Joining us as always, we're glad to have Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.org.  How you doing Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great.  How you doing Tom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am doing well.  Oh, I forgot to mention I am Tom Merritt-Philigan for Leopold, who's out at NAB doing our great  live coverage out there.  If you want to check out Twit Specials or watch it live, good stuff coming out of the  National Association of Broadcasters, really interesting coverage of the gadgets and things  that will be bringing you media in the future.  And speaking of media, the media maven himself, Jeff Jarvis, BuzzMachine.com.  How you doing Jeff?  All right.  All right.  Just all right?  Yeah, I'm doing great.  See, I tweaked you into lying.  You're giving me a more honest answer to begin with.  Good to have you along as well.  And joining us as a guest this week, Mr. Joel Johnson, Editorial Director at Kotaku.com.  You've had that job for about a month now coming over from Gizmodo.  How's it going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, a whole month.  It's going.  I'm still completely overwhelmed, but I'm doing okay.  Between taking a new job and moving back to New York, it's been a busy month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I bet.  Well, that makes me extra appreciative you had the time to join us today.  Thanks for doing that.  Yeah, no problem.  All right.  One more day left of Twit at NAB, like I mentioned.  If you want to see our live coverage, live.twit.tv, we finish that up today and tomorrow.  We'll have a little coverage tomorrow.  Leo's coming back today, so he'll be back for Security Now and shows like that.  We're covering a party tonight.  The Heil party, Bob Heil, you may have seen his interview on our triangulation show, has  been in the industry for quite a long time.  He brings us the mics that we use right here at Twit.  So that should be fun to see who shows up there because he's got connections to like  Jimi Hendrix and the Grateful Dead, all the best radio broadcasters in the world.  And it should be an amazing collection of people.  So watch that at live.twit.tv.  Let's start off with some news from the world of Apple and Google colliding.  Business Insider reporting that apparently, at least according to this book, Eric Schmidt  had the iPad hidden from him because Steve Jobs was upset about the use of multi-touch  pinch to zoom specifically in Android.  That according to Stephen Levy's book In the Plex.  Jeff, do you think this is a real thing or is this just trying to sell books?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe, but I'm confused.  I started to read the posts on this and so the first Android came out without pinch to  touch, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, former and gadget editor, Neelai Patel, we're going to have him on tech news  today later today, had a posting up and said, the first Android phone, the G1, shipped  in September 2008 without pinch to zoom.  And in fact, Google didn't add it to their official Android release until the Nexus One  got it as a software update in February 2010.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I don't know if that's because they felt that they were in some difficult position  or what.  So that's why I don't know how to really judge this as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, obviously, I mean, it does bring up that something weird was going on because  Google had pinched to zoom, obviously, they didn't include it for a while.  They allowed the carriers to add it.  Motorola was adding it on their interface.  HTC added it on their interface.  And then eventually February 2010, if it was a patent issue, they decided it wasn't a big  enough patent issue and added it to the Nexus One.  So Joel, do you have any insight on what's really going on here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think at that time, Google was still trying really hard not to piss Apple  off too much.  I think it wasn't it hasn't really been until the last six months to a year that they've  decided that they are full blown competitors and that Apple has recognized that they're  full blown competitors as well.  So that was always the impression I got in the early Android days was that Google kind  of was pussy footing around the whole thing.  They figured they were probably OK from a patent perspective, but it was worth being  nice to Jobs long enough to not have them completely go on the attack while they were  just getting Android up and running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you think it was actually more of a nice nice situation than a dispute?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I don't I don't think Jobs and Schmidt were still talking.  I mean, I presume they're still talking today or at least that Google and Apple are still  talking.  But in the very beginning, you have to remember this was still like when all of the Android  stuff was coming together.  This is still Schmidt was on the board of Apple and there was still a lot of involvement  between the two companies.  And yeah, I just think there was a lot of those decisions that they made that were sort  of token gestures to try to not upset Apple too much while they got Android actually on  the market.  And now that Android's completely dominating is maybe a little strong, but they're doing  really, really well on the phone market.  I don't think there's any reason for them to to really worry about each other anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This idea of Eric Schmidt having the iPad hidden from him by Steve Jobs could just be  a good business sense of like, well, we're now competitors, so we're not going to show  you every product in development, even though you're still on the board and you're stepping  down from the board.  And so we're not going to bring you into the circle.  That makes sense, Gina, right?  You just rephrase that and make it sound more controversial if you want to sell books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true.  And I'm actually I'm really excited.  We're going to have Stephen Levy on the show, I think, in a couple of weeks.  I'm not sure if it's next week or the week after.  So we'll get to talk to him a little bit about it.  Not showing Schmidt the iPad seems to make sense.  The pinch to zoom thing is interesting.  I mean, maybe it was just like like Joel said, they didn't want to piss off Apple right away.  There's a lot more involvement.  And maybe it was like we want to see what how our whole story about using the phone with  one hand is enough is going to go.  You know, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Andy Rubin made that point of of why they didn't have pinch to zoom originally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Exactly, exactly.  But I think Patel's piece, you know, was like touch screen devices.  Pinch to zoom is just as important as, you know, the screen and the batteries.  It's just part of it. Right.  And maybe that just wasn't clear what the patent situation was back then.  But now but but you know, later on, they were just willing to put it out there and see what  I see what happens. Well, yeah, I'll be interested to speak to Stephen about it a little more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree. I think it'll be good to talk to Stephen and say, OK, you know, what what do  you really know about this and how has it come about?  Because, you know, obviously, it's a good story to put out there and get people interested  in and looking at at the book.  But we may be a victim of business insider, you know, kind of tweaking this and pulling  it out a little more than even it is in the Plex, which is the name of the book, based  on two years of research at the company.  So he obviously knows what he's talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, he spent a long time embedded in the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you're not going to get a lot of a lot more insight, I think, at this point on that  era of Google than this book, although I still haven't read it.  I got a copy last night, but haven't even cracked it open yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, once once you actually read the book, I mean, obviously, that's going to make  a difference in how you think this stuff plays out.  But it does.  If nothing else, you know, forget the actual controversy of who knew what and why there  wasn't pinch to zoom in there.  Why hasn't Apple gone after Google for pinch to zoom?  If there is, you know, if they were the first to market with it, do they not have a strong  enough patent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's OK, which is always comes back to this patent story.  And it's a fairly obvious thing.  Somebody should patent that story.  Yeah. And you know, that's that's where we are.  I talked to a researcher working on something for us here at CUNY yesterday who told me  something fascinating.  He did study research with a professor at Reed University on Reed College, whichever  it is, on the most influential patents.  And by that, they just they analyzed the citations in the patents.  And this guy, Noah, told me that the most influential they found was the inkjet printer.  Because the placing of something physically on exactly that spot is critical in a lot of  the development going on today, like 3D printers.  Now, you see the kind of development that goes on with with patents and you take, you  know, OK, figure it out, boys, you know, figure it out.  It's now become a standard.  Is it is it is it is the swipe something we would have thought through is, you know, we

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have talked about that before.  Is the patent on swipe to unlock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And there's that there's a blog.  What is that PatentlyApple.com?  I think where it's just a list of all of the patents that Apple has put out as they kind  of come through the patent system.  And it's always mind blowing to me to look at those because so many of those things are  literally like we've done a patent on the way where the delete button should be in a  certain UI.  And the patent system at this point, you know, is structured that you just throw as many  patents up on the wall as you can possibly get to stick.  But I don't think if you look at the how many are actually litigated and fought for, it's  very it's very rare.  I mean, that's because not only do you have the chance to or you have to spend a lot of  money to litigate it, you also have the opportunity to lose the patent or have the patent  be revoked, which is risky, too.  So it's a it's a it's a definitely a cold war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a there's a bit of brinksmanship to defending your patents where, you know,  you're sitting on a pile of patents and they're sitting on a pile of patents and you agree,  well, we will we'll pay the difference in our piles height to settle this out of court,  essentially. In fact, somebody was telling me and I wish I could remember who that they've  been in patent meetings like that, where they brought in piles of documentation and  measured them and said, OK, we've got about two inches more.  Let's let's negotiate a rate for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is insane. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that not the way it's supposed to work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. That doesn't seem like the best way for it to work, but I do everything like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  every legal transaction I do, I do by weight.  So like when I pay for things, I like I always pay in coins because it weighs a lot more.  And it's really hard to convince people to let me do it.  But I have a patent for it.  So it works out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you'll be protected when you talk to your lawyer.  What what what's your pound rate?  Right. How much how much do you charge per ounce?  All right. Well, I think this I think this is an interesting story that people are  fascinated with because Eric Schmidt was on the board of Apple and then he had to leave.  And and people wonder, well, Steve Jobs, he's a prickly guy.  Is he upset that Google got into the phone business and are now the direct competitors,  not only to iPhone, but also iPad to iOS?  Is it a friendly rivalry or not?  What do you guys think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really hard to read those guys.  I mean, like Jobs in particular is and I don't I don't know him at all.  I know him just as well as anybody else does, which is just through the news.  But he strikes me that all the anecdotes about him and if you go to the folklore and read  even early Apple days, you know, he's he's definitely has a reputation for being vindictive  and being kind of a seething sort of sort of guy.  So I'm sure that he was incredibly pissed about Schmidt.  I mean, that's that's why he asked him to leave ultimately.  And even when Schmidt was around, he was supposedly refusing himself during discussions of iPhone  development and things like that.  Once Android was was out and known.  But by the same token, you know, there was shots of Jobs and Schmidt out having coffee  like a year ago.  So, you know, I don't think it's I don't I think for as much anger as there may be,  it's that sort of business anger like they want to get back at each other and they want  to be as successful as possible.  But I don't think that they're not communicating, at least up until the point that Apple can  completely replace Google and all of their product lines through search and maps and  the whole schmear, which, you know, they're they're they're messing around with.  But that's a big it's a big bite to chew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, what I find interesting here is that I've been arguing that the next frontier  of the fight in our world is between Google and Facebook over who's the best signal generator,  who's going to find the most signals of what we want and who we are, what we're looking  for and so on to be able to target services and content and then, of course, advertising  to us.  So in that sense, Google being in mobile to me pits the most against Facebook.  But Google being in phones, puts them against Apple in the hardware world.  And the argument these days is that what Apple really is is a retail company.  And they're the best damn retail company there is.  They make more per square foot in stores than most anybody out there.  And they do it in amazing ways and they involve us.  And so, you know, apart from the obvious line of who has the bigger platform, Apple or  Google and Android, what I have a hard time getting my head around is where is the real  battlefield there?  Where is the real battlefield between Apple and Zordy and Slip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, you're exactly right.  And I mean, if you look at the amount of real money that's being made, Google is still an  advertising company and Apple is still a products company.  But which is why if you ever have any sort of discussion about will Android kill iPhone  or vice versa, it's a useless discussion because they generate their money in different ways.  So as long as they're both relatively successful, neither one is going to win out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I'm actually very glad that that is the case because it means more competition  and they push each other and hopefully both will stay afloat and in these markets because  I want to see more platforms.  I want to see BlackBerry OS come back.  I want to see WebOS succeed.  I want to see people nipping at each other's heels, pushing them to be more innovative  and coming up with new and better ways for us to benefit when we use our phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely.  It seems like the battle between Apple and Google is really this platform for selling  things, right?  Like a store, a way to sell stuff, not just products, ads.  I mean, Google does ads a lot better than Apple does, but Apple has the App Store and  the iTunes Store and Google is certainly lagging behind in the Android market.  But I completely agree competition is a good thing.  I want to see more of it, more seething competition, whether it's a faux business thing or it's  like they really hate one another.  I'll take either one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I totally agree.  When you get to the end, what you want to see are situations that are created for different  types of people because not everybody uses their phone the same way.  So if you've got enough competition and enough different platforms, you've got to  platform that's really good for somebody who uses their phone in a casual way and just  wants to do some social networking.  You've got a phone that's good for somebody who's very productive and uses it in a business  way.  You've got a phone for the tweaker, the geek who wants to just mess around and see what  he can make the phone do.  And that's the ideal is when it's not about being a fanboy and saying my operating system  wins.  It's about having different operating systems that suit different kinds of users.  Google's got a major reorganization.  They're going to be doing what they do in a different way.  This has to do with Larry Page taking over as CEO.  His first big act is to change who's in charge of what.  Sundar Pichai is now Senior Vice President of Chrome.  Vic Gundotra is SVP of Social.  Andy Rubin gets a promotion to SVP of Mobile.  Salar Kamangar, SVP of YouTube and Video.  And Alan Eustis, SVP of Search.  And then I also heard that Susan Wojcicki, SVP of Ads.  I apologize to all of them for mangling their names.  I'm not sure if I pronounced everything correctly.  But the idea is now they have core product areas.  And they've got people in charge of things like Chrome, like Android, or mobile, YouTube  and video.  And everything comes up through those people.  And then those people talk to Larry Page.  It's a more centralized organization.  What's the theory behind this?  Do you have an idea of why they would reorg this way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the company line is they're trying to break down the committees that you have  to go through and get approval from in order to launch a product and make innovation happen  faster and easier.  And this is a challenge in all big companies.  Page just took the helm.  And this kind of thing normally happens when you've got someone new in charge.  Do this shake up, reorg, reenergize the company.  These are all names we all know.  Put them in charge of product.  I don't pay too much attention to Google's executives, but Vic Gundotra was at IO last  year.  He's super charming.  And I thought he was a really interesting choice to be in charge of social.  I think he was in charge of mobile before.  I'm not sure.  I thought he was more focused on mobile before.  Yeah.  So that's a really interesting choice.  Something that I'm happy about because I really like Vic.  He kind of won my heart.  And I owe last year.  So it'd be interesting to see.  But this just sounds like this is Larry saying this is the way it's going to work now that  I'm in charge and we're going to make stuff.  We're going to be a little more innovative and get stuff out the door a little more fast,  faster and more efficiently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that it's interesting to me that there is someone that senior in what  respect to the company in charge of social when Google basically still doesn't have a  social strategy.  Let's be honest.  Yeah.  And local, I think, is very important in this whole mobile signal generation thing.  Some people are saying that Marissa Mayer got passed over for that, but I don't think  so because he's not a senior VP and hasn't been.  And she has her areas of specialization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think because she's so popular, people expected to see her name amongst these other names  they recognize like Andy Rubin and Vic D'Andotra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  But I think that she would have been jumped up a quantum leap in the organization.  You know, I just did a Skype talk with Siva Vardafian's class at University of Virginia,  and he asked me what I would have changed in my fanboy book in the two years since it's  out.  I said the main thing is I don't think that I fully grappled with the notion of Google's  size, its bigness, and how that's affected so much about the company, including, you  know, it's the people who go after it in Europe and so on, including the people who go after  it, including the difficulty of continuing to grow at a rapid pace when you are so big,  the culture around it of what people think of when you're that big, but also more important  than anything else.  And Eric Schmidt always said this, it's the biggest challenge within Google.  And Gina's right, things had to go through committees and then the committee on top  and the triumvirate.  Yet ironically, you'd think that would have caused great integration and right-hand would  have known what left-hand is doing, but that's not the case.  We have Android and Chrome OS and things like that.  And given that Larry's new to the job, I think it's very smart to surround himself with a  very strong structure because the triumvirate was a strong structure and now he needs that  structure.  So this is, you know, by all appearances, good management.  I, you know, I'd be curious whether he has consultants now too or, you know, is McKinsey  hanging around?  God help us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think we'll know a lot more when we start seeing new products come out of the  company.  Yes.  I mean, that's been, that's Microsoft has gone through this well.  I mean, they're still kind of going through it.  Sony went through this for several years and is still going through it.  And it seems like Google just in the last maybe three or four years started to hit that  morass of being like too big and doing a lot of these half-baked projects.  That was always my biggest fear with Android.  And I think they've, you know, they fixed it largely.  But my biggest fear with Android coming out of the gate was it was half-baked.  It wasn't ready.  It wasn't as polished as I felt like it should have been.  And if Google would have managed Android like they've managed most of their other projects  over the last three or four years, it would probably be killed already.  So I think as you see a faster rate of innovation within Google, but also wedded to a larger,  longer product plan.  I'm thinking of things like Google TV, which is just completely stillborn,  but is a good idea.  And if they commit to it, could really do something with it.  I think over the next 12 months or so, if we start seeing a bunch of products come out  and they have a weight to them and they feel like there's something that Google's really  behind and will continue to be behind and iterate on, then I think it'll be a sign that this reord  makes sense.  Otherwise, it's just, what do you call shifting the deck chairs when the ship isn't going down?  Just shifting the deck chairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's called rearranging the deck chairs when the Titanic is going down.  Yeah.  I don't know if there's a shorter way to say it, but it's an after hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think Joel said the Titanic ain't going down here.  It's just they're redecorating the deck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shifting the deck chairs on the X cruise that's going through the Bahamas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me ask you this.  What do you think that they should kill?  What areas shouldn't they ban?  Part of what happened was with 20% and all that, they got into all kinds of new areas  and they moved stuff around a bit.  But are there things that Google is in that don't make sense for them to be in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I always, and I don't think, I'm not good at business.  That's why I work for other people.  But I always like Google the most when they are dabbling in areas where you wouldn't expect them  to be.  True.  I like Google being the company that's full of super geeky, super scientists and engineers  who have the ability to experiment as long as they can eventually tie it back into the greater  Google advertising system.  So all the automated car stuff, which is something that, I mean, that was of all the projects last  year that I think that just came out of nowhere.  And then I looked at it and was just like, oh, they did it.  This thing that I was supposed to take another two or three decades, Google's looks like they  pretty much got it cracked.  And so those kinds of things I love to see Google do because they have the engineering  acumen to go out there and take really big leaps and try to come up with ideas that are completely  out of left field for essentially a services company.  But they have to, again, when they choose to do those things, they have to continue to move  forward with them.  And I think so that the outline stuff, the investment in energy and all of that stuff is  really good.  And I hope they continue to do that.  But internally, they have a pretty like, you know, I can't say there's been a lot of effort  in their core products outside of search.  Search has continued to evolve in a pretty logical way.  But, you know, I use Gmail and GDocs and all that stuff every day.  And there's nothing that's really blown my mind about or impacted my life in the way that  Gmail did when it first came out.  There hasn't been anything iteratively within the product that's been amazing in years.  So I hope that they kind of go back to some of those old hits and revitalize those too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to disagree with you on that.  I follow Gmail and Docs development because this is kind of my thing is just follow along  with all the little features.  And I feel like they're constantly adding new little features or labs features.  And I mean, Google Docs just recently, you can upload files, you can share videos within Docs.  Gmail just actually, this is my tip this week.  They launch a bunch of little fixes.  I mean, they're all super minor.  I mean, none of them are like mind blowing.  Like you've got 10 terabytes of storage forever, which is kind of what it felt like when it  first, you know, when Gmail first launched.  But I feel like the product's pretty active.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I completely cop to the fact that I'm asking for something that is nebulous.  Like I'm saying I want to be wowed and I don't know what that would be.  You know, and that's completely unfair.  And I mean, I acknowledge that.  But I'm just saying that to me, Gmail is the one that I use it all the time.  And I switch off to hosted mail and I do all these other things.  And I always end up coming back to Gmail.  But I still remember vividly the difference between Gmail and all the competitors and  how it actually made the amount of time I spend in my life and email so much better  when it launched.  I'm just saying I feel like nothing, maybe the sum total of all the improvements over  the last however long it's been, six years, seven years, have gotten, you know, have cumulatively  been that transformative.  But I still feel like I was hoping there's a lot more like human intelligence stuff that  I feel like Google could be doing maybe better than any other company or artificial intelligence.  I guess is what like the things that they do with priority inbox, for instance.  I feel like there's all of this social stuff that Facebook is getting ready to smash in  Google's, like just completely steal the ball away from Google, where I don't want to use  Facebook mail as my mail.  That seems really weird to me.  I guess I'm just old enough that the idea that I would communicate with everybody on  Facebook is strange.  But there are a lot of really smart things that Facebook does about presenting and lifting  information that I find pretty accurate that I'm still amazed that Google, for as much  information as they have about me, aren't exposing in my daily life.  Or if they are exposing it, they're hiding it so much in the background of the algorithm  that it's hard for me to recognize what a good job they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think all of these companies are struggling with an old, old problem, which is when you  begin, when you're Sergey and Larry in 1999, putting your algorithm out there that's like,  this wows people, look how fast Google is.  Or when you're Ev and Biz and you're putting up Twitter and you're like, take a look at  it once you use it for a while, you really get it.  It's fun and it's easy to bust out of all of these things that hold back larger companies.  But once you get big and once you have a lot of people, it's harder to move.  They're all trying to figure out, they're all taking different approaches to recapturing that  startup feel in a large organization.  Facebook does it by limiting their hires and they try to keep developer teams very small.  This is Google's attempt here is saying, well, let's try to recapture that startup feel  by creating business divisions that have a clear head and we can all point to one  particular direction.  Because in the past, that 20% time has just been, and I'm using that very loosely, but that sort of  innovative spirit has just been kind of widespread and they subscribed loosely to the idea of fail  faster and they failed very fast in a lot of things except for search.  Search has been their cash cow that allows them to experiment.  And I think this is Larry saying, hey, look, we've got some good stuff going on here.  We've got Google Docs is coming along well.  Gmail has got widespread adoption and is very good.  Let's try to come up with those things that are going to move it faster and make it feel  like a startup and wow the Joel Johnsons of the world in ways that they didn't expect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is really the best business model you could come up with is just wowing me.  That's my consultant pitch for everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That actually is my pitch to VCs.  Anyone listening right now?  That's my business plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember that.  Maybe this is very unfair, but I always thought Eric Schmidt was super creepy.  And I don't know if he just had a knack for putting his foot in his mouth a lot, but  it was definitely Eric Schmidt who would say the things that made me scared of Google  as opposed to the founders.  So I'm kind of glad to see him on his way out because I like and again, this is very  cartoonish at best, but I like the idea of Google being a home for engineers and a home  for people that want to really innovate.  I felt like Schmidt often was representative of the Google that was going to take all of  that trust that we put in them in their founding years and monetize it in really skeevy ways.  So maybe he's the nicest guy in the world.  Maybe that was just all accident that he's not he says stupid things sometimes, but I'm  glad to see a founder back in the chair and like move forward with it.  It kind of feels it could be like a Steve Jobs apple thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Joel, I'm not going to screw you about having a founder back in the chair, but I will just  agree about Schmidt.  I've gained a lot of respect for him over time and I think that as a geek, you of all  people should understand the geeks sense of humor is get misinterpreted.  So I don't think he says so much creepy things as he has a sense of irony and that doesn't  often hold up and doesn't go.  I think he did a hell of a job training Larry and getting the company in the position where  it is.  I even wonder whether this organization is not about getting back the startup spirit,  but whether it's about a company finally acting like a big company.  And you know, you consider how fast you have to be able to change now.  I think the death of the flip camera is the Cisco killed this week is breathtaking in  the speed of a company from zero to hot company to dead company and product in four years,  which is, you know, a third of Google's lifespan.  And Google's basically had three lives search company ad company now mobile company.  You know, I think they've been remarkable and they've stayed up there, but I wonder  whether or not, you know, they're vulnerable for the next change.  So far they haven't been, but I still I still will defend Eric.  I think that Eric did a great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think anybody is impugning Eric's integrity here and he's still there, right?  He's still an executive chairman for whatever that means.  A lot of people think that Larry Page not so good with dealing with the government,  not so good necessarily with dealing with the public.  And maybe Eric will still continue to fill those roles, especially that role of dealing  with the government, which is a more important role than ever for Google because they have  huge lobbying interests that they're not filling.  You know, everybody likes to complain about lobbyists, but when you're a company that  doesn't have them, you get stomped because everybody else does have them.  So you know, Eric Schmidt, I guess, is becoming the lobbyist in chief in this situation  where Larry is focusing on, okay, I've learned from you, Eric, and I think I know what to do.  This is the way I'm going to make that organization.  It does put a lot of pressure on him, though.  He is at the center of this hub and folks are comparing him to Steve Jobs and saying,  you know, he's going to be involved in all of these departments at a very hands-on level.  Do you think that's true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we have a reason to.  The thing that I think will be confusing now is that I somehow still doubt that Larry is  going to be a very public face of Google.  And Joel, you're right that Eric stuck his foot in his mouth or had his foot shoved into his mouth  again and again and again.  But Larry, we haven't seen publicly at all, and it's going to be hard to imagine.  At some point, he's going to have to be.  He's the CEO now, and that's going to be a really interesting transition to see  how much he seems to be and wants to seem to be the man in charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the first things he'll be overseeing is the acquisition of ITA software,  which Caroline McCarthy over at CNET's The Social Blog reports is now closed.  The deal was approved by the Justice Department.  You may have read that the Justice Department filed suit against Google.  That's their way of proving it.  That's the way these things work is when the DOJ wants to object and put in conditions  for approval, they file suit and say, we're going to block this unless these conditions are met.  So now it sounds like Google has agreed to the conditions and announced that it has reached a  settlement with the Department of Justice, and ITA software will go ahead.  It's a $700 million done deal.  Google has added an update yesterday that said our acquisition of ITA has now closed,  which means that they will operate ITA and be able to benefit from all the data ITA does in the  travel industry.  If you're not familiar with them, what they do is gather fare information and then provide  a feed of that information to various different companies.  And Google is going to have several restrictions on them of what they can do with that company  over the next five years.  They'll be required to continue to license the QPX software.  That's the software that airfare websites use.  They'll have to license it on commercially reasonable terms.  Google will also be required to continue to fund research and development of QPX, at least at  similar levels to what ITA has invested up till now.  And Google will also be required to further develop and offer ITA's next generation Insta  Search product that had been in development.  And Google will be required to implement firewall restrictions within the company that prevent  unauthorized use of competitively sensitive information.  So if Kayak is giving a bunch of information to ITA in order to facilitate a firewall  and provide a feed to them of fare information, Google can't take that information and go,  hey, that's a good idea.  Let's implement that in search.  What is Google going to get out of this?  Gina, do you have an idea of what products we might see and what ways they'll be able  to make use of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They just want to return the kind of results that Kayak does for travel search results.  Show me all the flights under $500 leaving for Puerto Rico tomorrow.  And actually, I was curious to know, what do you all use?  What search engine do you all use to find flights when you need to travel?  I use Kayak.  I generally go to Kayak first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I default to Kayak.  And then for some reason, I've been like a I had like one really amazing customer service  experience with Orbit.  It's like three or four years ago.  And so often I just go back to them.  But if I'm trying to actually turn something around really fast, I tend to use Kayak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I use Expedia still only because it's habit.  But the truth is, I fly out of Newark.  So I'm basically stuck with Continental come United now, no matter what.  So I end up going to the site to do it because I had my first thought too is like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's good as this might be for business and as good as it might be for Google from a  revenue standpoint.  I can't see this affecting real people all that much until something about fair search  and all this indexing actually changes the airlines themselves because, you know,  unfortunately, the problem with all of this really great search indexing and fair indexing  and all of that stuff is it just continues to drive prices down, which is that's great  for the individual consumer purchasing things right at that moment.  But it's also why we have the tops of airplanes ripping off because the industry continues to  shave as much money as they can out of it.  So, you know, I feel like this is that we won't see it would be much more interesting if Google  was pulling a Branson and deciding to open their own airline or do some sort of travel thing that  actually involves physical travel.  But, you know, I don't think that's super likely for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think that more transparency of pricing is a good thing.  And I think that Google being involved in this will tend to lead to more transparency because  they don't own an airline.  And so I think that's good for consumers, whether or not airlines inspect their planes is an  entirely different issue for the FAA.  I once asked Sergey about an airline because when I was writing What Will Google Do?  I said that I speculated about the idea of a Google airline, the social airline, and he  laughed and said that a friend of his had started an airline based on that in somebody he knew in  Brazil, but it went out of business when the entire crew was arrested for smuggling drugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's one way of making use of social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we're such good friends.  We're going to be partners in crime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, right now airlines keep us prisoner.  At least they gave us drugs.  We might be happier online.  The other thing that I think comes that becomes really disruptive in the airline industry, I ran  a session on the social airline at the DLD conference in Munich in January with Lufthansa  and people like Scoble were there because Scoble's everywhere.  And as we went through it, what fascinated me, there was a story about six months ago,  some passengers on KLM wanted to go away from Amsterdam to a music festival in Miami and there  wasn't a direct flight.  So they petitioned KLM on Twitter saying we want you to get a flight for us.  KLM said, okay, if you get 315 people, we'll put a flight on for you.  And in five hours they did.  Now, what's fascinating about that is airlines are supply driven.  What if airlines became demand driven?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So like eventful for airlines?  Well, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Lufthansa people who were there said, well, we do already have a private air thing,  but it doesn't scale very big.  But imagine if lots and lots of people from San Diego said, we're all going to  South by Southwest and there's no really good direct flight to Austin.  Hello.  Well, if suddenly Google sees a lot of searching by people in San Diego to go to Austin,  what does that tell them?  What's the value of that?  Now you get all kinds of issues in airlines of having slots and all that kind of stuff.  But if you imagine just a little bit here what travel could be like if it were demand  driven, if it were a little bit less risk, less fixed cost, more flexibility,  that becomes really, really interesting as a disruptor in the industry.  And if you think about it, Google could be in that position where they might know more  about demand, just like they know more about flu than the doctors.  They may well know more about interest in destinations from locales than anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, that's really that's super fascinating.  I hadn't heard about that KLM flight.  That's that's I don't know that made me happy for some reason.  I really like that.  And I think that's the same reason that Google's messing around with this automated car thing,  because if you if you think of surface travel as like essentially a packetized system,  if they can start not just automating the cars, but knowing where the cars are,  know what the demand levels are for the cars, knowing who's in what cars at what time,  all of this stuff.  And of course, this is pretty being able to drive down the highway in a test car is a long way from  having the entire American auto fleet wired up to be autonomous.  But it's the same sort of thing.  All of a sudden, Google, they could give away all of this routing stuff to all of the auto  manufacturers and then knowing where people are going.  All it gets it gets it all.  It's all intertwined.  It brings you back to the local stuff.  It brings you back to how people are spending time, how you can save energy, which is sort of like a  outdoor thing, but it's still a positive.  Yeah, there's all of a sudden I'm realizing that Google messing around and travel is a lot  not as far flung as I had had first thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and now that I've gone too far, of course, this is my one go even farther.  And part of what we said at this Lufthansa thing was that the seat is a commodity.  It's long been a commodity and we're a prisoner there.  And if you had this demand driven thing, a company could come along and say, listen,  I'm going to buy bulk seats from Lufthansa or Continental United.  But I'm going to take care of your entire experience.  I'm going to get you to the airport and from the airport and I'm going to help you decide  where to stay.  The old time travel agent in a way comes back but in a bulk buy way so that you just  the airline seat is the commodity that gets here as long as the service is good enough.  That's not where the brand is.  The brand may be in Joel's Travel Wonderland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'd be Airbnb but with a focus on the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  You're good.  And then you go to Google and you think that there are things like getting me to  read what's my automated car.  In that car, have you programmed it with my music?  Did you pick the kind of car that I would like to drive me there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just log in with your Google ID and it's got all of your specifications, your preferences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And we know you're landing at noon, Mr. Jarvis, and you do like Chipotle and we  know where the nearest one is.  We'll just take you there automatically and we'll have your order ready for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually in the car when you get in.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Margarita with the Patron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was a real cool transition to Chipotle, huh, folks?  It was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was smooth, really smooth.  So I love all these ideas.  I love this.  I really love this.  And in the long term, it's really cool.  The possibilities are really cool.  But in the short term, if you're Kayak or you're Hipmunk or you do travel search,  doesn't this kind of stink?  I mean, Google's the best search engine out there.  If you do travel search and now that they own the software, I know that they made this  deal where they have to set up, you know, that they can't, that people are going to  be able to extend their contract and they're still going to provide this data to other  people and all this kind of thing.  It's still like, oh, you know, if I'm an entrepreneur, I'm not going to go in a travel  search now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why the Fair Search Organization was created to oppose this.  And they actually have some ideas that they've won in this.  I want to get to those in a second, though.  Speaking of product placement, Jeff, we should take a break and thank one of our sponsors  here, Squarespace, the fast and easy way to publish a high quality website or blog.  It's really simple.  If you want to start a blog, this is the way to go.  Squarespace.com is the place to go.  Slash twig.  If you want to support this, we can Google and get a 14 day free trial.  You don't have to use a credit card to sign up and you will have your, you can have your  site up and running by the time I'm done telling you about this.  It's so simple, easy to use UI optimized for both beginners and CSS experts, HTML experts,  folks who know what they're doing, can get under the hood and tweak things.  But the nice thing for those of us who do know what we're doing is you don't have to  do that all the time.  You can use the template to create a website and then go in and just tweak the couple of  things you need to.  You don't have to go through the tedium of it.  They've got all kinds of templates that you can tweak around and play with.  They've got a form builder.  You can collect email addresses and other information from visitors.  Website tracking, a built in search engine optimizer.  Talk about tedious.  Going through and doing SEO, forget about it.  Squarespace does it for you.  Permission access handling, cloud architecture for speed and site stability, and an innovative  drag and drop Ajax interface, even an iPhone app.  So you can log into the iPhone app and update your blog on the go.  Why not give it a try and help support Twig?  Go to squarespace.com slash Twig and we thank Squarespace for their support of this week  in Google.  So I mentioned FairSearch.  That was an organization put together by some of these companies like Kayak, but also  Microsoft was in there as well.  And one of the things that they opposed to was the idea of Google having this information  and incorporating it into search.  But one of the reasons they think they've succeeded in this, even though Google gets  to acquire ITA is the DOJ had the sniff around Google some more and they think that the DOJ  is going to be doing more sniffing around now and possibly going after Google in other  areas of, and particularly search.  Do you think that's going to happen, Gina?  Are they going to go after them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Interesting.  This organization is happy about it.  That's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody likes to claim victory, but yeah, they were saying this is a victory for us.  It put restrictions on Google and most of all, the Department of Justice is now familiar  with what Google's up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And this is similar to the privacy mandate that they're going to be checking in on Google  every year, every two years for the next 20 years to make sure that they're enforcing  privacy policies well.  So interesting.  To see if anything else comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a little, I mean, I would be very curious to know where they got that information or  if it's just wishful thinking because the DOJ and the FTC tend to be extremely opaque  about those investigations while they're happening or before they've announced anything  officially, at least in my world.  Like I know I've spent a lot of time hearing those rumors and then trying to get them  confirmed and it's really hard to get that information.  So that almost sounds a little funny to me.  Like they're saying, it justifies why they had to call in the big guns and create this  organization is to say, it's not just this one thing, it's all sorts of other things.  So yeah, they're not trying to say there is an investigation going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're sort of implying it because of the other investigations, we got one in Texas,  got other attorneys general still going after Google for the Street View.  Wi-Fi collection, but you've got that antitrust thing going on in Texas.  You've got some European Commission looking in and they're hoping, I think, more than  knowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  We don't know if Google has stopped beating its wife or not, but it'd be good to find out.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, do you think there's anything to this?  Do you think the DOJ would go after Google or is that just wishful thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's wishful thinking or it's an attempt to scrape victory from defeat.  The problem I have these days is that why is Google treated constantly as if it's a bad guy?  I had this discussion with Siva before about the BuzzFTC decision, which I went a little  bit overboard on the last twig, but I still find that a one-time mistake fixed over a weekend,  is that worth putting you on probation for 20 years?  Was the violation of trust that huge?  I think we just, I come back to this all the time, and it's probably a problem with Google's  size is that size brings mistrust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, Google's search share has been declining very slowly, but the new HitWise  numbers are out and Bing, if you count Yahoo and Bing together, makes up 30% of the search  market and Google makes up just shy, just around 65% or so.  And then, of course, you've got poor Ask.com and the others like them  trailing behind, but Bing is making some inroads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that in the US particularly that's highly competitive, in Europe, in Germany,  Google search remains over 90%, which is ironic since the Germans go crazy on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That almost may be why, right? Because it's 90%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but the people are making it that big and government media go after it.  So yeah, I think we can be fairly well assured that the FTC and the DOJ and the FCC are all  going to try to make points and score points by keeping an eye on Google because Google's just so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  big. The other thing we forget about sometimes, Google owns YouTube. YouTube getting into the  live streaming business. This past Friday, they launched YouTube Live. You can go check it out  at youtube.com slash live. They've got trusted partners that they're partnering with these days.  Featured live events have featured a lot of Indian cricket.  Coachella was going to be live. AdTech, the conference here in San Francisco,  had a lot of live streams from there. And then they've got other partners like Revision 3 and  other video production companies that are putting on live events. This sort of positions them between  Ustream and Hulu and Netflix somewhere. It's not anybody can get on and broadcast anytime,  but it's also, you know, it's not Hollywood. These are more independent video providers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tom, do you have any inside information? Is Twit going to go on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Where's Twit?  I have no idea. I have no inside information. You're talking to the best protected source  Twit could ever have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My reaction to the story was immediate indignance that Twit wasn't listed. So YouTube people,  get on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. See, maybe that's why Leo couldn't do Twig this week. He didn't want to answer these

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  questions. Yeah, because you know Leo, he's always keeping all those secrets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. He's very good at that.  I really can't speak to that. I have no idea what Leo's position is about putting us on  YouTube live. I can't imagine we wouldn't want to be on there, at least eventually.  But this is something where I've definitely been interested in taking some of the things  I do outside of Twit and putting them on here, but I'm not in there yet because I'm  alone not a big enough partner. So it is interesting. Not every single indie is on  YouTube live. Some of them are, and a lot of them aren't usual suspects. They're not live  production companies. They're doing specific live events for YouTube live. But this is an  interesting procedure for YouTube to follow in order to compete with a Netflix or a Hulu.  Don't forget, Hulu was put into place to crush YouTube because at the time the industry had  convinced itself that YouTube was the threat because of all of the pirated video. It turns  out that's not why YouTube was successful. That was part of it. People did like that aspect of it,  but people did like to see other folks' stuff, whether it was the typical cat riding a skateboard  or whether it was Fred or Lonely Girl or these other independent productions. So I think it's  been a long time in the making that we would have YouTube do a live service. It's interesting  that they're picking their partners though. It's more of a Google go slow approach. Let's iterate.  Let's put it out there slowly and see how it does. Yeah, that's definitely how it strikes me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's going to be really, I mean, I think live video streaming has been around long enough  that we've seen most of the real interesting things that you can do with it. But I think  the best thing for me is the idea that for a lot of people, I'm guessing, but I would think for the  mainstream audience, a lot of people are still just viewing, they think video online is YouTube.  So the idea of having live streaming, especially once it can come to mobile devices, I'm not  particularly wedded to watching something live for the most part, depending on what it is.  Because part of the nice thing about the internet for me is that I don't have to,  or DVRs or all of that stuff, I can watch it when I want to. But from a news standpoint,  I just instantly think of things like Libya and Syria and Bahrain and all of these things that  are happening where if it becomes more of a platform thing and it's very common and it's on  all these throwaway phones in another three or four years, the idea that I think it'll change  the way that we engage with the public in political ways. I think Jacob Applebaum keeps  getting harassed at the borders because of the work that he did for WikiLeaks. I just really  like the idea of him being able to flip open a camera and have it there, which is, again,  all stuff you can do with Ustream, it's all stuff that you can do with other services. But I think  that if a platform as big as YouTube and will get it out into places that it hasn't been before and  maybe kind of give it the boost that it has needed, because I feel like it's been a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  haphazard in adoption in the mainstream market. Yeah, I think that I'm surprised it took YouTube  this long to get this far with live because live is well established and has been there since  Justin TV and other livestream and such. But I look at it this way, I don't think that,  this could be heresy, I could get bumped off. I don't think Twit and Twig are shows so much  as they are conversations. No, I don't think that's heresy at all. Yeah, I think that's exactly why  people like it. Right, and so the chat room, which by the way says that Leo won it on, and I don't  know if they're joking, but there's some question of the copyright takedowns when we put on Glee or  something, I guess. I don't know. I don't understand what the chat room is bragging about being ahead  of us, and as well they should, but I'm not sure what that means. But I think that, Joel,  you're right, in terms of things like entertainment programming, live doesn't matter. Being on the  schedule, put it that way, doesn't matter. But in terms of having a conversation, being able to  look at the chat room here and seeing that they're saying, woohoo, they're ahead of us,  yeah you are, is part of the joy of it. And the number of people, I don't know, do you have any  idea, Tom, what the proportion is of people who watch Twit and Twig and such and your show live

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  versus delayed? Yeah, the smallest portion watch live. How big a portion is it? I don't really know,  but I'd say it's like a fiftieth maybe, roughly. Oh really, that small? And then the next smallest  portion watch video, and then the largest portion still watch audio, or listen to audio. They just  watch those little lines jumping up and down. That's our people, they just stare at the screen.  Because audio is more convenient, especially as a podcast, even as live. You can put it on in your  car now with 3G coverage getting better. I listened to Windows Weekly live streaming audio on my way  up to the cottage today, 20 minute drive, never lost the signal once. So I think in some ways,  audio is here now, and that's what people are using. Video is coming next. That is where it's  going, and we're still trying to figure out how best people access it. I can shed some light on  the whole YouTube takedown notice thing. Every time we show a clip on Twit or often on FrameRate,  that is a copyrighted video, but it's fair use. We either show it in a news context or it's a  trailer for a movie. We run this risk of running into an automatic takedown.  We can't promise that we're never going to run afoul of YouTube's algorithm. We can say,  look, we'll never actually infringe because we think it's fair use because of newsgathering,  and we know what we're doing. But we've had plenty of shows taken down by this algorithm  that you then have to go file a counter notice and have it reinstalled. It's easier, frankly,  to just re-upload the episode and then somebody doesn't object to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's really interesting because that affects YouTube in terms of having relationships with  any news organization, and I call Twit and Twig a news organization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly, because fair use laws are different regarding news and ephemeral,  like live, than they are for something that's going to be archived or something that's done

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for entertainment purposes. I wouldn't be surprised if part of the delay in implementing it  is also related to the takedown issue because what do you do if somebody starts doing something  vulgar, live streaming? What do you do if somebody starts live streaming content? They just go into  a movie theater and are live streaming the movie directly through YouTube. I think there is probably  a lot of legal wrangling and ad partner wrangling that had to happen behind the scenes to make this  happen. I think that's part of the reason it's being tiptoed out is that nobody that's a  guaranteed partner of YouTube is going to do anything heinous in their live stream.  That kind of gets everybody used to it. It gets the advertisers to calm down and get  comfortable with it and then they can move forward from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, let's take a quick break. We've got a lot of other stories to cover before we wrap  up here, but I want to thank one of our sponsors, Hover.com.

We've known it under the code name Pyramid. It's the Sensation 4G dual core 1.2 GHz Snapdragon  processor. Same body actually as the HTC Evo 3D. This is not 3D, however. It's going to come with  the HTC Sense UI 3.0, 8 megapixel rear camera. Really emphasizing video, they've got this Netflix  like video service they're going to put on it called HTC Watch. It does 30 frames per second  video, 1080p resolution. We're going to get it in the United States in summer on T-Mobile,  which by the way, folks, T-Mobile still independent till at least 2012, if not later. AT&T can't  acquire them until the earliest 2012. So T-Mobile is at least independent for another six months or  so. And launching in the UK, Germany and the rest of HTC's key European markets in mid-May.  They get it a little earlier. In fact, Vodafone gets an exclusive on it for a couple of weeks  right after that mid-May launch date. You guys excited at all about the sensation? Is it a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  sensation for you? The thing that I got the most excited about was the lock screen update, which  I'm not sure if this is part of Sense 3.0 or not, but it's got this really cool shortcut where,  and this is just this type of thing that makes me really happy because I'm just a software gal  and I love shortcuts, to unlock your screen. When you go to unlock your phone, you need to do  something. You're going to check your email or search Google or make a phone call. So there's a  list of apps on your lock screen. So your phone is locked, but there are apps there. So to unlock it,  you grab the app that you want to use and drop it onto the unlock thing and it launches it  automatically. So normally it's two steps, unlock, launch, and reduces it to one.  That makes a lot of sense.  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. It's a tiny little thing, but I was like, oh, that's great. And I  want it now. And that should be in core Android. But Netflix not being on Android is such a huge  thing. It's such a huge problem. So this HTC Watch is cool. I still just want Netflix.  But yeah, there's a big hole there. And so HTC Watch makes sense that someone else would kind  of jump in and say, hey, we've got streaming. You can watch your TV shows on Android. But I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  don't know what Netflix is waiting for. It's a DRM issue, right? But I don't understand what

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the issue really is. Does anybody? They have a particular DRM implementation that they need the  Android operating system to support. Jill, do you know more about it than that? I mean, all I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is that on the website of things, it's all based out of Silverlight. So there's not good Silverlight  support for Android, obviously. But by the same token, there's not good Silverlight support for  iOS either. So it seems to me like it's either a licensing deal, because you have to realize  that any of these media companies, which is the same reason that HTC Watch platform is just going  to probably crash and burn, is that when Netflix makes any move, or Hulu or any of these guys make  a move, they have to get sign off from a million different content partners on almost everything.  And so I would imagine it's just some weird holdup in the licensing fees for Android. But  technologically, there's no reason they couldn't do it on Android if they really  put their mind to it. They could transcode everything on the back end and use a different  DRM server just for our different DRM service, just for Android if they needed to. Netflix is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  on Google TV right now. Google TV is a build of Android. So this is like, I mean, technically,  it's absolutely possible. I use it on my Google TV all the time. Joshua Caleb in the chat room says

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  he thinks it's DRM on the chip that Netflix requires, and that that's what's holding it up,  and that the chip for the iPhone and the iPad both process that DRM. I know Netflix has some  pretty restrictive and weird DRM that they do, which is one of the reasons they've been able  to strike as many deals as they have, as many licensing deals, is because it makes the industry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  feel comfortable. I was not aware of there being any sort of hardware DRM aspect to the Netflix  stuff, but now I'm super curious. Yeah, me too. That would make a lot of sense. But I do think  it's a... Actually, I don't even know. I find myself not using Netflix and things like that  as much on mobile, on phones, as I normally would. But for the Android tablet market,  I think it's a real bummer because watching TV on an iPad or watching Netflix or Hulu on an iPad is  like one of the best things ever. So yeah, they need to get it fixed. Good news for Sprint fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google says Android carrier billing will be available for Sprint. It'll roll out slowly to  different folks. You may not see it right away, but this puts them now on what? AT&T, Sprint,  and T-Mobile for carrier billing. So that makes it easier when you're in the Android marketplace  to just spend lots of money without realizing it. Carrier billing is one thing that people  have required to say that the Android marketplace needs to have it easier to bill you to take off,  because it needs to be easier to buy stuff. But is that the only thing, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not sure. I'm not sure actually. So carrier billing is just an easier way for someone to  purchase something through their carrier versus having a Google checkout account.  So would this enable the Android market to use carrier billing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. As I understand it, when you're on a Sprint phone now, you'll be able to go to the  Android marketplace and when you check out, it'll give you the normal options as well as  a Sprint logo. And then you just click that Sprint logo and it gets billed to your...  It gets put on your bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. I think that this is super important. Because I know people who are like,  I don't buy apps because I just haven't given Google my credit card yet. But you've already  given your carrier credit card. So it makes sense. It's an easy way to buy stuff. And then this  is like has to be top priority and kind of is top priority for the Android folks. It's like making  it easier for people to hand their money over. So it makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just circling back real quick, Joshua Caleb sent a link to the Engadget story about Qualcomm saying  future Android devices with Snapdragon should be able to support the DRM that Netflix requires.  They said that at Mobile World Congress earlier this year.  So they have some crazy DRM requirements for watch instantly.  Okay. Russia backing down on banning Gmail. They had said at the end of last week...  Or Skype, wasn't it?  Yeah. Well, Gmail and Skype and Hotmail. All of them. Russia's Federal Security Service had  threatened on Friday to call for a ban on Skype, Gmail and Hotmail.  The uncontrollable use of such services can lead to a major threat to Russia's security.  Andrey Ichkin reportedly said at a government meeting. He proposed a ban on them.  But on Saturday, the Federal Security Bureau backed down and said it had no plans  to try and control Skype, Gmail or Hotmail.  Is this just a weirdness of Russia, isn't it? It's not something that Gmail is going to be facing  or Skype or anybody worldwide. It's not like a Blackberry situation. We're going to see a bunch  of people starting to consider this, are we?  Well, is it?  That's what I'm asking. I don't know.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the more authoritarian a government, the better chance that they're going to try to get into  interfering with communication. Russia does an excellent job of giving the appearance of being a  democracy maybe to people who don't give it just the most cursory look. But yeah, I think this is  just weird power struggle stuff that Russia's been doing for the last 10, 15 years. And so it doesn't...  I don't think it portends a trend among other European countries or anything like that. But  for oligarchies and for poorly run, not very free countries, we're going to see more of that  happening basically until they become free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Another battle also going on. Microsoft claims that Google's apps for government do not have  valid certification under the Federal Information Security Management Act. This is a tiny little  battle that a lot of people aren't really paying a lot of attention to. But essentially,  Google is going after Microsoft for government contracts. It's a huge revenue source.  And Microsoft is fighting them tooth and nail. Microsoft, from what I understand,  from the things I've read, had a pretty easy way. They would come in, they'd say,  here's our latest progress project. The government would rubber stamp it. They'd get the contract.  And with Google coming in, they've been fighting and fighting to keep them out.  Google does have what's called FISMA certification, Federal Information Security  Management certification. But they have it for Google Apps, not a separate product called Google  Apps for Government. Apparently, this has to do with the fact that Google is just not as

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  experienced in the ways of Washington. The other question I have relevant to the theme of the show,  obviously, this is Microsoft going after Google. That's the whole point. But is it also

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  anti-cloud? Well, that's a really good question because Microsoft is pushing their cloud services  too. I don't know specifically whether they're pushing them to the government as well, but I'm  sure they will. I don't get the sense that the government is saying no, or Microsoft saying,  you don't want to trust the cloud yet. I'm sure that's in their Rolodex of things to object to.  Right now, they're just saying Google isn't licensed. They lied. They said they had  certification. They don't. Google's like, we thought we did. All I know is that I really,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  really want Google Apps for Government myself. Now that I know there's a government-class Google  app, I feel really jealous. My tax dollars are paying for that. I should have government-class

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gmail. Isn't Google Apps for Government just a subset of regular Google apps? This just sounds

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like such a stupid nitpicking. I'm sure it's just locked down to a certain... Because the government  has all those internal standards that every application has to reach. I'm sure that that's  basically just the Google apps that are probably almost exactly identical, but that have gone down  the checklist of things that the government requires. It sounds like a technicality.  Microsoft has a lot of technicality, but it's also something that they should be able to fix  relatively quickly, that Google should be able to fix relatively quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Finally, Google just acquired Push Life, a company that developed music apps for  Android and Blackberry. A lot of sites are speculating Google will use the technology  to push music to your phone. Push Life has now said, we've been bought. We're not doing  anything anymore. It's getting integrated into Google Canada, apparently, as well.  Is this significant for the Google music rumors? Anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't feel... I mean, the tech behind music for Google music is... This is more along the  lines of a patent acquisition. I'm not saying specifically because I've used some of the  Good Life stuff, but I'm not familiar with what, if any, patents they hold. But there's nothing  stopping Google, of all the companies, to go to a completely cloud-based sort of situation. But  Google, I don't think, has quite had the stones to fight the content side of things,  which is why I was so proud of Amazon last week, saying, we're going to do our cloud music  implementation, but we're going to do it by just the same thing that mp3.com did a few years ago  with the Locker ID, our Locker idea. And you saw all the quotes from the music industry all,  oh my goodness, I can't believe we're so offended that they didn't have this conversation with us.  Whereas Amazon's position is essentially saying, well, we just don't think you legally even have  a leg to stand on. And I feel like Google and Apple both are acquiring companies and setting up  all of these pieces together for them to be able to make that big push, but for whatever reason,  have still been really timid. So this one, yeah, I'm sure it's part of the whole Google music idea,  but there's half a dozen companies that have been brought together before this and they still  haven't pulled the trigger. So it's impossible to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. We're going to take a quick break and then come back with Gina's tip, Jarvis's number  and my tool. But first, I want to thank our sponsor, Netflix. We were just talking about them.  Watch thousands of TV episodes and movies, stream to your PC or Mac instantly, plus get DVDs by  mail in about a business day. You can also stream them if you've got an Xbox, a Nintendo Wii or a  PS3. You can stream them right to your TV. There's plenty of other ways. We talked about  Google TV as a way to stream Netflix to your television, Apple TV. There's all kinds of ways  you can watch Netflix streaming live on your television. Gina, what's the last movie you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  watched on Netflix? I'm actually in the midst of watching Damages right now, which started  airing in 2007. And it's a fantastic show, Glenn Close. And I'm just completely, it's like,  when can I finish work so I can watch the next episode of Damages? I love Netflix. I didn't  realize they're a sponsor. I mean, the reason why I was bitching about it not being on Android is  because I have a Zoom and I want to watch Damages on my Zoom through Netflix. Right, right. And,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jill, you're right. Watching it on a tablet is really nice. It's a really convenient way. I do it  a lot just in the bedroom, even though we have a television. It's just more convenient. I've got  the tablet and I just pop it up. Netflix on my iPad, watch some episodes of Firefly or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Firefly. I admitted in the last show that I don't use Netflix, which appalled people. And I  said on the last show before they were a sponsor that I'm going to use Netflix now because I think  it's great what they're doing with bringing series on and they're going to compete and break up with  the hegemony of the old networks. And that's a good thing. I have one question here. Does Twig get a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  code for Netflix or is that just a Twit code? It's just a Twit code, but it still gives you a free  trial, Jeff. What credit for it? Netflix.com slash Twit. The credit is shared across the entire  network. Oh, okay. We'll be generous. Yes. I know you're into social and sharing, right?  No, I'm not. No, okay. Never mind. Netflix.com slash Twit, though. That's the place to go. Sign  up for a free trial. Instantly watch this movie, the Damages series, if you want, or Firefly,  or choose from thousands of TV episodes and other movies when you register. And we thank them for  their support of This Week in Google. Let's move on to the tip. Gina, you alluded to it earlier in

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the show. It's a Gmail tip. Yeah. Gmail has fixed a couple of annoying things in it. And the one  thing that I was super happy about is this. So by default, Gmail autosaves anybody that you email.  Gmail autosaves that person as one of your contacts. And that's pretty handy unless you  have a job like ours where you email with a lot of folks maybe once or twice and they're saved in  your contacts forever. So your contacts just sort of like balloon out of control. And then you're  syncing your contacts to your phone. You're like, who's this person that I emailed five years ago  once about something? So you can now turn that off and sort of have more control over your contacts  and have a cleaner decluttered contacts list. You go into Gmail's settings. There's an area  that is labeled create contacts for autosave. You can say when I send a message to a new person,  add them to my contacts. And that's how it works automatically. And then Gmail will autocomplete  for you when you send a message to them in the future. Or you can just say, I'll add contacts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  myself and turn it off. That's really useful. I'm going to take advantage of that because I have  that problem that you're talking about where I email with so many different people out of Gmail,  not always from a Gmail account, but it all starts to build up in there. So I wanted to do that  because I wanted to be able to remember those email addresses, but I want a better way to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  manage it. That's great. I'm now part of an extended family with another Joel Johnson,  who isn't me, because I think his Gmail is like Joel something Johnson. It got handed off. So  he's like a preacher or something. So I get all these invitations like, I loved your sermon last  Sunday. And I'm like, you're welcome. I did my best, but it would be nice if I could somehow go  in and remove all those autocompletes from the people that have them that don't know me. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's asking a little much right now. Yeah. The same thing happened to me. I got into somebody's  autocomplete. I get these random messages from someone in Louisiana, who is sure that I'm in  his family. I should probably let him know that I'm not. I just mute the conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't wait for one or the other. There's one Jeff Jarvis, who is a famous jazz musician,  but there's another Jeff Jarvis recently discovered who is honest to God, an Elvis  impersonator. Nice. Wow. I'm dying to get confused with him. Elvis Jarvis. Because I ate nothing but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a hound dog. That's just your alter ego. That's your Duke Silver alter ego. That night you go out  and you're an Elvis impersonating jazz player. That's a great, it's a great new way to hide an

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  alter ego now. You say, Oh no, that's not, that's not mine. That's not me. That's a different Jeff  Jarvis. Don't you think I'm a good and white satin? I always have. You're a knight in white satin,  Jeff. Let's move on to your number. What do you got for us? Okay, the number, the number of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  week is five to 15. That is the percentage of visits falling in the New York Times since it  implemented its meter, according to Hitwise. And, you know, more troubling for them should be that  according to Hitwise, the page views fell between 11 and 30%. They analyzed 12 days after the  meter to a 12 day period before the meter and found this. You know, the big question is that  the Times has said again and again that most people, the vast majority of people would never  hit the paywall, which is a good news, bad news thing for them. Because the truth is that if the  vast majority of the people never look at more than 20 pages of the Times in a month, that shows a  pretty low engagement rate versus, let's say Facebook. Most newspaper sites I know get 12  page views per year or per month on average. Facebook gets that every day. And that says  something about the engagement of newspapers. But in any case, the question is who is the Times  losing and why? Is it people who hit the wall and say never mind and go elsewhere? Is it people who  are now afraid they're going to hit the wall and so they've started looking elsewhere and the Times  has trained them in new habits? We don't know enough yet, but I don't think that's a great number,  losing 15% of visits just because of the threat of the paywall. And if those visits are from the  people who come most often, then that's very harmful to the Times because they cause, that small  number cause the vast majority of traffic on the Times site and they're the ones who justify the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  premium ad rates. So we'll see where this goes. Yeah. And the next number I want to see, which is  one you probably won't hear from the New York Times is what the revenue has done. At least you  won't hear it until the next earnings call. And even then they may try to fudge what's actually  going on, but if they have a 5 to 15% drop and the revenue goes through the roof, then  that's great. It worked. That's what they wanted. It's all about them raising that revenue line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what they have to do is they have to both keep expanding advertising at the same time  they get the paywall, the meter rate from consumers. And so we'll see where it goes. I  like the Times. I love the Times. I pay for the Times. I'm rooting for them to win.  But I think that if any other newspaper thinks they can do this, they can't. Only the Times could  do it. And it's still very much up in the air as whether the Times can. All right. I've got a tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got two actually, somebody in the chat room and I apologize for not remembering your name,  pointed out that the new Twit app for Android is out. So you can watch Twit on Android up to date.  But my tool is Instapaper. I don't know if we've talked about it on Twig before or not,  but instapaper.com is a place where you can easily save things to read later. You put a  read later button in your browser tag. I've got one in Chrome. I've also got one in Firefox.  And when I run across an article, because I'm reading so many things every day to prepare for  tech news today, I will run across these articles and I'm like, wow, this is really interesting.  It's really in depth. Maybe it's a scientific article or a philosophical article. And I'm  wanting to read it, but I don't have time. I click it read later. And then I can not only  read it at instapaper.com, but there's apps for your phone, for your tablet, that you can at your  leisure pull it up. It gives you a list of all the things you've marked read later. It's very simple.  You might think, well, it's kind of like delicious, but it works particularly well for this sort of  thing where you're like, I just don't have time to get to this right now, but I want to sink my  teeth in it when I have more time. So I've used them to great effect in that particular way,  instapaper.com. Do you guys use it at all? It's a great app. I recommend Instafetch on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I seem to kind of serendipitous because the last time I was on, everybody was making fun of me for  defending the iPad as a tablet, but actually having just sold mine. And I just got the email  today right before I came on that Apple has shipped my iPad from Hong Kong. And actually,  and the instapaper is one of the main things that I do on my iPad because there's something about,  it's not intrinsic to the iPad. It could be any tablet, but there's the idea of getting home. I  don't want to get online yet. I don't want to be at my computer. And I use my iPad a lot for reading  and I'll just pick it up and yeah, I'll fire up instapaper and grab. I kind of treat it like I do  podcasts, like these things that I want to sit down and spend an hour with or so and kind of  give a little more time. Yeah, I think instapaper is great. All right. That's going to wrap it up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for us. Joel Johnson, editorial director at Kotaku.com. Let folks know what's going on and  what they can look forward to from you there. Video games mostly. I actually, we're getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ready to do some really fun stuff at Kotaku that we have E3 coming up, which we're doing a lot of  planning for that. A lot of it is sort of nebulous right now, but I can definitely say  I've been really pleased. I've worked at a lot of different sites and I stepped into a site that  had a really strong team and a lot of really good editors. So we're trying to figure out how to  blow it out and do even more in-depth coverage and try to cover video games in a way that maybe  wouldn't be the traditional way that they've always been covered with just straight ahead reviews  and previews, try to take a little more cultural, thinky angle on things. So yeah, come check us out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We love that. Sounds good. Just as Google surprises you, you will surprise us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There we go. And there goes Jeff Jarvis, buzzmachine.com. Any notes to leave people with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. Okay. Good to see you again, man. I've said everything I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's nothing more left. Gina Trapani, smarterware.org. I'm looking through my think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  up stats right now. Awesome. Awesome. Yeah. We're always looking for contributors,  developers, documentation writers at thinkupapp.com. We're doing a mentor program this summer for  young programmers who want to get some experience working in open source. So come check us out.  Just install it and run it if you're on the Twitters or the Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of my favorite parts is the most retweeted. I like to...  Awesome.  That tells me what stuff I said that was actually penetrating people's minds and they wanted to pass  around. Cool. Cool. My number two most retweeted right now is something from the Oscars night,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  though. That's crazy. Wow. That's a while ago. Come on, Tom. You got to keep it fresh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. All right. See, that's what it does. It gets me up to date. Thanks everybody for watching  This Week in Google. Leo will be back next week. He is at NAB and you can catch our coverage there  at the Twitch specials. Thanks everybody for watching. We'll see you next time on This Week  in Google.
