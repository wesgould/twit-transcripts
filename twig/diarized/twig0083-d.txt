Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hey, it's so great to have you back, Leo.  Thank you, Gina.  Looking very tan and thin and refreshed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I had so much fun.  It was really nice to get a little vacation.  Thanks to Becky and Tom for filling in while I was gone.  I appreciate that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They were fantastic.  I said to them, I want all of you at the same time, not just, you know, piecemeal.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's a good idea.  In fact, I believe, well, I'll tell you about that in a second.  I believe we will all be together again.  And it won't be in rock and roll heaven.  It'll be sooner than that.  But first, let me say hi to Jeff Jarvis of BuzzMachine.com.  He's a professor of journalism at the City University of New York and the author of a  fine book called What Would Google Do?  Hey, how's the how's private and public parts come in?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm one third of the way through editing the manuscript.  We're fighting over the subtitle now.  I'll ask you about it later.  Oh, good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We can do a poll.  We could.  Yes.  You know why?  Because I met in when I was in Buenos Aires, I had a lunch after that event.  I had another lunch with a bunch of people.  And one of them, Mariano Wexler, was an entrepreneur who created a Twitter thing called followers  at Polo Polers.  And I use it yesterday.  It's an enclosed beta.  It's so cool.  It lets you do polls on Twitter.  Very cool.  So if you want help, we can do a little poll.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'll do a real quick reading.  OK, we'll get the chat room.  OK, so public parts of the title, subtitle candidates.  One public parts and expose.  Two, if we're slightly dirty, privacy, why do we share a billion times a day?  Oh, OK.  Three, privacy and fear, openness and opportunity.  Four, what happens when companies, governments and individuals let it all hang out?  I like that.  And five, the private self, the public sphere and principles for a new society.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I, well, I won't say anything.  No, do.  What do you say?  I have a strong opinion.  Which one?  That what happens when governments and let it all hang out.  I like that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What about you with the publisher, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that one's pretty provocative.  I like I like the one privacy and fears and public, publicness and an opportunity.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  OK, yesterday, the editor and I were going for the billion times a day.  But OK, all right, good.  We thought it was a private parts and expose was a Twitter title.  Clever, probably doesn't.  Very clever.  Yes.  So all right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, the billion times a day.  Why do we share a billion times a day?  That one's pretty provocative, too.  I like that one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, but remember, this is all about selling books.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And what you agree with the publisher, the boss man at Simon & Schuster, like the one  you like, Leo, and I was pissy about it last night.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it doesn't know.  I think you're perfect.  No, that's what I'm saying.  My first book, Gina Smith and I, who wrote it, wanted to call it How Do I Get the Dog  Here Out of the Disc Drive?  The publisher chose the completely mundane one hundred and one computer answers you need  to know.  Yep.  That'll do it.  That'll kill a book.  But, you know, and somebody once told me with our former program director at Tech TV said  you can be clever in a title or you can communicate what it's about.  But, you know, I think it's nice in a book to know what it's about.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I kind of already have a joke with public parts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, public parts is great.  And then the subtitle says really what it's about, which is how, how, what does it say  it again?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That one is, oops, oops, oops, where'd it go?  Where'd it go?  Where'd it go?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sorry, it was something like how governments and the public.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's what happens when companies, governments, and people let it all hang out.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I love that.  Yeah, that is good.  That's what the book is about.  You're bringing me around.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  All right.  All right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We could do a, actually it's too long for a poll on Twitter.  I don't think I can get that all in 144 letters.  Free consultation here, yes.  Twitter polls really have to be fairly succinct.  Anyway, I miss you guys.  It's great to see you again.  Missed you.  Yeah, it's so good to be back.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Tom, by the way, have you heard this before?  I've never heard before.  He does a mean Leo imitation.  No.  Yeah, he does.  No.  He does.  I think we have to have, South by Southwest, I think we have to have a Leo off.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're kidding me.  Blind test.  Plus one.  Oh, Eileen, you knew about this and didn't tell me.  I want to hear it.  I'm going back in time and it's all recorded.  That's good.  Well, he should.  He's very, he's a talented guy.  I really think Tom is so great.  What a stellar addition to the network he has been.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He's a natural.  The guy never says um.  It's amazing.  I've never heard him say that.  That matters.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, thank you, Tom, for filling in.  I really appreciate it.  And you mentioned South by Southwest.  That's where we will all be together again.  Is Becky, I think Becky's going to be there.  We're doing a tweet at Momo's.  If you go to InsideTweet, Inside dot, tweet dot TV, that's our company blog.  Eileen's put up all the information you need to know about South by Southwest.  We did tweet there last year with you too and a bunch of others.  And I think we're going to have a very, how big is the current cast?  It's, it's fairly large, I believe.  But we're going to do it from Momo's, which is a nice little club in Austin.  Not right on sixth.  How far off of sixth is it?  It's like a mile.  Cabot probably.  We're going to be Sunday, March 13th.  We're going to, I'm going to do the radio show at one.  Tom will do his show TNT at four.  And then we're doing twit at five.  And we'll do a meetup after twit and I'll be there.  Tom will be there.  Sarah, Brian Brushwood, and we hope you two will also be part of you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That wouldn't miss it.  Highlight.  Absolutely.  Good.  Yay.  You'll have to kick us off stage.  You'll have to shove us off.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I don't think there'll be a large enough crowd for me to throw you into the crowd for crowd surfing.  Crowd surfing.  If there is, the challenge will be on.  See if you can, you can do a longer live crowd surf than I did last year.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think that just goes down in the Hall of Fame.  Yeah, I think they will never be duplicated.  I was so happy I was there for that moment.  It was the greatest moment ever.  It was a lot of, it was a lot of.  When you, when you went down, did you at that moment kind of say, oh crap, what have I just done?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I was ignorant.  I found out later that it's actually dangerous that the crowd dropped Meatloaf once and he broke his elbow.  And there are a couple of instances of performers jumping into the crowd and being dropped.  But in me, you know, I don't know if I've said this on the air.  I hope I'm not repeating myself, but as I get old, I find I do often.  But for me, there was a great metaphor there because my whole career has been buoyed, supported by this great community that we have around us.  And this was a kind of a very visceral, real experience of me jumping, you know, leap of faith out into this crowd and then carrying me gently along.  It was really amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, I'm not such a...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I hadn't thought about the deep philosophical.  That is something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I was thinking as I'm going, I was thinking, wow, this is a metaphor for my entire career.  It was really wonderful.  Hey, quickly, I didn't see it because I was on a boat.  But a couple of things happened while I was on a boat.  Egypt, you know, revolution.  You know, Facebook started it, Google started it, I guess a Google executive started it on Facebook.  Twitter powered it.  And IBM beat Ken Jennings on Jeopardy.  I'm not sure which is more important, to be honest with you.  No, I do know which is more important.  So, but we've talked a lot about the amazing, I'm sure you did last week and the week before about the amazing role of social media and Google specifically in the Egyptian revolution.  We did.  But we have not talked yet about Watson.  I didn't see it, but boy, that's a pretty amazing thing.  Let's play a little bit of Jeopardy, shall we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What to wear.  U.S. geographic nicknames.  This is a double Jeopardy round.  Magical mousetree tour.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And finally, so Watson is a computer created by IBM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's do familiar sayings for 1200.  If you're one of these capable fellows, you're unfortunately master of none.  Brad, what is a jack of all trades?  Yeah, 1600.  Watson's kind of stoic.  A horse designed by this.  Ken, what's a committee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Familiar sayings for 2000.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's a poor work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's kind of fun because they're showing Watson thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Watson, what are tools?  You are right for 2000.  That's creepy.  For 1600.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some would say it sounds like Zuckerberg.  Also honestly titled his memoir, a heartbreaking.  No, he's more eloquent and fluid.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Watson, what is staggering genius?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  Same category, 1200.  Answer, A double.  Oh, do you not think this is creepy?  I mean, it's awe-inspiring and creepy.  I'll wager $2,127.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, you know that's exactly the right amount to wager, right?  Who would even come up with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  New Yorker's 1959 review.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Actually, they didn't talk about his algorithm for coming up with daily doubles.  I didn't, I thought one of the two.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay, the New Yorker's 1959 review.  Let's see, let's play Jeopardy.  I'd like to remind you, you need to state your answer as a question.  The New Yorker's 1959 review of this said in its brevity and clarity,  it is unlike most such manuals, a book as well as a tool.  Jeff Jarvis.  Strunk and white.  That's what I would have said.  You agree, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is?  What is?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, by the way, Watson would not forget to do that.  So we're going to say what is elements of style?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see.  The New Yorker's 1969 review of this said in its brevity and clarity,  it is unlike most such manuals, a book as well as a tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's try.  What is Dorothy Parker?  Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no.  The work was the elements of style.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Only 10%.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  10% confidence.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't that interesting?  Yeah, I love the confidence readings.  I love the buzzer threshold.  You know, he had a certain threshold where he'd only buzz if he had an answer.  I mean, not on that one because it was a daily double, but I loved it.  It kind of creeped out.  But then I was just cool to see, you know, and to kind of think about the different circumstances.  Like, Watson got all the answers in text, right?  But Trebek was reading them aloud.  So that made me wonder, you know, at what point does Watson get the text, right?  Because you listen, listening is to speech is slower than, you know, reading text, especially for a computer.  So I kept thinking about things like that because there was actually a buzzer that Watson pressed.  Physically?  Physically, yeah.  There was a physical mechanism that mashed down on a buzzer, just like the humans.  And it wasn't connected to the Internet, right?  Because a human plane has a huge database.  And actually, the room where the Watson system was, was filled with really loud refrigerators.  You know, I think it was like 50 blade servers, you know, connected, connected to Ethernet.  And then just like, you know, this really loud cooling system.  But I loved it. It was really, really cool.  Like Ken Jenning said that he welcomes our new computer overlords.  I kind of feel the same way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love you, Ken.  That's a really good, dee-dee answer.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes.  If we, if we saw Google, if we'd never seen search engines, we'd never seen the Internet,  and suddenly you saw Google fully birthed, you'd think it's creepy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right? Oh my God.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ray Kurzweil wrote an article last month in PC Magazine, Why IBM's Jeopardy! Victory Matters.  He said, when he wrote his book, The Age of Intelligent Machines in the 1980s,  he predicted that a computer would win the World Chess Championship by 1998.  He said, I was a year off, it was 1997, that IBM's computer, Deep Blue, beat Garry Kusparov.  He said, what happened immediately was, of course, people, humans, started rationalizing.  Well, the computer was chess is a completely analytical game.  There's a correct answer at all points.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  He says, no, this is, look at, this is significant.  And he said, what was most significant was that Watson had a sense of humor, or at least appeared to.  Did you notice that?  Gina, did you notice a little sense of humor?  For instance, Ken Jennings selects the Chicks Dig Me category.  He's making a joke, because he says, I've never said this on TV, Chicks Dig Me. Ken Jennings.  He's a human. He made a joke.  Later on, Watson says, let's finish Chicks Dig Me and gets a laugh.  Now, probably inadvertent, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Because there was no speech recognition.  Like, Watson couldn't hear.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Here's a question, a dumb question, but that's the kind I always ask you to.  Ask the dumb one, because believe me.  Is Watson AI?  Is it artificial intelligence, or is it just, you know, what is artificial intelligence?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, AI is kind of a deprecated term these days.  I know it is, right.  I mean, it's probably a big decision tree.  You know what?  Looking at those confidence readings, that's exactly what a chess computer is doing.  As it's an analog.  I don't know, Gina, is it AI?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, it's natural language processing, right?  So it's just this giant terabytes of data, and like, you just look at things like word frequency.  And, you know, I think that some of the scientists talked about how they try to identify, you know, the nouns and the adjectives and the verbs inside the answer.  And then, I mean, it's I don't know that that was that it's AI.  I would say more natural language processing, but it really had to because it's jeopardy.  It really had to understand things like references and jokes.  I mean, that was what was so cool about it.  You know, a lot of geeks I saw were kind of felt like this was this, you know, unnecessary display, you know, for regular people.  I thought it was such a great PR for IBM.  And I think it was an awesome display of what you can do when you have the data, what computers can do when you have the data.  If a computer is going to help me diagnose, you know, symptoms over, you know, a course of years that doctors can't then, hey, yeah, I want to go to Watson for my diagnosis.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My woman better than my exactly.  I was feeding doctors when I had an arterial thing, my falling apart body, and I would feed them symptoms and they wouldn't listen to the symptoms.  They would just jump to their own conclusion.  And I wanted Gregory House MD as an algorithm.  I wanted Watson as a doctor.  Yeah. Yep. Yep.  By the way, I really want to plug my good friend, Stephen Baker, who is the author of Final Jeopardy, the full story of Watson and Jeopardy now on sale.  And he is ex Businessweek writer and he did a really interesting thing where he wrote the whole book up to the last chapter.  He could buy the book without it. Yeah.  And then and then get the last chapter immediately.  And Stephen is great. I look forward to seeing his book.  So even big final Jeopardy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I also owe an apology to everybody who's listening who hasn't yet seen the show, although I don't know why you wouldn't have seen the show.  It was more than a week ago.  But apparently I've learned this, by the way, after talking about this before the show on the radio show that Jeopardy fans take this game very, very, very seriously.  And I got a lot of people saying, Leo, I hate you.  You I was looking forward to this.  You spoiled it by talking about the result.  I had no idea. I thought it was a TV game show.  Nobody for Jeopardy Cruz.  Nobody complains that you was all Wheel of Fortune.  You said who is going to win.  But Jeopardy is a little different, I guess.  What what Ray comes down to is he said he has a bet with Mitch Kapoor that a computer will pass the Turing test, the very famous test of that.  You know, it's complicated.  I could boil it down to simply is a computer indistinguishable from a human to a third party who's not in the know.  And Ray Kurzweil said twenty twenty nine.  Absolutely. And bet ten grand.  Kapoor said no way.  Kapoor, of course, the creator of Lotus one, two, three, knows a little bit about computer software, as does Ray Kurzweil, who is one of the premier artificial intelligence researchers in the world.  What do you guys think?  Well, I just will say that Ray considers this victory by Watson absolute proof that it's going to happen and it probably happens sooner than twenty twenty nine.  Come on. After all, it might have been hard to tell that was a computer.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, of course, it helped that he would change color.  He would go orange when he got things wrong.  So it looked like he was embarrassed.  And the fact that he had a male voice and that Rebecca was kind of referred to him as a he that that part creeped me out at first.  I mean, I know we call boats she and that kind of thing.  But I was kind of like, it's a computer.  Let's refer to it as an it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But that's that's the key in the Turing test is that you you anthropomorphize.  Right. Right.  And the and the Turing test is can you do it successfully?  No, it doesn't have any rules like, oh, you're not allowed to turn color or call it a he.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, if you go to if you go to Gina's point about data, the problem in trying to create the Turing algorithm before was you didn't have enough data.  Now the web is filled with conversations.  And if the Turing test is to have a conversation and believe that it's a human being, the data set of conversations now is incredible.  Yeah, huge.  Yeah.  It'll speak like Twitter.  It'll say, lol, man.  But that's not so bad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The conclusion of the article, Rick Kurzweil says, what will be the significance of a computer passing the Turing test?  If it is really a properly designed test, it will mean that this A.I. is truly operating at human levels.  Now, I had a debate with Ray saying, but it's not human, right?  I mean, it's not so what that it can fool you into thinking human.  That's not the same as human.  And Ray said, but does it matter?  No, it's not human.  But does it matter if it's indistinguishable from human?  He says, I, for one, would then regard it as human.  I'm expecting this to happen within two decades.  And I also expect when it does, observers will continue to find things wrong with it.  By the time the controversy dies down and it becomes unambiguous, as it is now, by the way, that computers play better chess,  it's going to be pretty unambiguous pretty soon that computers will beat everybody at Chappie.  If it beats Ken Jennings, who's never been beaten.  OK, it beat the world champion at Jeopardy, right?  He says, by the time the controversy dies down, it becomes unambiguous that non-biological intelligence is equal to biological human intelligence.  Then A.I.'s will already be thousands of times smarter than us.  But keep in mind, this is not an alien invasion from Mars.  We are. This is another argument I had with Ray.  Well, that's the Terminator.  I mean, they're just going to wipe us out.  He says, we're inferior.  Right. He says, no, we're creating these technologies to extend our reach.  The fact that farmers in China can access all of human knowledge with devices they carry in their pockets is a testament to the fact that we are doing this already.  Ultimately, we will vastly extend and expand our own intelligence by merging with these tools of our own creation.  He told me they won't kill us.  We're their daddy.  They will revere us.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That worked really well on Battlestar Galactica.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hey, I created you. Stop it.  What do you think?  Ray believes we're nearing very near what he calls a singularity.  By the way, we're going to talk to Ray Kurzweil in two weeks and that will absolutely be one of the topics on our show.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'll be tuning into that. It sounds very interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And if you read his book, The Singularity is Near or The Age of Intelligent Machines or The Age of Spiritual Machines, all of which kind of in one way or another deal with this, it's pretty convincing.  He's the guy who also said, I just want to live long enough to live forever because he believes if he can survive 20 years, he'll be able to pour his brain into a machine and he never die.  That's kind of a simplification of it.  So are you do you fear this, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't. I look forward to this.  You're a programmer.  I guess so. Someone in the chat room is asking, would you hire Watson as a lawyer or maybe an accountant?  You bet. You bet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Definitely as an accountant.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Definitely. Definitely as an accountant.  If the goal is make me pay the fewest amount of tax as possible, definitely Watson would do better than my accountant. Sorry.  But now, you know, this just this kind of thing just makes me really happy to be alive at this point in the world.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We may see an amazing thing.  You will see it in your lifetime, Gina.  I don't know if Jeff and I'll make it. It's really touch and go.  Especially me.  Are you falling apart, Jeff?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm falling apart. I'm a mess.  Is this something new?  No, no, nothing new this time. But it's, you know, it's every few. I'm going for a hat trick soon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, geez. No, hang in there, Jeff.  Yeah.  You just have to live long enough to live forever.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I will pour me into the computer now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I figure I just need to make Jeff a note on the network. That's all.  Yeah.  Let's we do that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We could be doing this show well into the 30th century.  Wouldn't that be funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's time for Twig.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Hello.  Number 4,676.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is elements of style? See, I knew that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I hope this doesn't come off as flip because I mean it. The first person to pour into the computer is Steve Jobs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No kidding. And it may be I hope it won't be too late. But yeah, you're right.  He will. God, I'm praying for him because he's so important to to this revolution that we're in the middle of.  Yes.  You know who will will be the first person, by the way, just so you know, Mark Zuckerberg.  Mark Zuckerberg.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Just so you know.  Isn't everybody at that dinner with Obama last week?  Yeah.  In the jar.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Larry, Sergey, Mark and Steve.  Yeah.  Sounds like a rock group.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's not a bad world.  It's not a bad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, absolutely. Mark Zuckerberg is right on track.  He's young enough. He's rich enough.  And gosh darn it, people like him.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  When I interviewed Zuckerberg, my editor hated this line, but I argued with him and I'll keep it in.  Is he said we're not in the technology business so much as we're in the sociology business.  Yeah. Well, he's right.  He's right.  And he is. I mean, he's he's human engineering.  He's he's engineering society.  And that's what's fascinating.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I actually said that on this show of a year ago.  I said what Google needs to do is hire more sociologists and fewer computer scientists.  Yep. Because the computer science problems are not intractable.  They're not difficult.  But the user interface, the is the way of taking complexity and making it simple.  All of that is very hard.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So it goes back to to Facebook again.  Yuri Milner, who is the major investor in Facebook now, has told me that his entire investment strategy is a odd.  But he believes that if you take data that exists on Facebook, one presumes, I guess, Zynga as well, and you add a eye to it, he says there's this this this giant leap that occurs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That makes sense.  It's that data set thing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The bigger the bigger the data set.  The more you can do with it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, OK, who has the biggest data set right now?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Google. Google. No doubt.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And but Google's data set is about data.  Facebook's data set is about people.  That's true.  If you look at it another way and say the way I ask it in the book is who's the best signal generator of human.  OK, that's probably a better measurement.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Huh? Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And so it's because more structured data and people centric data.  Right. Yeah, for now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But I think it could change.  You know, Google.  That's why to my mind, that's why Android and with Android, Google knows where we are, what we're looking for, what we want, where we're going, where we've been.  Those are very, very important signals.  Facebook knows who we know, what we like, what we talk about and and how you become the best signal generator and then the best analyst of those signals to become the best exploiter of those signals to give us relevance and relevance.  You know, I saw the Guardian some time ago did some kind of random story generator.  It was an effort to get the serendipity.  And I said, no, serendipity is not that serendipity is not randomness.  It's relevance we didn't expect.  Ah, right.  And so that's what both Google and Facebook want to be able to do is be is finally get the real train test is when they're a step ahead of us.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what Derek was saying when he said we'll know what you want before you.  Exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly.  It is it is book.  I you know, the next book I should do is Eric Schmidt's quotes that get me in trouble.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a long book.  It's a long book.  It's a good one.  It writes itself.  It's wonderful.  On the official Google blog last week, this post an update to Google social social search.  They today we're doing a little bit more to bring you all the goodness of Google plus the opinions of people you care about.  They're incorporating more information from the people that matter to you, whether they're publishing on YouTube Flickr or their own blog or website.  So social search results are getting mixed in.  Now, of course, they're presenting those to us.  But if they're presenting this to us, it's kind of like the tip of the iceberg.  You've got to think that two thirds of this data is being mined within Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was I was at a privacy conference in Victoria, B.C. last week, which is where I did the show from with bad Wi-Fi in the hotel room.  And I gave a talk the next morning and I got into a tussle with the head of privacy for Victoria for B.C.  When she said that Eric Schmidt said that privacy isn't relevant.  I said he never said that.  But the thing that I asked everyone there to do was I said the next time you hear the word creepy, which it conferences like that you hear all the time, just stop and say define that please.  Right.  You know, there's a time we would have thought Google was creepy.  There's a time when all kinds of things seem creepy.  TV seem creepy.  Creepy means unknown.  So Watson being creepy, A.I. being creepy, during test being creepy.  It's because we don't know if we don't know what can be done with it.  If we instead make it ours and control it, magnificent things can happen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll define creepy in a way that maybe doesn't fit that.  It's the uncanny valley.  You know, the animators have this phrase they use the uncanny valley where there's a human mind is so adept at seeing a human face or hands or body that if you draw a cartoon, Elmer Fudd doesn't bother anybody.  They know it's a cartoon.  The brain says, yeah, it's a drawing.  But as you move closer and closer to real humans, animated humans, there gets this place where you go called the uncanny valley where it looks to every in every way real.  But the brain knows it's not.  And it's creepy, real creepy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's when it starts to look real.  Right.  Until we understand the temporary valley.  Right.  It's temporary.  It's temporary until we take control of it.  So you can cross the valley.  We've got control of it.  It's not creepy anymore.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  I think that's that's what creepy is for me.  Right.  Like I didn't know that you knew this about me.  And then suddenly that's creepy.  You did.  And that creeped me out.  Right.  But it turns out you're standing right over my shoulder and I didn't know.  So that creeps me out.  Right.  As someone sneaks up behind me.  So like with the social search that Google just launched, it's great.  I love it.  But the first time it rolled out, I hadn't read the news story.  I did a search for something that Adam Pash at Lifehacker, who I follow on Twitter and who I email with all the time, had written about on Lifehacker.  So I do the search and at the top of the search it says, you know, here's the result.  And Adam recommends this or Adam shared this.  And I was like, oh, OK.  And which was great because I can get over that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I can get over that.  That's not the first time it surprised me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So I wrote I kind of hovered over Adam and said, oh, you're out of you're connected to Adam on Twitter and in Gmail.  OK, I knew that.  But but it's that that initial jarring like, oh, I didn't know that you knew everybody that I followed on Twitter, even though that that's public data.  I just that's something I did over on Twitter.  I think that that that can that's a little tiny example of a little creepy.  That said, the social search results now that I understand that Google has been crawling all knows all my sort of my social graph is fantastic.  Like I like I love seeing names and faces next to next to links like, oh, yes, this is what I want to click on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's a graph from Wikipedia.  Across the X axis is human likeness.  Across the Y axis is familiarity.  And there's the uncanny uncanny valley.  So stuffed animal.  Fine.  Humanoid robot.  Fine.  Zombie corpse.  Creepy.  But I would submit there.  So we have two kinds of creepy, two definitions of creepy.  One, which you and Gina embrace is that, well, it's technologically sophisticated.  So it surprises us.  But we can get used to that technological sophistication.  You can get used to.  Yes.  But I don't think you get used to a zombie.  It's permanently creepy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Isn't it?  Well, I never get used to David Copperfield.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Or was that other magician always goes like this?  So I think there is I think there's genuine creepiness.  It's not merely that we're technologically, you know, surprised.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't want this to get misquoted because I like the guy, respect him.  I'm saying good things about them in the book.  But I think that's I think that's part of why people don't get Zuckerberg.  He's genuinely creepy.  Here's why.  And don't quote folks.  I'm not saying he's creepy.  He's a zombie.  I don't think he is.  Oh, it's because you would think that he would be, of course, the most open person on Earth.  But in fact, the mystique of Mark Zuckerberg is that he's mysterious.  Right.  And the fact that he needed to be that and Aaron Sorkin and company tried to interpret him.  And I would say badly still.  I know I'm about the only one who says that.  So that's where that's where the creepiness comes from.  As we don't get him, we don't understand him.  He's not like us.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, certainly as Jesse Eisenberg portrayed him in the soon to be Academy Award winning movie,  The Social Network, Eisenberg clearly went for creepy, right?  Kind of subhuman.  Yes.  Yes.  I don't know.  You've been with Mark.  Is he really that creepy?  No.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, he smiles.  He smiles.  He blinks.  He actually blinks.  I was remembering this as I was rewriting the chapter, right?  My editor, who's by the way, is very happy to see what you guys are saying about the title  because his boss likes it.  So we win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We win.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Jeff.  You should have sent me an email saying, would you please?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, this is good feedback.  By the way, Gina, are you offended by a hangout?  Let it all hang out?  No, not at all.  To Purell, Penile or you used to be now.  And that's the publisher's contention.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's OK.  Then it's probably the right choice because you can never be too Penile or Purell.  Me.  So.  In fact, if you have the choice between Penile, Purell or both, I'd go for both.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or what's the name of the hand thing?  Purell.  Penile, Purell.  Purell.  Yes.  Well, safety is in taking first.  After your Penile and Purell.  Purell.  Geez, Louise.  That's why I saved that.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe you shouldn't use that as a subtitle.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Stop.  I'm telling myself stop.  So I remember I thought back to what I saw Zuckerberg at various events at, pardon me  for place dropping Davos or the Quadrangle Conference or this Murdoch event where I was  brought into.  And in every one of those cases, he absolutely threw the business moguls, pardon me, light.  I'm not dead.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is your soul lighting your computer screen?  Is that why it keeps getting dark?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, because I'm actually a zombie.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, geez.  By the way, Night in Jail said, Leo, hang out with a zombie.  Have a beer with one.  You'd find them not creepy after a while.  So maybe I'm wrong.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So Zuckerberg, what I loved about him on panels and stuff was that he never said exactly a  word more than he had to say.  And he was blunt, politely blunt.  Somebody would ask a question, he would say, and it was like that one scene in the movie  where he said, you know, why do you say that?  That's just what he was.  He would just answer the question, that's it, no more.  And I love the fact that he didn't add flowers and buzzwords and all that, that he just said  what he thought that was it.  Boom, done, now what?  And it threw everybody for such a loop.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's interesting because that was something that apparently Aaron Sorkin picked up on  because it's exactly how Aaron Sorkin wrote it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So now he's either had media training or I think more likely he is simply become more  comfortable.  He was scared.  He's relaxed.  So we get to see a little more of him now.  And you know, what's the real Zuckerberg?  The zombie or this?  And so no, I think that he's not like that.  I think that that's why he was like that because he was scared.  He was 19 years old, surrounded by mobiles.  He was a kid.  Yeah.  Didn't know what to do.  His father's a dentist who works alone.  You know, that's what it was.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It sounds like a line out of CSI.  His father was a dentist who works alone.  By the way, the Urban Dictionary has two interesting, two germane, as long as we're going to use  big words, germane definitions of creepy Jackson, someone somewhat scary because of strangeness,  which is kind of what you guys are saying.  It's just strange, unfamiliar, but but but we'll become familiar.  And then the third definition is by far the most common adjective predicated to quiet  people who don't smile.  Isn't that interesting?  Aka the old Mark Zuckerberg.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's take a break.  This is interesting.  I think it's interesting.  What is creepy?  And is you know, is it just is it merely just technologically new?  Strangeness?  Well, the cloud is creepy.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people creeped out by the cloud.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The fact that the cloud, I don't know what it is.  People just draw this cloud thing.  I would say that.  Where is it?  Where's your right?  That's creepy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I came up with a new.  So I can't remember who said it to me first, and I would give him credit if I could.  But a great way to respond to people who say, I'm not going to trust my data to the cloud.  And I include John C. DeVorek to this is, well, OK, where's your money?  Right.  Is it in your mattress?  No.  Is it does it exist?  No, it's in the cloud.  You've been trusting your entire financial world to the cloud for your whole life.  There's no vault with your money in it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I have this vision now of DeVorek with a razor and a mattress.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If anybody would put his money in a mattress, it's John C.  You might wish that.  He was in Madrid and his passport and wallet got pickpocketed.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No.  Ow.  The grumpiest man on earth.  Oh, my Lord, he must have been.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was karma.  Because I think he was like lording it over people.  You've never been to Europe?  Well, I've been to Europe many times.  And he's the one who got picked.  Anyway, we have no spam.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I have no passport.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'll make sure.  John, I believe, is back now.  And actually, we have a great video that John and Eileen shot in Madrid at the  Ford Focus event.  So we'll get that out soon.  Meanwhile, let me take a little break and mention our friends at hover.com.  Hover is domain name registration done right.  Simply clean.  They don't upsell you.  In fact, a lot of times on these other registrars, you say, all right, I'll buy  that domain.  Oh, it's cheap.  What a great deal.  Oh, by the way, you probably want privacy on this.  You'd probably like this and that.  And they try to upsell you on 1,500 different things.  By the time you're done, it's the most expensive domain name you've ever seen.  Hover doesn't do that.  Their domain name registration made simple.  In fact, I'll give you an example.  They build privacy right in.  They know you want privacy.  So they don't charge you for it.  It comes with the territory, H-O-V-E-R, as in cover, hover.com.  Actually, if you go to twig.hover.com, you can check it out and get a little deal.  10% off your domain registration.  Couldn't be easier.  Transfers are great, too.  Now, some people say, well, wait a minute, the transfer is not free.  Yeah, it's $10.  But what the $10 does is gets you an additional year on your existing domain  registration.  So it's actually a good deal.  And they'll even do all the transfers for you.  I transferred a bunch of domains, and I wish I'd taken advantage of this.  If you click the transfer your domain for $25, no matter how many domains, one to 1,000,  they will do it all for you.  You call them 866-731-6556, and they'll do the entire thing for you, all the niggly technical  details of a transfer, which is a pain in the butt.  They say, no, that's the thing that's perhaps keeping you from moving to Hover, but you'll  be glad you did.  By the way, when you call that number and you get a representative, you will not be  put on hold.  They have a no-hold policy for customer service calls during business hours.  And I like that, too.  I can't tell you how much time I've spent on hold with those other guys.  Hover.com for your new domain or transfer your old domain.  It's the easiest, the best, the fastest, the cleanest, the most straightforward.  Of course, they're Canadian.  It has to be good.  Did you notice that when you were in Victoria?  They're nice people.  They are.  You run into a Canadian, he apologizes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  When I got into the fight with the speechwriter for the commissioner or governor general or  whatever or privacy in British Columbia and saying, you misquoted Eric Schmidt, you cited  a blog, and she said, no, no, no, she doesn't.  I said, no, you're full of crap.  And she said, you're rude.  And I said, I'm American.  You're rude.  You're rude.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the worst it gets.  No, I have to say this is a division of two cows.  It was called Domains Direct for a long time.  It really is just a great service.  And I love these guys.  Well, you know, this came out of South by Southwest last year because Elliott, who's  the CEO, came over and we were we were.  Remember, we had that great meat dinner.  Yes.  So good. We're going to do that again, by the way.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  By the way, cardiologist still hates you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, it's good. You should eat more meat.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  After your South American venture, I bet you're full.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I lost six pounds on the cruise.  Really? Eating meat.  Good for you, Leo. It was carbs.  It was not eating carbs for me.  Anyway, I don't want to get into that because I don't want to kill you, Jeff.  So I'm not going to.  I just want you to go to twig.hubber.  He's a last to blow me over.  It would be so bad.  It'd be like, oh, yeah, I got this great diet.  You just eat a lot of meat. And Jeff goes, oh, and then.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I know we got to get his brain, pour his brain in the jar first.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Before we got to get the jar, then I'll tell you about the meat diet.  Yeah, I eat a lot of good meat.  Oh, man. Buenos Aires. Oh, they got this thing called provoleto,  which is like fried cheese.  It's so good.  Oh, man. It comes in a little skillet.  And then I had the blood sausage and chorizo.  Now, I've had Mexican treat. So this is not Mexican.  This is incredible sausage.  The food and the steaks. Oh, my God.  Anyway, what were we talking about?  Oh, you hover.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Note to self, eat lunch before.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Lunch before twig.  We made a Chipotle run. I should have asked you.  Oh, rats. I can't. Skype doesn't support Chipotle transfer.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Seriously, we need the burrito shoot.  From Petaluma straight down to San Diego.  Burrito shoot.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's a great idea.  You know what they should do at Chipotle is they should have pneumatic delivery.  It's the product made for pneumatic delivery.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's a bullet. It's the bullet burrito. Come on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Twig.Hover.com.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We are heading off on every tangent possible.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love the tangents.  If you if you listen to the Twitter network, not when Jeff, not when we're not when the Tom and Becky.  You know, these guys, these guys are professionals.  They keep it on track.  They know what they're doing. They they hit the clock.  They're everything. They're perfect.  They're wonderful people.  And we get back and it's like squirrels.  So Gingerbread, I haven't I'm keep looking at my Nexus S.  Now, Gina, you were bemoaning the Nexus 1.  During the commercial, I was checking my phone to see if the OTA on Gingerbread had come through.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I knew you were doing that.  Not yet.  Not yet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And even the Nexus S, which is using 222 should get an update.  Yep. And they said that it could take a few weeks for the next one to be released.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That it could take a few weeks to do the rollout.  But someone in the forum said it's not really going to take a few weeks.  It'll be in the next few days.  We just we do it incrementally just in case there are problems.  So as far as I know, no one's released an update zip that you can just grab, although someone in the chat room can can correct me.  I'm trying to be a regular user and just waiting for the OTA update.  But it also means that I'm the loser checking my phone every five minutes to see if I have the reward.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's like the hamster with the button in the palette.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Exactly. Give me the pellet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's just a great that there is perhaps for an Android user, no better feeling than that little announcement that comes on the screen that says you have an update.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, the little robot guy.  But you know, the honeycomb emulator or SDK is out.  So I was temporarily distracted by that.  I downloaded that this morning and took some screenshots.  So what do you think?  You know, it's the emulators kind of slow, but that's just the emulator.  And I had to fiddle with some settings and sped it up.  Otherwise, really beautiful.  I mean, the emulator, there are no there are no no apps installed at all.  I mean, they have a few demos, but like Gmail and all the regular apps aren't installed.  It's just kind of bare bones.  But it's really cool. It's just a huge screen.  It makes such a big difference.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What? Oh, you know, besides the video wall.  Yeah, because part of this is real jealous.  No, I could ever get it on my Galaxy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I'm with you, though, because that's eye candy.  I want to know, is it that is like, yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What what what is it, Gina, that you think is the is the is the most actually valuable thing?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's interesting that all the buttons are on the device itself.  There's no there's no key.  You know, the back button and the home button are all there.  You know, the time you can you can tap on the time and will pop up sort of a larger kind of like  not that I want to say this, but kind of like windows.  And you just have a lot more space. You can flip between things.  I mean, it's just it's just it's the bigger screen, stupid.  It's you know, it just makes a big, huge, huge difference.  But like I said, the emulator, there's there are no apps installed, really.  So I couldn't I didn't get a chance to try Gmail, the Gmail app.  That's closed source. That doesn't come out with it with the SDK.  So I really didn't get a good a good chance to really experience what it's like.  I really like the different panels, though, the action bar and the panel on the side.  And I ran my own app and have lots of really exciting ideas about how to make it kind of more tablet friendly.  So initial initial one thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This means that the manufacturers won't move the damn buttons around. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, but they will have duplicate buttons because we'll have hardware.  I mean, I know the zoom doesn't have buttons.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. And will others have buttons?  I mean, it looks like all the buttons are are on screen like the the the emulator itself  doesn't have the the extra buttons, even the search button. Really?  Although I imagine that maybe some of some of the other tablets will have these,  you know, maybe search and home.  Hmm. But menu and back or the advantage is it's never upside down. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's probably a lot of it, isn't it?  The orientation. Yes.  Is independent of the hardware.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Which makes a lot of sense. It drives me nutty.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One. Yeah. No, that actually is.  That's yeah. You're right.  On the Samsung, because it's just once you turn around, it's kind of, oh, dear.  Yeah. Right. And this isn't a problem on the iPad so much because there's only one button.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Good point. Right.  So that can be anywhere. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, you can't you know, you can't hit the wrong button if there's only one button.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I installed my app. It looked great.  There's tons of white space, obviously, but it completely works.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, so it scales. You don't have to do anything special.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, I didn't do anything special.  I mean, it's it's you know, it's scaled it up.  There's a lot of white space.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Would there be a way kind of kind of an elastic,  some sort of elastic layout that would kind of handle that better?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think that way you can do is as a developer is that you can create panels.  And if you're on the widescreen, both panels show on the screen at the same time.  But if you're on the small, you know, the small screen,  you would have to tap an object to move over to the other panel.  OK. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They got to make it easy for developers, though, to make it something that looks good.  The universal app. Yes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yep. Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Boy, Gina, you shouldn't have turned down that movie offer that you got last year,  because if you were if you're going to the Oscars  as a nominee, you would have received a gold zoom.  And by the way, I got to be clear about this because zoom is so generic.  It's a maybe what can we agree to say? Zoom.  Or something like that.  Oh, oh, it's the Motorola X.  It's a basic black for the general public, but they've got a gold one  for Oscar hosts and nominees as part of the you know, you get a bag of stuff.  Oh, a tax bill.  Well, that's right. I was talking to was  when he did Dancing with the Stars, they gave him a basket of goodies  worth 70. I hope I'm not betraying a confidence worth 75.  I don't know. He didn't make me sign an NDA.  Seventy five thousand dollars.  And and he took it because he said we didn't know any better.  So thanks.  And then they had to pay, you know, like half of its taxes.  You have to pay thirty thousand dollars for this seventy five  thousand dollar basket of goodies.  They said it's a bunch of crap. I didn't want, you know,  Bulgari perfume and stuff.  And it's all retail.  Who was you smell so elegant?  He said there were three good things in the whole bag was very expensive.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Just just to clarify, chat room, I did not get a movie offer.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I it says so in Wikipedia.  If it doesn't, I'll make sure it doesn't.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I thought you were going to be the lawyer in social network.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, she would have been good.  She so much more believable.  Yeah. Right. Oh, you would have been so good.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Are you guys being my agents? Seriously?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you know, hey, Snoop Dogg got that commercial.  Have you seen the Snoop Dogg for the 4G indulge?  I haven't seen it yet. All right.  I have not seen it yet. Let's watch a commercial.  I don't think they could sue us for playing their stupid commercial, can they?  They should pay you. Yeah.  I know we're going to get it from Jeopardy, though.  I know Alex Trebek's going to say, oh, Leo, you made a horrible error.  This is a this is a little bit from that  a little bit from that ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of like a dating stuff is Snoop D.O.G.G.G.G.  I'm a rapper, an actor, a director,  little league football coach and a relationship therapist.  And the 4G? Lately, the speed of my hustle has increased exceptionally.  And I've had to amp up my G's to facilitate my needs.  Settle down now, girl.  All right. When we come back, the lovely Brittany  will be grilling each of our contestants who she's going to pick.  Stay tuned. I get it.  This is an ad that's done.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The consideration brought to you by Metro PCS and the Samsung Galaxy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, that is that's homeless announcer.  That's him. Yeah. Yeah.  Oh, he sounds good to indulge.  Indulge. So that was the indulge ad.  And that guy's going to get more work than Casey Kasem.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So he gets out of rehab.  Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think he's did something happen while I was gone.  Anyway.  Eileen's got an Oscar.  Are you you're going to do that, right, Gina?  Eileen's Oscar poll pool.  Oscar poll. Oscar pool.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, Oscar pool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, send send them the thing.  We got to get them in that. Sure. I'm in.  Do you put money into that?  That makes it an illegal gambling thing.  No, yes, we put money into it. A lot of money into it.  You could win thousands of dollars.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We just bet Zynga dollars. That's all. Yeah.  Bit calling. Hey, I won. Hey.

Transcript:  Flash is going to be Adobe is has announced  in a little to Apple that Android three will will.  Come with Flash.  Not on the first tablet.  It's going to take a little while after the first tablet's come out.  But that's interesting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It will ship with a preinstalled or this is going to be part.  It can be part of the code base, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's see.  I'm trying to see if Adobe has it says the version  Flash player 10.2, the version of Flash that will be compatible  with upcoming Android tablets will be ready in a few weeks  after Android three comes out, after which it'll be available  for over the air installation.  So it will not be bundled.  OK, I thought it was I misunderstood.  I did think it was going to be bundled.  So I guess they didn't do a deal, a deal with the Google to do that.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Come back with more.  Gina Tripani is here.  Jeff Jarvis coming up in just a bit.  Our tool, a tip and number of the week.  And and we'll answer the question, why did Google ask for kids  social security numbers?  Before we do that, I'd like to talk about Squarespace dot com,  the secret behind exceptional websites.  The secret behind exceptional websites.  Go to Squarespace dot com slash twig right now.  I gave a talk on the cruise, as I mentioned about social media.  And we talked about Twitter and Facebook and how to claim  your Facebook username and all that stuff.  But I said, look, the most important thing for you to do,  the most important place you should exist on the web is your own website.  So many people think it's all I have a Facebook page.  That's not enough.  The good news is very easy and affordable to create your own website.  Get your go to hover dot com, get your name, register your name,  then go to Squarespace dot com slash twig.  Click that green button.  You could try it free for two weeks and you get all the features.  You don't have to give them a credit card or anything, just the site name,  password, email address and a little capture and you're in.  And you could try all the great features of Squarespace.  It's hosting plus the best content management software out there.  I don't want to scare you with that CMS term, but what it means is for a blog,  for a photo gallery, for a forum even, or just for a site that says,  Hey, I'm here. This is me. Here's my stuff.  Which at least you got to do at least, you know,  if you have a social media strategy, you know, you got to have a website.  I don't care if you're a small business or just an individual.  You got to have a website and there's no easier way to do it than Squarespace.com  Go to squarespace.com slash twig, try it free for two weeks.  And I have a feeling you will love it.  The beautiful templates make it easy to make a site that looks totally  professional social network integration so that you're,  yeah, it's your Facebook page and your Twitter and all that. I mean,  actually they do it better than anybody I've ever seen before.  They have these very simple plugins. There's the Flickr widget,  and you can have, you know, thumbnails or pictures.  You can have a slideshow. Here's the Twitter widget. And you see,  it's just sliders, check boxes, styles. It's so easy. But of course,  if you know CSS, you could do any RSS feed. If you know CSS,  the sky's the limit because all of this can be completely configured to your  heart's content. Squarespace.com slash twig.  It's the secret behind exceptional websites.  So I didn't know this.  We talked about the Google doodle contest where kids were encouraged to send in  doodles, Google doodles.  But apparently when you fill out the form,  when mom or dad fills out the form, cause I guess they have to,  Google was asking for the last four digits of the kids  social.  They've taken that off. That was on the parental consent form.  They wanted the date of birth, where you were born.  They wanted your parents full details and it wanted the kids last four digits,  even if you're, you know, six years old.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. You know,  they said that they did this because they wanted to make sure there weren't  duplicate entries, right?  But this actually dovetails really nicely in what we were talking about earlier  about creepiness and what you can do when you have data.  When you have someone's place of birth and their time of birth,  you can make a very good guess at the first five digits of their social security  number. So if you have the last four, you could, you know,  people were saying when there was a writer at the Huffington Post who made the  point that Google could guess these children's full social security number,  given the information, giving this information. I have to say,  I think they're just making a big deal out of nothing.  I think that this was really just about Google wanting to dedupe entries,  but same time, like this is the creepy thing we're talking about. It's like,  you know, if Google has this much information about me,  what else can they deduce? We know that they're in the business of doing this.  So it makes us question whether or not they are even if,  especially when they're a six and seven year old.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It feels like it's like my first Google, you know,  Sony has my first Walkman. It's like my first Google. It's like,  we'll start your data collection now. If you don't mind.  We're just starting a little dossier on you. Don't mind us. It's not,  not a big deal.  The Google spokesperson emphasized the company has never before asked for social  security numbers. This, I think you're right, Gina.  This is the typical programmer thing where a programmer goes, Oh,  I know how we could disambiguate. Well, just, uh, what would be unique? Ah,  the last four digits of their social. Right. But they didn't think,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  they didn't think. And actually the kid will say, get an iris scan.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a good way to disambiguate. By the way, could,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  could my little camera here do an iris scan? Uh, I don't know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't know. These watch the cameras are pretty good. Does it have to,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it's probably no,  no different than the cameras that they use for that clear. Remember clear,  which is back now, I guess it went out of business.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I signed up for the one. I actually got to use it. It's cool.  The new one. The new one. No, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I set up for the old one and they, uh, they took an iris scan,  although they never used it again. Um,  they did a whole bunch of, of I highly intrusive stuff.  And I don't know where that database ended up.  They just went out of business and said, thank you very much. We'll see ya.  Bye. We got your iris, your fingerprints. They take all 10 fingers.  It was really arduous. I w did they do the same thing this time around? Uh,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  yeah, it wasn't that bad. No,  you just had to go fill out a format and do this and that.  And then you go through. It was nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The thing about for some people who know what we're talking about,  this is a, the idea. In fact, it was an idea by Steve Brill,  Steve Brill, uh, uh, with that, you know,  I guess he didn't like waiting in security lines that if you had the clear  card, you have a special, although it really wasn't a special line,  at least not in those airports I ever went to, it was actually quite embarrassing.  You'd go to the clear booth, which had no line cause nobody used it.  You'd give him your clear card and, um, they,  I can't remember how they'd verify that it's you, but maybe you,  I don't know something. I don't think they did an iris scan.  I don't think they did the fingerprints. They just give them the card. They go,  Hey, and then a lady comes over and gives you a tub.  You put all your stuff in the tub and she, she goes, she's like an icebreaker.  She goes to the head of the line. Excuse me. Out of the way. Out of the way.  Leo's got to get through. There's kids, there's ladies, there's people,  there's pregnant people, there's people in wheelchairs. Out of the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo paid for clear and you're getting to the head.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was the most embarrassing thing. I never use it again.  No wonder they went out of business. So it's the same thing now,  or do they have special lines?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Uh, it's when you're coming through customs at the end of stock. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, the customs thing is different. Both us and Canada do this. Yeah.  That was even more intrusive, but at least it's a federal government.  You could trust them.  Boy, that was dead silence. Russia says it's Russia says that Google planned the  Egyptian revolution, that Google manipulated the energy of the people,  the comments during an interview about the investment climate in Russia with a  wall street journal with Russian deputy prime minister and energy minister,  Igor Sechin.  The, I guess the problem was the initial question.  The reporter for the journal said, how can we trust Russia?  How can you convince investors to trust Russia?  Sechin said Russia's changed radically in the last 25 years.  One of the world's most stable political systems.  Then the reporter really sent in the knife. He said, well,  Mubarak probably said the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sechin said, look what they have done in Egypt.  Those highly placed managers of Google,  what manipulations of the energy of the people took place there. Wow.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. Wow.  And the hilarious thing is that puts Russia and Putin's spokesman squarely in  the same camp as Glenn Beck.  What? Glenn Beck said that Glenn Beck's been saying,  I don't want Google involved in my world affairs.  I don't want Google involved in this and that. You know,  it's the weirdest thing. Not that I listen to Glenn Beck very often. I do.  I try not to, but, uh, jeez, it's,  he's being wacky about this.  And so basically he doesn't want to see any good news out of Egypt because it's  the, it's, you know, it's,  he's anti Muslim Maraudian Arabs are going to come to your backyard next.  Jeez, Louise. So it's really strange the reaction to this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So this all comes from the fact that it was a Google executive. Right. Uh,  right. Ghanim.  Wala Ghanim. Ghanim.  Who created the Facebook page that was widely credited with being the beginning  of the revolution.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Who took a leave of absence, who sort of didn't lie,  but or took a leave of absence at first,  didn't let Google know that he was what he was doing.  And then when it was all over tweeted, you know,  I hope that Google will have me back.  And actually Google tweeted back to him sort of publicly and said that they were  very proud and they have him back. No kidding. The guy's a hero,  but it had nothing to do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I talked to Karen Wickery who actually sent that tweet and all,  you know, on behalf of the company, she, she typed it out, but it was, it was,  uh, they, they saw that immediately and said, we'll have you back.  And we're very proud of you. Good. It was a very important statement from Google.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And he did say in a 60 minutes, minutes interview that Google, uh,  put some pressure to get him out. Um, so Google was involved in getting him out,  but out of the country, out of jail, jail. That's right. Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's very interesting because,  because you have companies like Google and Facebook want to help,  but want to not get too close because you know,  then that's another reason not to have you in China and so on. Right.  And Facebook has seen that coming out of the story this week that, you know,  there are those who said that cause cause good names page on Facebook because he  was, um,  pseudonymous,  they originally killed the page because he wasn't using his real name.  And the argument is, well, no, you, he couldn't, but the argument back is, well,  that's what Facebook is.  And so there are those who are trying to argue that Facebook should enable  pseudonyms and false identities. But I'm not so sure. I think that's Facebook.  Should you, you know, you, you tell four square,  that'd be like saying the four square that you should set up so I can lie  wherever I am.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. No, that's not what it is. Yeah.  No, that's not what it is. And look,  Facebook played a role and they didn't need an anonymity. And, uh, he was,  Ghanim was very brave and, uh, and, you know,  I think that's part of the reason that he was trusted by, uh,  the people in Tahrir square. I mean, this guy paid his dues.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And it was interesting when he got out of jail,  the rumor had spread that he was out. People said,  I'm not believing it until I see it on Twitter.  Cause that's for him.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Also because he got dark, right? His Twitter had gone dark there for awhile.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So you knew that was him the night that, uh, uh, Mubarak didn't leave.  Uh, Ghanim said on, on Twitter, I'm not going to talk to the press tomorrow.  I'm going to talk to my people through my Facebook page.  And then the great moment, you know, when he said that he wanted to,  on CNN that I want to meet Mark Zuckerberg, which I'm sure he will now to thank  him. Meanwhile, we have this whole, I think rather silly argument going on  about the, you know, the, the, the triumphalist versus the curmudgeons, uh,  where, um, to some extent you've getting more, it's off. Uh,  and a few others were saying that, well, especially not glad well that, oh,  this is not the Twitter revolution and Facebook.  How revolutions happened before that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Boy, did Malcolm get it wrong. Oh boy. I mean, this is,  this is, I mean, you couldn't have a more right on the heels of Malcolm  Gladwell's New Yorker article saying Twitter just promotes the status quo.  It's not used for revolutions. And then this happens. Uh,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  there's a great cartoon of Malcolm Gladwell hits his tipping point. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, I got nothing against the guy. I love his stuff and I've read his books  and he's a great speaker. Oh, the hair is ridiculous.  The hair's a little silly, but he got it wrong. And that's, and that's the point.  And, and, uh,  the naysayers who said this Facebook Twitter stuff, it's, uh,  it's just trivia. I think after now kind of say, look,  the internet is changing the world.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's a plate of crow bones ready for them. Yeah. The internet,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  digital technology is changing the world, not always for the good,  but in general for the good,  because I think the free flow of information ultimately benefits everyone.  It promotes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The problem is that they keep on trying to, um, shoot at a made up.  Right here. They keep on saying, the triumphalists say that Twitter causes  revolution. I find me the person who says that I know no one who says that  everyone I know says this is a revolution tool. It's a people revolution.  Tools to their advantage. Right.  The people who did the revolution said these tools were valuable to us.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You still have to fill the square. And in some places like Libya,  you still have to throw your body in front of a tank.  Twitter won't do that for you, but it sure as a tool. And, uh,  and I have to think that, I mean, the fact that Egypt, uh,  cut off the internet that Libya is now cutting off the internet tells you  something that this is a tool for democratization.  We said the TV would be that. And I think in some ways it was,  certainly it certainly showed people another part of the world,  but the internet is so unmediated.  I think in the long run it's a better tool for that kind of democratization.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And an interactive, you have to have an entire community of people ready for  change. You know, it has to be, it has to be,  the community has to be ready and then the tools will work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's just pretty darn exciting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's another way to go. This is going to go away.  What the hell? We're this, this is, this is, um, side, side road day on,  on twig. Uh, I interviewed, uh, Elizabeth Eisenstein, who wrote, uh, the,  the definitive book on, on Gutenberg. In fact,  I'm reading her next book for a plug right now about,  about Gutenberg and presses divine art and fertile machine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think the Gutenberg press is a very good analog of what's happening today.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I, I believe that now, uh, more is off yelled at me and made fun of me for it,  but F them. Um, you can't mean that, you know, she said,  and I have to be careful cause I didn't quiz her enough on this,  but she said that, that the Gutenberg revolution to some extent,  skipped Arabia printing in some quarters was,  was forbidden for three centuries. The same and Siva,  but nothing got mad at me for that, that it was too simplistic.  And she's not saying very carefully that Arabia was in the middle ages.  She's just saying that the impact was different, different. And in a sense,  what's happening now is that they stayed in some measure in oral tradition,  the impact of pretty, wasn't the same.  And now their Gutenberg press is Twitter and Facebook. Yeah.  And, and that when people are empowered to speak,  look at the amazing things that happen. It happened with the reformation.  It's happening again with tools that enable the public to be public,  which is a plug for my book, but what the hell? Well, this is the subject.  It's a great time. Yeah. Yeah. Public.  It's what Gina said before about, about, you know,  being a great time to be alive for Watson. It's a great time to be,  to see not only machines empowered, but people empowered.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I feel very fortunate that early in my career as a journalist, I said,  I think I want to cover technology. Boy, that was a hell of a beat.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  For me, it was like, Oh, this web thing is kind of interesting.  I'm really glad I said that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Damn. I can't claim any prescience, but boy, I feel lucky. We are,  we have ringside seats and everyone who watches Twitter is ringside seats to a  world is changing so rapidly.  I can't wait to talk to Ray Kurzweil in a couple of weeks. It's going to be great.  Time for our tool tip and number of the week. Let's start with Gina,  Gina Trapani and her tip of the week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Sure. My tip this week is actually a little bit of a tool or all of us,  or at least I'm going to start getting together via our income tax returns soon,  which is always a thrill. But there's a really cool data visualization. You can,  you can, that shows you where your tax dollars go.  So you go to datavizchallenge.org. There's a click on,  see an example.  You can enter in the year and how much you paid in taxes and then where that  money went in a really neat interactive visualization that lets you zoom around  and see exactly, you know, what, where your money's going.  And this data comes from what we pay for.com,  which was a data visualization, not, not, that didn't have anything to do with  Google. Google was so impressed with it though. They started this data,  this challenge that said, Hey, let's look at, you know, let's,  let's look at different ways that we can see,  you get insights into where your tax dollars go.  So this kind of goes back to what we were talking about earlier.  When you have the data, you know,  what are the interesting ways that you can look at it and insights you can get  into it. So yeah, Leo, you've got it up on the screen there.  Like you can say in 2010, if you paid $10,000 of federal income tax,  you can see that 2,500 went to national defense, 2,300 income security,  2,500 to social security,  and it breaks it down into a really cool interactive graph. So

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  look at the size of the interest floating away. Holy cow.  That is, that is really a great, great,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  really is.  So if you want to have a discussion about the economy and where we're headed in  the spending, this is the kind of data and making data available to people.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's matters. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I thought this was really,  really cool. And that data is challenged.org.  They're asking for more different and interesting ways to look at these numbers,  to break these numbers down. So,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  so you can put in the numbers yourself and come up with a new visualization for

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  it. Right, right. Yeah. On this visit,  you can change the year and your filing status and your income, but you,  but they're actually looking for different ways to visualize.  So this is kind of a bunch of, you know, sort of vibrating bubbles,  but they're looking for a kind of other ways that,  that you can look at tax data like this. Here's one from slate.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Click the green play button, the animation of the data. This is, this is neat.  Data visualizations are fascinating. These are,  this is unemployment statistics, by the way.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I want to learn it so I can teach journalists. It's so important.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's so important. I just went to the Edward Tufty's one day course.  I did. It was amazing. He was here in San Diego. Yeah,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  he was up here and I missed it. Completely worth it. Really worth it. Yeah. Great.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Really good day of thinking through a whole lot.  And you get his books with it. You get all of his books.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So what is it? Is it, is it a hands-on or a possibilities session?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's a possibility session. So he's a really good speaker. It's a one day deal.  You get all of his books and he basically shows you examples of good  visualizations. What are the characteristics of a good visualization?  But very engaging. It was definitely not, it doesn't feel like a lecture.  You're reading and looking and seeing examples throughout, throughout. And I mean,  all day I was just writing pages and pages of notes of ideas that I had for  ThinkUp and other, and other apps. But it really,  it makes you really zero in on what makes a good visualization and how  important visualizations are and how important it is to be truthful and honest  to them and how important it is to show data in the right way to tell the whole  story. So yeah, I highly recommend the class.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This I've always loved this poster. My dad has this on as well. Napoleon's March.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah. So Moscow and the war of 1812.  Yeah. The best data is ever made in the history of data visualization.  Yeah. Amazing. Amazing image. Yeah. We looked at that one actually for quite a long time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, that's so neat. I'm so jealous.  Yeah. I recommend it. He comes every year. He comes,  he comes to the big cities every year, travels a lot and his work is what the,  the visual display of quantitative information, something like that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. That's one of his books. He's got, he's got a few books out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow. I'm jealous. I've always wanted to see him.  Your number of the week, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think I'll do this one. 304,899,  which after two weeks is how many followers Howard Stern has.  How many 304,000? Yeah. Well, I'll ramp up pretty quickly.  The reason I mentioned it is because he doesn't, he, he, he, he, he,  he made fun of Twitter. He wouldn't do Twitter.  I went on the air trying to convince him to Twitter. Why would I do that?  Why would I give it away? And suddenly before he went on Letterman,  he decided to do it that night and then he's been on and, and Stern being Stern,  I love what he did next is that he was sitting at home, uh,  private parts. His movie was coming on. That's not a plug for the book. And, um,  uh, next thing you know, he was giving the alternative soundtrack,  the explanation track, uh,  the DVD extra real to it as it was going on using Twitter.  And it's really cool because you could basically go watch the movie and kind of  play that back.  And it was a neat new use of Twitter that I quite like. That's neat.  I took to it quickly. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's really kind of cool.  But while I'm on the numbers subject, I want to, I don't know if I plugged him  last week, but I want to mention to everybody, all of our friends at twig,  if you haven't started following or looking at Andy Carvin, A C A R V I M.  Yeah, he's great. He's magnificent. He's a NPR, uh,  social media strategist who has been tweeting the revolutions and adds real  journalistic value, finding the good people, uh,  pointing out what's not confirmed yet, asking questions.  He has about 27,000 followers and I'm amazed that, yeah, it is.  And now the problem is that A C A R V I N you will take over your feed  in the midst of something going on. So some people are making a list.  There's nothing but him. Oh, that's fine. But he is Carvin list.  He is quite amazing.  And I really recommend because I think that he's creating a new sense of what  journalism and news are in a world of live feeds.  So A Carvin.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And curation. He is, he's kind of the epitome of a curation.  Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I started following after you mentioned him last week, Jeff,  and I feel way more informed. He really is doing some good stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think I got, I got his name from Jay Rosen.  Remember when Jay published that list of journalists to follow on Twitter and I  think Andy, Andy was one of them. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I taught Regis had a tweet.  Not exactly momentous,  but it was very interesting to watch somebody who's been 60 years in show  business suddenly have an epiphany.  This year, just as I was leaving, so I hadn't really had a chance to talk about  it till now, but, uh, we went up to his, I have a little clip of it.  I could show you. We went up to his office and, um, I sat down next to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You give him a message and they tweet.  Have you ever sent a text message? Okay. So it's kind of like that,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  except instead of going just to one person, when you tweet,  it goes to everybody who's following you. You got a lot of followers.  You've got hundreds of thousands of people who watch your Twitter account.  So if you type something on Twitter, all of those people will see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who's been talking to these people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to be a part of this is the webpage.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I showed him and you know, it was interesting.  This was the day that he announced that he was leaving the show.  And so he tweeted, actually his first tweet tweet was quite good.  It was made a joke and he said,  I just announced that I'm leaving the show and David Letterman called and said,  congratulations. What the hell does that mean? And, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what the hell is that? What the hell is Leo? What does that mean? And, uh, but,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  but there was this moving moment. I don't know. I haven't,  this is the first time I've seen the video.  There was a moving moment where he said, I said, now if you click mentions,  these are people talking back to you.  And he saw all these hundreds and hundreds of, he says,  is this happening right now? I said, yeah, click it again. And there was more.  He called his wife. He said, joy, you gotta go to Twitter. They're,  they're talking.  He'd never had this kind of direct connection to the audience.  And it was actually, um, it was very interesting to watch this very savvy guy,  but he's been 60 years in broadcasting getting this experience.  By the way, the guy can't type for

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  like they sped it up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A lot. I was, this is an hour's worth of typing. And then I said, watch this.  I said, now click tweet, a little joke, little light, a little levity,  cause you're using the Regis and Kelly account Regis underscore and underscore  Kelly. Kelly also tweets in this account.  Well that's why I said our show. Right. So I would put a space and then a dash R  so they know that this came from you. Now, okay. Now, now,  now this is the chance you have before you press that button that says tweet,  just review it, make sure that you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I announced by leaving our show today, David, a little bit just called.  He said, congratulations. I don't know if that's good or bad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that's a perfect tweet. Yeah, I do too. Now press the press the,  click the tweet button.  Where is that tweet button? It's on the screen there.  So you've just moved the mouse there and you press the mouse.  He picks up the mouse. He's gonna, he's trying to click the screen.  This guy, I'm sure he's never used a computer. Never the less. That's the,  that's the comedy.  But the thing that I thought was really moving is just this, this impact,  this sudden light goes on in his head. Oh my God, these are the, this is my,  I'm talking to my people.  That's so great.  It was really a neat moment, but that is not my, uh,  my tool of the week.  And I'll do this very quickly cause we want to make room for a TNT,  which is coming up next. But, uh, you know, as you know,  there was a terrible earthquake in New Zealand.  Many of our listeners are down there. We wish you all the best in Christ's  church. And here is, uh, as again, tweet, tweet, Google's done this, uh,  time and time again. Uh, they did it in Haiti and they've done it again.  The person finder. Uh, if you're looking for someone,  they're tracking about 9,400 records. You can enter the person's name.  If you know where someone is, this is, you know, this isn't internet.  This is a 21st century bulletin board,  but it's amazingly effective and it's very powerful.  You can embed the tool on your site. And I just, uh,  I think Google needs credit deserves credit for, uh, for doing this. This is,  um, app spot Christ church dash 2011 dot person dash finder dot app spot.com.  And I think it was done by Google, right? I believe it was done by Google.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think it was. Yeah. At this point, they probably just have a, what this app,  you know, you just roll out. Right? Like, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That that's okay. I don't know if I talked about this in the show before,  but the head of privacy consumer protection in Germany said that using  geographic, uh, location and face recognition is taboo. It's ever,  it's forever bad, but imagine how you could use it in an earthquake to say,  Oh, so and so was spotted. We know, we know who's there. You know, it's, it's,  it's incredible what technology could do in those cases to put people back  together. Yeah. Yeah. Really, really amazing. Jeff Jarvis,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the author of what would Google do? Leo, what would Google do? It is a,  he's got a nice hat from Canada. It's available now in bookstores.  Yeah, you do look a little Elmer Fuddish.
