What do you do? I disappeared a  Stacey is getting her UPS delivery  But she will be back. She's in her new house  We're very excited and we thought it'd be better to start the show without her so we can make a big deal about her  Coming back to the show because it feels like you know a theme song for we have a theme song for her waiting  As we wait, shall we play the waiting theme song? Yes, you should play it. This is  adapted  from the  giz whiz show  Stacey

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They apparently didn't know where her house was so I  Think she doesn't know where her office is  She's lost her way back lost of the mansion. It's a giant house and she can't figure out where her office is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm watching this is Stacey's new room. She says for those of you who  Ladies gentlemen, it's Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's back  Wow, sorry, we thought you got lost on the way back

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I know I had to sign and show someone where to put it. So oh that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It always takes me a long time to show someone where to put it  Was it a bookshelf? What is you? What did you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was part of a water heater. Oh  So, yeah  Wow, he's installing it. Yeah, not a water heater a water purifier

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So your fire very important. Are you on? Well, I am yes very important. You want to purify that water?  We do soft water

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  First off soft water. It's better for your clothes your hair  Yes, oh how how how do you do that how you reduce your salt

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just a little soft  Yeah, it's still is there a is there a titration on the salt? It's so weird  I don't really understand how this works Stacey  I don't even because we put in giant bags giant bags of salt and it goes through them  I don't know where the salt goes because it's not in the why hope it's not in the water  Otherwise, it'd be making salt water. So where's the salt going? And how does it work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've never understood this and Stacey's gonna know, you know, she's gonna don't know I have no idea about the chemical reaction

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He just showed me where to go. He just showed me what to do to like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you can you go down and get them and have them explain to us, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's a deal you got your osmosis here  See, so you got on one side of the membrane there you got your salt the other side of the membrane there  You got the water and then it  The salt goes in the drain and the water goes in your mouth

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I see a video here from Gary the water guy  Explaining how you imagine being Gary the water guy. Okay, first of all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the farthest we've ever gone from this week in Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, Stacey the show has actually begun. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Figured that yeah, I assume okay. We decided to begin it and let you make a big entrance

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't mind because I figured we wouldn't start talking about Google for a while  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Explain it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we have that too because we're on well and you want to have clean water  But you also want to have good tasting water. And yeah, it's nice to have a lot of processing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's going on ever in the rest of the world, but yes, that's yeah, I know Gary the water guy Gary the water guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's explaining you drink the water you leave the saw what's complicated about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Someone someone said something in the chat about  Membranes or resins or yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of something the salt draws the the heavy metals or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there like an ionization where the chemical?  Is all this pulling it's yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a mineral tank a control valve a brine tank

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I'm gonna speak all the people who know this stuff which is like 90% of our audience  Yeah, yeah, I'm screaming at this you idiots you idiots. Can we get Gary the water guy as an advertiser Lisa?  He could be really great on his show

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Alright  moving right along

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very important. No. No, this is important  Yeah, we get our monthly the salt delivery. You got to be there for that to be a good bring in the salt with you  Soft water too. Yeah, I didn't know I could  Hair yeah. Well, it doesn't rinse, you know, it's soap doesn't rinse as well, but it is better

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  SLS is in your soap anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  SOS is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  SLS is what's that?  What are they sodium lauryl sulfate sulfate? Yeah, that's what makes things suds up. I thought you didn't want that  Yeah, you don't want that. But if you use shampoos and stuff without it  It doesn't  No, no you don't want them oh you don't know if you use shampoos without it you shouldn't have as much of a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see but then your shampoo just lies flat on your hair. It doesn't foam up. It's still cleaning though

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're just scrubbing bubbles era of people and my skin doesn't feel clean it feels slimy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the weirdest

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Conversation we've ever had on this show. All right, Google had a smart home summit this morning  That was  Deathly boring. Go ahead. You tell us how exciting it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was last night. I thought this was great  They did three of these and so I don't know about you, but I watched the APAC one. Where is she that was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is your beat

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and it was great. Oh you should show Kevin's story. Okay about Chromebooks  Stacey on IOT Kevin wrote it up for me though. So tell it but you while I'm showing his story

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the new works with Google program

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, so what Google Google announced one big thing and basically gave us updates on a lot of other things  okay, so the one big thing was that your Google the  Sorry that they would create a home button or a home platform on your Android in the upcoming version of Android  Where you press the home button or the power button and  You get access to all of your smart home gear

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is the biggest so newest thing that this is sort of the way it works with Apple if you have a  iPad or an Apple TV or an iPhone if you have an Apple device  I don't think your computer can be a hub but everything else can be it becomes the center and what's kind of nice with the  Apple solution is  Both your Apple TV and your iPad can do it there's not doesn't have to be just one  Right. Is it Google very similar to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we don't know yet. This is gonna be an Android. Is it Android 11? Is that where we are? I think yes  Yes, Android 11 are yeah  and  I'm assuming they're gonna if this works out for them and as they play with the  The design what are those the little tiles or whatever they're calling them?  The tiles or whatever they're calling them widgets the widgets the tiles  We'll start to see those shrink. I mean are they gonna put it in like where OS who cares?  No one's using that right, but maybe one day when they have Fitbit, they'll do something better

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So of course those of us who use Google home hubs the screens  I presume those will also be used that way, right? Well, those already have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what you're gonna see on your phone is the statements that you can actually drill down to this type of thing  You see on the phone, but what this or sorry in the display  But the cool thing is you haven't you've only had voice and then your apps you had to dig forever to get to that  And it was stupid because like if you were in bad or something, you'd be like, oh my gosh  I want to turn off my lights without waking my spouse and now you can just hit a button on your phone and just get  There which is nice

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that was the biggest news the rest of it was pretty  Pretty lame in the sense that we just got a bunch of updates  So and maybe we'll see more from the developer side  But you know, they talked a lot about the local SDK which we are very excited about but we've known about it since  Last year and then in April they kind of started rolling it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We saw the SDK the software developers kit is used by third parties to integrate with Google home stuff  Yes, why you're smiling at me as if no, I'm smiling because I'm like, yes translate. That's right. I have to I'm sorry  That's just my job. It's good and they have a number of partners including Phillips and tile  GE casa are these some of these I've not heard of are these all the big players Nanoleaf?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know life. These are all lights in my  Yeah, there are is well tile than tile tiles not a light and casas in a light and homogeneous isn't a light  Casa might be a light because they've got they do have bulbs and they also have the outlets but these these particular use cases  One I think Google focused on lighting first because it's an area where latency really  Causes problems when you're like turn on the light and you're waiting for two seconds you notice, right?  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's really annoying actually  Yeah, well actually more annoying is when I turn out the lights because I'm going to bed  I say turn off the lights and then sometimes it doesn't work  So I have to wait until it succeeds and yes, it's just two seconds. It feels like an eternity  Why did I do this again? I could have just hit a switch. I'm used to just flipping a switch, right?  Yeah, except that it's more lights than one switch could control. So oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like you in the chat. Yeah is saying that you can actually try the new feature now with the Android 11 beta

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's one of our change log points, but I do have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The latest talking about it so I was like, oh if you have it I do have it so let me so this is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Beta 2 of Android 11, which just they part of the public beta. They just came out today  Which is probably the last beta before the release the thinking goes. So how would I do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it in the settings hold your power button down for a second?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How fancy schmancy  Okay. Oh device controls loading recommendations now. We don't have probably anything here, but if I were home  This is where I'd see my hue lights  And anything else I had in this list of things, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay  So I can add controls  Yes, oh, you know what this is interesting it's seeing the stuff at home  So so there's my nest cameras  There's my hello right now and turn off some lights. Well, that's not I don't see any lights  So what happens if you click on the like a camera? Let's see what happens. Let's go to the hello doorbell  Choose controls to access or my turn them all on  So these are using that right now they use nest aware, but that's a Google product. So now it's added them  so let me just repeat now that I have those buttons on here if I press and hold the  The on off button for a second I get the usual the power locked down emergency  I also get a Google Google Pay  Card, but then I get these buttons from my home and if I tap front door, I don't know what what happens  It should give me it is it's gonna give me a picture of the front door

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's pretty cool. Isn't that nice? And if you had lights it would let you automatically turn it on  Give you a slider there's somebody my house

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's really so instead of having to use the nest app now  I can have that on the front and what else can I if it were lights that have a slider or controls that would change?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mm-hmm our blinds or any of these other things?  Thermostat this is much needed  Yeah, it is. That's that's why I'm like  It's the biggest news from the thing and probably the most interesting for most people because it does it makes it much more like home  The home app in Apple which just you know, you touch it you're like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's clever to put it on the power button because that that is a quick that's quick access  I don't have to I don't have to launch anything. I you know, it literally is one button and there it is  I think that's actually very nice  Apple sort of is like that you slide over and you can get in the widget page, but  And maybe now that Apple's adding widgets in the next version of iOS  There'll also be a widget to do that, but that's cool. Can I add widgets to do this too? I wonder if there's a oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why would you want to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I guess you're right. It's so quick to get to that. I don't need to have it on the screen all the time  I mean you know, I mean a lot of these have widgets but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, but then you've got a you once you get to a point with all your widgets. You're like, oh crap scrolling scrolling  There it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is much faster. I think yeah, you're right. I love this  Boom  Magic, okay. That's part of the SDK or that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's it's actually very easy for developers to do. It's going to oh  That's that's the local stuff. Sorry. Can I have routines as well here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could I have buttons for like turn off the house at night and stuff like that? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't know. I would hope so. I haven't I haven't downloaded the beta yet. So I haven't played with it just yet  Sorry, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was recording my show I can drag him around that's nice. So that's a little early change log. Do I have one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you have routines already for your Google home stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What would I say turn on the front door camera then turn on the backyard camera then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you would have like good night. So your door would lock your lights would go out. See I don't have the door lock

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have hue lights  So I could be to the hue hub could if I were home would it see the hue hub

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you should be able to control and set up a routine for all of your hue lights to turn them all off when you say  Google that would be better than saying it out loud

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I could say hey gee now turn off the lights. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Know but good night turns all of them  Well, I have like six things that happen when I go to sleep yeah, so the thermostat goes down the door lock. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We used to have a nest thermostat. I didn't install it when we moved  I just some of this stuff. It'd be nice for instance if it could make sure the garage doors were closed  If it could turn off the porch light turn off the lights in the house lock the front door  I don't have a lock that does that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm nervous about a Berlin my cue on Google or Chamberlain my cue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're talking about my garage door. No, uh-huh. Should I know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I appreciate that's one of my favorite devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Show her why do you keep showing me? I'm not interesting Jeff wake up. Thank you. I'm boring  Jeff is funny switches. Yeah switches which work

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so the my cue is a garage door opener the usefulness of that is  It ties into Google. So yes, you could tell it to make sure your garage doors closed  But it's it sends you the alert if you leave your garage door open  So you can set a timer like after ten minutes if it's still open just send me a notification and you'll be like  Hey your garage doors open and then you can remotely close it  Which is really handy for a lot of people who like worry if they left the garage door

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd have to replace so I have the ones that came with the house and I have to replace those

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't have to replace them. It's actually a little device you stick on the top of your talks as long as it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not link compatible. So it'll probably work. Yeah, then you're fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's long as it's like 1996 and older or in younger. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's this called? The the Chamberlain my cue

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's one sensor. You need one sensor for your door your garage door and you just tape that on there and then there's a little  Router hub that you stick on your garage door opener itself. Nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I've got two so they have to get two or I guess you you would just buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the hubs and then two sensors. Yeah, that makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I can have actions I  Can have I can have scripts?  Why didn't you let just open the door for the guy?  Yeah, see Stacy see you could have just open the door. You had to show him where it goes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it goes down in the storage area with all of the house accoutrements

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that the the son who ran for president in succession I think it is  All right, cool that's Chamberlain which makes as I thought made garage door openers  But now I see they do so much more  My cue smart home. Well, thank you, Stacey. See we missed you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anything else you can buy more things? Well, the only other big news from the Google smart home stuff  So we're excited about local SDK  That they just talked about it a little bit  They also did their smart home entertainment devices that they're integrating and giving a deeper integration into Google home with like  So you can cast to more things and more things can you can control things on certain entertainment devices and then the other really?  useful thing that people will care about is  when Google did  Transferred away from works with nest to works with Google they I  Don't know if y'all remember but it basically took away the ability of like the nest thermostat and other devices to talk directly to other  Devices in the home, right?  So a lot of people lost presence awareness and that made them sad  Google is now bringing back presence awareness. So if devices in your home are like  No one's here. It'll tell those devices and then it will automatically  Turn your cameras on lower your thermostat whatever nice needs to happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that is the other thing and is that required Android phones to know that your home or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's it's based on the devices it's based on the Google devices in your home so if they hear you or see you then  Yeah, I mean it's like the PIR sensor in the nest or I guess if your cameras are on okay, maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we see we don't have cameras in the house for that  you know obvious reasons, but  Okay. Now did they announce any new hardware at all? No, no hardware. We were sad. Yeah  They did they talk about the chip Alliance at all cuz that's the they did it was so lame it was basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was basically what Apple did at WWDC which was like hey chip. We're part of it  it's still happening and it's coming the end of this year and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember we were skeptical that Apple Google and Amazon  Could ever agree on anything but this was the idea was unifying their at their connected home all efforts

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and this is frustrating because  There's so many questions if you're a developer you're like, okay. How are they gonna handle like device onboarding?  How are they gonna handle things like talking to assistance?  People really want to know this and no one  Google Apple all the working groups they're figuring this out  But they're not allowed to talk about anything Google and Apple and Amazon are locking it down  So all we know is it's still expected by the end of this year before the end of this year  The first certification your first devices then come out next year. So that's where we are. That's where we've been. Yeah  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We missed you Stacy for many reasons, but one was when the Apple chip stuff was coming out  It was Stacy should be here. Oh, it's Apple silicon with the arm stuff. Yeah, was that it? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, there's a this is really not this is what hey, it's a little closer to our topic than water softeners  one of the  Technology Leo technology  One of the things that we were talking about earlier on Windows weekly kind of stunned me  Which is that I thought because Microsoft has been promoting Windows on arm and working hard that  Windows would somehow be able to coexist with Apple silicon at least run an emulation or run, you know somehow and  Paul told me, you know, they really shouldn't call it Windows on arm  It's Windows on Qualcomm and apparently and I don't know how much but a lot of the code is reliant on  features unique to Qualcomm's arm  Implementation which of course would mean that it's completely incompatible with anything Apple does  So, I don't know if you're familiar with that at all, but you are a chip expert  And not unfortunate. Yeah, I thought that was that's gonna be interesting. We'll talk about it on Mac break weekly, obviously, but I  People been worried that Apple will not be supporting Windows very well in future and this may mean they can't support it at all  Which would be really odd. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like through a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Deal. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, okay  And it would I think it'd be a problem because a lot of people are willing to use  Macs as long as they can run a few Microsoft tools or they can run Windows and emulation and you know somehow do that  Microsoft said they would support containerization  I'm sorry Apple said they would support containerization, but those would only work obviously with arm compatible Apple silicon compatible programs  It's not emulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's they they will push for that  I mean Microsoft is running arm based chips in their servers. Obviously, they're not their servers are not running windows  but  There's a huge effort that arm is seated for the last decade to get  code for again mostly enterprise and server oriented stuff onto the arm instruction set I  Don't think Windows. I don't think that's gonna be too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let me this actually then this is really the question for you  Because you're really up on this we know that there's two different kinds of arm licenses  There's the the actual license of the arm designs and then there's the arm architecture license  Which allows you to you know, basically licensing compatibility with arm  Arm is not arm, right just because a chip is an arm compatible chip  That's there seems to be some big differences in in arm implementations

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, so what happens is arm is what you're licensing is the arm instruction set and that's the commands that help  it's how the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chip talks to the the firmware is it does it come down to things like the registers the number the size and the  assembly language instructions that the that are required for arm compatibility is that kind of what we're talking about I  Think it's it's lower level than that. Is it? Oh, so it's microcode

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's in this is where like because I'm not I don't code so this is like it's  This is how the chip deals with like  memory and accessing like sending  Like IO in data back and forth. Okay, and how then that talks that firmware talks to  Now you do have to optimize all the way up the stack for an instruction set, right? Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's definitely different instruction set because that's the whole point of arm is it's a risk right instruction set  but  It must be so it's that's interesting. So it includes IO  It includes a whole lot more  Apple's gonna do its own custom systems on a chip

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, what well the difference between an arm like a traditional arm license and an architecture license is  You in arm actually just introduced a couple weeks ago a custom  design architecture too  So that's and I don't know if that's what Apple's do is it but it lets you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So basically you can the core license which lets you actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Use the cores you take yeah, you take the core and you pop it on and like it  But if you're Apple if you're Google if you're gonna use something much more flexible than that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Architecture lets you really tweak everything and then the one the new one that you mentioned that came out last year arm  Flexible access it gives unlimited access  To all of arms intellectual property. Basically, it's a license

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Take what you want leave the rest. That's that's not it. No, it's not flexible access. This was this year  That was like last year. Okay. Yeah, that was last there. It basically lets you design  They you take the blocks of memory and you can actually design and allocate  You you're actually designing your core

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you have an architectural license, this is the Wikipedia article you have to fully comply with the arm architecture  In any cores you design so Apple has that applied micro broadcom  Marvel deck Intel and video Qualcomm and Samsung  So I would presume anything designed by those companies would be interoperable

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, so so yes, those all have to run on the base  That's basically arms way of saying hey any software that runs on arm still has to run on your own machines  And that's true that that is the architectural license you can change some things but you can't change it so it doesn't work  that's yeah, but what they're doing is they're  they're fine-tuning like they're L2 cache and right there they're creating like software that'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Create a fabric on the chip and so maybe Paul misunderstood what Windows on arm their compatibility level because  If if it's designed to run with a snapdragon a  Qualcomm chip it should be compatible with any other arm architecture licensees. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't know what he I just don't know what he's talking about and I don't know how  I've never more research about those. I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't either but I do care about Apple and I'm curious because it would be a big deal if  Windows would not run at all on Apple silicon  All right, let's move on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So my my Twitter feed went crazy for about an hour today  With the report the Twitter is looking to hire someone to work on subscriptions. Oh  What is that people went nuts for like an hour then it died off  There was the hottest thing going and Twitter stock went up and would you pay for tweets or is it a patreon?  All of this because of just a job listing  problem, my guess is that it's probably  part of the Twitter open platform working group thing and it's an infrastructure they need  It does not quite a little loved it 10% 10%. Yes. Oh new revenue stream. Oh, oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does Twitter it can make money? I mean it has made money. Yeah  Not on a regular basis  Advertisers have you ever promoted a tweet paid to promote a tweet? No, can you yeah, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook I know their business model

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I thought there was advertising. There's no that is  Okay, I see to promote. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and this is promoted. Of course. Yes  No, I haven't ever done that. Maybe we might have I don't know  People do things around here. I have no idea what they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've never seen a tweet promotion, but I was just curious if they were effective or I get you know what I get

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get tweet ads all the time on the New York Times. Oh, well good. I'm glad it's going somewhere  It is going somewhere. Yeah, it's just like kind of like I you can save your money on me  I don't ever see those I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Get furniture ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I  Tell you what I like the idea of a subscription not because it's a revenue stream  But if you had to pay even a dollar that would eliminate 90% of the bots wouldn't it?  Well, I wouldn't imagine it's for all of Twitter. I would imagine it's for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo's  Stacy Stacey on iot's premium Twitter feed. What would that be? Is it some stack? Is it some stacker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, but I don't want to create I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What would that mean? Where's my marketing engine? I don't want to like limit the number of people who see my tweets  I don't know. I mean, this is all good. This is all guesswork. It's just a job listed

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was gonna say my tweets are not worth anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really Stacey Stacey buck up here have a higher view view of your personal worth your tweets are valuable

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You are valuable. I am valuable. My work is valuable  I'm just looking at my last two tweets or something and I'm like, hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're basically marketing for my thing marketing for my thing  They're basically marketing for my thing marketing for my thing stories  sponsor  I'm waiting. I'm looking for like basically the Stacey tweets that are like I am sad because it's raining  Tweeted a dog that was wearing a mask. Oh, don't need to pay for I'd pay for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I pay for dogs wearing masks more than I would anything else. You're like more than all your stories

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, that's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so you still have a free Twitter so what do you get if you're gonna so what do you get we don't know cuz

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's some job listing. This is so spec spec. What is that? So speculative as hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, but it could be like so it could be like some stack or it could be like patreon  Those are the two speculations going on. So you pay out of the goodness of your heart you paid that's the patreon

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You pay to have a relationship with a writer you pay a subscription  So sub stack and I've talked to them actually about doing subscription based content for me. And basically it's yeah people  Pay to get articles  From me because they think I'm in my opinion is worth, you know six dollars a month or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a possibility raised by the chat room that the word subscription does not mean what you think it means because oh  Twitter also has a subscriptions page  Where you can view product subscriptions and so there's something there's some other subscription stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That well, but this is the stock market went up on something. No one understands. Yeah, isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well what the stock market assumed was Oh revenue revenue. Yeah  It can really cap it's not doing a great job capitalizing on its potential

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's what they could they do a subscription to their API feed that could help you like see things coming  That because they had talked about that's a great idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well the whole Griffin thing. I mean what what Jack talked about? Well, how long ago now nine months ago now  Was that that it's not unlike the WordPress model where you have an underlying  Open source thing and then you can build on top of it and Twitter can build on top of it  But others could be I could build a curated Twitter on there where I guarantee to find you only smart tweets  I find you the best tweets there are I just find  The golden platinum tweets there are and you want my tweet curation. Is that worth money?  Or Stacey's has said the data  Is there data they have to sell that I could I could subscribe to that's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Alerts. Yeah, I mean Twitter is like a massive sentiment analysis pool. Oh boy. Yeah people people right now everybody's down

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah good for you there'd be a lot to get out of it you're right  We were in the early very very early days Twitter had a feature called track  Do you remember that where you could track a topic and it would notify you the topics are back  No, but you could track it  You could set a tracker and you would get notified if somebody was talking about something you were interested in  And they took it out and in fact  This was a this I met Steve Gilmore this way. There was a bear hug camp where they wanted to  A lot of people were involved in this  To try to get track back because that was really one of the most valuable things Twitter was doing  So you didn't have to read the stream you could just say hey, let me know if somebody's talking about something  I'm interested in maybe they that I'd pay for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah, and I actually remember because when they had that we tried to set up a  Ambient notification or  Stories that we wanted to follow right, you know, so if anyone's tweeting about arm. Yeah, I'm sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think almost what was all over it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, actually it was me you  Was my idea to tie it to a light bulb I was gonna say did you have a little glowing orb that would turn red when they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Were talking about arm?  possibly  There was a device very I had this was early days. Yeah long time little printer  No, there was a little glowing orb that you could set up  Right to to light up in different like if the weather was gonna rain or like the price went somewhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was the name of that? I don't know but you have it there probably somewhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If we hadn't probably threw it out in one of the great purges

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Today you could do that with a hue light bulb and an API call. It's true. Yeah exactly. Their API is more accessible  It's easy. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's take a little break lots more to talk about  I'm gonna let you guys choose though because there are so many stories to pick something you're interested in maybe uber buying postmates or  Twitter says the last one so the next one's on the stage Twitter says it's gonna add an edit button to tweets when any when everyone wears a mask  That's pretty much all there is to say about that  And and actually I think a big story that's gonna be bigger all the time is what happens when you're buying  to the academic year and since we have an  Academic with us a fake one a phony a poser epidemic. Hey  You got an endowed chair, man. That's the best way. Why are you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

They would have immediately said no you got here address data is all wrong  It's not unusual 30% of all customer data goes bad every year  It's like it's like the carton of milk. You gotta you gotta get fresh milk  Your customer data is going bad  Melissa that's their job. They've been doing it for 35 years  What's happened over time is their data has become richer and richer and richer and they are able to do all sorts of great things  You can verify addresses emails phone numbers and names in real time. So people make mistakes customers enter incorrect data human error  Records get duplicated the Melissa and there's a lot of ways to use it. You can do it on-prem as a web service  You could have it  Use secure FTP to upload it you could use software as a service. There's an API a lot very commonly for instance  Customer service centers will have the Melissa API running so when they're entering  addresses as the customer tells them it auto fills it and  And that saves huge amounts of time and make sure everything is accurate  Another example is in a shopping cart  But you know typo you say  Tallahassee instead of Tennessee  Melissa will find it and correct it  Plus you can add demographic information to your records property and mortgage data marital status social media handles  Melissa fills in the gap by adding emails and phone numbers. You can identify current customers  Which allows you to find new prospective customers through Melissa's prospect database  Incorrect error costs you money and could cost you with a customer  Match and consolidate your records. They're matching into diptyp duplication tools help you uncover merge and purge  Hard to find duplicate records for an accurate 360 degree view of your business  Their flexible deployment options mean you can set it up to use it any way you want  In fact, the best thing you could do is go to Melissa  melissa.com slash twit and try the  Developer portal you could try the API directly live  24 7 the sandbox is there so you get a sense of what Melissa can do  it couldn't be easier and I want to assure you that they  Constantly undergo independent security audits to make sure that your data is safe that their data is safe  They are committed to data security privacy and compliance requirements  They have the utmost dedication to your data security by implementing strong controls and safeguards  While they're processing your data over 10,000 businesses trust the address experts you should too  Bad data is as bad as sour milk.

Oh, yes, we are  I think there's a at least in our local schools here in Petaluma, but I guess this is nationwide  I'm sure it's happening in Washington State and in New Jersey  The local schools are completely perplexed. They have all the kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's if it's the third Tuesday of the month and  The full moon is out the kid will be there in the morning, but not for lunch  If it's the it's just it's confusing as hell to people. That's that's just that's that's elementary school  And how we got a land to work. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so yeah, my daughter school sent us a  30 minute YouTube video an 11 page PowerPoint  And then like a 20 page document  to explain the first half of the plan and I'm just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then of course, there's the teachers who those the people are most worried

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are the teachers? Oh, yeah, and they just get sloughed off and forgotten. Well, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The teachers unions are making sure that they're not gonna get sloughed off and forgotten  Because you got to get the union consent before you do this  I wonder what's gonna happen and professors at Georgia Tech  Have launched a revolt  over reopening in the fall saying the current plan threatens the health well-being and education of students staff and faculty

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because  Georgia Tech is not going to require the wearing of masks. Oh, it's all about masks all about masks  It's it's it's the anti science anti intellectualism Georgia Tech and can't be anti science. I'm sorry. Tell me I know but there's a  So we're all in solidarity with Georgia Tech. What's their mascot? I might know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are all  Bulldogs. Yeah, I want to say Bulldogs. Yeah  Wow, that's interesting now at least here in Petaluma  And I bet you it's we are all buzzes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we are all buzzes we stand on our jackets with the yellow jackets of Georgia Tech

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's gotta be crazy here in Petaluma  Similar they've got you know, mainly what the schools are saying is we don't know and we're gonna in fact  They've just said now we're gonna be online until it's safe not to be online which is that's reasonable

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  None of us know we don't know we are totally it. I mean we have to adapt to what were  we

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have to adapt to the situation you're in the problem is it's become politicized which is really too bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if all the more so today after Pence was up there saying the schools will open. Yeah. Yeah, that's Donald Trump's fault

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Trump says it's a democratic plot  How dare you politicize the school reopening he says  Yeah, it's a plot to stay alive to stay alive. So I don't I just I worry  I mean, this is actually I think not the first time we've talked about was it Jay Rosen or  It was somebody who was talking about this is gonna be a crisis come this fall and he was saying this in  April come this fall for for higher education

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is and it's all over the map  A lot of schools are insisting that everything's gonna be fine and that students are less susceptible  Of course the age of the of the hospitalized is going down  At my school, I think we don't have an official word at all yet. So we're still don't know  We don't know what to plan  But my presumption my knock on wood hope is that as few people as possible on campus

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  now Bill Gates  Yeah, Bill Gates says it's all social media's fault. Oh f me  Yeah, Bill  Man, but now says can the social media companies be more helpful on these issues? What creativity do we have?  Sadly, the digital tools probably have been a net contributor to spreading what I consider crazy. I know we need well  He's not wrong about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We need corona clippy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But he's not clippy he's not wrong I see you have  Virus  Yes, exactly exactly but it is the case that IOT thinks they see it's perfect you can do it isn't it the case that every  conspiracy theory finds fertile ground on Facebook and Twitter and all these other shall I remind you which trials

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. Well, hold up the which let's not go back to Salem, but  They were on the internet broadly, I mean reddit is reddit social media. Yeah, I'll include I'll include reddit YouTube

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter actually a little bit less. So Facebook for sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know and you can also see it anytime people get together in the real world  I mean my dad's office is like a it's like a conspiracy water cooler. I swear these people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I agree, but that would be a localized phenomenon

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just like the witch president of the United States is out there telling you not to wear masks and how can you then bill?  Say that this is all social media's fault. It's on Fox News  And you've got the Karens and the Kens out there having the theatrical fits  in  Costco's and Walmart's  It's out there and it's gonna happen. It doesn't it wasn't caused by social media  We have a larger problem with cognition and education I agree with you actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think most people don't I mean I am educated  I am willing to think through and challenge my beliefs and change them when they're proven wrong  But I will say that I find absent good government guidance. That's I don't really know what to do. There's a vacuum

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and read my  Yeah, well I do but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That takes a lot of time and effort

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Science there's no consensus in among scientists either

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's why you need you need. I mean, that's what a public health agency is for is to say hey  We this is what we know right now. This is the best practices and government in the government officials should then say, okay  I'm the governor. I'm going to take their educated opinion and distill it for people because that's what leaders do. Yes, and  We don't have that right now. So we're all like trying to distill things  And we don't have all the tools to do it  in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some places though are but Stacy the problem is that you have like Andrew Cuomo does just that right?  My governor Murphy does just that but then you have the governor of Florida who says no  No, we're fine and Floridians go around the country spreading the germs  That's that's why it's sad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it's so it's terribly frustrating

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People are now going nuts today about the CDC because because we're getting more the political than we are on the show  But hey, we start with water softeners. We can do anything  By the way water softeners a  liberal hoax  They put fluoride in your water nothing wrong with the water. Yeah, I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing wrong with the water I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't get fluoride treatments, however, oh the worst thing I got three times I got it and I got sick  The goo they put on your teeth really goo on your teeth. Oh, yeah, and and I got sick

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now podcaster another source of bad information, let's add that to the list Bill Gates  Sorry, so I forgot to we got distracted. Oh you were gonna say CDC. What's the latest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, see see see see so it's the latest CCD. So Trump said I don't like their guidelines. They're too tough  So the CDC said, okay, we'll redo them and all my all the people in my feed like great consolibus at the  At Yale are having fits and said the CDC is worthless now and they're pulling out of the W. H. O  Is this it's this institutional hatred we have now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but you see the consequence if if you turn your back on expertise  then you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More people die very simply. Yeah, you're pretty much rudderless then yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if you turn yeah, if you turn your back on expertise and expertise is required boom

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  people will die and unfortunately  Politicians  Have other motives that you know  Definitely they're really the real irony of all this is nobody really liked governor Cuomo  No, no, no, but yeah, nobody really likes governor Newsom. They both have 80% approval ratings  Because they took some leadership role  If yes, if the president really had wanted to get reelected  I'm beginning to think he doesn't because if he'd really wanted to get reelected it would have been simple  It would have been simple. Just take a leadership role just say

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where am I tests manufactured I'm gonna bring the power of the office simple you wouldn't even had to do anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, just say it CDC recommendations actually say politicians shouldn't deliver these messages

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's because the worry that it'll be politics and politicized and in countries that have done very well like New Zealand  Jacinda stepped back their their prime minister stepped back and and the briefings were held by  Scientists by by  Same with well Germany's now come in surging a little bit. I can back up a little bit that by the way  That's the other side of this is maybe even if you follow best practices

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a nasty ass virus. Oh, oh, you know, it's gonna come back  But the thing is you can then control it in a different way, right? Yeah, right it two British ladies came to New Zealand  They had it but they know the British  You deal with that yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was really so far past what's sad to me is if you had a good policy including cloth homemade cloth face masks  Our economy would not be in such bad shape that you could open  You know things and and so it that's the irony of all this is just the slightest sense  He would have an 80% approval rating. He would sail the victory in November  It's almost as if he's doing everything he cannot to get elected I  Mean he's pissing off old people don't piss off old people. They vote Jeff and I vote

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you listen to Rachel Maddow last night, which I'm sure to some people is it but fine I like her  The Mary Trump book she was just in prime for  I know it's not out yet, but but but  It feels like it feels like the experts are out. Yeah, it's no it this one  It feels very different feels like a very she's a she's a clinical psychiatrist psychologist, right and it feels yes  There's there's family stuff. She's dealing with  But no, it feels like it's actually a fairly  level-headed view

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook has a fan subscription program is that yes, it's they do you got char?  This is you if you're a creator  They started this last two years ago  You can charge fans a five dollar monthly fee for exclusive content and a fan badge  Maybe that's what you think that's what Twitter is they pay might be that's interesting would you I wouldn't do that  But I could see influencers would love that and celebrities  No, but we're not that kind of people no, we're not though no, we're not we're cynical nasty  We're not that nobody pay five bucks. I'm not cynical or nasty or  No, I actually would pay five bucks there to put a little Stacy badge on my Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about a gift of me yeah, I want your noise I want the Stacy noise

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First heard Leo Laporte's name  When young Jake Jarvis wanted to give who's this Leo Laporte you want to get money to oh he wanted to give me money

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he does nice. He joined he did their brief time to take we still have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We just don't promote it. Well, you didn't know you did kind of a membership thing. It was like five dollars a month or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, it was a tip Charles never we never got anything for it. Which is probably the big mistake we made. Yeah  No, I  I'm bad at self-promotion  And me too. I felt really guilty having advertising and asking for money  So we just we have a tip jar, but it's hidden we hide it if you really want it you can find it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see what else what else did you read I wanted to do I wanted to read your turn  Your turn. That's okay. I talked forever about Google  I actually really enjoyed the Bezos future thing. That's what I was gonna bring up. It wasn't that interesting  We're on the same way. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this was a super interesting yeah by Nathan Robinson who is I think he's an editor there  I should go look at the fine line. He's got a long opinion. Yeah, and basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He talks about the whole world like do we want the world to look like?  Amazon right do we want Amazon to basically get its goal of continual growth and then he says and plus why is Amazon doing this?  Why is Bezos so into you know growing and making more money?  It's because he wants to send us all into space in the parallels to the early  Kind of Christian damn the earth full speed ahead to the afterlife kind of perspective. We're so like  Obvious here. It's like oh Bezos is just like one of those those people who in the late late 1800s 1800s late  1900s early 1900s who were like who cares about the earth who cares about this we will all meet in the afterlife  Right except the afterlife for Bezos is is colonies in space. He wants he says imagine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Humanities spread out throughout the galaxy  there'd be a thousand Einstein's because there'd be so many of us and  The problem with this is if you are a true, but then I don't know if Jeff's a true believer in this  I mean he talks a lot about it. This is being his you know  He's doing a billion dollars a year towards it. So yeah, but you know he has a lot of money  That's for him. That's not you know, that's like us giving a thousand dollars to a cause  he  he  Apparently got this bug when he was a kid  And the threat according to the author of this piece in current affairs is if you believe  That the only future for the human race is off-planet  Then you'll do anything to achieve it including send, you know  Who cares about the environment because we're gonna get off the planet  I'm not paying any taxes because every penny that I give the federal government is wasted compared to my plan to bring us into space  and I  Don't know if this is I don't think this is what Jeff Bezos. No, this is ridiculous  but it is it is the case that  What he's the what he's doing, you know is essentially saying I want to control all commerce. I  Want all commerce to run through me and I think that's  It's a reasonable thing to say we don't know why  He's obviously already infinitely rich good business. Yeah, but he doesn't need the money  He we don't know why he wants to do this the any of these guys who I know what makes what makes  I know what makes Sammy run standard oil. Yeah  The good news is Walmart's gonna launch  Amazon Prime competitor in July. I want to see I think the best thing we could hope for I mean  I I like Amazon but what we could really hope for is it is a challenger

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, some of the things that they're saying about Amazon five to eight to eight to ten years ago  We were saying about Walmart, right? I mean nobody looks at Walmart and it's like yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're labor practices are amazed. No, that's true. Good point Stacey. Yeah, they were gonna take over the world. They were evil  My god, and now they're the salt there the white night. Yeah, it's all this it's all we got left

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's part which roots but the competition will keep Walmart in line and Walmart will keep Amazon in line  I mean there it's absolutely true that Bezos is labor relations are not great. I mean, they suck they suck  Yeah, he wants to basically suck every bit of juice out of his employees and doesn't much care. They're disposable to him

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen why I like the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead. Sorry. Go go. No, I was gonna say he's optimizing for growth and he's done  What I think is frightening and this is actually something I think about a lot because of IOT because it allows you to make it to  Really drive home efficiencies and optimize right but he's optimized for  lowered cost to the end consumer and  Higher revenue revenue not margin revenue for Amazon and  He is managing to squeeze every ounce of that out of the system and it's it's kind of frightening because  When you do that and technology gives you the ability to do that so efficiently that you  You can win at that game, right?  You can eke out to the very last tenth of a cent if you want to you just won't care about anything else and  That's terrifying because other companies can do the same thing and a lot of companies  Emulate Amazon in this way. So we're gonna see I think the real issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's easy to make Jeff be the stalking horse for this, but honestly, this is what this is the capitalistic way is  Yeah, infinite growth and I think that  We really especially now given that we've seen the consequences of  untrammeled growth  Trammeled growth  Environmentally not to mention in labor practice and other things we need to really kind of rethink this  This is gonna be a difficult conversation because everything we do certainly in the Western world is  Designed around this notion that you could continue to grow. What's your what's your GNP?  What you know, it's if it's negative that's bad  It's got to be the highest number possible and that's not I think sustainable on the planet. We just can't so there  Actually are a lot of movements  Towards either zero growth no growth sustainable growth that kind of thing that I think it would really be nice  To look at these and maybe rethink this kind of worship of eternal

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some growth is good and necessary. It creates jobs it creates  Wealth, but but the issue is how you then distribute that and what the limits are to that  And and you know, so do you end up with the Carnegie found it the Carnegie corporation and you end up with the Bezos  Foundation and the Zuckerberg Chan Foundation and that's how the money gets redistributed or you do it through taxes  Basically your choice, right?  And and I think there's more and more call now to redistribute wealth through taxes and I'm all for that  That's government's job to do and it's politically unpopular and that's the issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's still unpopular because the Republicans did such a good job in the late 70s early 80s in  demonizing government and  So with here we are and and taxes with them. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just also think though there is there is a case to be made whether the government taxes it or not  You cannot just continue to grow resources run out. It is it is not possible

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What if you take and this is this is my I grew up reading science fiction brain speaking  But what if we took a different approach to resources like we're seeing things like, you know, there's renewable energy  there are  if you think about using things like CRISPR to  Grow building materials, for example that are strong and flexible, but we don't actually invest in that sort of thing  we don't we have a we have the same innovators dilemma as  a country as  Researchers, we don't want to like undercut what we've always done right which is extraction based mining of resources, right?  So I feel like more so than just saying hey we need to think about taxation which we do we also need to think about  the resources we elect to use and how we're trying to  Use what the world has made available to us and  if we can if we can take that shift and start shifting some of our  R&D and some of our  creativity  Into taking advantage of harnessing not extracting what the natural world offers  I think there could be some really cool and Bezos is  Is investing in that right Bezos says he's put what is a hundred million dollars or whatever it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's promised that the company is going to be fully on on renewable energy by 2025 I think it was  You know, so that's why I the theory that he wants to destroy the earth to get off of it. No  He's got a business reason to do it  A hundred million is nothing to that man. I mean like like they said, he's got a hundred million dollars

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  A

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hundred million is nothing to that man. I mean like like they said he's got a hundred he  Sells a billion dollars worth of stock for Blue Origin every year. He you know a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hundred million is nothing and by the way the company and full disclosure as I have some Amazon stock  Which I have disclosed before  But damn it's it's heading toward it could be the first trade two trillion dollar company  It's now in the trillion and a half. It's ridiculous range. It's absurd. It's unbelievable

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's problem has just been unbelievable problematic. I think so that's the mark  I I'm not gonna be the poster boy for steady state economy. I believe in it  I think it's the right thing to do  I don't think it's gonna happen  But if you want to read more steady state org is the center for the advancement of a steady state economy  and I think it's there I think we're having a lot to read and I think it's really really good information and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the discussion to have is this larger discussion it gets us away from

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff's just doing what every single person in  An economy like ours is trying to do infinite growth, but it's not sustainable and unfortunately  Jeff's gotten very good at it. So he's you know kind of the poster boy for this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But so there were two pieces in the rundown today that I thought were very sensible in this way  One was we just mentioned them both and discuss one was politico  Saying that the ad boycott fine, but let's look at what cuts in the past really  It's it's it's it's for its virtue signaling. It's gonna turn out Facebook's gonna be better off  This is what's happened in the past. It's a game that they're both playing  I thought was very sensible and then Casey Newton's piece about  That that it's not really the press versus  Tech  It's really about employees versus managers  Which I thought was also very interesting take that that we're seeing fundamental shifts here  and what social media does allow now is it allows employees to gang up on man to find each other and and and and  Gather together and then act and put pressure on their managers and that to your point  Stacy and your point Leo about about what creates the pressure to change the rules of the game  That's that's a new factor here and it's and it's interesting to see how it's playing out  So I thought they were really interesting is they no longer played tech as evil. They looked at the underlying  dynamics of  companies and economies and  communications now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Text only evil because they've gotten so good at exploiting  Their advantage, but it's an advantage. Everyone would exploit given the chance. It's just yeah, it's the rules of the game  So I agree it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't to assault techers attack Jeff Bezos  I thought it was a great article and raise some interesting points, but it doesn't really get to the fundamental flaw  I  Think that's that's gonna go on forever  But as somebody in the chat room says this is a pointless conversation because we're just we're like the paperclip  Factory we just keep making paper clips till there's nothing more to make paper clips

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With you know what? I'd like to do kill the humans so we can make more. Yeah  Paper clips

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Paper clips  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's so a lot more to talk about I do want to get the Google change login if you don't mind so Jeff  Would you do the honors?  That's JB Rockman at the controls, thank you Jeff Brockman  Rumors flying that forget the pixel 4a  Get ready for the pixel 5 maybe contributing to that Google has now and they admit it  discontinue the pixel 3a  And it's big brother the 3xl  Still no release of the pixel 4a which a lot of people were hoping would be like a successor to 3a which was a less expensive  But yet very nice pixel phone  There does seem to be some evidence that maybe the 4a is not going to be released  They've got a bit. There's got to be a warehouse somewhere with millions. Is there a warehouse with them in boxes? Yeah has to be  So I don't know what's going on at the gook but  There's one piece of information as we get closer to something  You know if they wait too long  They might as well just jump to the five  They might might as well just jump to three four a's for everybody four a's for everybody  Is Google Voice back  Jr. Raphael writing at computer world. He's a big Android guy  Pointing out that in fact Google Voice may be back  For one thing Google has released it from the PHY  Bonds that were tying it down now those of us with PHY can continue to use Google Voice  You don't have to give up your Google Voice number to get Google PHY  And there's now a Google Voice optional G Suite add-on  So maybe Google Voice maybe Google's decided to bring voice back. I don't it's a strange  Thing but you can now if you are a PHY subscriber or Google Voice user you can now coexist  Peacefully good news because I think Google Voice is one of the best things they ever did  One of the things I don't know if they are really important or not, but the balloon powered internet  Or Google Loon is not dead yet  A commercial deal is it's a business a commercial deal in Kenya is the first application of balloon powered internet in  Africa and of course this is potentially a very big market is that it is the continent with the lowest internet penetration  There is a Loon balloon. They they're high-flying  Stratospheric balloons that bring the internet. They started delivering internet access to Kenya yesterday

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Didn't they deliver it in Puerto Rico and they did during the after the hurricane. Yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I was like I really thought it's not their first deployment they after Maria. No, they use it more permanent  Yeah, but this is a commercial. This is a this is the first kind of  It's ironic because of course Elon Musk Starlink is now starting to get a little ground  They've got a lot of satellites up there and they say they're gonna launch this year  So I don't I you know what  We'll see we'll see I would I just want internet on every square inch of the planet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't care how we also do they see your interests are aligned. There we go. We agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's plenty of people who do not want internet on every square inch of the planet. Just as a reminder dictators  I know all the wealth those people definitely and all the EMF people the people who are burning their 5g

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It causes kovat actually project loon balloons have been spotted recently over Virginia and the Carolinas

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what that thing is bringing kovat. Yeah, I shouldn't even joke about something like that. It'll end up being somebody you'll say yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They they fly at 50,000 feet which is pretty that's higher than a commercial jet airliner. Well better be I don't want to fly  It's it really at the edge of the atmosphere  So maybe maybe I thought we said loon was was you know dead but I guess no remember we were talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At the end of the year was at the end of the year show where we're like the Google things that should go away

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We played the game where right will be killed right loon is living loons alive as is Google Voice  How would you like to get some traffic lights in your Google Maps?  Apparently on Android you will oh

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think I always assumed they knew where the traffic lights were because you always see the slowdown right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also stop signs now the real reason this is important is for self-driving vehicles because they don't necessarily see those stop lights are  Traffic lights are stop signs  So that's my guess that's what that's all about because you know when you get to that intersection. There's a light there  You don't need a map to tell you that  Maybe for planning. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My mom actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Optimizes her routes to avoid traffic. Oh, yeah, actually really yeah, that's a thing. Yeah, yeah, that's and she will run stop signs  Oh, well, that's not a thing.

This is the third release  So there was a beta 1 release after the original Android 11 release and I found it to be very stable  Works really well some have complained about audio distortion. That's gone the recent app screen now works  Screenshots are supposed to work  Correctly screenshots sharing and text selection. I haven't seen any of these problems worked quite well for me  I actually really like Android 11  And we showed earlier in the show in case you're just joining us that the power button now  There's some home automation stuff if you press it for a second. So that's good. That's the new Android 11  Now  That's all the good stuff you Google's doing. Here's the one that's pissing me off  YouTube TV is now $65 a month

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh  Kevin was upset. Yeah upset. So you started at 35

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  went to 50  now goes to 65 so they've been the second another $15 price like this because  They say  the higher cost of programming the channels they carry are gonna cost more but don't worry because  you're gonna get such great channels as  the Paramount Network  MTV VH1 and TV land they're adding more Viacom CBS channels 14 of them and  They're gonna they're gonna do that immediately which is over 85 channels in their base plan and then later they're gonna add MTV to  MTV classic Nick Jr. All  Stuff I don't really care about

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently there you're not watching Nick Jr. On the on the rig. I should be I should be what does MTV? What is it anymore?

Transcript:  Leo how many channels do you watch in a month? Oh, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't know  I'm not counting basically I pay for every possible service every possible form of content and then  watch a handful of shows  But you know, I want to have the choice I  Want to have the choice. So honestly, we probably could turn off the cable except for news. I need news news channels  Local news  What else Lisa watches the local news in the morning?  You're not that many we need Disney Plus and that's all Disney Plus for Hamilton gotta have it  Just for Hamilton

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got you to I cancel you TV YouTube TV when it went to $50 and then Lisa said I can't watch my football games  So I got it back but now oh  No, I think she says it's okay to cancel it because she's pissed that it's 65 bucks  No, and the only reason I had it as I you know, I was trying it so I could report on it  Although the DVR is really nice  Makes it really easy to record shows  Steve Gibson says he's going over  To sling TV. They're still 35 bucks per kind of not quite as  Deep an offering but they promise they won't raise their price for a year. But this is exact. You know what?  We've seen this we've seen this story before this cable TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Warned us what I mean, this is what everyone said what happened when  When we started doing streaming we were like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Disaggregation because we're going back to re aggregation. Do we really want a la carte TV? Don't we want that?  the challenges because

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the business  Because companies just a few companies own so many channels like Viacom owns so many so they're like  You will buy all of our channels or none, right? Which makes total sense from their economic point of view. Sure, so  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  think honestly  You know if I were worried about the spend and I am at this point  I think the best thing to do is get Netflix Amazon Prime  Maybe Hulu if there's something you want to see on that  There a couple of overtop services. Maybe HBO Max. I have I subscribe to some weird ones like the criterion channel and  Brit box  Because you know, those are interesting, but honestly you could you could narrow it down  And I have to say I think I bet you this is gonna hurt  They say they have two million subscribers. I've heard a lot of pain a lot of howls. That's a that's a lot  That's a cable subscription

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right  so so there was a story I just put in the rundown that a  Pennsylvania town had crappy internet access so they built a tower to  Beam it into the homes and I thought that's exactly how cable started exactly in Pennsylvania  Yep, because people couldn't get access. Yep, so they built the community, you know community access TV. Yeah, see a TV  and and  So there's a yin-yang here that the community tries to step up because it wants something  then the company takes it over and then the company makes it awful and  And then tries to imprison you and so YouTube thinks we're imprisoned  Disney thinks we're in prison trapped. We're  Really? You know, I'm gonna do I'm gonna do Disney Plus for one month  It's worth it for Hamilton. That's all I want to see him. But that's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually a good deal because I mean the movie would cost you twice that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To go see it plus there's I mean Disney Plus is not terrible. There's some good stuff. It's not for me

Transcript:  But you know, so so JK Rowling signed it and of course, she's been accused of anti  trans trans sentiments  You know, I have to say I'm again, I'm gonna blame Twitter  It's all Twitter. It's stuff people say stuff on Twitter that are hot takes. They're off the cuff. They're  Arguably dumb and but they should but they there should be treated as temporary  And they're not they're kept permanently  Record go ahead Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the interesting things I found about the whole JK Rowling and the the turf comments was that there is a culture in the UK  That that's normal and what's interesting is I would have had no idea of that just because it's something I don't think about but by  Having a global platform  We're coming to some sort of agreement on what's okay and what's not between the two countries and  JK Rowling is bearing the brunt of that but at the same time  Maybe it will force some people over in the UK to reevaluate how they feel about  Good trans women and that that can't be anything else  That can't be anything and you know, we actually kind of I'm curious to see because we haven't talked about this  But like tick-tock getting banned  We could see some things like we're seeing cultural aggression from I'll call it cultural aggression. That's probably a silly thing to say  It's a book in terms of values and that sort of thing being pushed with like tick-tock and  We're pushing back against that so in some ways yes, this is this is  gutting and hard, but it's also  It's cool. It's like what happens when you get different people in the room and you start talking to each other you're like you think that that's wacky

He said yeah people think that about me  I don't know why  But there's one paragraph he said with so many famous and serious authors signing on this letter  I have to call out the use of the word censorious  This word is commonly misused and misunderstood it does not mean as many assume prone to censorship that is censorial  Censorious actually means  hypocritical of others not trying to force them into silence  That's a Mike Mazda moment, right? I love it. He just tosses that in he's good

Transcript:  In the it's gonna be lovely in the Wall Street Journal  Who is the mystery shopper?  leaving behind thousands of online  shopping carts and it it's it started with various  Online merchants compared notes and said, you know this guy John Smith  He comes in he buys a bunch of stuff loads it up in his cart and never comes back doesn't buy it  doesn't pull this pull the trigger on it and  Yeah, that's been happening to me this guy named John Smith. He comes in the email  Addresses don't match  In fact when they mail the traditional hey you left some stuff in your shopping cart  If I give you a 10% off, would you buy it bounce back because they're not real email addresses  It's a great mystery  But it's also a problem because a lot of these  companies  Pay attention to what people put in their cart and use it for analytics to decide what products to  To continue to sell things like that and it's it's screwing up their analytics that this John Smith's coming in all the time  messing things up  Quite a mystery until  Google admitted. Oh  That was us  Our bad bad. So Google apparently is part of Google shopping  Because sometimes you have to go to a store and put something in the cart before you can see the final price  Or add the shipping and handling price  So you can't really tell what something costs until you go through the process of buying it  So Google has created bots to do that  Name John Smith and  creating email addresses at Gmail forum and  It's just the way they  collect  price data  So the mystery solved Google says the company's looking to clarify how those automated systems  Will work with merchant websites in the future to avoid  confusion  What a mystery you know I started reading this I thought why is the Wall Street Journal?  Writing about this. This is what this is just a weird  I also saw  Oh, it's a good Ahead story that that middle story

Transcript:  Well, are they sanitizing each like thing because this guy has touched his face mask like a gajillion times  And I want that thing sanitized. This is why i'm not going to the amusement park anytime soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what keeps falling off his nose I have a lot of velocity happening there I bet my mask wouldn't fall off  He's trying to be good keeping the mask in place. Yeah, he's keeping the mask in place. Maybe that's what he's demonstrating  And the other guy who has a properly fitted mask.

Transcript:  Fraunhofer has created a new video compression codec

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Vvc now, this is geeky

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is good. We talked about it on my show. Yeah, good. See so you know, see I said you're geeky  Fraunhofer can created the mp3  They created h.264. They created h.265 the high efficiency video codec, which is in wide use right now  Their new codec vvc, which is h.266  They say is can get files  Shrunk by 50 percent more  Than h.265. That's pretty impressive. There is an issue and this does relate to google  because  Google won't use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they have their own standard. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and they don't like the h standards because  They're patent encumbered. There's a license. I was gonna say they have to pay fran huffer  Well, yeah, there's actually so remember  The there was the mpeg alliance was handling the license originally for all of this  The new license organization is media coding industry forum or mc-if  Companies including apple ericsson intel wal-way microsoft qualcomm and sony  They say fran hoffer says it'll be franned licensed  Which means reasonable but still you gotta pay right?  So fran stand for fair reasonable and  Something else. I don't remember but the idea is that it'd be  You know, you wouldn't you wouldn't go for the jugular that you'd charge a fair amount  And uh, I don't care reasonable and non-discriminatory

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We google  We google at the same time  Who needs a brain simultaneous googling

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's good to actually cover licensing for an ip publication. See this so you won't see this on youtube

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, but because they have their vp9 codec and their their own google codec  So that's not good actually that there's a schism in the video codec world  I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm pretty much done at all anything you've missed in here. Well, no, I gotta see I think I had some fun thing or two  Let's see

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it has to do with facebook, I say we skip it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fine with me fine with me  We could talk about the oversight board isn't gonna be around until the fall and people are having some fits about that  But we're not going to talk about that. It's tasty. Mike Pompeo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mike Pompeo secretary of state says the u.s is looking at banning  Tick tock tick tock. Oh, yeah, that's what I was referencing with our wow. Well india has banned it  And 56 other chinese  apps  But I wonder what would happen if the u.s government tried to ban tick tock

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The story said it's a it's an empty threat. They can't they're not going to yeah, well they could

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Under what under what how would they get apple as a first amendment issue? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they couldn't get apple and google to pull it  But they can put pressure on them  So it's a big problem in india where a lot of influencers  Who use tick tock and make money with tick tock are very frustrated one guy said i've spent two years building  You know a career on tick tock and now it's gone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is why you own your own platform, right? End of story lesson learned

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  tick tock tick tock, uh oddly which is is a chinese company is  quitting hong kong  Because they don't want to be used to surveil activists  Which sounds very odd

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That yeah, but other companies just said we're not going to give you data, but tick tock pulled out of hong kong

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I couldn't interpret that. Yeah, maybe because they couldn't say no. Oh, they can't but can they pull out?  Well, they tried they did. I mean, we'll see if that's yeah, what are they gonna do get back in there? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  Uber is going to require drivers and passengers to wear face masks  Good  They didn't before

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know i'm amazed at that  Mary Jo for now we're going to have the the karen and ken  uber videos

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel bad for small businesses that try to force people to wear masks and the people say no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't I just don't i'm grateful very grateful to the businesses who then escort those people out  The thing is if you take like the walmarts and that those people wore masks to get in  Once in it's all theater, right? It's anger theater, right?  Uh, they decide to have a fit, right?  I have two quick stories that I want to mention. Yes  One is jeanotrapani. I don't want to make stacy, you know feel I I don't I I like she does

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I I have plenty of ego jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't uh, I didn't mean to say I know that would be both. I don't think we're gonna say that no I says yes anyway  um, so uh  Way ahead of her time. There was a story about how document creation now is finally doing what wave was intended to do  And dear jr wrote the book on wave and then it got killed  But it's true a lot of document  companies notion coda air table  Are really putting together the whole the whole idea of dynamic and collaborative  and inserted element

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Document creation should they left out rome rome researchers is another really good one. I use  I use notion. Uh, in fact, this is my laporte family notion, but I use it for planning shows  We have show rundowns in there. I think notion is really  Really cool it all of these can be public web pages  You can embed content  I use it to prepare a couple of shows. We also use it for um  Ios today to produce the show together  I've created pages like this. This is my covet 19 page where I have a lot of information for instance  I made a big page on mask making as I was doing the research  You're able to embed videos content text  Modify it when I traveled in the good old days. That's when I started using  No, I started using it for a travel blog because you can make this a public web  Cancelled and canceled canceled and canceled. This is where we would have been  And it's nice because when you make a page, you know, you can embed all sorts of content maps and images  You can have a calendar. You can look at your calendar and a variety of views as a calendar view  But you can also have a card view  So I think it's a very I love notion. I really do it now. There's a free  Version that allows you to have up to a thousand blocks of data  But then there's also a um, it's cheap to pay for I think it's forty dollars a year for  Unlimited use I use do everything with it. I keep my hardware inventory in here  I have system setup scripts in here. So when I  Set up a new

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Device, I have all the information I need god. You are so organized. It's it's this is a great view of leo's brain

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the idea is this is leo's brain, right?  This is all this is get it out of thought stacy would be disorganized but you I wouldn't expect look here's something movies  I want to watch in quarantine  These are oh babe pig in the scene. I know you'd like that  I know you'd be on the lights. Yeah, that's a good movie, too  Yeah, these are I've seen babe, but a lot of these I haven't seen i've seen clad atlas  So yeah, yeah, this was from some uh an article somewhere  Um, so that's another thing when i'm trying to remember books I want to read or  you know quotes I want to keep track of or  Um, you know that kind of thing my car shopping  This is these are my list of requirements. So mustang gonna be out  Well, supposedly i'm supposed to get an email that I can order this thing  uh now  But I haven't um  I haven't gotten that email. So supposedly it's going to come out very soon  In like probably the next couple of months  So it's nice  I love notion. That's that's kind of a nice story. Yeah, and and and you know wave was this I would rather use notion or  Air table, which is a similar although tabular more focused tabular  um  I use coda as well. I would prefer to use those in wave the problem with wave. It was just kind of  It was early complicated and it was early. It was it was it was it was a notional thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To explore the idea and they were they were on top of it  But they couldn't turn it into something quick enough for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think we're at the end. I don't think we're at the end of the line  I think this is just the beginning of rethinking what a document is in a in a in a way that is divorced finally divorced  From paper and fold little folders and things like that. That's because you know, we are past gutenberg

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We are past gutenberg. Yes. Yeah, so I tweeted the jeana was way ahead of her time and she just said, oh, oh  So the other story I just want to mention because I found it fascinating. I I I read the whole thing really quickly  I want to go back and read it again new yorker piece on cloud kitchens  ghost kitchens

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the this is really I think one of the things i've been really finding interesting is how  The covid crisis is going to change how we live after the covid crisis. Yes  And one of the things that seems clear is that restaurants no longer need to have dining rooms

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, it may be not just need to it may be a horrible waste of yeah real estate and unfortunately, uh labor

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there are a lot of I ghost kitchens isn't the term i've heard before I can't remember what the term is  but there are a lot of  Basically kitchens that don't have dining rooms, but you get takeout so the delivery guy comes picks them up brings it to you you eat at home  And it's fascinating. So this company called reef

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is a huge owner of parking lots  and their belief and so they control parking lots and and and they started by by  Having a parking lot reservation. So they're talking food trucks then but yes  So they put truck they believe parking lots are going to need to be repurposed  Oh interesting, they can put trucks there and that truck can be 20 different restaurants. Yeah, well, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  walmart's doing movie drive-in movies in their parking lot. So I think there's a real interesting play there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah, I think restaurants will change but also it was I was talking about this on twitter, I think  Uh lisa wanted to did I talk about this last week? I think was on twitter lisa wanted to buy a um  badminton set  and um  We could have ordered on amazon. It would have come five days later  But she realized oh dick's sporting goods over here  And the pickup process was amazing. It was so easy. She ordered online paid online  You give her they give you give them the car model and information and when she drives up there's slots  They put it in your car and you drive off. Yeah, like that's fine  And it makes me yeah a lot of stores are doing this  It makes me really think that may be also the future of retail that these big stores might just be warehouses  And the advantage they this is where the advantage they have over amazon is you can pick it up right away  So it's all the advantage of e-commerce

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Without amazon might buy jc pennies or might buy bases, right? They might need this  Yeah, right so it's and so it's not just restaurants, but the idea is that you can you can do that and  and um  I just found it absolutely fascinating because it changes the economics completely now that goes into um  What's been called having been bought by uber?  What was you had the story earlier postmates, thank you right  So yes, your point is it changes the use of this real estate immensely

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. What about so this is i've also been thinking about this with higher education  Our son has been going to uh online high school for a couple of years now anyway  It's accredited  It's actually free because it's public school in california. They get paid just like any public school. That's using the charter school system  He gets a state curriculum proved curriculum gets a you know high school degree like anybody else would  And it turns out he was very well suited for the quarantine because he was doing it before the quarantine. Yeah  and I wonder  How many students so I you know, I found this this is the university of the people. I don't know what you think of this  But they're good people. Yeah. Yeah, the whole idea is this is a non-profit american accredited  tuition-free  online university  And I love the idea  That anybody wants to go to college can do it while they're working a job at home  And I don't know how good the curriculum is i've read pros and cons. It's maybe kind of middle of the road

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I you know, I think this is really interesting. So what happens I wrote about this and what would google do the googly university?  Right. And if you separate the fun and so you have  Students complaining about missing the experience of college  Well, i've been on a hundred of these tours as of you leo and soon you will go stacey  Where they're selling you the dining hall and the food court and the dorms and the sports arena  I used to give those tours

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were at the university of texas austin, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I I did but I did it as part of a program designed to attract a minority and underrepresented  Oh, that's cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See even then stacey you put your spin on it right there  Yeah, that extra caring spin

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you separate out the functions, right the education is one certification is one. Do you get a degree?  socialization is one  Research is one right? The problem is that when you when you disaggregate all of that, which I think is going to happen. I agree  And education even social education and socialization even aren't going to go together. I don't think anymore because of coved  What happens to research?  Right, what happens to expertise and research?  Um, who's going to pay for that government's not going to there's not enough bell lab jobs in the world  That's what well doesn't government pay for most university research. No, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know that actually is part of the conversation at harvard  because  I don't know carston should weigh on this but when you get a harvard education how much of it is  The classwork you do and how much of it is?  Hanging out, you know in your college and the dining hall and the people you meet and the experience of being at bosch

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think i'm going to take over the social graph myself. So that's mine. What are you going to take over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly  Uh, I don't think mark zuckerberg what he got out of harvard had nothing to do with the courses. He was taking do you think no?  so  So that is you make an excellent point my I mentioned this before my dad who's a university was a university professor for years  He's now retired  Um, so really the notion of a college in the early days was collegiate was  A place for scholars to get together and discuss scholarship  Uh as much as it was a you know, you know  Not like a high school where you have a teacher in classes and you take exams. It was really  More about getting together. It was about the social experience  And maybe that's you know in a library, of course and maybe that and some and some expertise

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you have so then you have melrose place apartments where you have your socialization. Yeah, right  And then you you do your classes online  And then you take a test somewhere to get certified that you've done your work

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you can you got a big kerfuffle with uh, I think was it taylor lawrence on twitter?  Over the notion of a gap year. You said it's a privilege. It's a a privileged thing to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was not just her was a few people. It was taylor lawrence and and I and I couldn't I was trying to make a simple point  And I found myself mansplaining so I I grew back  Um  The argument I said that gap years are privilege or a sign of privilege  And people said well, no, no, no, they can take a few courses at community college and I said well no  Because a lot of these colleges don't take those credits. I hate to tell you. It's just like ap credits doesn't work  So well, well they can get jobs. I said well we have have you heard we got a depression going on  There's not jobs to be had people trying to trying to support their families or take any job they can get  So well then they save money I said well no they they still end up spending four years if they went to college this fall online  They save on room and board then if we're back to normal, they've got three more years  They've had a net savings and I couldn't get that argument across  To her or to anybody but you know, the gap year is a wonderful thing. I wish I'd had one  I didn't I was stupid. I didn't take it. I'm not against them  But the the schtick out there now is well after harvard announced well if I were in college  I'd just take a gap year and I wouldn't go  Uh, well that's easy for you to say but you presume that you don't have to I mean if harvard would defer your

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matriculation a year  You don't have to it doesn't have to be a question of privilege. You can well the issue well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Number one so so that presumes you've got a home that you can go sit in for a year

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you work you get a job and you work and you live like a normal person you heard we got the great depression on  We have 15 unemployment. There aren't jobs to be found. My daughter got a job at trader joe's there maybe aren't  Appropriate jobs to be found but there are jobs out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  um  So I always say so I built my students as somebody just getting high school taking a year off before they go to college

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's probably sufficient  things they could do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To support themselves as as a colleague of mine said at cuny when we have our cuny students  Then you're going back to an apartment with three generations and probably going to get cove in and you can't find a job

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's not and and that has nothing to do with gap years or college. That's life now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It it does but if you have your college and you have the scholarship  There's gonna be a lot more scholarship money this year than there is going to be in two years  I'll tell you that you want to go to harvard online  That doesn't sound like much fun. What's the goal of going there the goal of going there in the end should be education

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, not at all. Oh, no. No the goal of going there is networking with all the the fancy people who have connections

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's wrong with that ladies and gentlemen, that's where that's where go back to your previous stories. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Carson was not some fancy kid. He was a kid from montana at good grades was smart kid got into harvard  I don't know what his scholarship situation was landed now. Well that worked well cars. It did work  Well, he got his first job because he said he said it in the chat room  He got his job from his college best friend's ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend  It's the people you meet  Actually, you know helped me not one wit. No wait, take it back  Yale did because I got into radio because I use the campus radio station, but it wasn't about education  It was about the scene. It was about being there  Honestly college really is just a halfway house for kids who are not yet ready to enter the real world

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what i'm saying is we're going to separate those functions  I think you're going to go move to the melrose place  And get socialized. Yeah, and you're going to get your degree separately  You're going to get your certification separately. Why do you keep saying move to the melrose place?  I don't understand what you're talking about socialization that there's a socialization some apartment building somewhere  It was a show it was a tv show where they were all young people and this is where they socialized  All right. Oh jesus stacy. You just make me feel so effing old

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're just so sorry. No, I just that may just be a reference. I just didn't get that's okay. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I barely got it. I never okay. He's a former tv guide critic. He keeps using these words  You can't expect to understand what he's talking about. He comes from a different place from you and me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, someone pointed out jeff was a tv critic. Yes. See that's what it was  He watched I stopped watching television when like 21 jump street like that was like there was there's like a  20 year gap in my television history

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now stacy's  pick of the week

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is also just stacy's for the next couple weeks you guys y'all are going to be part of my pick of the week will be  Stacey's to-do item of the week. Oh good. I like this week  Is installing the ufi doorbell?  If you listen to my show you can skip this because i'm going to talk about why I chose this but you ufi is an anchor brand

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Badge right? It is. Yeah terrible name  No, it's ufi. I think it's terrible  It's some other language probably but anchor makes great stuff. So  I think if it's ufi, it's it's got to be the name like ufi. It's got to be good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got to be something  um, so this is their doorbell and I my  My house had a vivint doorbell, but I didn't want to pay for the vivint subscription  Even though the vivint vivint vivint video doorbell is quite good  um, so without a subscription  The nest doorbell, which is what I wanted to get is pretty useless  And my husband was adamant he did not want to pay anything so I was like, okay  And next up was arlo because that actually is a pretty good doorbell  um  and my they also had a subscription so  Ufi or ufi did not  And they also have an external security chime because for some reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My doorbell does not connect to the doorbell transfer. The ring would do that too. So you plug this in and it connects via wi-fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so i'm not going to be complicit with ring at this moment. No, I think ring is I couldn't do it ring is on the outs. Yep  so  This is what I purchased. It was a hundred and I think fifty nine dollars and ninety nine cents  and ninety nine cents and  Oh, so so it doesn't put the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Video up on the cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does it has local storage. It does not put it on the cloud  So, but you can can you go back in time and see

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What happened earlier? So for instance  When we were on vacation last year somebody drove over our mailbox  You know one of those rural route mailboxes on a post. It's outside on the street. Somebody crushed it  I was able to go look at the video from the doorbell and see who did it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I was able to go back in time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you get there? Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it turned out I figured out who it was  It was the lady who delivers the newspaper  And because I could see she was folding the newspaper not paying attention and she in slow motion drove right over my mailbox  And to her credit  I also saw her come back later that day on the doorbell trying to find us and again the next day trying to find us  So she was very honest and I said, oh, please we were going to get a new mailbox. Anyway, don't worry about it  You're such a nice guy. Yeah, she wanted to she wouldn't pay for it. I said no how much she makes how much she  Delivering newspapers. No, I can't let you do that that you know, we're gonna we're gonna replace it  Anyway, so it's nice to have what my point being it's nice to be able to go back in time. Can you do that with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, I don't remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been a crazy because that's really what you pay for on those subscriptions is the storage of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Historic really we just needed a doorbell that would ring in the house. That was our priority. Okay, um is less  It does say 24 7 monitoring I can't pay for that right later  Yeah, I think there's an option. Is there an option? I can't remember just ignore me  This is a terrible pick of the week just because I don't know enough yet  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
