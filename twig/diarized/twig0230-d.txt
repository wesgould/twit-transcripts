Transcript:  I was about to edit it there.  I would just like to say Bob who sort of stole my mind with articles like this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And so I could come up with better presque doctors like Red Yunü Red Yunü Red Yunü in  Well, a happy Festivus to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is time for our annual tradition on this week in Google.  We bring together your selections for the best of 2013 during this year.  We've had an amazing show with Jeff Jarvis and Gina Trapani and many visitors.  It is my outfit.  I hope you like this is a Google slanket and the traditional Festivus headgear.  We've got the poll.  The airing of grievances a little later on.  But I thought we'd kick things off with Gina Trapani and her resolution for the new year.  Take a look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I ordered a DIY make your own cheese kit.  Like mozzarella cheese kit right now.  I'm not really like I can I can function in the kitchen like I can make coffee and I  can make toast and you know I could put together but I'm not I'm not exactly a cook.  Well my wife saw this and she just went.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  She just sighed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I was like come on it's like make your own what's not home.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is on Amazon right.  It's 23 bucks on Amazon.  Oh the Mozart is that the one you got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  No no it's a Kickstarter.  It's a Kickstarter campaign.  It's a yeah it's a Kickstarter cheese making kit.  Let me see if I can find it.  It's probably on my own profile.  That's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I could just probably search for a cheese making kit Kickstarter and yeah fine.  Good idea.  Make cheese incorporated.  Let's make cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Exactly.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's in your own kitchen.  So guess what.  They've raised thirty nine thousand dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Wow.  They raised almost forty grand.  I can send you some buttermilk and some lemon and some cheesecloth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Did you get your kit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I haven't gotten the kit yet.  I got like a holiday card saying like hey it's coming.  I think the mozzarella one ships in like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know what sold you.  Look at this mozzarella making party.  That's what sold you on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  This is the thing.  Come on.  Look at that cheese.  My mom is going to be so impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Turn around to eBay right now and put it up there and say that you can order the first  cheese making kits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you pledge enough to get the mascarpone included.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I didn't.  Just straight mozzarella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it does make thirty batches of mozzarella.  So it's quite economical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Thirty batches.  I'm so excited.  My wife was she was serious.  She was just like you are never going to do this.  I'm like I am so going to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll come over.  Let's have a cheese pulling party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Maybe on New Year's.  I'll make cheese.  In the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good segment.  And now as we approach New Year's in Ghana.  Gina Trippani will join us to show us how to make cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  You're like here are some saligny balls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think you stretch.  It's like taffy right.  Mozzarella you got to stretch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It just looks.  Yeah.  I've never done it.  I'm a bad Italian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's about time.  Come on.  I want it.  That's funny.  Sorry.  Sorry for the.  I used to make pasta till I realized you could just go buy it.  Ella is a cheese maker from Calgary.  That's cool.  You know what.  This is what Kickstarter is all about.  We did talk about Google Reader shutting down.  There's been petitions.  Hundreds of thousands of signatures.  Nobody's that's not going to change anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  No.  What did you think?  I know Jeff was pretty upset about it.  I saw Jeff ranting.  I was I was imagining the bumper of Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On Twitter saying, you know, did they close Reader after the show?  So we haven't talked about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  They did.  We have not.  So I think it was a Friday.  One of these Friday news drops.  OK.  We kind of buried in one of their spring cleaning bullet point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We talk about Andy Rubin.  In the pope.  We did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK.  Talk about it.  I'm so confused.  So Andy Rubin was first and then they killed Google Reader.  So 500,000 people sign up for Feedly.  I signed up for Feedly.  It is not a Google Reader replacement.  I'm sorry.  It's OK.  It's too pretty.  Here it did.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Why not?  It did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It did import all my Google Reader content.  And so the one that I often do is tech news.  And so this is kind of Google Reader like.  This looks very Reader-y.  Yeah, I guess it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  There's old Reader.  That's the one that looks like Reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The old Reader dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, there's who's the old Reader dot com.  The old Reader.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This was made a while back when Google broke sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You said, oh, you've got to share on Plaspid.  It doesn't work.  The old Reader said, well, we can recreate that.  So if you go there and import your subscription, it has the  share-y stuff that Reader used to have.  Now, can they scale up to accommodate all the unloved  Google Reader users?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the question.  Because there is some sort of a

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  sort of a  sort of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  sort of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because there is some server side, quite a bit of server.  Is there not, Kevin?  What's involved?  What is the cost of running a Reader service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the challenge is the crawling.  And the reason that Reader sort of took over and became the  central sink point for everyone was because Google does it as  a side effect of their main web crawl, which means that  they're crawling the entire web all the time anyway.  They've got very good at knowing when things changed.  And so that is a lot easier than the classic  feed updating problem.  So the feed updating problem is, the point of a feed is, it  gives you a list of the articles and you know when they've  changed, but you still have to check the feed.  And so you have to go and check the feed every so often to see  when it's updated.  And the way we used to do that was we had ping servers, so  called.  There was several of them.  Dave Weiner ran one.  We ran one at Techlarati.  There was a couple others.  I remember that, yeah.  And you would put the URLs of those into your blogging  software, and it would poke that and say, I've just updated.  The problem with those became that they, you know, spammers  would just ping them all the time.  So by the time Dave Weiner sold the weblogs one to VeriSign, it  was like 95% spam.  I was at Techlarati at the time.  We would read all the firehoses from these ping servers and  then run them through spam filters and decide which ones to  make sense.  And it was very hard to get utility out of that.  So there was a spam problem with those.  And then, you know, we were trying to build protocols for  sharing stuff, basically a sort of big shared ping server  thing.  name of that does a fairly good job of this.  And then there are also the big blogging platforms have their  recently updated pages or feeds that you can plug into.  There are two or three ways of doing that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can also do it client side, can't you, with like a client  app like NetNewsWire?  You can do it with a client app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was the other way of doing it.  But the challenge of that is that you've then got lots of  client apps hitting your blog all the time.  So you've got a popular blog and you've got 100,000 readers.  You're getting 100,000 people calling you all the time.  So it's a hardship on the blog.  So it's a hardship on the blog.  And it's a hardship on your phone if it's polling everything  all the time like that too.  So there's value in doing it as a cloud side service, I think,  in the cloud.  And there's also value in amortizing that crawl across  lots of users, which Google was effectively doing.  And also because they're calling the whole web anyway,  they were very good at telling when something could actually  change.  It's quite hard to work out what's really going on because  time zones, people have their clocks set wrong, and people  change something and suddenly their entire feed gets  republished and a whole bunch of stuff like that happens.  So when I was doing the Tenerati crawl, there was a, you know,  it was like, oh, look, this thing's in the future.  It was a common problem.  It's a very common problem, yeah.  You can trust the site.  You know the time you crawled it, but you don't know the  time they published it.  Right.  And Google's crawl is big enough and comprehensive enough  and not blocked by anyone.  So they were very good at crawling everything.  So that, they effectively displaced the entire  infrastructure there because they would let you tap into it.  And it wasn't a formal API.  It's a sort of undocumented backend that lots of people use  and the team informally connected with them, but they  never went through the official Google API process to put it  out there, which means it's not going through the official  deprecation process where they say when they'll turn it off.  It's just going to vanish when they turn the product off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It seems like Google should keep this going if only as a  public service, right?  That would be nice.  Not even for people who use Reader, but because it's doing  this crawling anyway, it could really offload both of the  blogs.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there was this, so this is, there's a group that was  formed called Open Access Coalition, which is semi-related  to this, that Kevin Burton of Spinner and what's his face?  What's his face does so much these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's really too busy.  I think he should stop doing so many things.  It seems like he's doing almost everything nowadays,  especially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  So you think you should keep the product, you think they  should keep the entire product running as a public service or  just the unofficial API?  I mean, since the API was totally unofficial, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Greg, sorry, Greg Kidd of ThreeTaps.  So they've put this Open Access Coalition.org to fight for the  ability for people to write web crawlers.  And this is an important issue.  The reason Google exists is because you can crawl the web  and download the stuff and make sense of it.  And people don't restrict that.  Anil wrote about this this week as well about we should have  weird user agents because the user agent is the client side  app you use to connect to the web and make sense of it.  And a lot of sites are now saying we will only let you  connect to us if you're one of these known browsers.  Facebook does that now.  You can no longer.  Really?  If you try and curl a Facebook URL, it'll say you don't have  a recognized browser.  Wow.  So this crawlability has been reduced.  Also, people, you put a lot of stuff in their robots.txt that  says only the Googlebot can crawl me, which is tricky if  you're Bleco or if you're Bing or somebody else trying to  crawl.  So yeah, there is a problem here.  Now, there are some other crawlers out there.  There's obviously Bing.  If Bing wanted to steal a march on Google and say we're now  the open company as Google is the closed company, they can  say we'll provide this API for people.  What feeds have been updated and which ones have changed  API people as part of our crawl.  And it would probably help their crawl as well because they  would get, then people will be motivated to plug things into  that.  Open up.  Yeah.  So I can see that if someone.  Microsoft.  I'm just thinking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Huge opportunity for Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're already crawling the web.  They're already doing it.  So it's just like you just write a MapReduce that feeds this  stuff out to the site, which is what all that happened at  Google.  The reason that Reader could be built by three guys at Google  was because they could use the existing crawl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Microsoft, there's a guy right here who knows how to do that.  He'll write you a MapReduce.  No problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just trying to say I write my MapReduce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's probably done it a few times already.  Just take an old one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So then the other thing there is, is there's this group called  Common Crawl.  Common Crawl.org, which is a crawler that dumps its data into  an Amazon thing and then you can run scripts against it.  So that's an interesting project.  I know I've seen Pete Warden has done some interesting stuff  with that.  So the idea of that is it's supposed to be web crawl data  that could be used to make sense of this.  So there's that.  The other piece of this that could be valuable is PubSubHubbub,  if you remember that.  Oh, yeah.  So PubSubHubbub is designed for this problem of what's updated  when.  And the idea is you have a PubSubHubbub server and you publish  your stuff to that and people who want it subscribe to that  server and say, call me when it's updated.  And there's a verification protocol to check that they are  who they say they are and the callback URL works.  So then you post your thing to there and then it does the fan  out of that to lots of, you know, all the people who subscribed.  And those are chainable.  So you could actually build PubSubHubbub networks.  So that's still there.  That was actually part of the reader infrastructure.  There's one that's hosted by Google that Brett Slackin built  that's still running and that Vida was plugged into.  I hope they'll keep that up as well.  So what's kind of happening is that somebody called it the  breakup of the Soviet Union.  It's like all these old battles that were frozen when this thing  takeover are coming back again now.  So we're going to have an interesting discussion in protocol  space for the next few weeks as we try and put these together.  So in some ways it's annoying that Google have done this.  It's very annoying that Google never did a proper API for it in  the first place.  And we've got this sort of weird reverse engineered thing.  But we may be able to build something interesting and open out of this.  That's my hope for a big chunk of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So to be clear, the fact that Feedly and I presume others, I'm  looking at Bazcux, B-A-Z-Q-U-X.com that imports your OPML and gives  you a very kind of Google reader-like interface.  And you mentioned the old reader.  The fact that these companies do this isn't really a solution.  You don't want a million of these going around.  What you really want is a centralized repository.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, I mean, it depends how they're doing it.  What you really want is to define a good API between the cache of all  that's changed and the client-side app.  And at the moment there's an API that was designed by a bunch of guys at  Google for their particular purposes and is being used by other apps for that.  It would make sense to spend a bit of time converging that together and  saying what is the good API between that?  So that may be a conversation that's going on.  But the other part is, we've had, the other thing is that a lot of this  infrastructure is creaky as anything.  The feeds are messy things.  Most of them are invalid.  And you have to have a lot of, there's a lot of, if you look at the  Universal Feed Passer, which is the best feed passer that I know about, it has  something like 3,500 test cases that it runs to, and most of them are bad feeds  and have to deal with them.  And they grew from finding bad feeds.  Mark Pilgrim spent a big chunk of time getting that right and a lot of us  fed stuff into that.  So the assumption that feeds are these beautiful things that work is  actually, most of them are broken and there's a lot of fudging that makes  this stick them together.  It's really a shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, Google was doing the crawling.  Google had the code.  Wasn't much to maintain it.  I first thought, oh, this is a great opportunity for companies like Feedly.  Black Pixel, which owns Net Newswire, says, hey, good news.  We're working on new versions for the Mac, the iPhone, and the iPad.  That was a great news reader on the Mac side.  So an opportunity for them, but really not really the ideal long-term solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the challenge is who's using this?  The reason this is shut down is because this is those of us who were the  text-heavy web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not sure that's the case.  I have to think it has more to do with Google pushing Google Plus than it does  with the lack of use of the Google reader.  Same reason they took out Share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They haven't had that many users, but it's had lots of use.  It's had lots of usage, if you see what I mean.  The people who use it use it intensively.  But it is those of us who read long-form text.  And we're a small minority of the web these days.  So the question is, do we preserve this sort of long-form text parallel  infrastructure, or do we try and merge it with the Twitter, Facebook,  Pinterest flow of millions of updates that are built on sort of similar ideas,  but with a very different sort of cadence of update?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dave Weiner himself said when he heard about this, well, you know,  the inbox model is kind of out of date.  The News River model makes more sense, that Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Totally agree with him on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've had a reader configured to be a river for a while.  I mean, you can turn off the unread counts, and that makes it much less  inboxy.  And then you can decide which, you know, you can pick a...  What it is, it's a sort of series of rivers.  You can put them in folders, and then you can get a river for each folder.  And that's the piece that I find useful.  And I end up with like one main one that I look at most of the time,  and I have some other ones that I'll check now and then.  And if you look, you know, Facebook has just made...  Their redesign thing is kind of that.  They've got tabs that you switch between to see different rivers in there.  And obviously the various Twitter clients that give you columns that are  now mostly owned by Twitter have that sort of worldview as well.  So there is a...  There is some...  I agree that the river is right and that when we are converging on that  view, but there is value in having these rarely updated ones that you look  at as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dave says in a conversation with Max Levchin on Twitter, he says,  so it looks like there are three possible outcomes.  This is Dave Weiner, one of the instrumental guys in RSS.  He says, Google readers' demise, one, Google readers' demise is also the end  of RSS, he says, which seems to me is Google's desired outcome based on other  things they've done.  Two, as market develops, or a market develops, but we're unable to get the new  features into it that simplify the subscription process so it has a chance  like Twitter.  Or three, a new dominant reader comes about and if they're good then maybe  something good happens.  He says, I don't think there's the slightest possibility of that.  Number three happening, people in tech are too insular, they don't study prior  art or even study their competition enough to know where the problems are,  much less where the potential solutions are.  You think more likely a mix between one and two, a continued decline for RSS,  and more and more reliance on big companies that couldn't care less, like Twitter.  That's depressing.  That's a depressing outcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  Dave Weiner's blocked me on Twitter so I can't read what he's tweeting.  Good old Dave.  There is a difference of, I still see retweets sometimes, but there is a difference  between the centralization and the centralizing, and he's right.  The stuff he built was decentralized, it meant lots of us could build on it.  Again, Anil and I were reminiscing about this, but we were able to build these  things that had an interop layer, and it was a, not a beautiful interop layer,  but it worked, we could glue it together.  The difficulty is that lots of the things that were built since were effectively  blogging within one company.  Even Delicious was like, oh, it's a link blog except that the tags bridge across  Delicious, isn't that nice, we've got a link there.  Tumblr is exactly that.  Tumblr is a blog with an update system that feeds inside itself so that you can  repost things and they stay within Tumblr.  Obviously Twitter and Medium and the other things that are like this have those  same characteristics, which is it's very easy for them to interop with themselves  and it gets harder and harder for them to interop with each other.  One of the nice things about 10 years ago in blogging was that we had multiple mature  clients that actually behaved fairly well with each other, publishing things and  reading things.  That is a piece that's sort of being damaged by the centralization stuff.  Maybe this is a chance for us to try and rebuild that, but I spent a chunk of time  trying to do this with OpenSocial, trying to make these feeds interoperate and it's  hard.  It is a hard problem.  It's hard to get companies to realize it's in their interest to do this, especially  when they've got a large user base and they like the ability to shut people down.  Facebook did it again this week.  Somebody started building a successful messaging thing and they said, oh, we're  shutting you down, boy.  They like that ability and to some extent, you need to shut down spammers.  We did have a spam problem with blogs.  There was a time when Blogger itself was a giant spam factory because it was very easy  to set up scripts to generate blogs and post there and feed them into the rest of the  infrastructure.  It took a while for Google to realize that and clean that out.  There are problems with this and how you plug this together.  It is hard to maintain who gets to talk to whom with this, but we've come up with more  models.  The following model and the subscription model actually does make some sense and we've  seen that idea spreading out into other places.  The challenge is, as Dave was saying in that post you quoted, making that work in a way  that bridges between the systems is the valuable piece and the piece that we need to spend  some time doing in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let you choose how you want to see.  He also points out, he says, I never use Google.  I didn't trust Google.  He says, make sure if you're going to support something like this that it has a business  model, you're paying for it so that there's some incentive for them to keep running it.  I hope you're enjoying this best of this week in Google.  We'll be back next Wednesday with a this week in God, but you're exhausted because it's going  to be New Year's Day.  We are doing a show in New Year's Day, Chad.  Is that true?  Yeah, it's true.  Holy cow.  Well, I'll be exhausted because I'll have been up all night.  I hope you're going to stop by for our New Year's Eve party.  Meanwhile, we're looking back at the best of 2013 and a little battle over something  Google like to call the Chromebook watch.  So I said the pixel back.  I canceled my pixel order and Jeff says I'm wrong, wrong, wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I have a video showing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I should show the verge pops up on my pixel and scrolls quite responsibly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Scrolls just dandy.  Gina tried to tell you it was your machine.  I'm just going to enjoy this going back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If there were more pixels, I could go see if there's a tiebreaker.  But I don't the next time I see somebody with a pixel.  Look at that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  You're moving.  I might say you moved very gently into that.  Oh, jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You must have been a real pain in the ass on a playground argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  My only point is that and I don't care how the verge scrolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My only point was that for that price.  No, no.  For that.  Well, I was using as an example for that price.  It should be a much faster, more responsive computer.  It should be a much faster, more responsive computer.  It is not.  I find it very fast.  Very fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  And it works just dandy for me.  After using it for a couple of days, I felt like, God, this is frustrating

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because it's just kind of not responsive.  It feels a little jerky, a little.  Well, again, you got the wrong machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  That's what I'm telling you.  Last week, your entire complaint was the verge went up slowly and it did on the video.  And so I was.  You can't do it because you're in Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't do it.  But I did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  As soon as I got home, I said, I'll record this for you.  I can sit down.  I go to the board.  But you didn't have it full screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you weren't really testing.  She will know that's that's your main because what you want to do is fill the screen, fill the pixels.  The point is that my point was that the graphics card in that is insufficient for the number of pixels on the screen, which is true.  But if you're not going to see that, if you have a window, you have to go full screen on the verge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  I don't want to be your roommate, the old folks home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I think we should just have a pixel throwdown at Google.  We'll get those those wrestler bouncy suits, you know, and you guys can just go at it.  The middle of Moscone.  Well, I stand by I stand my review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was not a broken pixel.  It's a lot of pixels to push.  It's not at all surprising with Intel Motherboard HD 4000 graphics that that is too many pixels to push.  You won't know until you put a very demanding full screen web page on there.  But you will see it in day to day operations because it's a very high res screen.  Now, that's the advantage.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  I've been using it for three weeks now and I'm telling you, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're a perfect person to own the pixel then because you don't notice the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Vance McAllister wrote a wonderful post on Google+.  He wrote actually as a comment on my post under that video.  Right. And I read that.  Yeah, the Adelio video.  Yeah.  And I asked him to make a whole post so we can put up there.  It's very, very good.  And he explores why this is so polarizing.  Well, I'll tell you why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You guys have Stockholm syndrome.  You wasted your money on that.  And now you have to justify why it's a good purchase.  I haven't received it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  I'm still using the loaner machine.  It's not too late to cancel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Actually, it is.  It's not too late.  It's not too late.  No, well.  I was thrilled when I canceled it.  I was able to do so.  Look, there are some real advantages.  I won't deny it to Chrome OS.  It's secure.  If you're content to just run a browser and to do your email in the browser and everything  in the browser, it's fine.  That's what I do.  But it's an awful lot of money to pay for such a constrained machine when you could  pay less for a full machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  I can't fully.  See, that's the thing.  That's what Vance was saying, that there's this belief that the machine is the way they  were, is the machine is the way they should be, and that there's this belief that it's  somehow limited.  I'm on the web.  The web works fine.  I was thinking today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Jeff, I have to point out that you did install Linux on that and you had to to run  Skype, which you're using right now.  For you only because of Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  That's the only reason.  And if you guys would get your act together and get WebRTC or Google Hangout, we'd be  fine, which everybody says, why the heck isn't this show on Google Hangout?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because it looks terrible.  Just say it.  Because it looks terrible.  We could use Google Hangout, but it looks terrible.  And it sounds worse.  I cannot remember.  So some people don't.  So my point is, some people, it's like it's like you telling me, I love Chef Boyardee.  That's fine.  Eat Chef Boyardee.  I'm not saying you shouldn't, but it isn't necessarily great food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I like Armani suits, but I can tell you don't.  No, I don't.  Based on what you're wearing today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, Lisa's going to kill me because it's a Tennessee Titans shirt.  Graduate professor.  I love you anyway, Travis.  Jeff, I love you anyway.  You're not going to you're going to keep this up, huh?  We're going to have a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, just before the show, you're going to you're doing the Salting My Chromebook again.  You won't let it go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's my fault.  Oh, now it's my fault.  Yes, it is.  OK.  And Jeff is also a professor of journalism at City Hall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, they're out of the game.  No, no, no.  A resident of journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's, you know, would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You weren't really doing that.  Were you doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It's the picture.  I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And look, there's another person here also with us.  Lamar Wilson, YouTuber Lamar Wilson, the host of our show this week in YouTube every Sunday on the network.  How are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thanks to have you.  He's also, of course, on YouTube.  Lamar Wilson.  Hey, I got I got a YouTube story.  We'll lead off with a YouTube story.  You know, our show this week in YouTube blocked on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  What's blocked already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, not the show.  But the whole damn show, the latest episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's only one dude.  This is the first episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we have zero still on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But yeah, you're right.  Oh, yeah, there is an episode zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Zero survived.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So is it is it TWI YT on YouTube?  YouTube dot com slash TWA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's this week.  Why T this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why this week?  Why T?  We're now we're theorizing that maybe we don't get as much slack on this because we're a new YouTube channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet that's what it is.  That's why we need we have a contact at Google.  We need to push this probably to him because I think that's what it is.  It's a new account and and a lot of spam accounts come up new and they start putting up illegal content right away.  Right. They probably treating us no differently.  That's what I would guess. I would hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because so what the weird thing is that it was one of those automatic content things and it was by Cy.  Remember, Cy was very famous in his first video, Opal Gangnam style, that he let everybody do anything they wanted with it.  I don't know if they issued takedowns, but it was very free.  And there was it was I was never did.  No, no, no takedowns.  Well, boom, he's got a new song now.  I guess he's a big shot.  Doesn't need anybody.  We played just a few maybe 15, 20 seconds of his new video.  Right.  And talked a little bit about it.  How hard it might be to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It wasn't even the whole thing.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Which, by the way, sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But here's the interesting thing that Chad correct me if I'm wrong, but he said they say the audit, the automatic content filtered detected as a live performance of that song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the live performance of size of news.  The new song.  I don't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we appealed it.  They did have the appeal process and they said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, they said they said, sure, but it's going to take us.  It could take us up to a month to get to it, which which for a new show is a big deal.  That's episode one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We can make that go faster.  That's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we're going to we're going to pull in all our chits with people like you.  And you know what I think you should do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  You should go back and edit it.  You should just have a screen that says size is a jerk during that time.  That's a great idea, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we did that.  Except it's still except now that our account is no longer in good standing.  We can only upload videos less than 15 minutes long.  We'll have to have a mini show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have I have a guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  I have a guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll take care of it.  We're theorizing that because it's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  First of all, it's fair use.  We didn't play the whole song.  It's a new show.  It's commentary.  And normally we can make that appeal because we get knocked down all the time on all of  our channels.  But there's so many shows to do.  What's trending?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does this mean that's the basis of their show is to put other people's videos in there  and and they get away with it.  So yeah, but sure is a lot better looking than I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think that she this is accurate.  So now but let me show you.  I just got an email from YouTube.  It happens all the time.  This is I don't even know what show this is.  This might be a twit episode.  They just blocked it.  This video contains content from a Brazilian radio and TV.  It doesn't, by the way, from either of these in a Hungarian television station.  Met one or more of whom have blocked it.  They pulled this video down.  Even though there is, I guarantee you, no Brazilian or Hungarian content at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  There have to be penalties for these bad take down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This happens so much we need some sort of slap shield law or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And from an article I think we saw and we talked about maybe two weeks ago.  I have to dig it up.  This may actually get worse with some new rules.  Remember, we talked about this universal got in got in.  UMG.  Yeah.  And so there's there might not be any appeal process.  That's something you you actually brought to light the episode before.  I think you should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  I mean, I think you should threaten Psy and these these scumbags with suits.  Counter suits.  Yeah. Yeah.  So they'll be there.  They're clearly losing business.  There's there's there's there's tangible damage to you.  I think that's going to turn this around a bit.  And Google finds itself in the middle of those things.  They don't want that.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And like I said, we have a rep that reached out to us.  They like to show that they've blessed the show.  They don't have a plan.  Right.  With YouTube in the name.  And so that's the guy I said I was going to reach out to because he asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He said, if you have any trouble, let me know.  Hey, guess what?  We've got trouble.  But so I don't I mean, I'm not going to whine about this.  But but what it does raise is this larger issue.  If YouTube wants, how do they balance this?  I mean, I remember when YouTube started before Google bought it.  We were talking to the founders of I think was Jeffrey Chen.  We were talking to one of the founders of YouTube.  And I asked him that question.  This was the six month old startup.  Aren't you going to get sued out of existence?  And he didn't have really a very good he said no, but he didn't have a very good answer.  I think he was already negotiating with Google.  I have to think that this was the best way to save this company is to pair up with Google.  Google's response is no, we're going to use the safe harbor provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  We're going to offer DMC takedowns and content providers will have a good recourse.  But now it's swung so far in the opposite direction that independent content creators like me and I'm sure others write Lamar are getting hurt by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's it's so many people that are getting hit by this.  And some like again, journalists like like yourself or just people who are innocently just trying to create good content or commentary are getting hit unfairly.  And again, there may be no appeal process in the future.  And I think on one hand, on a business side, they feel like they have to do this to to keep everybody happy.  That's on the business side.  But it hurts content creators like us, obviously.  And so I don't see a way out of this unless we do what Jeff said and some type of legal action.  I can't I can't go around suing Hungarian television and Brazilian radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not going to I don't I'm not litigious.  I think you're right, Jeff.  That would be a good thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  But I think there's an opportunity here for the likes of an EFF to to to give cover to a Google to say that there's there's a real tangible business damage that's being caused here.  And we can't just willy nilly.  Well, take this and the good forces Google to say that if you issue three bad take down notices in a row, you're out for a month.  Let's let's penalize them.  So there's a couple of yeah, there's a couple of things that come to mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  First of all, I think and I've mentioned this before that people are gaming it.  I don't think either this Brazilian or Hungarian.  Now, normally what I would say is they wouldn't do a take down.  They'd want to have ads placed on our content and make a little money off it.  So a take down, I don't understand the benefit of that, but it's obviously an erroneous take down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  But the second point because the ad ran on there on that channel.  And so they're matching.  I mean, the video that you featured also ran on this.  No, I hope not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Maybe they did some commentary.  I mean, you know, maybe kind of a similar thing, right?  I mean, I don't know.  And then the bot sort of erroneously picked up, made the match run related.  I don't know.  I'm trying to imagine, you know, how this happened.  But anyway, so go ahead, Leo.  I didn't mean to interrupt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's one issue.  And that both those videos are down.  In fact, our channel, our This Week in YouTube channel is down now because we can't upload content to it more than longer than 15 minutes.  But then there's the second issue, which somebody in the chat room pointed out.  What this does do is point is push independent people like Lamar and others to go work for these YouTube partner channels because the YouTube partner channels have the cloud and to protect you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is interesting because I feel like that's what YouTube wants to happen.  At first, I wonder why YouTube allows thinking allowed these networks to exist in the beginning.  But YouTube is still going to get they still take their what is a 45 percent cut no matter what.  So they don't care if a network comes in and wants to cut cut you out some more.  It takes the pressure off them to be able to have to offer technical support to have to offer any kind of support.  They can say, hey, you talk to your network and then they'll have a rep who will handle the whole network.  So I think that's where they're moving to where their hands off is the hey, a universal made a deal with maker or whoever it is that that's their business.  You deal with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think that's just the wrong direction, because I think the whole beauty of YouTube is the democratizing nature of it that gives anybody a kid in, you know, in Hungary who wants to do a show a chance to do a show and get global distribution.  But if he's at a major disadvantage because big companies can stomp on him, I don't think that, you know, what proportion of your views comes on YouTube?  It's not hugely significant that one that they pulled down had about five thousand views.  But this week in YouTube is going to be a little more significant.  It's a show about YouTube and not being able to post those shows on YouTube hurts us pretty badly.  I just I think it also should make people question whether YouTube should be part of their distribution strategy that.  Yeah, the nice thing about YouTube is you get free bandwidth.  But if you have but if but if you get pulled off all the time, this is not a good way for you to consider.  Maybe you should look at Vimeo or somebody else.  That's going to hurt you. I think that hurts YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, it does. It'll be interesting to see what they say when you speak to your contact.  It sounds like you need to talk to a human. Yeah, I mean, email him already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So he'll get back to us. I have a Python script that can interact with them beautifully.  I've been writing.  I'm just looking if there's anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  There's an amazing. Have you seen the kids guide to the Internet, Leo?  No, I haven't. Oh, you must. It's on. It's under other.  It's a you can. Others were all the best stuff is part of it. All right.  This is this was made. I thought this had to be a joke.  Lauren Weinstein said no, it's not because he looked at all the stuff.  It's pretty amazing. It's old, though, right? This is not. It's oldest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's it's a 90s. Adjust the VCR tracking for a clear picture.  Maybe that might be a giveaway. Yeah, I thought it was a hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  That's that's a bad sign. It is, man. It just took a lot of work.  You want to hometown television presents. Well, I just want to see the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I always like to I wonder I might have worked on this. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you might. You could have been bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah. On the Internet, cyberspace, sex free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  When we installed Internet access on our computer, I got the whole family involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's true. Everybody had their own tasks to do. It was a lot of work, but it was really worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Now that I've gotten on the Internet, I'd rather be on my computer than doing just about anything.  It's really true. The Internet gave us a whole world of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, there's naked ladies on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So I guess this is a story of how it changed our lives.  Maybe it will yours, too, with the kids' guide to the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Take a scan now. You're in with the techno set. You're going surfing on the Internet.  Who is this aimed at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As Rich told you, we installed the Internet on our computer just a short time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  I wonder how do you install the Internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We installed the Internet on our computer just a short time ago.  And already it's laden with viruses, spyware, and malware.  And Dad's getting the Viagra spam every minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  I don't like the typical computer games that all the kids enjoy, but their curiosity for learning has skyrocketed.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dad, I'd like to go into my bedroom now and learn some more on the Internet if you don't mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  And that is my favorite subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not to mention the improvement in Peter's grades.  And Dasha's, too.  Having the Internet in our home has had a great impact on our lives.  Rich keeps up with the stock market and our investments, and I'm able to pay the bills and have the time...

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Hey, he has a few secret cyber affairs on the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dad's been very busy.  He says he has an Internet nickname, Carlos Danger.  Look at the Netscape browser. I love the navigator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  The next thing you'll type will be specific, directing you to a particular website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  MTV, a co-producer of this, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Or you can just surf the net using a search engine to help you locate information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What search engine? Online MTV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I have the World Wide Web to search the archives of the Smithsonian Museum a few weeks ago.  I also had to do a homework assignment about the Wright brothers for a history assignment.  Can you show us what you found?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That Smithsonian really does the state of the art, huh?  The sad thing is we all remember exactly when the Internet looked just like that.  Street View.  Street View.  By the way, I do believe you had to set up windows to do that waving window cursor.  That wasn't the default.  That's the worst.  It was an hourglass, right? You had to turn it into the waving, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  We just figured it out. Look, I'll show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All you have to do is go to Playboy.com.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Isn't this amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Netscape, the color... Oh, remember the color wizard? I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, all about rainbows.  You know, seriously, I worked on shows very much like this.  I did a show, a PBS show called The Internet.  And it was pretty much this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Does it exist, Leo? Have you shown it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  God, I hope not.  Oh, please. Oh, please.  I hope it's long gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bounty.  I don't have it. I certainly don't have a copy, but I bet you somebody in the chat room will find it and humiliate me in public.  Oh, Lord.  I remember Gina Smith did one where she was driving in a convertible down the information superhighway.  I don't know if there was singing involved.  There's Al Gore over there.  Look, there's my imaginary family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  All right.  I think we have to be finally found our replacement theme song for this week in Google.  Hey, maybe, you know what? Let's listen to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what? Can we use that, you think, with impunity?  Do you think hometown productions would mind?  Cyberspace, it says what we want it to say.  Cyberspace sets us free.  I can we can we just steal that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you find out who has the rights when you post this on YouTube.  Perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, on the Internet.  That was such a catchy song.  I love that video.  Now, you know all about the Internet and how it works.  Hello, everybody. You're watching the best of this week in Google.  I'm Father Leo of the Church of the Red Hot Holy Peppers.  I like that we couldn't find my Santa hat.  So this is a Google slanket.  I do have Santa on my shirt.  And this is festive.  All right.  You if you've watched the show all year long, you know that Jeff Jarvis.  It's a little upset.  He is upset all the time, but he was particularly upset about the fact that Verizon would not allow him to use his LTE based Nexus seven on their network.  My mistake.  I didn't know this and I asked him about it.  Hilarity ensued.  Hey, speaking of which, did you get your Nexus seven LTE version yet?  No, no, I wanted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  It's for sale every day.  Every day of day I search for Nexus seven LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Can't you tell me when we're going to get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  No.  And now here's the latest in dignity.  It's for sale in Germany, the UK, France.  I'm telling you, France gets it first.  What the hell's wrong here?  How dare they?  That Frenchies.  That's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, you have friends in Germany though.  Just get them the same one.  No, because it's different frequencies.  You don't want the German version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, right.  You want the US version.  Good point.  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Nice job.  We don't get stuff all the time in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm pretty used to it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You are.  There's no point in getting a Canadian Ryle death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the nice Canadian thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead.  Screw us and we'll apologize for it.  Sure.  Send it to us a couple years later.  We're not like that down here, Ingram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I want my Nexus LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, Matt, you really have to adopt the American sense of entitlement if you're going to be  on Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right.  Get with it.  Where's my Chromecast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  I had this vision today that somebody with a sense of humor at Google would put it on  for sale right now during the show and I had to order it during the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll order it for you.  I've gotten very good at talking and ordering crap at the same time.  It's amazing life skill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can get stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  And this week I got some good news, I thought.  I got my Nexus 7 LTE.  I've been waiting for it for weeks.  I've been waiting for it to go on sale.  I finally got to order it last week.  It didn't arrive before the show and here it came on Friday.  And I was so happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  All your dreams came true, right, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  No!

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Watch out.  All your dreams came true, Jeff.  You waited so long for this tablet to buy it.  You have it now.  This is it.  This is what you've been hoping for.  I know you're a picky guy.  You have very high standards.  You have very specific things that you want.  And now it's in your hands.  What's wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  How's that LTE working?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yo, you're cruel.  You're cruel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  So, so I am going psychotic on Verizon because Verizon will not hook up my Nexus LTE.  Now you remember when it was announced months ago.  Google said it was going to work.  The first device that was going to work on AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon on LTE.  Wow.  There was a slide.  See, in coming weeks, Verizon right there.  And so I walk into the Verizon store on Saturday and I say, Hi, I want to give you more money.  I want to add this to my shared data collection there, right?  Well, one snotty little smart ass clerk came over and said, You can't.  You can't.  It doesn't work.  You can't.  I said, No, no, no, no.  You don't understand.  I looked up things on the line.  I should look.  Verizon LTE, this device.  Yes, yes, yes.  So I got a nice clerk.  And I got a manager over as I glared at the other clerk.  And they tried to put in the IMEI for this device.  Wouldn't take it.  Wouldn't take it.  All around.  So they said, Well, maybe it's just not ready yet.  I said, Oh, they've had months.  How ridiculous.  But this happened with my Chromebook Pixel 2.  Where I went in and tried to get the deal, the $10 a month deal that they had.  And it wasn't in a SKU in there.  And I figured, OK, so they messed up.  Big old Verizon.  Well, they're not rich enough, but fine.  I have them call Verizon HQ.  They try to do something.  They can't do it either.  But I figure, OK, this is frustrating.  I'm mad.  But I leave calmly.  I leave with a smile on my face.  I say, Thanks for your help, guys.  I get back home.  And of course, I go to Twitter.  And I say, Oh, VZW support.  I need your help again.  Can you get my device hooked up?  Because I want to be a happy customer.  I wait until days.  And then I get this response.  You can put it back up again, Chad.  I'm excited.  You got your Nexus 7.  But not all LTE tablets are created equal.  It's not part of our lineup and can't be activated.  I'm laying there like the turd it is.  So I have psychotic fits all around.  And then people remind me that Verizon got the LTE spectrum C block,  as it's called, block C rather, in the 700 megahertz band,  on the condition which Google managed to push into the spectrum auction,  the condition that it be open.  And Chad, if you could go back to it,  you see that first block quote,  that it must be offered that no licensees, quote, shall not deny, limit,  or restrict the ability of their customers to use the devices  and applications of their choice on the licensees C block network,  except in so far as there's technical problems or other regulations or statutes.  Well, this is a device that has been approved by the FCC.  This is an LTE device.  It works on AT&T.  It works on T-Mobile.  And I have a SIM for T-Mobile, by the way, because it came with the device.  Nice deal, one month free.  Thank you very much.  Everybody's saying, why did you just hook up T-Mobile?  Well, because, number one, I have a shared device account on Verizon,  thanks to my Chromebook, Pixel, Google,  how could you have made this a Verizon-only device?  My family has their iPads on Verizon.  What can I do about that?  And so it's going to cost me more if I use this on T-Mobile or something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  And plus, there's just the justice of it, the justice of it.  By God, Verizon, you will connect my Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  So I go around, I'm about to end this here.  I go around and around and around.  I go on Twitter.  A lot of folks come in, huge response on Google Plus and on Twitter to this.  People saying, yeah, why don't you learn Verizon sucks.  Verizon's awful. Go to T-Mobile.  T-Mobile's better.  And I keep on saying, no, I'm going to force them into it.  And then nice folks at Free Press sent me their complaints to the FCC more than a year ago.  And last July, the FCC had a consent decree against Verizon for $1.25 million  because Verizon at the time was forcing Google to take applications  that had tethering out of the Play Store.  That's not open.  And so Verizon was told you have to do this.  And Verizon said, oh, yes, we will.  And earlier when Google had complained about Verizon's behavior  and sent a very tough letter, Verizon got back and said, oh, Google, how can you?  You're just being catty. No, no, no, no.  We are going to be open. Of course we're going to be open.  Look at all the ways we're going to be open.  I tried to find that full post, which had been quoted on our technical, but of course Verizon has erased it.  So this goes on and on and on around and around.  I then get another tweet from Verizon saying once again, or the technical equivalent thereof.  And so today I wrote and sent a formal complaint to the Federal Communications Commission  enforcement division saying, go after them, bastards.  And so I'm not going to rest.  I am not going to rest until we bring Verizon to justice, because this was the whole point of the notion of openness is that we have the choice.  We have the control and Verizon.  Take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Good for you, Jeff. Good for you.  I love that you wrote a formal letter complaint because, you know, you can go back and forth on Twitter, but that's it's 2013 to L.  Hell. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  I want to rename it Del Hell to tell hell now.  And it's just it's just absolutely ridiculous.  It's galling and the attitude they have.  So Verizon PR didn't respond to me for days.  And then finally, after I posted it, they came back and they sent me a link to their certification requirements.  But the problem is, if I go buy a phone here that's unlocked and on GSM and I go to Europe, all I have to do is put a CIM in it.  And it works. There's no certification. There's no this.  There's no that.  I've taken my my Nexus 40 Europe before, you know, it was sold there and no problem.  It just works.  That's the point of having an open standard, which is what GSM and LTE are exactly on Twitter have said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  That's exactly right, Jeff.  I mean, these are protocols, right?  I mean, all you have to say is I adhere to the protocol, right?  So I've enabled the chip in my device adheres to whatever the standard is, whatever the protocol is, and it should just work.  That's why these things exist.  That's the whole reason people do these things, come up with these protocols.  And there should be no there should be no question about it.  Right. And I think that's why that's T-Mobile's whole value prop, right, is bring bring your own device.  Just come in and it should work and use us.  And don't worry about Verizon and all this crap that they send your way.  The other thing is, I wonder how much of this is because they don't have crap where loaded on on the Nexus seven.  I wonder if they're trying to hold up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  The second tweet I got from Verizon support when they said, no, no, no, it can't be activated.  They said, here's a link to all the nice things will sell you instead of the thing that you brought.  So that's consumer fraud. That's bait and switch.  That's a big problem. And by the way, when they say it can't be activated, that is a bald faced lie.  Verizon, because I did take the SIM out of my Chromebook Pixel.  I did put it into the Nexus seven LTE.  And guess what? Bomo, it does work.  So it's not a question of it can't work, can't work on the network.  It's a question of Verizon won't let it work on the network.  And this is Verizon's control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It looks like Verizon posted a statement about this today.  Virgil just posted in the chat room. I put it under your rant on the rundown.  Jeff statement on Verizon wireless device certification.  The Google Nexus seven is not yet a Verizon 4G LTE certified device, though it entered our process in August.  We expect it to be certified shortly.  Once the device is certified, we will work with Google to enable the device to be activated on a 4G LTE network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  That's such a bald faced lie right there.  Because again, it already works on the network because that's the standard.  As Erin just said, you can put it in there.  The thing that Verizon won't do is give me a SIM and put it on my account.  So there's no matter of certification here. That's horse poopy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, they're saying that their testing protocol is the most rigorous of any carrier.  And it's focused on guarding the safety and security of their network done by third party labs.  It takes four to six weeks.  Hmm. Interesting. Interesting.  Pot thickens.  Four to six weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  So what did you guys say about it on LLTWan Android last night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well, we were just we were relishing the thought of your rant today.  I was promoting it because I said you get to hear about Jeff's LTE experience.  And we pulled up your post on the show.  I thought I was rather rather reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  I kept I kept a less than usual pink face.  Yeah, that was a good one. It was a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I love that you filed a formal complaint with the FCC.  And I bet that this statement by Verizon looks like it was published today at 18 that doesn't have a time.  So absolutely prompted by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Did you guys look at the the certification process that they like to take a look at it?  It's it's it's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Well, here's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I mean, so they have if you go to that that link that you just put in there, Gina,  and then click on and go down under the certification process.  Yeah, go to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Open network of Verizon.  That guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  And then under the little wrench there, there's certification process.  That's what I'm looking at right now.  Yes. View our certification.  So they've got four steps, right?  Review pre certification, which is conditional.  What does that mean?  Then they've got certification, which they test rigorously in our labs.  But they say they can test the device live over our network and see if it works.  And then look at the last one.  This is what I was getting at before.  Go to market.  Why do they need go to market in a technical certification?  We build external and internal awareness of your device through joint public relations  and the use of the Verizon certification logo, training our sales teams and listing your device in the device showcase.  So what they're saying is all of that stuff has to be done before it's technically certified.  We have to train our sales teams and do all this stuff.  I mean, that's a bunch.  I understand one, two and three.  I understand review pre certification and certification.  I don't understand why they need go to market to say that this is technically certified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  If it's a CDMA device, which is what Verizon normally is, of course, then it has, as someone explained to me on Twitter,  I'm sorry, I can't give you credit because I can't remember your silly Twitter handle,  that has root access to the device.  It is a security matter.  But as you said a few minutes ago, Aaron, this is a protocol.  This is an open standard protocol.  So I could go make a phone at my workbench.  And as long as I do it to the standards and I put a SIM in, it's going to work.  Verizon can't stop that.  And that's the irony of all this.  Verizon doesn't understand that they've entered an open world.  This is the first time they've really worked.  This is the first time they've faced, I think, an open GSM device on their network.  And this was the condition.  I can't repeat this often enough.  This was the condition of them winning the auction to get the LTE 700 MHz C block spectrum that they got.  Remember that Google entered into that auction not to win, but to put the pressure on,  to have the assurance that open devices would work.  Why? Because clearly Google saw this very day coming.  And here's the day here.  Now, mind you, there's another issue here.  Google has been silent about this.  I'm a little upset about that.  I've emailed Google PR.  But of course, the problem is that Google, love them dearly, have a show about them, wrote a book about them.  The one time they get in trouble is when they do deals with telcos.  And they've done devil's deals with Verizon.  And I'm sure they don't want to piss off Verizon too much.  But what's happening here is Verizon and Google are tweaking each other and we are stuck in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Yep. It puts users in a pinch.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  So can you you could pop in the T-Mobile sim and get your first free month.  And in theory, if what Verizon is saying is true, which I know you don't think it is true.  But while you wait for response to your official complaint and while Verizon reportedly goes through its certification process,  maybe by the time your month your free month is up, it'll it'll work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Yeah. And I'm you know, I've thought of doing that.  But right now I'm trying to stay true to the principle of this.  I'm just going to keep forcing Verizon to to to do what they're supposed to do under the law.  And other people said, well, if you just take a sim out of something else, put it in there, it works.  Well, it's fine. But then my my.  Then you don't have a sim in your pixel. Yeah. Yeah.  Now, they also the nice guy in the store said, well, the only workaround I can really do is I can try to get a sim going on a phone and put it in there.  But then the problem is that in the billing system, I'd be paying forty dollars a month instead of ten dollars a month for adding it.  Right. So this is all about business conditions and Verizon control.  It has nothing, nothing, nothing to do with technology certification.  Any of that AT&T and T-Mobile are not idiots.  They have much experience with GSM, much more than Verizon.  They are happily running this. Now, Google, by the way, when it came out with this device a week ago, they sold it with a T-Mobile sim.  That lasted about a week. And then they went they took it down for a day or for for part of a day and everybody got suspicious.  Then it went back up and a bit later they offer it now without a sim, with the T-Mobile sim or with an AT&T sim.  But notice not a Verizon sim. So here I am.  I'm trying to give Verizon business that Google promoting to go to others.  I'm trying to give them money. And the only thing that's happening here is in some freakish, horrible, anal control game that this corporation has to not let customers ever win anything.  Verizon, the truly evil company, the company that hands over all your metadata, the company that, by the way, we found out this week from The Guardian, phone companies never even tried to protest handing all of our data over to the NSA.  A Verizon executive this week also called Google and Microsoft and Yahoo and company grandstanders for fighting the NSA for our rights.  This is a company that does not give a damn about us as customers.  This is a company that still thinks it's mobile and has a monopoly and can tell us to go below.  Well, guess what, people? We've got Twitter. We've got Facebook. We've got fax machines. Yeah, I had to fax it to the FCC.  And we are not going to rest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Good for you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Best of right there.  All right. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Anything else to say about that rant? Anything that brilliant in the chat room going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Well, I think the only thing in the chat room that I noticed as you were talking is there is a, you know, the the only legal out they have from what you were saying is that there is a clause in there that says if a device could harm the network, then they can then they can.  So then that's their claim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Then there's a burden of proof on that. Yes.  There's a burden of proof to show it harms the network.  And it's not harm in AT&T. It's not harm in T-Mobile. It's not harm in GSM networks around the world, where, of course, it was available before it was available here, which was the subject of another rant.  Why France had it.  We didn't. Maybe I now understand why.  Maybe this has been a behind the scenes thing.  I don't know. I am eager for Google to say something about this in public.  I have I've gone to their public policy people and to their PR people.  And we'll see what comes out and I'll report all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Good for you.  Yeah, good for you.  Yeah, forget that T-Mobile, Sam.  Stick to the principle.  Let's put the screws to him.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Has anyone else have you found anyone else on Twitter or just sort of about out and about complaining about the same thing?  Have you been able to sort of get other people together?  I've found a lot of people who get a few things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Some who just took a sample from another device and before I did it showed to me that no, Jeff, this works.  And they demonstrated it to me very quickly.  So that's nice.  In fact, while I was in the Verizon store, I went to Twitter immediately while I was there and I said, I'm having this problem.  Everybody know anything.  And immediately somebody came back and said, well, I just took this.  I just got the device.  It works, Jeff.  So I got to be able to say to Verizon, no, this works on your network.  Here's the proof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  That's the beauty of all this, which also, by the way, always comes back to the power of Leo, to the power of Twitter.  Absolutely.  Because I don't have those kind of followers there except for this wonderful show and network.  So that worked out.  A lot of people on Google Plus have been saying, I was thinking about getting put on Verizon.  I'm not doing that.  And a surprising number of people, Gina.  This is a trend that I haven't seen.  Leo's been talking about how T-Mobile is pretty good.  T-Mobile is good around here.  You can use T-Mobile.  It's fine.  And what was happening on Google Plus is the number of people who said to heck with Verizon, not just because you have the sim, T-Mobile is actually good.  They have unlimited data plans.  They care about people.  I have a good customer service.  It was like 90% in favor of T-Mobile in this whole discussion, 10% of T-Mobile complaints where it's the opposite.  Where it's 95% complaining about Verizon and a few hangouts trying to defend Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  So were people saying I'm just going to switch because I don't want to deal with these people at all?  Because switch to T-Mobile in general?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Good.  And that's where, I mean, you've got to follow the money, right?  I mean, that's what's going to eventually get Verizon to take notice of this is if people start leaving.  I think that thank goodness for Jeff and his reach, right?  His virtual reach out through the ether, so to speak, to people.  Because if it were just like a normal person that had this problem, I mean, no one's going to notice, right?  So thank goodness Jeff's making it.  Because let's face it, I mean, how many customers are actually trying to do this?  Probably not that many at this point, right?  So it's not like someone pulled one of Verizon's key devices and says, hey, this doesn't work.  And it affects, you know, 80 million people, right?  So this probably affects a small subset.  And it's the small minority that doesn't have any voice really.  So thank goodness for Jeff.  Thank goodness you're raising this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  It's a very small concern.  It's a very small audience for this.  But yeah, there is some level of responsibility if you have this platform like Twig and the blogs and such that rather than just surrendering,  because some people said, I just give up.  And I said, no, I can't.  I won't do that.  So on we go.  All right. I need a break.  I need something happy.  I need positive change in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder, has anybody ever used the Mayday button?  Who uses that except lonely guys hoping that Jennifer will answer?  It's kind of like a chat roulette for the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm so glad I'm not the CSR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I'm so glad I'm not the CSR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  It's the human Clippy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It is the human Clippy.  I think Kevin Rose did it and like screencast it just to see what it was like.  He did it.  He said, how do I get the settings?  And it was a dude who looked nothing like Jennifer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the problem.  His name is Amy.  We've been corrected.  Sorry, Kevin Rose Mayday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  That's good.  I thought he tweeted.  He tweeted a while back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He said, it's amazing.  Man, Mayday is a name is a genius.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  But if your product needs that, that tells you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure they debated that.  Should we?  Yeah.  So he got a dude named Anthony and Anthony is not sitting in a futuristic space.  He's sitting in a call center and you can see the ducting on the roof.  It's not nearly so sexy.  Hey, Anthony.  Yo, let's play the video.  You want to watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And how are you doing today, Kevin?  I'm just looking to get into the settings.  Can you show me how to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm going down from the time.  Yeah, I see that line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wipe down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just like a regular tech support.  Great.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you.  You're very welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Aw.  Aw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It would be better if Kevin weren't looking at the latest issue of Men's Health magazine  during the call, I must say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I like that a little flavor to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Aw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what you're going to get.  Let's be honest.  You're not getting Amy.  Yes.  Amy is not working at Amazon's call center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Kevin and Anthony sitting in a tree.  Aw.  Sorry.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hope you're enjoying our best of this week in Google.  We'll be back next week with a fresh show with Jeff.  And I think Jean will be back for, we missed her all December.  She should be back January 1.  Meanwhile, we're looking back at some of the best of this week in Google for 2013.  Remember when Google had that crazy idea of Internet with balloons?  Let's take a look at Project Loon.  Project Loon.  On Sunday we had Trey Ratcliffe on Twitter because he was one of a couple of people.  It was Stephen Levy of Wired and Trey Ratcliffe who were invited to go up in the helicopter  and watch the launch of the first Google Project Loon balloons.  They go up in the sky.  These balloons eventually, Google hopes, this is a Project X plan,  to provide 3G quality Internet access to the entire globe from hundreds of these balloons  floating 10 miles up in the stratosphere, well above the commercial aviation traffic.  One of the advantages of being so high is they can tune these balloons.  There's two chambers.  There's a helium chamber and an air chamber.  And they can tune these balloons remotely to make them go up or down to catch the particular jet stream flow  to move these balloons to kind of keep them in position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Are there humans actually making them go up and down to catch the right air flow?  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or is it just autonomous?  Of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  An algorithm does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, only if you consider a Python program a human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  There's a .py script.  There's a .py.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are they pulling the signal from cell towers on the ground?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not cell towers specifically.  They're towers designed to do this from cities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, because I was going to say, if you let airline passengers know that balloons can do this, but they can't, man, they can't.  It's going to destroy the navigation.  We're going down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Look at that.  These are the...  Pause that, Chad.  Pause that.  These are what you get.  This red...  It looks like a red Tootsie Pop antenna.  This is what people in New Zealand who are the first beta testers of this will get.  Somebody said it kind of looks like a place pin on Google Maps.  No, it does.  It's 3G level at best, I think, right?  Well, I don't know.  Trey said he was really impressed.  It was very fast.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Trying to hold down expectations.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It is pretty far.  I mean, 10 miles is a long way away, and the latency is going to be horrendous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Every time I see photos of New Zealand, I always just want to move there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to be a hobbit when I see photos of New Zealand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but not in Christchurch.  Well, yeah.  I mean, like the balloon test photos in the videos are just amazing looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  It's interesting.  I don't know if it's intentional.  It's very near Queenstown where Trey lives.  So he and his family drove over and he got in the helicopter and watched this.  He made some great movies.  You can catch those on StuckInCustoms.com.  Jeff Levy is writing articles for Wired about this as well.  Grr.  Better latency than a satellite.  That's a good point.  I mean, a satellite has bad latency, but it won't be as bad as that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  I mean, the point of this is to get to remote areas that just simply can't be covered.  And if you have enough balloons up there, you can cover, you know, if we can bring internet  connectivity to huge swaths of the earth, imagine what happens when some of the Earth's  power is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And nobody better to do this in Google.  You wouldn't see, there's no extra governmental organization that's going to do this.  No NGO.  That's the other great thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  If they can put some servers up there, maybe we're safe from the NSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the NSA can even tap the stratosphere.  However, you know, it isn't this is Google's mandate.  They've always said this.  The more you use the Internet, the more we make.  They might charge for this, but I don't think this would be a business anymore than gigabit  is a business for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  This opens up entire new nations.  Yeah.  Business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There are the last mile problem, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Last 10 miles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are five billion people who don't have internet access.  So you're talking, you know, about a significant increase in your market share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  And they're solar powered, which is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  They are set up in such a way that they can take them down when they wear out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, they wear out, they take them down, they recycle apart, which is cool.  They have landing or collection areas, right, that they can steer them to, which is really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  I wonder how that has to be coordinated with air traffic control, though.  That's what the up and down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's not that crowd coming down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think this is the Leo question, but when can I buy one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Kevin Purdy balloon.  There they are going up in New Zealand.  This is is this a Trey Reckless?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is one of Trey's videos.  The one he was talking about with the technical demo still hasn't been approved yet, so it's not up yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But he apparently was able to go to the staging Quonset hut and record a bunch of tech talks and whiteboard stuff.  And he's hoping Google has to approve it before he can post it.  But he's hoping to post it that would give us a lot of more tech information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is recorded using his Google class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty neat, huh?  Pretty neat.  I guess that's his son.  I guess he did bring his kids.  Either that or he's scratching Stephen Levy's hair, which is a little weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  No, Levy was on the right.  Oh, good.  That was his son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look at that. That's really amazing.  These are more robust than weather balloons.  They're pretty tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  So is the solar stuff on the top of it and that on the bottom is the transmission piece?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. We'll have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, from if you look at this photo, it looks like that bottom piece is has the top layer is is solar panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Oh, it does. OK, yes, there you go.  The other neat thing about this is it's a mesh network.  Right.  Right. They connect with each other.  The balloons connect with each other to do things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you need that because most of them are not over these uplink facilities.  Those are in major urban areas.  So only one has to be up above above an uplink.  They uplink and then it spreads it via mesh to all the other balloons.  So that's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's amazing that the 2013 solution to this looks a lot like what would probably be the 1913 solution.  I know. You know, that's really out of the box thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I love it. You know, I just think that's great.  I am thrilled.  And I think this might actually work.  This is, by the way, not the first time people have talked about something like this.  Even a few months ago, Google was saying we're going to do this in Africa.  But I've heard of remember somebody was going to do an Internet where it was planes that were always up in the air.  This was quite a few years ago.  That's right. Expensive.  Obviously, there were airships not long ago.  Yeah. Yeah, I'm not sure why they don't use zeppelin's to do this.  But I guess this is the same thing, right?  They're lower. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  A little less. They need fuel.  That's why. Isn't that cool?  It's really cool.  What strikes me about it is that's a little weird is that it doesn't look very futuristic.  I mean, they look like floating garbage bags.  Right. I mean, I would be like, oh, I remember Bill Gates land in the ocean and choke some fish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bill Gates spent a billion, I think a billion dollars on Teladesic,  which was designed to put low Earth orbit satellites up doing the same thing.  But this is so much more economical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  So that's great. Harmless science experience.  What it says? Yeah, that's if it crashes science experiment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's hard to not. It is not a bomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is not for the NSA. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, maybe it is.  We laugh because we're scared.  You always joke about the thing that most worries you.  How do you like your glass? Still liking it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  I'm enjoying the laughs I get when I demonstrate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How about you, Gina? I don't see you wearing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I don't wear it when I'm sitting on my computer, but I do wear it when I go out on the weekends.  In fact, I was just at San Diego Pride this past weekend and I had it had them on.  And actually, Latoya Jackson was there, random.  She was one of the parade leaders.  And I snapped a quick picture of her and she had a little entourage.  She was in a golf cart and there were all these cameras and stuff.  But I generally like I take it out. We went to the county fair.  You know, if I go for a walk, if we go down to the beach, I'll take pictures.  But if I'm sitting in front of my computer, I don't have it on because I don't need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you'd get punched in the face, wouldn't you? I think so.  It's a camera, though, right, Gina? I mean, it sounds like what you just described sound like a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm using it as a camera. And, you know, here in San Diego, it's really sunny.  So I always have the I often wear it with the sunglass piece, which makes the camera a little less conspicuous.  Like people don't really notice it as much. I use it mostly as a camera.  I use it for navigation. And I do enjoy getting text messages just kind of, you know,  popped up in my face without having to check my phone.  But that's that's basically what I use it for.  And obviously, I take tons of pictures of the baby and little short videos of the baby that grandma grandma and grandma love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  I don't know if I said this last week, but I think it's three things.  Three, three, three minutes in one. It's a camera. You can record your life.  Number one. Number two, it gives you alerts.  And number three, it gives you instructions, including directions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, somebody was walking.  I think was it baritone or somebody walking around New York and said this is a perfect use as as a pedestrian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, navigation as a pedestrian. Definitely.  And even driving.  I mean, I don't recommend that you have have the navigation on while you're driving.  But there are times when I'll be in the passenger seat and have it on or I'll look up, you know, look up something beforehand to get places.  So Nav is great.  And the walking Nav is particularly good because it knows which way you're facing, which is very, very useful, especially in a dense place like New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  I found another fringe benefit to having it, which is up on the rundown on the bottom thing on glass is that what I'm now dubbing glass selfies.  I demonstrate them to other people and I and of course they want to put them on.  And what do they do? They take pictures.  What are they of you? So I have a whole huge.  That's kind of cool.  Twenty eight pictures there of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like that. What a handsome fellow you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I kind of like it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Me again. Me, me, me, me.  Glass selfies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Selfies.  That's pretty funny, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  So I've heard of at least two or three publications who have asked me indirectly or through friends.  How do we get a hold of a pair, you know, some glass so we can send a writer out to do kind of stunt like see, you know, record people's reactions to it or, you know, see, see how how weird they look kind of like doing the excuse me.  The glass look at this glass hole piece basically, which is which means it's jumped the shark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's over. Yeah. Time to move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm seriously a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a little says local news is doing glass stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  It's over. It's all over.  Although I saw I wish I put a blame rundown.  I don't think I did.  Did I?  Oh, wait, I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did.  I did. I did. I did.  No, no.  Well, that not an onion headline.  This is a real headline area woman exploring use of Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And how it'll affect your weekend after this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well, yes, being to get down to practice one of the NFL teams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  I don't remember what actually needs to Washington catch a ball is pretty cool.  Yeah, well, actually, catch a ball is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  South men's Tribune area woman has glass.  We have a whole glass section on our rundown here.  We have a huge section.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  We have the NFL players with glass.  We have Larry Page wearing it at a wedding.  Oh, don't let somebody. Is it his wedding? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, he was a groomsman.  No. OK. Yes.  So what's the story?  Do we are we going to see a bunch of pictures on his Google Plus of his brother's wedding?  We showed you see him doing the more subtle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  We don't see Larry Page going, OK, go ahead.  We don't see Larry Page going, OK, glass.  We see him doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You always wear it.  Now, apparently, Google has patented glass, a way of making melding glass with prescription lenses, which is good news for people like me.  Most of these are pictures of Larry's attractive wife, it seems.  Yeah, she is attractive. Yeah.  Where is this? I don't know where the pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  The pictures that he took. Yeah. I don't know if he actually shared them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. God, I don't know.  I guess I would well if it were my wedding, I would welcome somebody wearing glass because he's documenting the wedding.  Right. We gave when I got married 20 years ago, we gave insta.  You know, this is how long ago it was in disposable instamatics to everybody.  They were at every table to take pictures and then leave them on the table.  We'll get them developed. This is kind of like that.  Yeah, it was in Croatia. Nice place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  I hear. Yes. Yeah. Nice beaches and things. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, so NFL glass. That was pretty cool.  So are these people who lent their glass to players or ESPN reporter put them on the players? Oh, he had him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He had him. OK. She put him on. She.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yes, they had him on the quarterback. That's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, I bet I'm thinking she had to start the recording for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  No, he's about to throw the ball. Wow, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  He catches the catching is even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We you know, you see this stuff on you see this stuff on NFL coverage anyway, because they have helmet cams and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what the coach was saying.  You know, you really can see the helmet, every helmet being equipped with this kind of thing.  And for viewers to be able to watch the game from any player's perspective. Right.  I don't know if I'd want that, though. It's a little like little Blair Witch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, because when the networks use it, it's a little it's a special thing.  You see it all the time in race cars. They'll have special, you know, cameras in their race cars.  First person is nothing. Yeah, there's nothing.  Turning left. I'm turning left now. I'm going to turn left some more.  There's nothing new to the idea of first person. No, no, no.  Glass just maybe makes it easier.  Easy enough for an NFL player to use.  Almost. So Jeff demoed a glass at the Guardian activate.  That's where some of those pictures came from.  You have that was where you interviewed Vint Cerf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Vint. Wonderful. They just put the video up this morning.  Yay. I want to watch it.  Vint is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we talked about the fact that you did it yesterday or last week.  But yeah, so so actually, we should just not do the show and play the interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Twenty minutes. Yeah, that's the demo one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, highlights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anything you're not wearing glass during the interview?  No, I have audio from Google Glass.  Big deal. OK, where is that? Oh, that's you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I click on it, but I won't see you using the screencast. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And you said they very kindly edited out the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  It took me like 20 times.  The way the way to turn the screencast on is you've got to photograph the barcode on the phone with the glass.  Yeah. Oh, God. And trying to get it in the right spot is nearly impossible because you can't preview the photo.  And so I was on stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So a good first impression when they put a GoPro quality camera on this thing, then maybe I'll be impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  But then I did it in my feed.  It takes a while for the photos to come up. So then three days later, I'll see 20 pictures of half a QR code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's pretty funny.  We've had so many great guests on this week in Google and many regulars like Matt Cutts and Kevin Marks.  But I have to say, for me and Jeff, I think having Bruce Schneier on talking about the NSA was a real highlight.  Bruce is one of the great gurus of security and the Schneier security.  What is it? Schneier on security is just an incredible blog.  We asked Bruce to talk about the NSA. This is when the story was first breaking.  Take a look. So, Jeff, you have booked somebody I've been trying to get on Twitter for seven or eight years now.  One of the premier guys in security.  Frankly, if Bruce Schneier says it, I believe it.  He, among other claims to fame.  You helped Neil Stevenson with the crypto in Cryptonomicon, right? His card deck crypto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, I built a playing card cipher that he used in the plot.  And the neat thing was I got to write it afterward in the book.  The extra neat thing is I got to accompany him on some book signings and learn that cipher punk writers get way better groupies than photographers ever do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bruce, it is such an honor to talk to you.  Really, you are a legend in the business and especially now more than ever.  Now more than ever.  We need Bruce Schneier.  If you want to read his blog, Schneier on Security, there is really nobody who is more trenchant or accurate, entertaining even on the subject.  So, Jeff, since you were the guy who got us this great book, and I'll let you take the lead on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  So much. We have so little time. We have we have Bruce to the top of the hour.  But start here, Bruce. You wrote a great piece for the Atlantic and about a topic that I was trying to tackle, too.  But you, frankly, did it far better than I did.  Is the fear that the NSA is commandeering the net?  I was thinking about it in terms of what they're doing, maybe to individual companies where there are people with security clearance and their bosses don't have it.  They don't know what they're doing inside the company.  And I couldn't express that.  And you just came up with a very clear view that they're just plain commandeering the Internet.  And then you're also arguing that what technology companies it's time for them to fight back.  Why don't you talk about that for a second?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You know, it's really part of this very broad trend of surveillance being everywhere.  I mean, if you think about it, surveillance is the business model of the Internet.  I mean, that's how Google makes its money.  It surveils us and serves us personalized ads.  That's how Facebook makes its money.  That's everyone's making their money by mining us for our data and then buying, selling and using it.  And it turns out that the government wants access to it, too.  And stuff they can't get for legal reasons or technical reasons, they're learning to get from these corporations.  Either they're asking nicely.  We've seen example after example of companies willingly subverting their security or willingly handing the NSA copies of everything.  They'll do it to national security letters.  They'll force companies to do it.  Is something that's going through Congress running with the FBI has gotten phone companies to make their networks eavesdropping ready.  So I mean, I think of this as a public private surveillance partnership.  So, yes, the NSA is coming during the Internet for its own purposes, but also companies are surveilling us for their own purposes and using law to protect them.  So it kind of goes both ways, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bruce, I've always been much more worried, though, about a government surveilling us than about private corporations trying to sell us.  Doesn't that seem a little bit more nefarious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Well, I mean, sell us is just the beginning of it.  It's being used to deny people loans, to deny people banking privileges.  Redlining, digital redlining.  Well, redlining, not just even denying people access to banking.  There's an article recently about people being judged by computer algorithms and being denied bank accounts.  So now they're forced to use these more expensive unbanked and check cashing services.  You know, these corporations are not just selling us consumer products.  They're very much controlling our lives.  If you can't get a cell phone, you can't live the same life.  You can't get a credit card.  So, you know, looking at corporate power, it's different than government power.  But corporate power is pretty darn extreme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  And, you know, go ahead.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  No, I mean, I just really see both types of power working together and sort of is this weird libertarian fantasy that if the government does something, it's bad.  And then if a corporation does it and magically becomes good, I usually tend to look at the thing and not who writes the pages.  Who writes the paycheck of the people in power that are doing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm more afraid of guns, though, than I am of redlining.  But I'll acknowledge that both are problems.  How do you fight it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Right now, the rock paper scissors in Egypt is the army always wins over the Internet.  Let's continue on with Leo's question, Bruce.  When I talked to Vince Cerf about this at Guardian Activate in London, someone asked him whether the solution to this is technological or institutional.  That is to say, laws and policy and principles.  How far does the technological solution take us here?  And what are its limitations?  And how do we solve it institutionally?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  So I don't think that technology takes us very far at all.  And so here's a great example.  I'm asked an email all the time.  I want to use a secure email service.  Who should I use?  And the truth is, I don't know.  I don't know what companies have been subverted by the government, what claims are true, what claims are lying.  Last week, we saw two small secure email services, LavaBit and Black.  Silent Circle.  Silent Circle shut themselves down.  They shut themselves down one after they received national security letters, one before.  And so these independents are going away.  What's left of the big corporations that really have no choice but to cooperate.  So, you know, the technology only takes you so far, but you can't trust the technology because you can't trust anybody's claims.  I mean, these are very much political problems and the solutions are going to be political.  Now, once we have the correct politics in place, there's a lot technology can do because there are a lot of tech problems, but they are subservient to the political problems.  I mean, right now.  Which goes to your point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Goes to your point about trying to get the tech companies to fight now that if they want to prove whose side they're on, are they on our side or are they collaborators with the government or the victims of its overreach?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But isn't it a meaningless question?  I think Bruce is probably right.  They are collaborators.  But even if they weren't, they don't have NSL.  And I know Matt Cutts works at Google, so he's going to he's going to chime in there.  But even if they weren't, I think it's moot because even if they weren't, the law requires them to participate because they're public companies.  They can't do as Lava bit and Silent Circle did shut down.  They have to keep cooperating.  They have to cooperate.  They have to cooperate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Just as they had to cooperate in China.  They don't cooperate willingly.  They don't have to do more than the law allows.  And they don't have to go silently.  So both Yahoo and Google are having great at fighting back.  And they will they can they mostly lose.  Sometimes we win.  You know, Brewster Kale, the Internet Archive, fought a national security letter and won.  And his story was in the New Yorker, I think, last year, earlier this year.  And our sort of only way to beat this back is to fight back.  And even if you lose, you're going to lose on the narrow of the narrowness of the letter.  You're not going to cooperate more.  There's a lot of articles now of companies that are cooperating because they're afraid if they get the letter, it'll be more annoying and more expensive.  And it turns out not to be true.  You fight.  You keep the moral high ground when this is all exposed.  Like, you know, what happened to Yahoo?  What's happened to Google?  We're all thinking, well, these companies are fighting for us.  So even if they lose, I'm going to trust them more than I will a company that isn't fighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I also could say that we don't know what's going on because of the silence requirements of many NSL.  So it may be much more than we even know.  And it probably is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  A lot of these silence requirements are being fought, sometimes successfully.  That the national security letter doesn't go away, but the gag order does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I look at Lava Bits founder who apparently got something but is so constrained about what he can talk about, he has to sit there with a lawyer next to him saying, whispering back and forth.  What can you say? What can't you say?  He risks prison by saying anything.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  But the companies will change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  They can stand up and say what ought to be.  If they get away with the specifics of the cases against them, the companies need to stand up on the basis of principle and say, this is what we'll fight.  This is what will stand up for you.  You can be assured that we will do this or that because if they don't even say that right now, they're being silent.  The companies are not coming out and say much of anything.  And that doesn't lead to trust.  Plus, we, the users, have to give them cover.  We have to demand that they fight so they can say to the government, hey, man, we're caught in the middle here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bruce's most recent book was about trust.  It could have been more timely.  It came out last year, but you couldn't be more timely.  I don't know if we can trust anybody at this point.  And, you know, when you see, for instance, the FISA court itself two years ago trying to put out a report saying that the government is overreaching and then that being quashed by the Department of Justice, there is it is all being suppressed at this point as much as the government can.  There is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And it's actually it really amazes me that the NSA had no contingency plans for our secret programs get on the front page of the newspaper.  You think with the major budget and security mindset, they have some plan B.  Here it is. What? A couple of months after General Alexander was at Blackhat.  And like the best he could do was explain how the FISA court works.  Talk about this.  This Iranian cab driver was sent five thousand dollars back home.  I mean, this is this is his defense.  And how even now they're just making it up as they go along, hoping for the best.  And they have to believe that these thousands of documents are going to become public.  All of them sometime soon.  It's just not going to stay undercover much longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So could I take a little bit of the the the worry that we're painting with a little bit of a broad brush?  That cuts from from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I don't know whether my video can come through or not.  If my video does come through, I'm actually holding up a copy of Bruce's book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So liars and outliers.  Good. You're reading it.  That's excellent.  Well, this one's actually the other one.  Security, which is the classic.  Yeah, I have that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am a fan.  You know, so I very much enjoy and agree with that.  That's a must have security theater.  But I do think we don't want to paint with too broad of a brush,  like talking about collaborators and talking about private public partnership on some of this stuff,  because, you know, from a lot of the coverage, you get the idea,  the sense that a lot of this is more like a shotgun wedding where companies are compelled to.  And I think you can look at the the history of companies and get a sense for which ones are fighting for you  versus which ones are like, hey, please give us a government request.  We can hand over all the phone calling records of various Americans.  So, for example, you know, Google was one of the first to really double down on encryption, both of Gmail and on search.  Whenever we got a 2005 Department of Justice subpoena that wanted to turn over two months of users queries for a lawsuit related to to pornography,  we fought that and we won and 33 other companies didn't fight that.  We've been very big on two factor authentication.  You know, there's an article in Wired that talks about a little device that lets you do two factor authentication a little bit better.  So, you know, I think to say that all these companies are just falling over themselves on this topic to help out the government is not a correct characterization.  I think a lot of engineers in Silicon Valley are thinking about different ways that they can try to protect users rights and protect security and privacy as best they can.  You know, it was really wild to watch the events around LavaBit.  And I think hopefully that will give a lot of people in the government pause and and and make them think a little bit about just what they're doing.  You know, they're really removing a lot of trust in the Internet and in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yes, you know, CDT just came out with a blog post and they have been fighting the extension of clear clear is the law that required phone companies to make their phone switches eavesdropping friendly.  And the FBI is trying to extend that law to the things like like Gmail.  And it's being fought. The law hasn't passed.  But he's pointing out that these these attacks against the smaller companies that are really forcing them to close or collaborate the inability for the larger companies to to close.  So they have to basically hand over NSA data and then lie to their customers about it is effectively getting this actually clear extension passed without the trouble of the company.  And it's impossible of going through Congress that effectively all we have left of the large companies.  And it's sort of impossible. You can't imagine Mark Zuckerberg saying, well, we're just not going to comply.  We're going to shut Facebook down. That's what we have to do.  Right. He can't do that. It's a large public company.  He'd be fired. They'd find a less moral CEO.  Keep going. Right. And it would continue.  So, you know, we're now entering a world where you only have the big companies that collaborate and, you know, they're forced to and some fight and some don't.  And maybe we went around the edges, but largely we lose and no small companies left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  And that scares me. Let me ask you another question, though, since you're the technologist here in my field in journalism, we yammer on a lot about professional ethics.  And I have threatened to quit jobs over matters of ethics.  And I know lots of people who have.  And I know that Yonatan Zolotarov, right? No, Yonatan Zucker, the architect of Google+, wrote a great post saying, listen, the thing you have to trust here is that if this stuff were going on and I knew about it, I'd leave the company.  Right. How much discussion is there among technologists?  Is there enough, do you think, about the ethics of a technologist?  And how much do you can we trust those individuals? Is that where the wellspring of reaction is going to come up and say, no, I refuse to do that or I'll I have to quit or whatever?  Where does it get down to the individual or the individual within the company who has security clearance, who's treated differently from everybody else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, thank goodness for the Edward Snowden's and Lillardar Levison's of Lava Bit of the World, who do who have put their in a way put their life on the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Is there discussion of these ethical principles among developers, technologists, security people and so on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's certainly within Google. I think it's safe to say this is hotly debated, you know, and every week we have weekly discussions where we can ask, you know, Larry and Sergey questions.  And it's entirely safe to say that even though we might not say that much externally, because, you know, there's there's discipline about external communications, you can believe any hot topic outside of Google gets a firestorm of debate inside of Google.  And so that's that's an entirely safe assumption. I assume that happens a lot of companies as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, so the president gave a press conference last Friday and he talked about he did a couple of things which I applaud him for.  One is acknowledged while he said while our law national law enforcement agencies are patriots and trying to protect our country.  He also said, and I hope he believes this, that those who are fighting for privacy are also patriots and fighting for very fundamental constitutional tenants in this country.  He also said, and I thought this was really telling we have an unprecedented ability to gather this information.  And, you know, I think perhaps what happened is that that unprecedented ability to gather the information snuck up on us and we got this ability.  And of course, somebody whose job is to protect the country is going to embrace anything.  And the problem is the controls and the oversight have not been there have not caught kept up.  Is it enough to say to Congress, let's let's get this under control?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I mean, you can say it has to get done.  Well, what else should we do?  I mean, I agree. That's that's probably the mechanism, at least one of the mechanisms.  The mechanisms are there are court cases going through Obama said he do four things.  And of course, the proof is in the pudding. Talked about reforming Section 215 of the Patriot Act.  That's the section that has to deal with national security letters.  So what does that mean? We don't know.  To increase transparency, the FISA court, I mean, it's a good idea, but the devil's in the details.  The third is to make more information public as can be made public.  Again, good idea. And fourth is to report to appoint some kind of independent review board, which is either a good idea or a way to make the problem go away and, you know, put into a document.  So these are four generalizations.  You know, the details matter. I mean, yes, Congress could do a lot.  We saw a few weeks ago the House tried to unfund one particular NSA surveillance program, the one that collects phone metadata of every American that failed but failed very narrowly.  There are things the courts could do. EFF, ACLU, EPIC are all filing lawsuits trying to challenge the constitutionality of this aspect of that aspect.  Those are ways. There's a lot of public pressure now.  I mean, congressmen are feeling this. The president is feeling this and views are changing.  You know, even some of the congressmen and senators who are pretty much on the side of security at all costs and don't really care about this are starting to change.  So there's a lot we can do. You have to push on all fronts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Is it enough or are those four things enough?  Or presuming they're done properly or is there more that you would like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You know, I think fundamentally our privacy laws are outdated.  I mean, it's what you said. Technology continues to advance.  The FBI, the NSA are continually grabbing this new technology because it's a gray area and not really covered under the law.  They assume the most broad, expansive powers they can think of.  And because the law was written in the 80s or sometimes even the early 90s.  Sometimes the 1880s.  It's not that bad, but it's still pretty bad. It's still pre-internet.  So we really need the entire body of laws to catch up to technology.  And if we're really good to write them technologically invariant, so you don't go through the same problem again in 20 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Yeah, that's where I'll disagree a little bit, Bruce.  I think what we have to do is write the laws at a level of principle where then I agree they're invariant to the technology.  The principle is that you don't suck up all the communication that occurs.  Here's a better example.  Our first class letters and packages only are secured so that they can't be opened without a warrant.  The metadata can be taken, but the package cannot be opened.  Anything else can be opened. Our email does not have that security.  Our private chats, of course, don't have that security.  Well, the principle at work here should be the private communication is private and is secure unless with a lawful warrant.  That should be the principle that should exist against any technology, whether that's a letter or a phone call or a chat or an email.  So what we have to do is actually, I think, raise this discussion high to the level of principle so that we can then know what's being protected as citizens.  And then the problem now is that in a way you don't blame the spies, say, in the words of Alexander, gather it all.  The more they can gather, the more they've got their job. They're going to go as far as they can.  And if the law is too specific to the technology, it doesn't catch up, they're going to walk through that loophole.  Whereas if the principle is set up that says you cannot listen to or in any way spy on private communication at an individual level until you have a warrant, that to me is pretty darn clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  That's right. And it's resistant to whatever the next thing is.  Our problems have been we had this with videotape rentals versus DVDs versus streaming video.  We'll have it right in letters versus email, phone calls versus Skype calls.  So, you mean, if you write the laws to the technology, the technology changes and your laws no longer apply or no longer work well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  If we have dropped the laws to the idea that technology is going to constantly change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Right. You know, but this stuff is hard. You know, fundamentally, it's very hard for members of Congress and I applaud the ones who managed to do it to say to law enforcement, no, you can't have this.  No, we're going to stand up for what's right and we're not going to give you what you want.  It's very easy to succumb to fear. You know, I feel their pain. I don't, you know, I have sympathy even though I don't want them to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And, you know, I think the judiciary also is going to be a big part of this interpreting the laws to support the Fourth Amendment is going to be a big part of it.  Bruce, we have a promise to let you go at this time and I thank you so much for being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Bruce, let's have you back, but I could stay longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would love to have you back. Liars and Outliers is the latest book enabling the trust that society needs to thrive.  Schneier.com is the website.  Really a hero of mine, Bruce. So thank you for being here. We really appreciate it.  Thank you.  Take care.  Actually, Danny told us just as we were starting the show, breaking news, Yahoo for the first time in five years.  Number one on the net.  Is that right?  Crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So they've, you know, every year comp score comes out when they say these are the top sites or the top networks in the United States.  And every year the list is always the same.  There's hardly ever any changes that kind of go on with it.  But this this month it came out and that turns out in July that Yahoo popped above Google to be the number one site network in the United States since the first time since at least early 2008 since they've been there.  That's amazing.  196 million unique users to Google's 192 million unique users.  And that's not even counting Tumblr.  The comp score hasn't integrated all the comp Tumblr numbers.  So those are separate.  And if you put those in there as well, then that would take Yahoo up to like about two hundred and thirty five thousand.  Use a big, big, big gap between them and Google at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's always been back and forth, though.  Yahoo, Google, Yahoo, Google hasn't.  I mean, Yahoo's not like coming up with number 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's been like number two for a really long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  So it's not like the other truth is people don't go to Google for Google.  You know, Google doesn't emphasize having Google dot com as a major site maps as other things.  Yahoo has been a content site, trying a destination site for since the beginning of the portal portal turn destination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're they're about content, aren't they?  I mean, really?  So what does that include?  So would Gmail be a Google site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would Yahoo Mail be that should include any Google property and any Yahoo property?  It doesn't matter that it's on Google dot com versus YouTube.  Like YouTube isn't broken out from the Google numbers.  YouTube is included in it.  But well, that's content.  What you watch in in like a day or two, Google will probably like say, well, you know, if you factored in this thing over here, that thing over there.  And so it'll be interesting to see because Google really doesn't like mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Mobile, Danny, what what what what you know, with with people, supposedly mobiles, everything I'm seeing with the sites I work with mobiles going nuts in the numbers is Yahoo.  Do anything particular?  They have a new weather app.  Everybody was talking about.  But is mobile a factor in this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  In fact, we're still trying to figure out what it is that that might have popped it up.  The first thought was, well, maybe this is all the Tumblr numbers that have come in.  But like I said, Tumblr is broken out on its own.  The gap has always been very close, but something happened that maybe moved Yahoo up.  And it may be also that, you know, what happens in the summer is that you get the people who aren't searching on Google as much as students go back to school or are out of school and everything.  So it could be that they were so close and Yahoo's had just enough of a gain that Google's just enough of a drop might have had an impact.  So, you know, yeah.  Good on Marissa Mayer.  That's huge.  I know there'll be some celebrations over at Yahoo.  You bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And she looks damn fine in a in a in a gown.  Can you believe all the attention?  Let me ask Gina.  She's a woman.  Oh, boy.  Can you believe all the attention?  I feel you know, I feel kind of bad.  So Vogue did an article on Marissa Mayer.  It's Vogue.  Marissa Mayer has always loved fashion.  We know that.  That doesn't make her less of a brilliant person or an engineer or a CEO.  They did a I think a great looking picture of her in a designer dress with fabulous heels upside down.  And people say, oh, it overshadows the story.  And I don't think so.  Can't we live in a world where somebody can be interested in fashion and still be brilliant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yes, we can.  I do think that too much is made of her looks, but it's kind of like it's a unicorn thing.  It's like you're just not used to seeing young female CEOs like in the position that she's in.  And, you know, look, I think I think Mayer has a lot of control and a lot of say in the way that she's presented in the media.  And I think that she accepts these interviews and photo shoots and does so full well knowing what they're going to turn out to be.  And I think I think that she probably thought it was a good idea.  You thought it was a good idea.  I wouldn't wouldn't be surprised if she had final say on what the you know, what photographs they finally publish.  And I feel like if that's if she's comfortable with with that presentation, then that's then that's cool.  But I do think that a lot is made of her appearance.  But I think it's human nature to react to something that looks different.  It is kind of like the unicorn principle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think if you read the article, what is very impressive and by the way, look at the other pictures, what is very impressive is that she held her own in a boys club.  You know, actually, this is CEOs go wild.  This is the wrong slideshow.  Although, although did they make a lot about Richard Branson dressed as in drag as a stewardess?  I don't know.  Was that a big story?  Larry Ellison drinking the largest bottle of champagne I've ever seen.  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I read the Vogue article on think on Friday and the link I had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  That's not a phrase I ever thought I'd hear on this show.  I read the Vogue article.  You buy it for the articles.  Yes.  But it's funny because I mean, I read so much on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't you know, you don't I don't tend to think of it this publication that public.  I mean, I know Vogue and everything.  Right.  But I I clicked on the link and I read the article and it was only the article.  There was no pictures or anything.  So I actually had this weird experience where I went in.  I read the article critically.  That's it.  Right.  So I read the article critically and I'm actually going through the article.  Is that right there?  What do I think about this?  What about that?  And I thought overall was a good piece or whatever.  I didn't see the couch thing at all until yesterday, which, by the way, I recreated  on Twitter myself because I have that couch.  Oh, wow.  Not exactly, but I have a couch with that kind of thing.  So it's a few tweets back.  I did yesterday and that is a really hard pose to hold.  So someone says Rupert Murdoch.  I don't know how she did it because yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, Danny, they have trained professional photographers, lighting technicians, makeup  artists.  You just you can't duplicate that at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's it.  Let me tell you, my wife's like, no, you got to hold the iPad this way.  I'm like, oh, so, you know, first of all, I thought it was a great picture and it went  with a great article.  And, you know, who cares what you want to pose it?  OK, so who said this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Danny Sullivan, Marissa Meyer.  I really like even numbers and I like heavily divisible numbers.  Twelve is my lucky number.  I just love how divisible it is.  I don't like odd numbers and I really don't like primes.  When I turned 37, I put on a strong face, but I was not looking forward to 37.  But 37 turned out to be a pretty amazing year, especially considering that 36 is divisible  by 12.  Wow.  That's the lead in the Vogue piece.  Wow.  She may have regretted that particular quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's not regretting anything today, man.  Je ne regrette rien.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She is Coco Chanel for a day.  No, I think it's I bet you it's intentional that Marissa Meyer is saying, just as she  had her baby and took the job at CEO, that you can have everything and that women shouldn't  be kept out of the boardroom or out of the fashion week.  You can have it all.  And I'm wearing heels from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if you saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  We had a couple of women in leadership positions.  I think that there are women who play it kind of like one of the guys.  And I think there are women who are like love like being sort of conventional, like have  conventional female interests, you know, fashion, whatever.  I think it's great that she is, you know, that she's being who she is and that she's  one representation of one way that you can be a woman in a leadership position.  Exactly.  I'm not into fashion, but rock on.  Rock on.  So that's what I say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a I think postmodern feminism, I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  And I think, you know, role models for women in both technology and corporate leadership  is important.  And, you know, however you what would the story we quoted about a month ago of the woman  who's high up in Google, who dressed like a geek, right?  She finally decided enough.  Right.  Perfect. Yes.  And I salute that.  Right.  You can be yourself.  You can be in technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whatever that is.  And I just want everyone to know I don't like sports.  I don't drink beer.  And I don't like cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  So there because you're a queen.  We just we.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would love some blue suede pumps.  Let's take a look.  Anyway, congratulations.  I think you could pretty clearly point to Marissa Meyer and say that the strategy is  working at Yahoo with these numbers.  I really think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, those numbers are incredible.  It's a little hard for me to believe.  I just don't spend a lot of time at Yahoo, but I don't think that and I don't think any  of us do, but I don't think that we're representative of real people do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Real people do.  Yep.  I use Flickr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I lock into Flickr pretty often.  So I'm on one of those numbers.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  Well, that's fair.  Another great regular on the show.  Danny Sullivan from Search Engine Land.  I hope you've enjoyed our little look back.  We had some fun, didn't we?
