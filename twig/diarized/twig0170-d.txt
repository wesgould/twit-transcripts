Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hello, happy Halloween.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Happy Halloween.  What's your costume?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't have one, but my six week old daughter has a  Wonder Woman onesie on.  Aw.  So I mean, I like you guys, but you're not nearly as cute as  my kid, I just got to tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if little later on she'd like to make an appearance, a  little cameo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's taking a nap, but if you go to my Flickr, there's a  picture.  There's a picture of the Wonder Woman, yeah.  Flickr.com slash GinaTripani, you'll see a picture of my  girl.  Maybe, yeah, if she wakes up, maybe we'll bring her in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Etta is a Wonder Woman.  So no princesses for her, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not yet, not until she requests them specifically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There she is.  There's a new Disney princess, Princess Leia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's yum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's not so bad.  And she's easy to do with the cinnamon buns.  It's very simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leia I'm good with.  Most versions of Leia I'm good with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have costumes for Ozzy, and I've been waiting all year to  put them on him, and I forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I might have to run home and get them.  He's got a Bumblebee costume.  He's got a Santa costume.  He's got a little Mexican hat and Serapi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, this onesie is for a six-month-old.  She's only six months old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's not quite filling it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, she's not filling it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's all right.  She'll grow into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You got to put on the costume.  So cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also here, speaking of cute, Jeff Jarvis, the chat room is  wondering what color skin you'd have for Halloween.  And you've decided pink.  How unusual it appears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd pay to see you in a onesie, Leia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a onesie.  I could put it on.  Don't tempt me.  I literally have a onesie.  Isn't that in the other room?  I don't know how I would get it on here.  Maybe during a long, if you do a long monologue, Jeff, I  shall pull my onesie on.  It's a tie-dyed onesie.  We also want to welcome Paul Boag, who is a longtime friend.  We actually have had Paul on years ago.  We were going to do an international news update.  And Paul joined us for that.  He is a web designer, co-founder of the web agency  Headscape in Great Britain, and also of the Boag World  Podcast.  Paul, it's great to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's great to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was in town and just thought we'd bring him in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I only wanted a nose round.  And next thing I know, I'm on the show, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure you'll have something to say.  And we actually have another guest who is on his way, but  he's running a little late because I guess there was a  World Series and somebody won and there's a parade.  And I don't know what's going on.  But apparently traffic in San Francisco, kind of tough.  But joining us in just a few minutes, because I think he's  getting close now, Robert Stevens.  And you set us up with this, Jeff.  He's a former CTO at Best Buy, right?  A guy who invented the Geek Squad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He invented the Geek Squad and then became CTO at Best Buy  and is a very, very nice, smart, opinionated guy.  I think you'll enjoy him.  This is going to be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is going to be interesting.  But first, let's get right to the news.  And then when Robert joins us, we'll bring him into the game.  So there was no Google announcement on Monday.  We thought there would be.  But because of the storm, they canceled it.  However, they still pushed out all the new stuff.  Maybe this would be a good time, before we go much  farther, to have Gina tell us what's new at Google.  What do you think?  It's time for the change lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you want to kick off the change lock?  Oh, Google, change lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, jeez.  Oh, Lord.  This is quality show.  I want to do that before Robert got here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a lot of stuff new this week.  And I didn't even count the Nexus launch.  So we'll talk about the Nexus launch separately.  But a lot of little product tweaks here and there.  Google search for iOS came out, added voice functionality.  Have you tried this out, Leo?  It's pretty cool.  It's kind of like Google's version of Siri.  It's super fast.  It's really good.  It's kind of got a Google Now-ish.  So yeah, if you just update your Google search app on iOS,  you'll be able to ask it questions through voice.  If it has answers, it will read them back to you.  Otherwise, it just shows you Google search results.  But it's really fast.  As you speak, you can see the words, the translation,  the words kind of update, kind of like Google  suggests as you type.  It's pretty neat.  Gmail got a new compose functionality.  So in Gmail now, when you click on the compose button  inside the web interface, your new draft email  opens up in a panel on top of your inbox.  So you can actually search your inbox.  You can refer to other emails as you're drafting an email  inside this compose window.  It's pretty neat.  And when you reply as well to an email thread,  there's kind of a new layout.  It looks actually kind of, dare I say, Google-wave-ish.  The reply kind of shows up at the bottom of the thread  as you type.  So you used to be able to, if you hold down the Shift key  and click on the compose button, it  would open the compose window in a new window.  I'm sure that no one was actually using that feature,  even though it was very useful.  So you can actually now search for email  while you compose an email.  And I got that on my Google Apps account and my Vanilla Gmail  account.  I just refresh my inbox, and you'll  get a little notification that says, hey,  that we've got this new compose feature.  Not me.  No, not you, not yet.  Do you not have to apply for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's rolling out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I just Shift reloaded my inbox.  I got a little notification.  Oh, there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Got it.  I'll have to do a new compose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Excellent.  Excellent.  Google Earth for desktop.  Google Earth 7 just got the new features  that rolled out on mobile a while back,  with Tour Guide, a new 3D imagery.  I got to say, I haven't used Google Earth on a desktop  in a long time, but I downloaded Google Earth 7.  And this new Tour Guide feature lets  you click on sites of interest, and it kind of walks you  through and gives you some history and pans around.  Got some new 3D imagery as well.  For those of you who have Chromebooks,  Chrome Remote Desktop, which is a Chrome add-on that  lets you remote control another computer, came out of beta.  And it has a couple new features.  It supports audio feeds, real-time audio feeds  for Windows machines.  So if you got your Chromebook and you're on the road,  you can remote desktop into your Windows machine.  You can listen to your music on the way.  You can also copy and paste between local and remote  computers as well.  So Chrome Remote Desktop out of beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The storm also delayed the ride by my Chromebook  was supposed to arrive Monday.  The least of my problems right now, but I got no Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Sandy's fault.  Google Translate got a couple new features.  Reverse translation, so you can check a translation  to see how well it goes back and forth between languages.  Google will list translations based on frequency,  so how often a word is used, and offer synonyms as well.  So google.com slash translate, you can try those out.  And every election season, Google has voter tools.  Last week, we talked about the Explorer, the Election  Explorer.  There's a voter info tab now.  If you go to google.com slash elections,  you can look up your polling places.  You can check out information about the candidates.  And there's quite a few different tools here  on this page.  But that voter info tab just launched this week as well.  And that's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's the Google changelog.  OK, we're going to have to dump that at some point,  because this is a serious show.  Thank you, Gina.  Sure.  Yeah, and you left out all the Google announcements  that would have come out Monday.  Let's the big two.  Well, there's three.  There's Jelly Bean 4.2.  There's a Nexus 4 phone, the LG.  Basically, I think it's an Optimus, right?  And then, of course, this new tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, the Nexus 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the price reduction in the Nexus 7.  Yes, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's important, too.  Actually, Jermaine, to that, Asus Tech  has just told the Wall Street Journal  that Nexus 7 sales are pretty good,  approaching a million units a month.  It's a beautiful thing.  That's, you know, this.  We knew it the minute we saw it.  And I think everybody did.  This works.  It's a great device.  We're starting to hear early reviews of the iPad Mini  that maybe it doesn't work quite so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I even think the added, it's an inch wider, right?  The iPad Mini?  Yeah.  And I think that's too wide.  I try to say.  Yeah, and I put mine in the hands of people  with short and stubby fingers and said, OK, now add an inch.  And they all grimaced.  Is it the price or the size?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think it's the size?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that if you have the chance  to hold the two next to each other, it'd be the size.  The problem is, where do you go to hold a Nexus 7?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  The other problem when it comes to the size  is if they've made it any smaller than that,  they wouldn't have been able to go with the 1,024 by 768  screen size, which means that you would have had a load  of developers complaining they're having to redo  their applications again.  So to some extent, the iPad Mini was kind of defined  by the developer audience, I think.  One, Android doesn't have those kinds of problems  because there are so many screen sizes anyway that is not  an issue.  Yeah, well, I used to do it.  Absolutely.  They've got to suck it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and people, even John Gruber, who is, no one doubts,  a major fan of everything Apple, is a little down  on the iPad Mini.  His wife said, wow, it feels like a Kindle.  Ooh, the screen is terrible.  And there seems to be a lot of, now, we're  going to get our Mini on Friday.  But it seems to be a lot of the reaction of the early reviewers  is, boy, this really should be Retina.  Why is it not Retina?  And Google may be stealing a little march on that  because while the Nexus 7 is not Retina, it's higher resolution.  And now they've announced a new 10-inch tablet that  is super high resolution.  I think that might be the most, that's very interesting.  They're going right up after Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple's full-size iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't think, actually, they've solved the problem  that they thought they had by keeping it  at the same resolution anyway because what's happened  is you've taken the 1024 that used to be on the iPad 2  and shrunk it down for this smaller device.  And you're saying to all the developers,  oh, you don't need to do anything.  It'll just work.  But what's happened is all the buttons have ended up  so much smaller.  So it's now much fiddlier to interact with stuff.  Isn't that what Steve Jobs said?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He said, you'd have to sand your fingers down  to use a 7-inch tablet.  And maybe.  That's what's happened.  He was right.  I've been playing with the Surface RT, the Windows 8 tablet.  And that's, it is exact, one of the problems with it  when you get to desktop is the touch targets are really small.  So they'll put Excel up on the screen.  But it's no longer, you've got to use the mouse and keyboard.  It's not a touch device anymore.  So the new Google Samsung tablet, the Nexus 10,  is 300 pixels an inch.  That's higher than the Retina iPad.  2560 by 1600.  Is this going to have the same problem?  Well, yeah, potentially.  Because the dots are small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, but it's not such a problem  if you're designing the application from scratch,  specifically for that device.  Doesn't it resize?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gina's the Android developer.  Do you say the size of a control in pixels?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's relative.  On Android, you develop sort of.  It's all relative.  Yeah, it's a relative layout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that shouldn't be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, you provide assets for various resolutions.  So there's low resolution, medium, high, extra high.  So you have to provide images that have the right pixel  density.  But yeah, no, you're not defining layouts in pixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we'll see when this comes out.  It goes for sale November 13, 399 for 16 gigabytes,  499 for 32 gigabytes.  So it's less expensive than the iPad.  That's the Wi-Fi version.  It's manufactured by Samsung, has a A15-based Exynos 5 chip,  1.7 gigahertz quad core.  It has a Mali T604 GPU, which you need  for that kind of resolution.  That's one of the reasons I think Apple  big iPad, because they needed some speed on that high res.  Four times the pixels of a 1280 by 800 screen,  which is the previous Nexus tablet.  And the 300 PPI is, let me do the math, 36 PPI better  than the iPad.  Pretty well on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does it just become a numbers game at a certain point?  You wonder whether people do this just so they can say,  oh, it's better than the iPad.  I think the iPad's good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's camera megapixels, same thing.  I just put up a link, Leo, at the bottom of that section.  Linus Torvalds had a rant on Google+, saying,  can we please stop with the retina crap  and just call it reasonable resolution.  So even a 399 tablet has 2,500 pixels,  can we please just make that the new standard laptop  resolution?  The fact that laptops stagnated 10 years ago,  but even regressed in many cases,  at around half that in both directions is just sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It is nice to have retina, but of course, the GPUs  really get sluggish on that.  Hey, let's welcome, by the way, our fourth panel.  Well, do I count?  I don't know.  Fourth or fifth, depending on whether you're counting me.  Robert Stevens is here.  Robert, thanks for joining us.  We appreciate it.  How are you?  Good to meet you.  Can we get his mic on?  He's on mic three.  Mic three.  There we go.  Robert, former, not current, former CTO at Best Buy.  Former.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, my father passed away, and I stuck around the house  in Chicago to look after my mom.  And three weeks after I left, they had fired the CEO.  Oh.  Yeah.  So my timing was amazing.  So that was good.  Well, I mean, I wasn't happy that they fired him.  I mean, I knew they were going to fire him,  but I think everybody expected him to be tossed out eventually  for lack of business performance,  not for an inappropriate relationship with an employee.  That was unfortunate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's all rushing back to me.  Yes.  And founder of the Geek Squad, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, almost 20 years ago.  What?  Yeah.  That's how good of a job I did.  Everybody thinks Best Buy invented it.  I was running it for 10 years before I sold it to Best Buy.  Oh, that's right.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now it's coming back to me.  It was a business, and then Best Buy acquired it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I started in college in 1994, and I ran it for six years.  And then I called it Best Buy and said,  most of my employees used to work at Best Buy,  so I know you have good people.  I don't know why you take forever to fix laptops.  Why don't we join forces?  Why do you suck so bad?  Yeah.  Like having a Starbucks inside of a Barnes and Noble.  And we dated for two years before we got married.  That's interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Robert has now gone from the Geek Squad white shirt,  black tie to a San Francisco hip black t-shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm too old to be hipster, so I have no Warby Parkers.  I can't be held to any of that stuff.  Thank you, though, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Too old for a hipster.  I'm glad you have electricity.  You're never too old for a hipster, Robert.  I'm just going to tell you that right now.  So we've been talking about Google's non-announcement.  They just slipstreamed all this stuff out  since they couldn't have their big event.  Do you use any tablet in particular, Robert?  Is there one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm all Apple.  I mean, as a tech support person,  you want to buy a car, talk to a mechanic.  Ask my wife, who doesn't really like technology.  And we used to have HPs and all the crap in the house  and Linksys routers, and none of it worked.  Get rid of the HPs, I agree.  I tell people, Geeks will make more money off of you  if you do not own Apple products.  It's as simple as that.  That's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My brother-in-law wanted to buy a computer  a couple of years ago, and I said,  well, I would buy a Mac.  If you can buy anything you want,  but only expect support if you buy a Mac,  because I'm not going to help you if you buy Windows.  God help you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's still a problem, actually.  I mean, I see a lot of the perception issues.  During the 90s, Microsoft Windows  was a better operating system, but starting with OS X.  But that perception in people's minds  is still that Windows is better, and the perception also  is that Apple is expensive.  And I'd say $499 for an iPad kind of blows

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that all out of the water.  You played with the new Windows 8 Surface stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like it.  I actually have to say I like it.  There's lots of issues, so generation one product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The hardware is awe-inspiring.  I got to say, the keyboard, I got to give points for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like Metro.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, I'm rooting for them.  Before I left, I really was trying  to convince HP not to dump Palm.  I thought you ought to have paid for it.  And developers were saying at the time,  they would consider webOS in their top three.  It was a decent operating system.  I think it's probably going to be a couple years.  Not all will survive, but they will rebuild.  The ones that survive will rebuild their software  acumen to do this.  I just don't know how the whole OEM  thing is going to play out with Microsoft doing hardware too.  So that'll be interesting to see.  But yeah, I hope they do well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've got huge respect for them.  They've taken a brave step with Metro.  It's very different to what was there before.  And I think that is a big thing to do when you've  got this huge user base of people  that have been using your software happily for years  to step out and do something completely different,  whether you like it or not.  You've got to respect them for being brave enough to do that.  I feel like they had to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that they recognized the writing on the wall,  that Apple was eating their lunch,  that the world had changed.  It was a post-PC world.  But to their credit, they bit the bullet.  I mean, it was not an easy shift to make when you have  such a successful incumbent to say, all right,  well, we're going to go touch.  We're going to go tablet.  We're going to go portable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they didn't do the easy thing,  which was to follow Apple.  Metro is taking a very different direction in its user  interface than Apple has.  And I think that's brilliant.  I think that's really brave of them.  They haven't gone down the schomorphic route of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apparently, Apple's turning back from that dead end.  Thank goodness for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think it's great that Microsoft  are moving in the direction they are.  Will it be a success?  I don't know.  But at least it's nice to have something out there  that doesn't look like either an Apple product or a knockoff  of an Apple product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, Robert, you mentioned WebOS.  Did you see the LG, which was making a Google TV-based smart  TV, is apparently considering WebOS for a smart TV?  I like WebOS.  I wonder how it will be in a TV interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The WebOS, if it were to even be viable,  would probably have to be, obviously, updated and retooled.  But I think in the end, you'll see not everybody  can have their own ecosystem.  But I think you'll see.  They do now.  Samsung, LG, everybody.  Well, the whole Bata and all that other stuff is silly.  I think in terms of what we see in integration with iOS,  I could see an average max of three consumer operating  systems and maybe an additional two that also have more  enterprise blend of the companies.  Android or Chrome OS?  I don't count Chrome OS or anything close.  I have to tell you something else.  Now that I'm for Best Buy, I can say whatever I want.  I worked for years.  I told Eric Schmidt, I said, 10 years ago,  we didn't know what an Apple store would look like.  Now we do.  What would a Google store look like?  It would look like a Best Buy.  I said, why don't we partner up and put a black cube  in the center of the store?  But what I found out is that there's not one Google.  There's 4,000 of them.  I used to be all Google.  I used to be a Google Notebook.  But I pay for Evernote now.  I only trust companies that focus.  And Google TV, I told them, I said,  we could sell more Google TVs for you.  The day they bought Android, back in 07, I went to Best Buy  and I said, let's go all in on Android.  Every picture frame, every TV.  We were going to sell Mike Arrington's Crunchpad.  See, we were in secret negotiations.  Oh, damn.  And then Arrington threw up his hands and said, I give up.  Robert, the war's over.  Apple won.  I'm like, don't give in the fight.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because Apple was doing its own retail thing.  You needed to find a new niche.  I mean, there were Apple stores in Best Buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think Best Buy.  It's like, Best Buy's not going to win trying to beat  Walmart on price.  And you're not going to beat Apple on design.  And neither is Microsoft either.  Microsoft should be, you know.  What should they be?  Where's their niche?  I think if you believe in the theory that there's a creator,  an intelligent designer in the universe  who has set your life in motion.  Johnny Ive, I think.  That's Apple.  If you understand Darwin's natural selection  by many life forms randomly mutating, that's Android.  And that's also good.  I think Microsoft could be a blend  where they're more open than Apple,  but they're more consistent than Google.  I think that's where they are right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's exactly it.  And I think that's what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what they're doing.  But like Google, let's look at Google Voice.  I use it, but I have now only using it  to transcribe voicemails.  You still can't do MMS.  You still can't do international text.  I hope Larry continues to be more disciplined  and design-worthy because they have been  so unfocused on everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that was kind of,  we were talking about Chrome OS last week  and I was bitching about it.  And of course, Jeff has now decided  he's going to go all Chrome OS just to see how it is.  Push it.  But somebody came to me after the show and said,  really the main point you should have brought up is  they've got two OSs and Android is  in every way superior to Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is really true and I'm dreading,  that's the one thing I'm dreading is that I'll be used  to doing one thing on my Nexus 7  and then another thing on the Chromebook.  And-  Why not just do all Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a real operating system.  It's good enough even to be on the desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, here's the problem.  I thought about that because you can get the Asus tablet  with, which is very much like the Microsoft,  probably the model for it, right?  With the clickable keyboard and all that.  But the applications on Android aren't quite as robust  as the Chrome applications and as, I don't think.  And so if I'm trying to do some serious business stuff,  I'm just fearing it's not going to be as good.  And part of this too, I want to go back to the retail thing  that Robert was raising a second ago.  And I talked to Robert's former colleague, Barry Judge,  who was then CMO of the company about this,  before they went out and visited with Google  and I talked to Google people.  I think that Google should have a retail presence.  Best Buy, imagine if you had a Google corner.  There's now a poor guy in a white shirt  standing by Chromebooks looking lonely  in various Best Buys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And airports too, by the way.  They've taken over from the Hare Krishnas.  Buy an Android, buy a Chromebook, buy a Chromebook.  No, sorry, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Imagine if you had, Google is cool to people.  If you had a place where you could go touch Google things  and Google stuff and play with Google games  and things like that, it makes sense.  It's not, you know, and they don't have it.  So what we were talking about before,  if you want to compare a Nexus 7 to a Kindle Fire,  to the Microsoft thing, to an iPad Mini, you can't,  unless you have a friend who has one.  That's absurd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just saw this and I can't get somebody in the chat room.  Thank you, Kevin and Dublin.  Samsung is making a dock for the Galaxy Note 2,  which is of course the giant phone that,  by the way, how do you like my sporty white leather case?  Very fashionable.  It's like real skeuomorphism.  I made an error somewhere in the ordering, anyway.  Two pounds.  I don't know what the hell I was thinking.  This is so bad.  But anyway, this goes with my white buck shoes  that I'm wearing in my white belt.  But there, Samsung is making a dock for this thing  with HDMI, two USB ports, a speaker port out.  A keyboard?  Yes, this will essentially turn it into a desktop computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wish the Nexus 7 had that.  I'm collusioning together a keyboard for the Nexus 7.  I would love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now see, when I see products like this,  I don't think, oh, I'm a design snob.  They'll never make it.  The way I look at this is exactly another life form  in this Darwinian model.  You nailed it.  Later, Samsung and LG will bump into something genius,  and that's how they do it.  Apple is intelligent design.  Survival of the fittest.  The consumer's all the winner,  it'll increase choice, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Microsoft, we figured it out as the Scientologists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, something.  I mean, choose whatever metaphor you like.  They talk about our space.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry, does that really work?  I mean, they've been saying this for years  about open source and about all kinds of different things.  If you just kind of open it up  and you let everybody do stuff,  then something wonderful is gonna appear at the end of it.  And I'm not actually sure that works  because oftentimes the people that are developing  all these gizmos and gadgets and add-ons and extras  and all the rest of it are developers.  They're people with an engineering background  or a coding background.  They're not somebody that's focused on design.  And I think that why Apple's approach works so well  is because you've got people,  it's being driven by design rather than technology.  So I'm not convinced necessarily  that we are going to see some kind of wonderful,  evolved creature come out of the other end of this  because I think sometimes you do need somebody  to design the creature personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's Johnny Ive and that's the Apple way, right?  Yeah, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's a device, not an ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Design though is merging.  Technology, I don't mean to say that programming  is going to become a commodity.  But storage like Amazon are helping to make  that some of a commodity.  Design is one of the differentiating factors.  It's part of, I don't distinguish now,  I don't think you can be a great developer  without having some either design talent or focus  because absolutely you won't survive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, obviously I'm biased being a designer,  but that's why I quite like what Microsoft are doing  because like you say, they're kind of a hybrid,  they're half way in between where they're much more open  than Amazon, sorry, Amazon, much more open than Apple,  which kind of encourages innovation,  but they still seem to have some kind of  design direction behind them.  So if I was putting money at the moment  on the major competitor with Apple,  I have to say I would say Microsoft rather than Google.  Wow.  That may be completely naive of me,  but okay, yes, fair enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even in the accent, the accent doesn't rescue that.  Doesn't rescue that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's another way to agree with you.  It's like the Gecko, Gecko.  Regardless of how well Microsoft does or doesn't do,  there's room for at least three major ecosystems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So those are the three that you predict,  Apple, Microsoft, and Android.  Do you know which ones are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If HP, when they got rid of-  WebOS had a chance.  Before they got rid of Leo or whatever,  I didn't know anything about him,  but when they had WebOS and John Rubenstein was there,  and I thought if they had developer interest,  there was room for that third one beyond Android.  Now it's going to be Microsoft,  but there'll always be a battle for three  no matter how strong a fourth one is.  So that's another way.  Google and Apple don't have to lose  for Microsoft to do okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, absolutely, but I think the other thing  that goes back to what you were saying earlier,  one of the things that concerns me about Google  is their lack of focus, as you were saying.  It's almost like Yahoo all over again,  they're going in so many different directions  that they're lacking focus.  I feel like Microsoft have almost passed through that era  where they're beginning now to feel  a little bit more focused to me,  certainly in their design aspects.  You're shaking your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yesterday, just yesterday, Balmer said,  Apple hasn't actually made a product yet  that consumers use.  Balmer said that?  Yes, Google it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What world is he living in?  Exactly, as long as-  100 million iPads, but no one's using them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly, he said something to that effect,  almost verbatim, yesterday.  Unbelievable.  And of course he's gonna say that,  but I think you're forgetting that there are decades  of cultural inertia at that company  that have yet to play themselves out.  I don't know that they could sustain  anything they're releasing right now.  Maybe, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, what am I?  I'm just a designer, what do I know about these things?  I just, looking at some of the stuff Microsoft are doing,  I'm more encouraged at the direction that they're going  than I have been for a long time.  That I agree with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fear is a good motivator,  and it's a good way to get focused, right?  When you're scared about someone else  doing something really well  that you haven't been able to pull off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On the other hand, looking over your shoulder  is a pretty bad way to design technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  I mean, that's why it is pretty cool.  I mean, I think the point that Metro  is something new and different,  I think that Microsoft definitely deserves credit for that.  I agree, I agree.  Sorry.  You're using an iPhone.  I am now, sorry.  Leo, you said you really like the Surface.  I'm curious to know, is that gonna be your tablet?  Is that gonna be your entire tablet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're not producers.  That's crazy, don't go crazy on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, lots of people said they liked it,  but is anyone really gonna use it full-time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could, you could easily use it full-time.  But the problem I have with it is it isn't a tablet.  It's really just a very small laptop.  I'm gonna bring it to Australia.  You know, I should mention that this show will be handled  by others for the next couple of three weeks,  because I'm gonna go on a geek cruise leaving on Sunday.  And I am gonna bring that.  I'm gonna bring an iPad mini.  I'm not gonna have an iPad fourth generation by then,  so I'll bring the old iPad.  A Galaxy Note 2, a Galaxy Nexus 7,  which will be useless, because there's no Wi-Fi on the ship.  And then I'll bring a Windows 8, which is also,  Surface RT, which is also useless without Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So when I go on conferences and things like that now,  I mainly just take my iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I noticed that's all you're using.  I see, you know, it's interesting.  This might be a good measure,  because people who do panel shows usually bring,  on this network, usually bring their own computers  or devices.  Far more, more and more are bringing iPads,  often with keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was gonna say, what I haven't got on the desk here  is the Logitech ultra-thin keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I would say if that's what you're doing,  then you should look at Surface RT,  because I think it's exactly that.  Right, okay.  Yeah, it's basically a tablet with a keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the keyboard is better designed.  Yeah.  I love the touch keyboard.  You can use it as a tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a little weird feeling when you do that,  because you've got keys on the,  you're holding keys.  Love the feel.  It's kind of, they say you can do that,  but it doesn't feel right that you've got,  even though the keys aren't live,  I'm typing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not good.  What's the keyboard actually feel like?  Is it a good keyboard for the platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I wish I had brought it today.  I didn't.  So there's two keyboards.  There's a, what they call the touch keyboard,  which doesn't move at all.  It's just keys painted on a plastic surface.  Do you have yours?  Is Alex here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He might have his.  The touch keyboard is like halfway between  a screen keyboard and a real keyboard.  Yeah, well, it's like Chicklets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's Chicklets, right?  Oh, okay.  So it doesn't move at all.  I got the type keyboard.  I mean, this is close.  I mean, it feels like it could be, but it's not.  I could not, sorry.  I don't buy that.  And then, but then there's the,  which was wild, there's the type keyboard,  which actually has moving keys,  and is probably no different than I would say.  Very thin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this a magnetic detach?  Yeah, very good magnetic detach.  Now here's what I'm wondering.  Like when it's magnetic detach,  that felt like something that's clearly patentable by Apple.  And how did so quick,  how does Microsoft so quickly get something  that's obviously so close to what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, let's see if Apple sues.  It's a bet.  It's much better.  Wow.  You can't do that with a smart cover on an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm shaking.  I went by the Microsoft store in my mall  the day it was all announced,  and your Scientology references apt,  because it was like they were cultists all trying,  trying to get people to come in.  It was so sad and so desperate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is-  Marco wrote a sad post about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you know, Marco though,  yeah, I read his posts, but it was a little snarky.  It was unnecessarily snarky.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not a big fan of making fun of people  who make $14 an hour in a demo new software.  I mean, it was a little rough,  but he did make some points about-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some of the points were very well taken.  By the way, this is how Jeff-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he said they were all very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You wouldn't want to hold this.  And the other thing is this is,  because it's 16 nine,  it's just, it's a strange way to hold it in portrait.  It feels odd.  It's also, even though it is not heavier than the iPad,  feels heavier than the iPad.  And even though it's not thicker,  much thicker than the iPad because it's square,  it feels thicker than the iPad.  You know, all this-  Nevertheless, I think this is comparable  to carrying around an iPad and a keyboard.  And I, by the way, the touch keyboard is very good.  I like the touch keyboard a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You guys have given all the attention here,  which I'm not blaming you,  to the Microsoft announcement  and to the Apple announcement.  And Google blew it.  They were going to hold it.  I understand why they canceled it.  We were trying to.  I got derailed.  And I was going to go and on all that,  but they just fizzled.  And I think it's a bigger announcement  than they are getting credit for right now.  Well, I just-  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you think is the biggest story?  The Nexus 4, this high-res Nexus 10 tablet?  $299 for an unlocked-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the big one.  Yeah.  Super phone is pretty amazing.  With the wireless charger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That wireless charger is so cool.  I want that so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it an induction charger?  Like the power map?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I so want that on Apple devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, can I just point out  Windows Phone has that  and has had that for some-  Okay, nevermind.  Now we're moving on from-  Nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Android 4.2 is really cool.  They're calling it the new flavor of jelly bean.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is not Keyline Pie.  It is the new flavor of jelly bean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  It's got swipe typing.  So it's kind of like swipe.  So you drag your finger from letter to letter to type.  Supposedly better and faster.  It's got these not panoramic photos,  but I forget what they're calling them.  You basically can take photos kind of in a 360 area  and it stitches them together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're called photospheres.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Photospheres.  Thank you, Chad.  And user switching, which, you know,  I got to tell you, that's going to be great.  I mean, we leave the Nexus 7 laying around the house  and my wife and I, you know, share it.  And it'll be awesome just for her to be able to switch  to her desktop, her home screen  and for me to switch back to mine.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Microsoft, by the way, did photosynth.  It was, it still is available in iOS.  It does the photospheres.  That's been around for a while.  Let's not forget the Palm pre did the inductance charging  as long as we're talking history.  This looks cool though.  One of the features of 4.2 is daydream mode.  So when you plop your Nexus 4 on the little thing,  it goes into daydream mode and shows photo albums,  news from Google currents and other content as it's,  it's a chumby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it is a chumby.  This charging sphere looks like they took a Nexus Q  and kind of sliced it down the middle.  And it's got magnets in it.  And you can put the phone in portrait or landscape  and then it goes in that daydream mode.  Oh, and Google Now actually got,  and I should have included this in the change on it.  Google Now got an update.  Now shows you cards from Gmail and other,  and it gives you other answers.  I think you can get that on 4.1,  Android 4.1 devices and up right now.  I can't wait to get 4.2 onto my Galaxy Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm still not getting good stuff from Google Now.  I didn't complain about last week.  I go into every possible setting.  If anybody out there has, I've turned it on.  Somebody came in and said,  I got to turn it on in my preferences.  You're holding it wrong or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cause look what I got.  Now this is completely spontaneous.  It's now giving me a card for stocks  that change more than 1% in a day.  Facebook down 3.79% when the stock market  reopened this morning.  Apple down eight bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It knows my stocks and I didn't get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this is, it just, it's telling me  that some packages have shipped from Amazon.  It's, I didn't tell any of this stuff.  What temperature it is, my next show.  It showed me the Niners score,  but I, you know, I swiped that off  cause I've seen, you know, I said it was done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tied it to, I changed all my accounts last week.  So the only thing that's left on my old,  plain old Gmail account is Google+.  Everything else, my phone, Google Now, my browsers,  everything else is my apps account  and I'm not getting crap on now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm loving Android more and more.  Jelly Bean is great.  I can't wait to see more too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does Google Plus allow you by the way,  to do multiple initiate, multiple Google Hangouts  of multi-party on mobile?  Or is it just person to person?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't, I think it's just person.  Should we try it?  No, you can have a group.  You can do a group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can join a group, but can you host one?  Can I host a group?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a good question.  I know, I can't even find how to do it.  It's so hard, so buried.  Where do I, how do I, oh nevermind.  I can never find this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you like it more and more, but you can never find it.  I don't use Google+.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well at least they finally made Chrome  the default browser in Android now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chrome is the default browser in Android 4.2 now?  That's good.  Well I think so.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chrome is a great browser.  Love Chrome.  That's where it's smart, where you have Android  as like your native operating system,  and then you've got Chrome as like the backup.  That's one thing I try to get Sundar Parshad to do,  is to say hey, best buy sells like 25% of all laptops.  Every computer that goes out the door,  let's put a second OS on there.  So if your Windows crashes,  you could boot to a second 100 meg partition.  So put Chrome OS in ROM.  Tried to talk him into it.  I was like, listen, I'll do this for like no charge.  Well, you know why they didn't do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because it deprecates it.  It says, well this is just your backup OS.  It's not a real OS.  They want it to be a real OS.  Is it good?  Good luck with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Getyourgoogleback.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, this is for Windows 8.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Windows 8 users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it doesn't work for RT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh it doesn't, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's kind of a bummer.  They only have a Metro app for the desktop version.  Get your Google back.  The problem was of course  that you don't have a Google search widget on Windows 8.  So you can put Google on your start page  with the Google search app,  but it is not for Windows RT.  I think Google better hurry up  and make one for Google RT.  Windows RT, not Google RT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Getyourgoogleback.com.  How long before this is this week in Surface?  Has it come up yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're launching it actually.  What, December?  We're calling it Turning the Tiles.  I like This Week in Tiles better.  It won't be, yeah it could be This Week in Tiles.  We actually aren't sure.  But yeah, we're not gonna launch a show.  But it won't be Surface, it'll be Metro.  But we can't call it Metro.  RT.  It won't be just RT  because it'll be Windows 8 and Windows Phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is my point.  Microsoft has not changed.  Yeah, they're the same.  They're still fragmented as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  But so is Google.  I like your metaphor.  I love that metaphor.  Intelligent Design, Apple.  Evolution, Google.  Microsoft, we still.  Scientology's a.  It's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's not bad.  It's close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You keep going here.  So that means that Steve Jobs is God.  Larry Page is Moses.  You know Larry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, every person at Google is a mindless slug  that is just running.  Darwin.  Yeah, it's Darwin.  There is no intelligence.  It is just.  I think it's pretty accurate.  Because the PageRank algorithm actually mimics  how insects use chemicals to find food.  It's a reproductive mechanism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And thus Steve Bomber is necessarily,  what's his name?  L. Ron Hubbard.  Scientology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's very apt.  He's L. Ron Hubbard.  It works, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It works, yeah.  The weird thing is that Google's, though,  all their evolutionary motive is powered  by this parallel universe called advertising revenue.  Right.  That funds all their distractions.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So in real evolution, it's the reproduction of the gene.  In Google, it's the reproduction of the ad.  They just want the link.  Yeah, they want the link.  They just give us the link.  The link data.  I think that's very apt.  And it is exactly how Google works,  which is why they can just,  all they have to do is generate.  They have to be generative.  They don't have to come up with good, just generate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The more we use the net, the more they make.  Yeah.  Well, you know.  It's the most beautiful business model there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a certain,  there's only a certain amount that consumers  can absorb of functionality.  There's a lot of things that even iOS does  that most users aren't even aware of.  And nothing breaks my heart more than,  just this afternoon, I gave my wife her new iPhone 5,  and look, it does this.  She's like, I don't care.  I don't care.  Exactly.  This is where Android and Microsoft  can actually make inroads to people  because it's good enough.  I really wish I had the new,  is it called Field Trip?  I love it.  I've been waiting for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's annoying, but I love it.  I'm gonna use it in Australia.  I can't wait to try it.  Now, so okay.  So if Google is evolution,  the survival of the fittest Darwinianism,  then I think France must be Tennessee.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's my view on France.  Every country has a different take on fermented spirits,  chicken and fish, that I know of no culture,  no pun intended, that can take bacteria,  stick it in a cave, and come up with blue cheese.  The French win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The French win on that regard and that account.  After meeting with Eric Schmidt,  France stands by its threat to write a law  forcing Google to pay to link to news sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was on France 24 for a so-called debate on Monday  as the storm was coming through.  I was already in a bad mood,  and the French got me in a really bad mood.  And I just started yelling at them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's Francois Hollande.  I don't know, I don't think Sarkozy as bad as he was.  I don't think even he would have done this.  No, this is beyond.  This is the socialist Hollande.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they keep going around trying to argue that,  well, they make money on our content,  or we have to make money from content.  Well, no, they don't.  They send you options.  Well, we deserve, the content is expensive.  I don't care.  They have a better business model, they're competitive.  Then they drop that whole line in the debate  and said, well, Google doesn't pay its taxes here,  it pays it in Ireland.  We need to get taxes out of it.  We just need money out of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't even know why Google's arguing.  Just pull out.  Just stop linking to news sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And finally, Google has threatened to.  Finally, Google has gotten some more French cojones.  Say fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You'd want us to pay, we're not gonna pay,  so we'll stop linking to sites.  Good luck, good luck with that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They already took on China,  and that didn't really work out so great for them.  But again, they don't really care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't need a link to French news sites.  In effect, the French newspaper will disappear  under the waves, and then that'll be it.  It'll be goodbye, right?  Jeff, someone on Twitter said that he was seeing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  a whole different Jeff Jarvis on TV than he saw on Twig,  and I was wanting to respond that, no, that is you,  but we just soften you a little bit.  So were you like really harsh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I finally just had it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because I'm also screaming at them.  I'm the only guy on Skype,  and they're in the studio,  and I just started going after them.  Is there video of this anywhere?  I really wanna see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but they were using Google Translate to translate you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  until they came across this half of this is a server.  Jeff speaks an interesting form of French.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you speak French?  No, no, no, I don't speak any French.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I still get credit for saying a German word right.  No, it's under-related,  after the meeting with Eric Schmidt there.  There's video, it's long,  and maybe you can just randomly fast-forward.  I would really like to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would really like to just get a clip of you fuming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it was Elgin said I was throwing truth grenades.  I just had it with him. Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Truth grenades.  But nobody on the panel saw it your way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One woman did, defending kind of the new media way  to look at it, but the other guys were just so,  it was just so entitled.  We are the industry, we should be protected and covered.  And I said, why do you,  why should you deserve that protection?  You don't deserve it.  Just because Google makes more money and competes with you,  that means you should take money from them  because you screwed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry.  That's a kind of, for better or worse,  that is a kind of French attitude.  It's a cultural difference.  They have this very different attitude  towards things like this.  I don't agree with them, but it's their right  if they want to throw a wobbly over this  and Google a pullout and that'll be the end of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's Jeff.  You look just as pink on French TV.  No, I do.  I know, I do.  Can you hear him?  Is it me?  Oh, I'm having that thing.  I have it.  Go ahead.  Chad's got a better way of doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What should happen right now is Robert Stevens  should swoop in and fix it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, actually I would like to dub my voice in  and guess what you're saying.  But Monsieur, I could disagree completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's all in English?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's French.  I'm really carrying the product of the devil.  You couldn't have this many Bibles done that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, he's referring to Gutenberg, ladies and gentlemen.  Again, with the religious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google is sending millions of people to media every year  and it's up to media to then do something about that  in the form of serving those people well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People pay us good money to send traffic  to their websites in ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no reason to say that the old industry  has to be protected by society  when a new technology comes along.  But we're seeing old media and government institutions  threatened by the internet joining together  with this kind of Luddite efforts in Germany  with the Leistungstschutzrecht there.  Oh, look at that.  Look at that.  He threw in the Leistungstschutzrecht.  An absurd, laughable, but not so potentially dangerous.  Why potentially dangerous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not going to speak to you.  I'm not going to say a word to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because if suddenly I can be, you could be taxed for,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you could make a big.  And what is the, is it random video they're showing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, they had, they, whenever they,  I hate TV.  Whenever they cut to Jeff,  it was random B-roll off to the side.  This big show is mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we're gonna show you a random B-roll  so you don't get bored.  I feel really to distract people

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  from listening to what he's saying.  That's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At the very end, I took my webcam  and I said to the journalist,  I put it up my window and I said,  we don't need you to tell us it's raining here in New Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love it.  Jeff, you're the best.  So let's take a break.  We've got a good panel here.  Jeff Jarvis and Gino Trapani, as usual, from Boag World.  It's Paul Boag, web entrepreneur  and visitor to the Brickhouse.  Nice to have you.  I know, it's nice to be here.  Yeah, it's great to have you.  Also, former CTO and founder of the Geek Squad,  Robert Stevens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you up to these days, Robert?  I just got my family settled here in San Francisco.  When you moved out of here?  Yeah, I moved two months ago and I live in the city  and my daughter's out of high school,  so it was either now or wait four years.  And I'm taking a year off  and then I've got a few things I'm thinking about doing,  but I won't be going back to any large corporations.  Future angel investor, Robert Stevens.  No, I would be a horrible investor.  I plan on funding my, I fund a Geek Squad myself  and I plan on funding my next startup all by myself.  Do your own thing.  So you're gonna stay an entrepreneur.  Good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

I think we're done with France.  It's obvious.  They're folly.  What, the whole nation?  They make great blue cheese and that's about it.  Google is testing same day delivery for shoppers.  This is something we'd heard Amazon was doing.  This is the real war.  Now the war.  This is where the war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does this do to best buy, Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this is great news for every physical retailer.  What?  This is huge news for every physical retailer.  The one thing that beats free,  again, if you're gonna compete against Walmart on price,  you're gonna be dead.  If you try and compete against Amazon on pure digital,  you're not gonna win.  But the one thing that beats free overnight shipping  is in stock near you right now.  And Google, and I can tell you,  there's probably at least 10 startups right here  in the Bay Area that are working on same day dispatch  because Airbnb, Uber, Instacart, Postmates,  they're all dispatch algorithms.  And that's gonna commoditize it  and make it as easy as cloud computing  for a small little sports shop  that focuses on what they sell  to make their inventory digital.  And Square is gonna help digitize people's inventory.  So over the next couple years, this is great news.  You know, Expedia didn't put travel agents out of business.  They put mediocre travel agents out of business.  The good ones that survived focused,  wedding tourism, ecotourism,  same thing will happen with technologies like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me understand this, Robert.  So what you're saying is that  rather than putting a retailer out of business,  this now makes their inventory able to be delivered  same day through a merchandising platform  such as Google and eBay  and through a delivery platform  like what Airbnb is building.  Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you look at what eBay's done,  and I think they've actually done a brilliant job  of their acquisitions of Magento and GSI.  I met with John Donahoe a year ago.  The first thing he said to me, he goes,  we're not a competitor to Best Buy,  we want to enable commerce.  And you know, again, not every little retailer  is gonna be able to build their own stack.  So they're gonna use Square and other services  like same day delivery,  which is vetted with reputation systems  and varying levels of quality.  This is where Uber could become a verb  much beyond black car service.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Amazon will have stock.  I Ubered by toilet paper today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, in fact, this is what they say.  Google is not intending to operate warehouses  or a shipping service.  Right, so it won't have stock  whereas Amazon will have stock.  They want to team up with retailers and delivery companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now here's my prediction.  Google came to us as with everything else, Google Wallet.  And they only call you when they want something.  My prediction, Google will have a lot of money.  They'll make a big splash.  They will not execute very well, especially on this.  This is a company that doesn't even have an 800 number.  Try and get them on the phone.  Yeah.  You think they're gonna do well in the physical world?  I will trust a company that's more like an Evernote  or an Uber that focuses on that.  Or Amazon, right?  Does Amazon have a head start here?  I think you're gonna see, again, a blended version.  One is where it's either high end  or they're independent contractors  who may show up in a jean and a t-shirt,  but they'll get the product to you.  They may not be dressed very nicely.  I also really love these lockers.  Like a courier.  Like a courier.  Yeah, or these lockers systems.  In fact, I predict that they're gonna sell one.  I would buy one.  Imagine like a three foot cube  that you could lock outside your house  in the side of your house.  And it could be unlocked with disposable codes  for the UPS guy to drop stuff off.  I would like that,  because I miss a lot of deliveries.  That's a good idea.  You're gonna see,  I bet there's at least one or two startups.  I know one is doing it like that.  They're doing like the cart systems for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if I had a Google Locker in my front porch,  things would arrive in there.  Again, I don't think we could do this.  It's kind of like the mailman.  Or the milkman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, which he's replacing anyway, yeah.  This replaces the mailman.  So the postal service,  not to go off on a tangent here,  but the postal service is becoming purely  an advertising delivery mechanism.  Right.  It's just crap right now.  That's what it does.  It's circular.  So there are opportunities.  The only growth area in delivery is parcels and deliveries.  And it's super growth  if you could now take the things you used to drive to  and have them come to you.  Gina, you as a new mom,  are you ordering things in more,  less wind-destroying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, definitely.  Definitely.  Yeah, we have a rough time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and that's the thing.  I don't want to go to a,  I don't, even if Amazon has boxes at 7-Eleven,  which they're doing in some areas,  and I can go pick up my stuff,  I want it at my doorstep.  Yeah.  I don't even want to get in the car at all.  I don't want to leave the house.  But see, that's why I think brick and mortar  is kind of troubled.  Yes, people still go to brick and mortar  because they need toilet paper now,  or a diaper now.  But wouldn't it be great if you could go online,  order the diaper and still have it now?  Isn't that what we're trying to get to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, if something could be ordered better  and easier and faster and less expensive online,  it will be.  But there is something about browsing.  Now, not every category of things  like consumer electronics,  not everything that's sold in the Best Buy  is going to just remain in Best Buy  even with same-day delivery.  I'm not saying that at all.  But new kinds of retail.  Physical retail has a lot of life left.  It's a very social experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what Jeff's been talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  You know, listen, when the CD-ROM first came around,  it was the death of the book.  And you know, there's still books in bookstores.  When the DVD came out,  they said it's the death of the movie theater.  I'm seeing more creativity and nice plush chairs  and better food at movie theaters.  So I'm not worried about physical retail.  It's going to kill the mediocre retailers.  And that'll create a glut of real estate.  But you know, if you believe that there's a retail god  that smiles down upon little shopkeepers,  GPS and same-day delivery are just the beginning  of good things for them and square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If they can figure out how to capitalize,  if they can be that quality shopkeeper  that knows how to take advantage of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know,  like the food truck movement's very interesting  because now people who are saying,  I don't even have enough capital yet to start a restaurant.  So they start with a food truck, build up their name,  and then become a physical restaurant.  In Minneapolis, they're doing a light rail right now.  And there's this one Jamaican restaurant  that got shut down  because the construction ruined their business.  So they converted to a food truck for two years  until the street is restored.  So that's what's so cool right now  because you just can kind of go any direction you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You'll love San Francisco.  We have a little event every week  where all the food trucks gather.  Off the grid.  Yeah, off the grid.  You know about that already.  I'm hip to that, man.  You're hip, man.  You're with it.  You're doing it, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's already there.  I got my bread from Tartine  and I got my mission bicycle company.  How long have you been here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Two months, man.  Man, you just really acclimated.  Where were you from originally?  I've been watching the show for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where do you think I learned all this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Off the grid is really fun.  All the food trucks gather  and it's a food bazaar and it's amazing.  This is the one in the Upper Haight on Thursdays  right there at Golden Gate Park at the Panhandle.  It's pretty cool.  Pretty cool.  Makes you hungry just thinking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a few, few trucks here in San Diego  but nothing quite like that event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, we used to call them roach coaches, right?  It was like you didn't really trust  what you were gonna eat there.  Now it's like gourmet.  It's the creme brulee man comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now it's the Silicon Valley of food, yeah.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Modern organic Filipino cuisine.  That's that truck.  Only in San Francisco.  Some of them try it.  I can't wait to do a cooking show here.  Organic balut.  We need a little miniature kitchen in the studio.  Now did you see on Sunday, Robert Scoble was on  and he's writing a book on Google Glass  and apparently got more access to glass  than most of us was able to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Robert sees the world differently at all times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's an enthusiast so I always, he loves everything.  So I know when he, just cause.  Until he hates it.  Right, it's just cause Robert says it's great  doesn't mean it's great.  But he was waxing on and on about Google Glass  and he says it works.  It does what you might think for instance,  that field trip program that you're excited about Robert.  Imagine that's on your glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but Lord help us when the politicians  walk around with these things.  Hey, Robert, how are you?  You gave me $1,000 last week.  Thank you for the $178 donation last week.  And I also love your mother's alma mater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly, they're practically doing that already.  Automated sincerity.  You should see the text messages  I get from Barack these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but listen, I wanna agree on one thing for Robert.  Okay, from now on, a year after Robert  is really excited about any app,  we're gonna have to make him like start reusing apps  that he recommended a year later  and relive his own recommendations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nothing wears out faster than a Robert Scoble app.  I don't know, I think Glass has a lot of potential.  We'll see, he does not have it yet,  but he was able to play with it a little bit more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was gonna ask if he has them.  That's the trick, he has them, he's actually using them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's just like you and me, he's got his number.  He's got a low number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've gotta live with something like that  day in and day out, don't you really?  I just think-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My big problem is I have prescription glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they're gonna solve that.  In fact, supposedly, you'll go to your optometrist  and he'll say, would you like that  with or without Glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh.  I think I'd put Robert's wife, Marianne, on sometime.  I would just like to thank her.  I'd say, you know, Mrs. Scoble,  you're the most patient, understanding woman I've ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, this feels like it could be  kind of Bluetooth headsets all over again.  That with Bluetooth headsets, I don't know about over here.  It's so annoying.  But you just look a complete prat  walking around with one of these headsets on.  And I just think unless the glasses look  just like the pair of glasses I'm wearing now,  no different whatsoever,  you're gonna look like an idiot.  And also, the other thing is I've got a feeling  when you're having conversations with people,  it's gonna feel like you're not giving them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  your attention. No, they're looking off to your left.  So we'll look at the screen about what that says  about what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So basically, you seem totally disinterested  in whoever you're talking to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But aren't people already doing that  where they walk around with their, I mean-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, better than looking down at your phone, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go downtown, just look.  Nobody's looking at anything.  They're all looking at their phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but downtown in San Francisco.  No, not in wherever the hell you're from?  No, in the middle of, they don't even know  what phones are where I come from.  You really are from the-  Oh, I'm totally on the stick.  When I take out my iPhone, they call it the magic box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  I'm making that up, but-  You're gonna capture my soul.  Yeah, no, and it's what's nice about a really big phone  like the Note 2, you can really get lost in it as you walk.  You walk into trees.  It feels like it's getting a little bit like the clergyman  in the 18th century,  walk around with a prayer book constantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't there an app actually that allows you to read email  and stuff that shows the camera view?  There is.  So that you can see where you're going.  That seems very dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's who Microsoft is.  They're the Gideons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're the Gideons.  A Bible in every hotel room, Windows 8 in every pot.  Let's see, what else?  Anything more about the Google announcement?  I think not.  Did you see that a Google employee  left the Nexus 4 in a bar in San Francisco?  Oh, that, you mean by memories?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I was waiting for somebody to do that  because that is the way to launch a phone  because it would get all the attention.  You want coverage? Sure.  I think they should have left them in about 100 bars  as their launch announcement  because that would actually work making it look intentional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not for sale.  I'm not kidding.  Special secret Google project, one niner four.  That is a good idea.  It's a good PR stunt, that would be.  Good marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would have left it in the exact one over in Walnut Creek  or wherever that poor kid left it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Nexus 4, 299, November 13th availability.  Where is it gonna be?  It's from Google, so I guess it's T-Mobile or AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you drive by directly from Google.  AT&T is the only one that's gonna sell it.  There's controversy because it doesn't have LTE  and some believe that's Google kowtowing,  caving to the phone companies for not including LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  T-Mobile is gonna have an unlocked 199 version  with a two-year contract.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but no LTE.  Quiet, I just don't know if I wanna go T-Mobile again.  Don't you feel like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm using my Nexus on AT&T,  and except for right now during the storm,  it works pretty darn well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd just like to say for the UK listeners  that it's going to be exclusive to O2,  because you always say to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't know, that's why we're living in a country that's.  Exclusive to the O2, it says here.  We're bordered by water all around,  and the people in the other countries are far away.  They talk funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are very long way away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should mention something.  I was in Europe the last two weeks.  In Dublin, we were there for a conference.  You can buy a 20 euro All You Can Eat Sim.  That's from three.  Yeah, three, right?  Yeah, you can put it in your Verizon iPhone 5  that's unlocked.  Unlocked.  And there's a heat roller.  So can you get a nano sim?  No, you just take the little clippers  and you turn that down.  I have a nano sim cutter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But also.  That makes me nervous though,  because it cuts some of the metal on the contacts.  It's pretty tolerant though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because up to the metal you're fine.  There's a lot of redundancy.  There's a vending machine that sells data sims in Heathrow.  It's a vending machine.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's brilliant.  Unfortunately, it's not the same  in other European countries.  I wish it were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they're getting better on that slowly.  They've now kind of capped how much people are allowed  to charge between European countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, that's right.  So that's better than it is.  The roaming has gotten cheaper, yeah.  I'm looking forward to,  now when I get to,  maybe somebody in the chat room could help me.  When I get to Australia on Tuesday,  and I will bring an iPhone 5 so I can pop a nano sim.  Will I be able to do the same thing with Telstra  or one of the Australian carriers?  I'd like to.  That'd be great.  Three is a, are they like a budget carrier?  What's the deal with them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, three are, they're kind of,  they haven't got the same reach as the other.  They're the T-Mobile or Sprint.  Yes, so they tend to do really good deals.  They're all just unlimited data for 20 pounds.  They're very focused on data.  That's their big thing.  So that's a brilliant deal.  I'm gonna move my wife across onto that deal.  My son is on it at the moment,  which he loves.  He never makes calls, but he uses loads of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the reason no LTE is,  because Google wants, of course,  to control software, no carrier intervention,  and there's no LTE carrier, apparently, and we'll go for it.  Verizon and Sprint say there's no such thing  as an unlocked CDMA device.  We're not gonna do it.  AT&T, which is GSM, is on different frequencies,  so Google would have to build a custom phone for the US,  as opposed to worldwide,  and if AT&T won't subsidize it,  it doesn't make any financial sense to do it.  Andy Rubin calls the lack of LTE a tactical issue  and also cites cost and battery life  is another reason not to support LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have HS, what is it, HSPA plus?  HSPA plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which, you know, the truth is,  it's not all that bad on T-Mobile.  I saw, actually, a speed comparison in New York  since the storm,  and a lot of people using other carriers, T-Mobile,  nobody has a T-Mobile phone,  so they were actually getting  a much better performance on T-Mobile,  even though it wasn't LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you see in the chat room,  they just said that three is in Australia?  Ah!  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a Nano Sim cutter I'm gonna bring with me.  That'll get through the TSA.  Do that live.  Where do you buy a Nano Sim cutter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody brought it to me.  I think you can buy it online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Most of the shops are called that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you declare that as income?  Under taxes.  So you know, you have to report that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's only 50 cents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a question for Jeanne, if I may.  Jeanne, since you're a developer,  what's your view on Android,  the fragmentation, the different resolutions,  is that, it feels like it's not becoming  any less of a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not.  I mean, generally, when you build your app,  you have a lot fewer people using  the most recent version of Android.  I started doing mobile development on Android,  so I was always thinking about different resolutions,  different screen resolutions, different versions,  whether or not the device had a keyboard or not,  whether or not it had data or not.  I was always kind of thinking about all those options.  I think a lot of other folks started on iOS,  and were so used to everyone being on,  the majority of their users being on the latest version,  and it being one device to target,  that the transition to Android was more painful for them.  I mean, I don't know, I come from a web development  background where I started on the web,  when there were lots of different browsers,  and we were writing crappy JavaScript  to detect which browser you were using,  and you had to think about targeting different versions.  So it didn't feel that different to me on Android.  It's painful.  It's something that Google really has to remedy.  I think that they're doing that,  in part, by building up the Nexus line.  I've been a huge fan of the Nexus line  since the very beginning,  and basically, the Nexus phones are the only ones,  devices are the only ones, really,  that I get excited about buying,  because I feel like I know I'm gonna get the latest updates,  I know I'm gonna get to see the latest Android,  but as a developer, it's painful.  They need to do a better job  of getting people upgraded faster,  but for me, it hasn't been as big a deal.  I think other mobile developers,  especially those who started on iOS and came to Android,  feel like it's a much bigger problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's also an issue where you've got future devices.  As a new device comes along,  that's another screen resolution,  another set up that you've got to worry about,  and so it gets quite expensive for people  that are hiring these,  paying for these apps,  that they've got to keep upgrading,  which is why a lot of companies now are looking  at responsive design and being web-based  in order to solve this problem.  Of course, that comes with lots of limitations to it as well,  the biggest one being speed at the moment,  but that's another way of dealing with it,  because with responsive design,  you're not designing for any specific device  or any specific screen size,  you're building something that essentially responds  to whatever size you're currently working on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Responsive design is great for web development,  and I think that the tools that Google provides  for making your app work across different layouts  are actually quite good.  I mean, with the iPhone, when the iPhone 5 came out,  I had to make a new bitmap image  that would perfectly fit the new 4-inch screen,  and that's the launch.  This app is a particular image, a bitmap,  and on Android, it's like you provide assets  for different resolutions,  and yeah, that's a pain.  A friend of mine just ported her iOS app to Android,  and she tweeted out the list of all the sizes  of all the images that she had to create,  and she was like, this is crazy.  It keeps designers in business,  and it's a little bit of a pain,  but the tools are getting better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I haven't done any Android development myself.  Does it suffer from the same problem  that you get with iOS,  that the actual applications become quite big  because they're holding all the graphics  for the different resolution sizes?  Yeah.  So you have this problem,  which is gonna be an issue with people  that have got low-end devices without a lot of storage.  Suddenly, apps are getting so much bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  That's why things like  Android with user switching,  if one user downloads an app and installs it,  and plays the game and has a high score,  and you switch to the new user,  and that person wants to install that app,  it does it instantaneously.  It uses all the files that are already on the phone  with separate user settings.  So that was a nice implementation of that.  But yeah, that is a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Linus, I like Linus's idea  that we should have a standard resolution for laptops  of now 2560 by 1600.  I wonder if we could do the same for phones.  No, I guess we can't,  because there's four by three, there's 16 by nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just don't think it's gonna happen.  Wouldn't it be nice, though, to have like...  Yeah, it'd make my job a lot easier,  but I don't think it's particularly feasible, unfortunately,  because there are always gonna be people  that are interested in different size screens,  and you're gonna end up with people  with a very large screen,  but a really low resolution on it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google, the other last domino,  false Google signs finally with Warner Music,  which means now it has all the big four record labels,  not just in the US, but globally.  Green Day, Madonna, Neil Young,  and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, now on Play.  Also coming November 13th,  Google Play available matches in Europe.  That's just for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, thanks.  Thanks, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the big, I have two teenagers at home,  I have to say the biggest surprise I've seen in the last year,  besides my kids almost, and all their friends,  stop using Facebook and almost all go to Twitter.  Exclusively. Wow.  Oh yeah, what, and...  Wow.  But the other thing is, my kids,  and all their friends do it.  They're sitting there playing Xbox,  my kid has his MacBook, laptop open,  and all their music is being listened to through YouTube.  YouTube, my kids do. Yeah, no Spotify,  no iTunes, all YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Spotify's more common in the UK, unsurprisingly,  but they do, yeah, a lot of,  they have the videos running in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love Spotify, but YouTube has such a huge amount  of attraction with kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So are they making playlists of music videos,  is that what's happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they, no,  because I think they're just using their browser history,  because kids tend to listen to like the same 10, 20 songs.  But they're able to use Facebook in the background  and switch it.  And they're not looking at the pictures,  they're just listening to music.  I don't know this for sure,  but I think what happened is Google worked it out  with the music company saying, listen,  if we increase the quality of the audio  in the YouTube video, it used to be crappy.  If we increase the audio, we'll keep the kids in the browser,  you'll get all the data with us,  and we'll advertise to them, not just on interstitials,  but on banners on the side.  And I will tell you, I just had a,  I had a 25 year old hipster yesterday in the Bay area  who told me, YouTube's not doing that well.  I'm like, dude, you're old school, man,  because my kids, all they listen to is through YouTube.  And that really surprised me.  And I think that's just the beginning of, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm with you, I took the Google TV  out of the television system,  because it was just causing problems.  And my son said, hey dad, what happened to that thing  that let us watch YouTube?  They were, they would put on a 70, 60 inch TV,  they would just sit around, five guys,  18 year olds watching YouTube.  And it was, a lot of it was music,  but a lot of it was also grind shots.  I mean, it was a variety of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, my nine year old son doesn't watch TV at all anymore.  It's YouTube.  It's just YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's what I think they're gonna do.  They're gonna merge YouTube with Google Hangouts.  So the big school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they already have, you can do a YouTube,  a Google Hangout where you're playing videos for each other.  You can already do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That, I think, I don't think the teenagers  have discovered that yet.  I think part of the reason they've jumped to Twitter,  my guess is, partly just the iOS integration  and celebrities that they follow are using it.  Yeah, but they've almost all stopped using Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would guess your teens are not talking on Twitter.  They're mostly seeing celebrities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're talking.  I've had to kind of talk to my kids saying,  you guys, Twitter's like all public.  This is not like your Facebook feed,  where your stuff is only seen by your friends.  That's weird.  So.  That's not good.  Yeah.  That Snapchat is the thing though  that they're all using now.  Snapchat.  Oh, Google that.  Snapchat is the hottest thing for teenagers right now.  This basically is disposable text messages.  It's in the app.  Oh yeah, look, they're having fun.  You send a photo.  You send a photo and these kids are sending  every 60 seconds.  I think it's stupid,  but I've also learned not to judge teenagers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's on Google Play or on the app store.  So it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you send a text message or a picture,  it is erased off the other person's phones.  So it could be used for obviously less savory,  unhealthy things for teenagers to do  that they are known to do.  They're doing it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, it's photo sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if I send you a photograph.  I'm gonna install this thing.  I can then delete the photograph that you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's automatically.  It only lasts for 12 seconds.  It's like the O'Reilly Ignite conferences.  Yeah, this has only got one year.  You get it now or never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  It's like disposable.  Now one of those girls are shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I understand.  Look what, what do you think they're looking at?  Take a look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I get to show me what they're doing.  A lot of times they're riding in the back of the car  and they literally just do like 10 per minute.  They're just constantly doing it.  That's bizarre.  I can't even see the appeal of that.  This is how fast we become obsolete.  All right, like you need this week in teenagers  because there's a whole other universe of content.  No, I don't want you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because it won't be Snapchat next week.  And so what's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scobel should host it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Scobel, you never even heard of Snapchat.  I'm downloading it now.  I'm gonna Snapchat Scobel.  Of course, she'll be on there already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just had an article yesterday.  So somebody just covered it.  They either raise money,  or they're building a pretty big thing.  Real time picture chatting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Five stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somebody in the, JoJo in the chat room  has said a really good thing, which is,  okay, it might only be there for 12 seconds,  but you can take a screenshot in 12 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what these teenagers don't know.  They're gonna learn that the whole way.  I know actually they disabled the screenshot.  I tried to test it.  They actually disabled that while the app was running.  That?  I just didn't know you could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is this released three days ago?  This has updated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this has been,  my kids have been doing it for at least three months.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It looks like the Android version.  Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you look at the Android version and the installs,  it's like a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's one day and it's 100,000 to 500,000.  Oh, they must have just launched the Android version then.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been on iOS for about three months.  That's...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Make that 100,001, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm gonna Snapchat you, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, why don't you Snapchat  from your Australian...  I will.  I'm gonna Snapchat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So can you do group or is it just one person?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's like a group thing.  You know, I mean, these WhatsApp  and these other kind of text messaging apps.  I use that.  This is the iteration of that flavor,  which has been kind of popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's definitely teenage colors, purple and yellow.  No adult would want a color like that.  Show the designer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you look at it in the app store as well,  the sample screens that they show  have all got attractive young teenage girls  jumping around on it.  So it's very well taught.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My son is on it.  Your son's on it.  Holy cow.  This is the awkward portion of her...  Awkward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Awkward.  This is like sexting app.  Wait a minute.  This sexting app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lisa's on it too.  What the hell?  And Apple computer is on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, that's just all of your...  It's just an...  No, it says friends on Snapchat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, right, yeah.  Kevin Rose.  He's probably an advisor and investor.  Steve Wozniak's on it.  I don't wanna see that.  That's quite terrifying.  All right, so now I get a picture  and I'm gonna take a picture of you and Gina.  And now where does it go?  Send it.  It goes to your two friends.  Team Snapchat or anybody I add.  I see.  All right.  And then, but they get it.  You don't have your...  Do you have it on your phone?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  I'm installing right now.  Are you?  Okay, Gina, just tell me what your username is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And as soon as you have it, I'll send you a picture.  Okay.  Is it gonna be Gina Trapani?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  You can also type it in the Google Doc chat  if you don't want it to be public.  Too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, just tell me when you're signed on.  I'm Leo Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  It's installing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're gonna get the worst pictures, Leo.  Do you have to accept people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or does it just go to them?  We're completely derailed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It can't totally.  They'll have to accept.  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you do.  Otherwise, anybody could send you anything.  You've just announced your ID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Get ready for some snaps, Leo.  So what you're saying is this is the chat roulette

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of text messaging.  All right, I've added you, F&Done.  Send me some texts.  All right, so I'm gonna send that to you, F&Done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now.  I'd like to apologize for all your viewers.  We're just completely hijacking this afternoon.  And who's Team Snapshot?  I'm not an investor, by the way.  I have no stake in any of this.  Press and hold.  I think Kevin Rose is an advisor though.  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, they sent me a little welcome.  That's why Kevin's on it.  Yeah, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he's too old for this now.  I sent you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, I'm on.  All right, Gina, I'm gonna see this.  I'm gonna add you now.  Oh boy.  Oh boy, this is so much fun.  This is television history, baby.  All right, send that to Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, they launched on Android yesterday.  That's why they're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this is new on Android.  So this is completely appropriate for this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not too much stretch.  Not at all a stretch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plug yours in for like real-time screen sharing of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, see, and I could send it to Gina  and I'm gonna send it to my son and Kevin Rose  and really confuse the hell out of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, your son will now drop Snapchat.  Yeah, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's how it's dead to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Immediately.  So I just sent that picture to you guys.  That's interesting.  Yeah, that's how you actually protect your kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is you join the services that they join  and then they're off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, they won't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There it is.  So it works, but it's now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hold it up and see how long before it gets deleted.  And then it's gone.  It's gone.  I hope you enjoyed that quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so you tap the, oh, that's interesting.  So you have to tap it, you tap and hold  and then it's just gone.  All right, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  TechCrunch says it's not sexting.  So there you go.  And if they say it.  If they say it, it must be true.  Yeah, and you can set how long it lasts.  How many seconds it lasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Up to 10 seconds.  So it can't go past 10 seconds.  That's insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As someone who is obsessed with saving our web history,  this drives me a little crazy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like, no, I want that picture.  It was created by a Stanford college kid, Evan Spiegel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a really important point, Gina.  That's really, really important, I think.  Not to go up in the clouds,  which we tend to do once in a while,  but I think that this idea  that something is public and permanent,  this is probably your answer to privacy,  but it's really a shame and a tragedy  that you have no record of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I would love to hear Dana Boyd's take on this,  but it's clear that what's happening  is that kids are going,  oh, God, this stuff lives forever,  and that's why they're gravitating to this.  Oh, this doesn't live hardly at all.  It's the mayfly of photo sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it is fascinating as well,  the number of apps that exist that place limitations on you  and that actually that becomes their selling point.  So Twitter, 140 characters.  This, it's only there for 10 seconds.  Even Instagram, you know.  There's too much freedom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's too much freedom.  It is I am the pentameter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't like freedom.  It's too much.  It's too complicated.  Too much.  You should move to France.  Yeah.  In France, the head's for them.  All right, I just want to briefly show,  since we were talking about,  we're gonna take a break,  then we're gonna come back with your tip and number,  and I'll have a tool for you,  although I think Snapchat's a pretty good tool.  I got my Bespoke Post box.  Do you know about this?  This is kind of fun.  This is a whole trend in Manhattan.  It's a surprise box?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a Snapchat of in-home delivery retail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't know what you're gonna get.  You don't know what you're gonna get.  You subscribe for somebody.  It's a good thing for a geek  because you don't want to give geeks gadgets  because they already know what they want.  You don't want to do that.  So this one is coffee,  but every month it's a different package.  So I got some like artisan beans.  I've got a ceramic burr grinder, hand grinder.  I've got, have you ever used this?  The Aeropress, the Rubbi Aeropress?  This is the best way to make coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but I was following your whole thing  about which machine you bought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I love the one I got, by the way,  the Breville dual boiler.  This is a little less than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I ran the math on it.  Two lattes a day or a two household family.  Okay, two lattes per person  with a two person that's four lattes a day.  A $1,200 special machine pays for itself  in about three or four months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, Leo, the big question I have  is what do you think of the new Starbucks machine?  The Clover?  No, I'm not a fan.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We did that, you and I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, the new machine is junk.  It's a pod machine.  It's a pod machine.  Nobody who loves coffee would ever consider pods.  Oh, excuse me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please.  Every company, I don't know, it wasn't one,  it wasn't one Kings Lane,  but a company tried to do this where you pay a fee.  It was the shoe company, Shoe Dazzle, I think.  Yeah, Shoe Dazzle.  They would send you stuff.  And they were subscription and then they said, huh.  It didn't work.  Didn't work.  It didn't work really well.  I think the problem is  because it's like a regression to the mean.  They have to include, it's like the wine club thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Alexia Sousis was mad though  because she apparently had quite a few.  You pay $39 a month and you build up credits.  I think they went to subscription from an,  I can't remember, but yeah, they had to change their money.  Yeah, well, they do have a grab bag you get every month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Inevitably, it's gonna regress to the mean  and you're gonna be disappointed  with 70% of the stuff you get in your car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you don't have to do it.  You don't have to, you know ahead of time.  I think this is cool.  We'll see.  They had socks, shaving gear, it's for men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love the idea of it.  I love it too.  I just think companies have to be really rigorous  on what they're curating for it.  It's curation, isn't it?  That's what it is.  We're all lazy.  By the way, this same day delivery,  the backlash against that will be the carbon output  of everybody getting in home delivery.  It'll have to be like some regular delivery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Except it's the same truck.  If this truck is going around anyway,  then it's not a big deal.  I agree.  It'll be a train.  It'll be a little train.  I want a box on my porch and tracks in front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it'll go to that  where you have a little of a thing go by  and it'll be on the schedule.  It could be electric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ford makes that electric transit car  that just goes around.  I want a monorail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Monorail.  Now that Disney owns Lucasfilm.  What do you think of that?  I think, well, first of all,  the whole circular completion,  the fact that Jobs bought Pixar from Lucas  became the biggest shareholder of Disney.  And now Lucas is the second biggest shareholder of Disney.  I think that's quite poetic.  I think, frankly, Lucas, after Jar Jar Binks,  deserved to lose control of his own franchise.  He's retiring, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's saying, I'm gonna sell it to somebody  who'll keep it alive.  But somebody had a very good idea  because Disney also owns Marvel.  And what we really wanna see is Hulk taking Jar Jar  and going boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  And I think that would be,  I'd just go see that for two hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I trusted anybody, I'd give, who knows?  Maybe even Pixar would get a crack at some stuff.  But I like the idea of them rejuvenating  some Star Wars action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To be honest, it can't be any worse than the last couple films.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll be better.  They'll get Chris Nolan, they'll get great directors,  Fincher, they'll do something really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I think will happen.  Jon Febrile was awesome as the director of Iron Man.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Disney, they're content guys.  By the way, this is the future of home delivery.  And I plan to have this soon, is pneumatic tubes.  We wanna put this here in the brick house.  You put the thing in a tube.  You're still steampunk.  You're a steampunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he goes, we're a steampunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I worked at newspapers that had that.  Yeah, it works good, doesn't it?  We sent it to the composing room.  You can always blame it when it got stuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You roll up the thing.  Everything has to fit in a tube.  That's the only negative.  You put it in the tube, you close it, you put it, boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could put some very creative things in tubes, Leo.  We learned that late at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He sent a cheesesteak sandwich through the pneumatic tube  which was not a good idea.  I wonder if Mythbusters ever did anything  with a pneumatic tube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wasn't that how mail was delivered  all around the city of Paris under the streets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pneumatic tubes, only in Paris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's probably how they still expect data to move there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm trying to find, there's still-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody's made an internet tubes joke yet.  I was thinking about it.  You all had it on the tip of your tongue.  You all missed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are many companies still making  these pneumatic tube systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess they exist.  I mean, they always used to exist before email,  didn't they, for moving memos around?  So what do they get used for?  Oh, money.  Banks use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like drive-up at power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Drive-ups at banks.  We have one over here.  You can't use it, but it's there.  It's just sitting there waiting for somebody.  Ah yeah, Instructables.  They did.  Pneumatic soda can cannon.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I knew that Mythbusters would have done  something like that.  That's hysterical.  Gina Trapani, do you got a, do you got,  I don't know what happened to me.  Hey, do you got a-  Yo. Yo. Yo, Gina.  A tool for us there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have a tip of the week.  I have a lot of friends and family on the coast  where near Jeff, near where Jeff is.  Some in New Jersey, some in New York.  There's still a lot of power outages around that area  after Hurricane Sandy.  And of course, Google set up a crisis map  for Sandy pretty quickly.  And they have a power outage information  on that crisis map now.  It's kind of a layer that you can enable.  It's kind of helpful.  I mean, you can zoom in on the area  if you have friends or family  that you want to check in on.  I'm trying not to text people  because I know they're trying to save their batteries  on their phones.  But you want to see the status  of where they're at power outage wise.  There are links to the local power company there.  So I was zoomed in on New Jersey and I looked at,  it's PG&E, is that who it is, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  PG&E, really?  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not specific, it's something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you know, sometimes the sites are slow  because there's lots of people checking on the status.  But if you're interested to know who's still in the dark  for Hurricane Sandy, Google's crisis maps at google.com.  It's apparently down.  Oh no.  Google.org slash crisis map.  That's so weird.  How could it be down?  Five minutes ago it was up.  So I don't know, maybe Twig just took it down.  But there's power outage information there  and some more information.  They're Snapchatting the crisis map though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're giving it up to 11 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I should check to see if I've...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google's crisis map was really, really good.  You know, being able to see where the storm was,  what was happening in one spot.  It was a very good effort, I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, what did you use, Jeff, to figure out where to go  and where you talked to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was nothing, there was nothing.  And the problem was that we lost,  I guess I'll go in the numbers now.  There's 2.6 million of us in Jersey without power.  Wow.  Oh.  Wait a minute, YouTube is down and Gmail is down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What?  Oh.  Google.com's up.  I was trying to go to YouTube.  Both of us were trying to go to YouTube  and it wasn't working.  Yeah.  And I thought it must be a local disruption,  but the chat room's reporting it too.  Gmail's down.  Google's down.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My Gmail's working.  Oh, YouTube has just come up from the...  YouTube is 1.1%?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's up and down.  It's up and down.  You know what, apps is working, but Gmail's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, regular Gmail is down right now.  Holy cow.  Yeah, this is Gmail.  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're listening to us.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't remember a Google-wide outage ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's crazy.  It must be.  Yeah, my Gmail is stuck uploading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Check Google Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What does Buzz say?  I don't even know what's Google Wave.  That's just mean, Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't know how cruel that is, Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, you know, I spent years inside Best Buy  telling Google, I'm practically a Google employee,  a mole for you.  I'll put Android across every device we sell,  Chrome OS on every laptop, I got nothing.  Now, they're dead to me.  Fair enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are some...  I'm looking at the internet weather report.  There are some servers and routers down.  Of course, in the East Coast, quite a few.  I have to think it must be related to Sandy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm actually, I'm using my Gmail.  It seems okay.  YouTube is definitely down.  I'm getting service unavailable.  But Gmail, I'm okay.  What's the app status dashboard say?  Yeah, the app status dashboard says everything's green,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but that's obviously not right.  Well, that's what I'm on.  Yeah, it seems to be, it seems to vary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The app status dashboard's down.  Right.  It's Halloween, they went ticker-treating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, it is.  I think it might be down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It seems like it varies in different parts of the world.  There's actually no history

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  on the app status dashboard that's showing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, if you had a Chromebook, Jeff, you'd be screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd be screwed, that's true,  but I'd be no more screwed than I am now, Leo,  which is really kind of the point.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  I'll segue into the number.  So 2.6 million numbers without power.  I have, the cell coverage is very, very bad,  worse than usual, not just because people are using it,  I think because a lot of those cell towers  probably lost power.  And it occurred to me that when we built the POTS system,  the plain old telephone system,  there was an expected up,  there was an up expectation to the system  and the way it was engineered,  there was a monopoly that did it,  and there was a safety issue.  And we've chosen not to invest in infrastructure  to that extent.  And one realizes ever more how dependent we are.  We've gone through only 100  of what people went through in Katrina here,  though the shore here is in disaster.  2.6 million of us are without power.  It's amazing, I'm on the air right now  thanks to the Gerald A. Dardodge Foundation  in Morristown, New Jersey,  which is a pocket of electricity  in the otherwise powerless state.  And I spent yesterday with neighbors of mine  tearing down trees, trying to get out of the neighborhood,  which is also how I'm here, because we were stuck.  You don't wanna see me with a chainsaw, by the way.  If you, Leo, I put up the link,  if you look at my Google Plus feed,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you'll see. I can't get to it  because it's on the Google Doc.  Oh, Jesus. Which is down.  It's down. By the way, this is the page  I'm getting right now when I go to Google Drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go to...  502, what is a 502?  That's a, only Google has them.  Go to Google Go Plus, is Google Plus up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nope, I just died.  I have to say, this is a huge story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't seen this much down in a long time.  This is gigantic.  I clicked through things.  The data centers, you know why?  Data centers on the East Coast  started running out of power or whatever, and backups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't Google spread a little bit more widely  than just the East Coast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but they'll probably,  I mean, they may have to replicate  certain things across distances.  And at some point though, you know...  It's a cascading failure.  Maybe a cascading thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you get people getting moved.  That's what I guess.  I'm talking over my ass here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go to Google on Twitter, it's going nutty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is Google Plus, I get this,  which is all Google accounts are down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm seeing messages on Google across all languages.  Spanish, Russian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty much everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  German.  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder if this, wow.  Wow, Twitter is going down.  It's down in Japan, according to our chat room.  So I got Google Plus back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the images.  It's up and down.  Yeah, it's going around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Samantha tweets, says,  the world is ending, people, Google is down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Holy cow.  It is unsettling.  So which is more shocking, Google going down or Sandy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, they're equally, you know, traumatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all right to have a hurricane,  but if Google's down, I'm pissed.  Yeah, I mean, that's serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People don't die when Google's down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now we're plus-planing the election.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if others want to try,  you can go to downforeveryoneorjustme.com,  and it looks like mail.google.com is down for everyone.  Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think what you see when you see these  is intermittent outages up and down,  because Google has many more than one server or knock.  But maybe if North Carolina went down,  then the Oregon data center gets hit hard,  and then that one becomes intermittent.  Wow, that's just, that's really kind of shocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've never, no, but I've never,  they're so, they're architected in such a way.  This is a big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And developing story.  We'll continue to cover it.  And of course, my Google Drive does sync,  so I can open the Google Drive folder,  and I can, I believe, see whatever was most recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, if you have offline enabled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute, though.  It has to, it tries to open a Google spreadsheet.  See, this is where, so you double-click it.  Yes, I have the file, but I, but, thank you.  The iPad's still working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  So my pick is still up, I think.  I voted today, because you know,  in California, if you wanna mail your ballot,  today's the last day to mail it,  and be sure it gets there by election day.  And of course, I'm gonna be in Australia.  Actually, I'm gonna be on a plane during the election.  But I was desperately trying to figure out, how the hell?  We have 11 ballot measures in the state of California,  intentionally written to confuse the voter.  You know, yes is no, and no is yes.  They do this every election season.  And I was looking for a good place  to find kind of a summary of everything.  I found a great site, ballotpedia.org.  I'm not sure who does this,  but it's based, of course, on Wikimedia.  And it is a nonpartisan collection of information  for not just this election, but previous elections.  I went to the state of California,  and I was able to see, in my case, all the ballots,  but not just measures, but not just the ballot measures,  but how much had been spent before and against,  who spent money on it, who's in favor of it,  even summaries of the editorial positions  from a variety of California newspapers.  It was, it took, much of it comes from the ballot pamphlet,  which I already have, but then there's a lot more.  It's kind of combining that with things like,  who gave money, how much money, and so forth.  And I find that just a very quick and easy way  to figure out which way I wanna vote on a proposition.  Really nicely done, using the Wikipedia model  to provide information about election.  We have a very complicated election in California.  I imagine that's true in many other states as well.  And this is just really nicely done.  It's ballotpedia.org.  And I'm sure there are other sites.  Of course, Google's own election site,  when it comes back up, will be a great place to find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, Google, I think it's all back up.  Wow, that was Google's Halloween scare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you two's back.  Everything I'm trying is back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, same.  I'd love to know what happened.  This is the Sandy page that we were trying to get to  in the very beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There it is, yeah.  By the way, we didn't mention,  but Google has a fun Halloween animation,  at least in the US, on the front.  Do you guys celebrate Halloween in the UK?  Well, we kind of do.  We know about it.  It's a media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't do it as well as you.  You guys really know how to do Halloween.  We just kind of throw eggs at old people's houses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't have my audio again.  It's gone into that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But we do have the same graphic as you on Google.  There you go.  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just in metric.  Halloween's an international language.  Actually the imperial system.  Robert Stevens, it's so nice to meet you.  Thank you very much for making your way up here.  I'm sure it was not easy to do,  but we're glad you were here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got no traffic  because everybody's downtown for the Giants Parade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those Giants, they won something.  Some game happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can someone explain to me why it's called the World Series?  I'm very confused about this.  It's a small world.  Only if you could explain cricket to us.  Okay.  No.  I can't explain cricket  because I don't understand cricket.  Okay. See?  No British person really understands cricket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's probably true with baseball as well,  to be honest.  Anyway, we're glad you managed to get through the traffic  and really appreciate your being here.  We look forward to seeing what you start.  Let us know.  Either can I.  You're thinking though, along some lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like dating somebody for 18 years.  The last thing you should do  is jump right into another relationship.  You end up dating the same person that you just left.  You know what I mean?  Spend some time with your kids.  I might take a cruise in Australia pretty soon.  I'm thinking about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there's still some room left  if you'd like to come.  Insightcruises.com.  I don't think it's sold out, believe it or not.  It's gonna be fun.  We're gonna see the total eclipse of the sun.  We're gonna be at sea for that.  Super.  Google will be down for the entire trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't this December, the end of the Mayan?  Oh no, that's December 21st.  We've got plenty of time.  Plenty of time.  Living up.  Thank you.  Nice to finally see the brick house.  Great to have you.  Thank you for coming up here.  Be well, Jeff.  Hope you're doing well.  Thanks to Paul.  You too, Robert.  To Paul Boag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, thanks for coming on, Robert.  Yeah.  Paul Boag from boagsworld.com, right?  Boagworld.com, yep.  Boag, no S, world.com.  And there's a great podcast.  What is the podcast about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tell us about that.  It's a web design podcast, basically.  It's been going almost as long as you have.  You're one of the first, I remember, yeah.  Yeah, in the early days.  And we haven't learned to quit yet.  So it's an hour long of, well,  what was described recently on an iTunes review  as constant drivel.  So if you want constant drivel.  I could beat you for that.  And just a little bit of web design information,  then it's worth checking out.  The drivel is constant at boagworld.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Still drizzling in New York City.  Thank you to the, who is it, the Gerald E. Nair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gerald E. Nair Dodge Foundation.  Dodge Foundation.  Chris Daggett down the way.  Yesterday we were cutting down trees.  And today I'm here in power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're really glad.  Maybe cook yourself a hot dog while you're there.  Have a nice hot meal.  So you're going home?  Are you staying at home without the power?  I managed to get two nights in a hotel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  And so when I, you know, going back there  and then we don't know.  We're without anything.  And the power, not only the trees are down.  If you go to, if you can now go to Google+,  you can see the arbor side in my front yard.  Not only were trees down,  but thus the power lines are down all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  And that's really the unexpected consequence of this.  Cause we had a lot of rain.  Those roots, the root beds get softened up.  We didn't have that much rain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the wind was incredible.  We had a tree hit the back of our house.  Very little damage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But yeah, it's fun.  This is normal.  It's just that there's houses there now.  Yeah.  But in the old days, that was how they,  they called the herd.  Yeah.  Well, Jeff, take care.  We hope you'll be okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm delighted to have made it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

We'll look forward to seeing you at the,  I guess it's at the rocks.  Or it's at a pub near the rocks.  But details on Mactalk.com.au.  And then we're trying to figure out a Brisbane meetup.  But I don't know if I'm gonna have time to do that  because I'm gonna go see some koalas.  And I think I'm gonna be busy in Brisbane.  But we'll do our best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that the next Android version?  Koala?  Koala.
