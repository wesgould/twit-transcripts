I like their audio  And I want each I want HTC to come back to their glory days, you know  The HTC one was such a great phone. So really high hopes for it. And yesterday I got an order a notice from FedEx  An HTC package is coming. I was so excited. I thought I'm gonna do an unboxing. It's good. I didn't because this is all that came  It they're driven they're dribbling it out  This is the USB C to audio adapter that I'm gonna need because it doesn't have a headphone jack  Oh, this is that no, I rubs it in. Yes  Yeah, that does kind of rub it. They said this but they haven't set the phone yet  I don't know and there's no release date or anything for the phone. They're being very  KG about that, but they did send me a backpack with Android toys in it and stuff  So I don't you didn't bring that to show us. I have that I came a few weeks ago  I'll bring it in next week. Oh, I see. Okay. I  Couldn't figure out I think it was  It had a nice handwritten note. I  Think it was because they know who I am  I can't imagine that everybody who ordered maybe everybody who ordered this phone got a backpack and a water bottle and Android dolls  And I mean that that and a handwritten note from an HTC team member  Anyway, the one thing I really think this is this is good and this is HTC trying to convince people it's okay to buy us  They're doing a one-year free  Replacement for broken screens and water damage. They're including that in the price. I mean, it's one of those $750 phones, but  Yeah, I think that's a good idea  They've got it. They've got to win people over somehow  Anyway, I got the cable

I do now really do hey  I highly recommend the Warren Buffett documentary on HBO becoming Warren Buffett  It leads up to his 34 billion dollar gift to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ten years ago and it's really fascinating  It's I mean, I don't I wonder if I  Feel like there maybe there's like it's like a cover-up like maybe he's an alien or something  but  Cuz I mean, how do you get to be the richest man in the world by just being a normal nice guy from Omaha?  It doesn't seem possible  You know and he dry he has breakfast it starts with him getting breakfast every morning his wife  Looks at the stock market and if it's down she gives him two dollars and fifteen cents for a happy meal at McDonald's  He stops and he gets it. He gets the less expensive sandwich if it's up  She gives him 265 and he can get the more expensive  egg McMuffin and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  he could just see a McDonald's for breakfast every day is not a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can have McDonald's in your basement. He's I know he could have his own franchise  Just in the basement. I don't know. It's very odd  I I don't and it what seems to be from the dice well worth watching from the document  It's very well made from the documentary  It seems to be that he really didn't have any interest in the outside world except he knows how to make money  He keeps he keeps lauding the principle of compound interest  Like all he did was kept putting pennies in the savings account and it just grew to a hundred billion dollars like that  and  But he's very unassuming and he just says  You know, I just I you know, I'm not that interested in the money  So I'm gonna give it all away, but I I kind of like playing the game  And he was very you know, he's a sweet guy. He went to IHOP yesterday for the free pancakes. I swear to God

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There were free pancakes at IHOP. Oh, yeah and cake day

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dear lord, okay. I am talking about all this little  trivia because I just I  Don't see you go. I don't see anything. What should we talk about pick something? Oh, you're bored  I don't see Google's deep learning AI project diagnosis cancer. Yeah  That's kind of interesting. That is kind of we've been seeing more and more that you know, the AIs can  I don't know what this is. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That I'm sorry this autoplay video drives me nuts. All right, I'll make you happy. Have you seen the flying phone case camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The kickstarter project. Yeah, that's by the way do not put money into that. I know okay fine  I was trying to make you happy. There's in no way that's gonna be a real thing. I've spent enough time on  Kickstarter backing and crazy project. I know I know I have to this is the air selfie  Is this it?  Yeah, the bottom of the it's not it bottom of the rundown actually the air selfies old one  Yeah, the bottom of the rundown cell fly the smart flying phone case  Camera, so it's a case moments. You want to cherish from you? All right, I can't I can't I'm gonna turn down the volumes  I can't take this  So they're all having a happy-go-lucky life like all you Millennials do Stacy and your daughter's  at the baby grand piano and  So this has got to be phony  So you open up your case and it flies your camera around  No way much money to yeah. Yeah, no way by the way, they've raised almost a million dollars  No way this drone can lift your phone. I'll tell you that right now. No, it doesn't look your phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, no, it has its own camera. It has its own camera case you take it out of the out of the camera case  That's me carry around with you you have your drone  Oh the drone of the camera doesn't everybody need to have a drone with them at all times times

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, do you think this is real?  No, Carson says no  Let's see 99 bucks to get one. Oh  Expected retail 139. I would say my suggestion is wait. Wait, wait, because it's fun. Yeah  Let's see what the risks are grumpy enough. That didn't make him happy that well  Yeah, that didn't make me happy because I don't buy it. Let me see if I'm gonna go all the way to the bottom  that's where they hide the  risks and challenges  It's based on existing technology  We've already developed a few working prototypes which have been tested and perform. Well  Many drones have become quite popular. All right  Our drone is very stable. However, a $99 product obviously does not include stabilizing gimbal  Okay, obviously, yeah, all right  Oh, this is important that the video shows the target of the final product  Not an actual we do have working prototypes, but the prototype does not include  the full and final functionality  It's feasible. We can do it  We just haven't yet. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I maybe I'm being cynical. Am I being cynical?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, you're that is the voice of experience  I bought a floating bonsai tree and I've learned

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bless your heart so the deep learning I'm gonna go back to this and I'm gonna have the same stupid  Startup video. This is the International Business Times. So I would like to find a better source for this but  Diagnosis cancer they say faster than experts  They've been finding that with all kinds of yeah, we saw the skin cancer one and they were I was parity right now  This one the human being here. Let's go. Let's go to the Google white paper. The human being was able to do  Using gigapixel pathology images. So very very high resolution images  The the human pathologist got 73.2% accuracy the computer  So that's that's pretty good  And they use it I guess there's a standard test set that they use  So if if you if you read this the people should be worried are radiologists the people who read we already knew the radiologists were going

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Going away. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have friends who are radiologists and they've been they're among the most technologically savvy of doctors for instance  I remember years ago  They were using something called a photo phone which allowed them using a modem to connect to the hospital and downloads  X-ray so they could read them at home and then they got to the point now where they can do that all over the world  So many groups will have doctors all over the world in different time zones  So that they can respond their group can respond at any time  A lot of times your your radiologist is not in the hospital is at home or somewhere as in India or China or somewhere else  But it is just a matter of time isn't it where you get an AI doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and if you'd like a company called analytic which they do special they do AI specifically  I thought they did speech, but apparently they do medical imaging too  back in  2015 so about 18 months ago  They said they were able to diagnose cancers  They had a false negative rate of 7% or sorry the humans had a false negative rate of 7%  Analytics AI had none and then they had a false positive rate none Wow a false positive rate  Which is incorrectly diagnosing the cancer of 66% and the analytic AI had a false positive rate of 47%

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  False positives not good though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nevertheless, then you could have a second positive. Well, the false positive usually leads to a biopsy and I mean not that that's not fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we're gonna do on Monday. We're gonna do an iOS today  Segment on healthcare devices and I already got this one though a live core that you use Jeff for your EKG  And I got you got one. Yeah, and I got an EKG done. It was pretty amazing  It's really is it is it's really well done. Yeah, and then I also ordered a new blood pressure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Monitor called the cardiac that works a little that was terrible. It is at the queue one  Yeah, the cardio starts with a queue. Yeah  So I did the  Why but I should always ask you first  No, no, I did. I did a blood pressure cuff monitor

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Story for the wire cutter so I have the why things I can compare it to that and  so the heart  This one is different because you don't they have a bunch of other stuff too, but you don't have to it's not I mean  Does it inflate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so this one does  Inflate so I'm pointing at your screen here, which is silly. That's okay. That's what everybody else is doing. Look at Leo screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's so big  It doesn't fly. So it's it's just portable though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the challenge with that one and we didn't actually we tested it or I tested it. I don't know why I'm saying we  But it's real touchy about  Folding to turn it off. You have to fold it over the right way  In the right way is kind of complicated. Oh, so like it drains his battery  Yeah, so it was always at a battery whenever I was trying to test but is it accurate?  Those are actually so both why things and that one are less accurate than like the most accurate like the omron or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Omron 10. Yeah, that's what it was. And those are cheap. By the way, those are a lot cheaper than these  Yeah, well, yeah, and they they will pair to your phone and copy you date over there and just like that and all that stuff  too the omrons

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do you have to have both an omron account in an IOS account

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's somebody was complaining about the cardio as well that in order to send your data to your doctor  You have to send it to cardio first, which is yeah  But that's true of a live core too, isn't it Jeff that you have to kind of go through them and you can even buy they

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sell readings. They sell readings and all that. But yeah, what's what you have to get your first one approved

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not sure what the legal reason for that is. Yeah, and then and then you just just use it. You don't need to

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  To do anything. I've used it a couple times where I thought oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Patients would you send it to your doctor or no

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, just it says normal because oh it tells you it tells you and you can and I can I've been around this stuff long enough  I think you've seen it enough. I know I'm symptomatic

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know. I like this category  I mean, you know, we're in the two days, but I think the idea of having some diagnostics  You have a pretty powerful computer in your pocket

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, the other thing is so I don't know if I told you so when when Jake taught at ID Tech camp  Some some summers ago many summers ago. I went and talked to the class and there was one kid in there who had Tourette's  His his idea for an app was basically to capture  various signals because those signals could be  predictive of  an episode and  I would think for things like  Tourette's  Having seizures epilepsy  Also, my mother is diabetic and there's signals that that you know when I grew up with her  I'm sure she was diabetic because I was born by fault  But type one so she had insulin reactions and there were just many signals her her her  Claminess of her skin the way she moved the way she talked  You know, you know that there are gonna be for that kind of effort at diagnosis  Being able to get somebody medication to stop them, you know  It's like the dog you hear about the dogs that can that can tell when somebody's gonna go into an epileptic seizure  Because the dog is picking up on signals right that we're too stupid to see right  They actually use companion animals for that don't they? Yeah, so all those areas that to me is a fascinating area  I was scheduled to have a call with Vic and see what else they're working on

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But we had to cancel we should point out dr. Mom saying the doctors won't use a  Readout unless it's FDA approved the the live core is FDA. Yes, one of the few that is I don't know if the cardio is  Or not. I don't see  Anything saying it is the cardiac you be the cardiac thing the blood pressure. Yes. Oh, I said but but yeah  Yeah, the the the but yours thing is approved yours. He life core is yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you could send it to a doctor

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it's very small and easy. I'll leave it my briefcase  You know they make it so you can stick it on the back of your phone and have it all the time  But I don't want that I'm waiting for blood sugar

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Some sort of blood sugar sampling without pinpricks. That would be nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't they have those that you can implant? I mean they're implantable. Yeah, they're they're still under you. They're still I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't know. I've looked at those. I don't know if I want to do that  If I were type if I were type one maybe I would because then you really monitoring is so important. Oh, yes  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, yeah, so okay. Good. No little tests are I was gonna say a reminder for you when you're taking your blood sugar blood sugar  Blood pressure. Yeah  Make sure you do it correctly in terms of like chilling and having your both feet on the floor

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, stuff. Otherwise your readings. I know the only reason main reason I want to do that  Is because I because it always goes up when I'm in the doctor's office. So I just wanted to try it at home  So what did you find?  It's much better at home it is yeah, but I'm also I'm on medication so I  That helped, you know the listen April helps  Problem with doctors Leo you want to talk about this? Yeah, I have a problem with doctors. They always finding something wrong  Hate that. I hate that  Google and IBM say we want artificial intelligence to help you  Not replace you. Of course, that's what they would say  liars

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, wait wait before we hate on AI

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry, I gotta stop this. Thank you. I turn off autoplay. It still comes back before we hate on AI. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  AI can be really effective at a lot of things like what is effectively grunt work for people right or  Intuition based stuff. So as long as they stick to that stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I mean if you're a radiologist you'd be pretty upset right now, wouldn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and if I was like a hand calligrapher back when it's true  Press I'd be upset to look at Jeff. She got good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See I do that for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, I mean I'm not I I  Think there's a lot of opportunity that we will lose if we don't if we just look at it from a jobs loss perspective

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, and in fact, I've talked to a number of people who say  That it's not that clear John Markoff. We had a great interview with him two weeks ago the great  Kind of one of the best tech writers  New York Times for 20 years 25 30 years  And he was saying, you know, it's not all that clear what the job impact of artificial intelligence would be  You know, there's there's there's it's it's not it's not like intuitive your intuitive grasp of it is  Oh, well, those robots are just gonna take our jobs and we'll be sitting on the grass  He said that's probably you know, in many cases that they create jobs  anyway, so I think there's as John's really good about not kind of accepting the the the the you know  Accepted point of view and digging deeper. So I kind of trust you speaking of which  Here's an article from the Drive Jonathan Ramsey who says the way we talk about autonomous vehicles is a lie and  That's dangerous. He says no matter what you've been told and told and told again our self-driving future is a long and  uncharted ways off pretending otherwise  I have dire consequences  So  He says don't believe the clickbait  partly because the definition of self-driving car is  fuzzy and you know level one two three and four most of the time when  Journalists and the press are talking about self-driving cars are talking about Tesla style level one autonomy not  fully autonomous self-driving  vehicles  And so he yeah, I think a lot of times  He says there's currently no standard for the type of equipment used in semi-autonomous systems  Musk says he's not a big fan of LIDAR due to its complexity and expense  Although I I do feel like a lot of others are using LIDAR I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't is it Ford that's using lighter? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In many cases the you know, they're very the places that they're testing it or using self-driving cars are very constrained  That's true there is a new there is a new classification system replacing the levels of  0-4  Autonomy that just came out from the NHTSA  Taxonomy and definitions for terms related to driving automation systems for on-road motor vehicles now has six  Levels of autonomy level zero is intermittent warning systems like blind spot detection one  Monitor environment alter steering acceleration and braking like parking assist level two  systems that steer and change speed  And traffic jam assistance  The driver and all and all of those levels obviously zero one and two has to be there and monitor level three  Could take over all driving functions and total monitoring of the environment, but the driver is expected to be ready to take over  If the vehicle finds itself in a situation it can't handle or strays off course  The and then he talks about the number of disengagements that is humans taking over  the  Says although cars are improving none of the experts with whom we spoke believe level three autonomy is safe  And the issue has largely to do with people a self-driving car operating in an autonomous mode can create in drivers a false sense of security  Yep, and it's susceptibility to distraction  Making emergency  Disengagement more dangerous because the point at which the driver needs to retake we've talked about this before  Control is also the point at which he knows the least he's poorly equipped to do so. You know what the hell's going on  What you mean you need me to steer what's going on in the seconds? It takes you to figure out are of course  deadly and  That's I have to say and I'm sure this is true for you. You know Stacey. You don't have  Autopilot is that right? I?  Don't yeah, so if you did and certainly we do on our Model X I  Watch like a hawk. I use it all the time, but I'm always I'll use it tonight going to the airport  But I'm but my hands are on the wheel and I'm looking I stay engaged  I would not dream of looking down at my phone or something else for that precise reason  Yeah, I'll tell you what  It's great in commute traffic  Because I have some considerable amount of confidence in the cars ability to stop  If a car in front of me stops that I trust  So I pay attention to the steering, but I don't have to ride the accelerator which is really or the brake, which is really nice  So it's very helpful  So level four is the first phase it this is the article goes on  Which vehicle will never need driver input no matter the situation if a level four car gets in trouble  The car is programmed to get itself out of danger without human input by pulling itself off the road for instance  Currently there are no level four autonomous vehicles for sale  Although how automakers and headlines continue insinuate are outright declared. They'll be here in three years time, but 2020  He's skeptical and he's probably right right  And he talks about the you know famous failures of Mercedes and Tesla and Waymo and  Uber he says it's a media hype machine that's putting our lives in danger  That makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a little bit off it. Yeah, I mean other side clip. I know panic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't think we'll actually be there  Because we I think once people start using this we're gonna encounter the bumps in the road quite literally  and  Then we'll slow down  but I think it's important to galvanize the industry towards this kind of  Audacious goal because I think the technology is really close and to get people starting to talk about it and regulate and think about it  This way I think is a good way to get us to that goal or get us there eventually  Kind of like Kennedy, you know directing us to the moon. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with that on the other hand  I think is we all need to be careful and automakers especially of over promising  And giving people the impression they can take their hands off the wheel and start reading a book  Yeah, people do have that impression, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't people do I mean, yeah, look at all the people who don't put their Tesla and autopilot and watch movies

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that idea really? Well, that's what that isn't that still illegal. Yeah. Yeah  Yeah, but but and this is his point is that you know, if you watch the media coverage, you know  He talks about one  One report saying but what are we gonna do with all the new free time?  This is from inside edition about a grandmother behind the wheel of a self-driving Tesla  It was clear we were in good hands with the P90d, but with all the new free time autopilot afforded us  What were we going to do with it?  Pay attention and drive. How about that?  Novel idea and of course that makes sense people love the science fiction angle of the cars driving ourselves

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and a lot of people hate to drive  I mean, I know that there are people who love to drive but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Will say that it driving and stop-and-go traffic which used to be my worst nightmare has gotten a lot better  Thanks to autopilot. I do much prefer. I feel much better and stop-and-go traffic. I was always afraid I was gonna fall asleep and  Ram into somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Haven't followed asleep, but I have run into someone. Oh who hasn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway, I just you know, I agree that it's  This is link bait and some this is unfortunate to some degree as well  But it's probably a good cautionary story that you know, it's maybe it's not a big lie  But it's maybe not quite here yet either  Let's see kaggle  kaggle  That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a site that hosts data competitions. They've done lots of places Google buys kaggle. Oh  Yes, I think this is a good idea  Yeah, I  Thought this was a nice move giving them credibility with a community  Google has already been very open with the AI and the data analysis community about what it's doing  but  This basically is a way to show support for people who kind of value that bottle  I think about it maybe as an answer to the creation of open AI. Mm-hmm  Yeah, kind of tangentially, I mean it's not a direct answer it's not like callback or anything like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But well, you know Google next is going on right now in San Francisco  I was really hoping that we'd have a slew of stuff to talk about from next they're making all the IOT announcements tomorrow  Oh  poor Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sadness, I know and Kevin Kevin was there so well, he'll be there tomorrow. I hope  Presumably. Yeah, who knows where Kevin is you'll have stuff in the world is Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But apparently they're going to be some IOT announcements of this. This is what is next. It's not a public thing, right?  It's I thought it was their cloud. It's their cloud. It's their cloud conference. Yeah, so it's for cloud engineers cloud  Everything you need to know about Google Cloud next  There was a keynote we didn't cover it and  Maybe tomorrow we should cover the keynote because that's when was it Diane Green. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so she she said some lovely things written my friend Barb wrote it up  It was very  The headlines all are focused on what she said about Google being a great place for women to work

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's senior vice president Google Cloud Sundar Pichai spoke as well  Eric Schmidt Feifei Li Tariq's Shaqat Sarah Robinson  Where is Holtz? It's all the lovers. I know I like his name too. It's  And like favorite Feifei Li is good too, she's a chief scientist cloud AI and machine learning at Google Cloud  So but I anyway, I just saw on Twitter that there'll be more announcements tomorrow and then that that maybe there'll be some stuff to talk

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they'll have like an answer to Amazon's AWS Lambda if they don't already tell us what lambda is. Oh  I shouldn't have said that because now I'm gonna butcher this  I'm like, okay, it's um  Take it take it because whatever I think about lambda  I think about the future and my brain just kind of explodes a little bit and I'm like I should write this down before

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get excited kind of basically zero administration cloud computing. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's so much less complex  Good job. I was gonna go into microservices and functional programming

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're using you're using their cloud but you don't have to like, you know  Create a container set up a server any of that stuff. You just upload your code and then it just runs  I think lambda is what a lot of people use for echo, right? If you're doing an echo task you put it up on lambda  It is yeah and it could be so that's so that's I think probably its most common use is if you're using some other Amazon  Service you leave you put code up on it on lambda. That's triggered

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like by well, it's great for iot stuff, right because a lot of it's a  Trigger-based right and so it just goes and instead of running constantly which is expensive, right? You only pay for what you use  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's really great for again iot stuff or anything that's react well and for somebody like me who wants to do an echo skill  If I don't make it public it's cheap  Because I just pay for I don't have to run a server to do it  I just put it up on lambda and then I only pay for the microseconds that I use when it when it hears my trigger  So it's really great way to kind of prototype stuff for iot and it scales  So if you decide you want to make it a public thing, you know  You can you don't have to do anything it it'll scale  So that's lambda. How did that come up? I forgot. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I was saying I didn't think Google had anything that like that equivalent. Yeah. All right  And I think that's a very big kind of forthcoming  Model of using the cloud but I  would love it if anyone in the chat room knows if Google has an equivalent because I  Have missed that I think Azure has something  but

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was Google code. I was it similar. This is where we miss Gina. She knows. Yes. Google has quietly launched  Its answer to AWS lambda. This is a story from  a year ago, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Cloud Functions

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is a lightweight event-based asynchronous commute solution  Compute solution that allows you to create small single-purpose functions that respond to cloud events. Yeah, that's exactly what lambda  does  Mm-hmm. I don't know. It's an alpha or it was an alpha and then as your app services Harrison says is the same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, there you go. Oh, oh, it's still alpha function. Look at that. Geebus. What's that mean?  Alpha as opposed to pre-beta. So it's very early. You have to be yeah, it says  This feature might be changed in backwards incompatible ways and it's not recommended for production uses  It's not subject to any SLA or do you policy? So we can't promise you anything  So yeah, this is this is for playing only yeah  Alright, so I'm gonna still say they don't have it then because this does not feel like a real thing  I mean, it's a real thing. There's also something called iron

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that I oh  This is a third party open source serverless computing  similar idea  Anyway, I I'm not up on all this stuff, but I guess there's plenty of ways to do it  Google is kind of the laggard in that regard  Google assistant and Amazon's Alexa clashed at Mobile World Congress. I missed this  the battle I did too I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was like I thought it was more notable that uh  They both went down for a little bit and had some drama this week. Yeah, this is there is nothing to talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me take a break. You guys  A few things I've added some things to the rundown, please. Okay. I'm gonna go to you in a moment  We're gonna take a break and talk about it. I just don't have stuff. I feel desperate some days, you know  Some days you come in and there's just nothing to talk about. Yeah, you're right. We should just chat I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I can bring out your life? Okay. We'll talk about these things

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  we'll talk about Jeff's tacky cardia and

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Tacky tacky tacky. I remember a British friend of mine somebody when I had one of these episodes years ago  You have a dicky ticker a dicky ticker a dicky ticker I like it I say I'm a dicky ticker

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Thank legal zoom for their support and now 12 years in for the help they gave me  I had no nothing. I knew nothing then about business. Actually, I still know nothing about business  But you can fake it better now. I can fake it much better  I've surrounded myself with people who do but back when it was just me know who to call. Yeah, honey  Honey, now I just I just roll over and say hey, what's all this about gap?  did up to the up to the  even a bit of  And she says again  Again, you want to know?  Just read something that some huge percentage of Silicon Valley  Does some sort of non gap accounting like that's become?  So prevalent in Silicon Valley, let me see if I can find that story. I just saw it ran across it in I have  And and and by the way, the SEC is not happy from today. SEC wants to crack down on screwball accounting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I should  I maintain that  Too many ads the SEC should be looking at what happens with better data analytics and what that means for accounting and understanding  Like if you can predict material information based on machine learning  How does that change how you do your accounting because like think about things like predictive maintenance in industrial settings, right?  Yeah, suddenly you don't have to suddenly your depreciation schedules. For example become far more accurate and  You might be able to predict like you maybe you allocated a capital expenditures budget based on just those  Depreciation tables, right? But if you can actually know what's going to break in the next, you know  Quarter you can be a lot better at that like guessing that so I  think there's a lot of interesting kind of things to look forward to from a  From an accounting and actuarial perspective

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, of course the complaint the complaint of the SEC and of others is that  Companies are using this adjusted, you know, non generally accepted accounting practice earnings  Because it inflates the earnings it makes them look better because they're not including stock compensation  and and and you know, so I  guess if you're investing you ought to be sophisticated enough to know the difference and  and and consider the difference accordingly, but  Actually this SEC begins to crack down story was from a year ago did they no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stuff that's pretty cool. All right  Google can now recognize objects and videos using machine learning and this apparently happened today at their  Cloud event it was in is it Feifei Feifei Lies? Yeah  So it was in her speech and  Did I put the link in is this kind of like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, they can recognize tumors and tigers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is it looks like they could recognize doxins front and the fact that the video is watching as a commercial Oh which  So again, I don't think they're gonna make the API available to developers  But this is actually a really big deal because there's so much video content and you know  If you don't tag it properly, you really have no freaking clue  So think about all those billions of hours of YouTube and making that searchable. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Alright good one. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like it. I'm like does anyone else want to talk about that or say anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think you're gonna want to talk about this is weird  giga-ohm AI labs I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Couldn't miss this consulting. What are they now? So giga-ohm was sold for parts, right? Right who owns giga-ohm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this oh look at that. So yes a man named Byron Reese who is from  demand media and  He wrote a book. He's a futurist. He's a very nice man

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And it probably didn't pay a lot of the media wasn't so nice, but keep going the concept demand media. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the idea of whatever happened to that Jeff  We used to talk a lot about that with the idea a lot of time with them

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You should write articles that toward to the search results, you know exactly what happened to it Matt Matt constant Panda

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right on. Oh people still do it though. I mean like it was a big time is the Super Bowl on yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. Yeah, if you google that you find a lot of pages. That's yeah, they changed the name

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean is is it now leaf group? No. Oh, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the okay, so this is interesting. So this is basically Byron

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Byron is trying to figure out what to do with this amazing brand that he bought  and  I think he's he thought he would be a publisher and  He didn't really understand the economics or the the business of being a content like a real  Content company not like a demand size doesn't it?  So I think that and then he sold research and then that person who did the research business with him kind of left  And now they're doing conference businesses and now there's no he's offering AI services  Although props to anyone who talks about Claude Shannon who is just freaking yeah, it's in the open

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  1949 dr. Claude shannon of MIT built on a computer that could play chess  Sure, it could only handle six pieces of required 15 seconds to make a move, but it played chess  I think this is actually smart. I mean Byron's probably you know, right that there's gonna be demand for  Help with a you know, a lot of companies could probably benefit. This is big data, right? This is business intelligence  to the next level

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like it's a consulting agency for this sort of thing  and actually I think IBM was talking about doing something like this with Watson kind of  Back a couple years ago with kind of how to apply Watson to the legal profession because I  think there is in this this is a business idea if anyone wants to run with it, but  There are so many tools out there that right now use AI to make your life more efficient  And it's really hard to understand which ones might work for you and which don't and so I think a way to like  Show people how to build those tools or how to put those tools to use in their  real life would be really an  Interesting opportunity like on the publishing side. I can see a newsletter for you know  The six awesome tools I'm using this week to understand scheduling or to make my calendar more manageable. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not gonna do that though. So to get back to Feifei Li's cloud video intelligence API  It's a private beta, but eventually it will allow developers to query video content  using words  To describe objects in the video like did you see a tiger in that video?  You know, this has always been a problem with video and podcast audio as well. It's not searchable  So something that would help you search through video and say I can be with the words fairly easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But the images weren't now you can do that. You have Google search has become so popular right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Amazon did something similar last year called a recognition with a K  Boy, it's just a race between these companies. I think that's good though  The kind of competition you're seeing means faster development for this this kind of stuff  Until it breaks until it breaks us  So the humans say I don't get it IBM says we're we're gonna be able to build quantum computers  So I saw that that was so exciting. So you better you better get developing  What really  The company set up a new division IBM Q that is intended to make quantum computers and sell them  And sell them  Commercially IBM says we're close enough to start work on getting software ready. How close is that?  well, they didn't really say but  Most researchers agree that quantum computers, which are still theoretical are years away from actually being made  That's a scary thing because these computers are a  Lot faster fast enough so there's been some concern about public key crypto and its robustness in the face of  quantum dumb question. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Especially what does that do to Watson's law?  To Watson's Watson's law, I mean the no one Moore's law Watson Moore's law Watson  Yeah, no, it's one attempt to get to get past Moore's law. Yeah. Yeah, which was we thought Moore's law was gonna die  It they've passed it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a different parallel track so it leapfrogs Moore's law. Yeah in terms of the impact on

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Society oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right now the way like quantum computing right now is it's unreliable the computing itself happens in these massive

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Energy consuming boxes that have to be super cold. That's why it doesn't really reply to Moore's law because Moore's law was  That the number of transistors in a processor would double every 18 months number of transistors in a processor were double  There are no transistors in quantum computer. No, that's what I'm saying  So yeah, they're qubits so the computational capability that's interesting that's what's what's the relative computational

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know if you if you look at things like

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Encryption what does this do to that? Well, everybody's very concerned that quantum computing is the kind of thing that could  Rapidly cause problems in public-key crypto. Yeah, so it's definitely a lot faster. I don't know how much faster  I don't know if it's in I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a different type of programming right not with zeros and ones. It's not right. It's multi-multi. It's multi

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's cubits multi cubits. It's cubits

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we're all like we'll say that word like we know what it means

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So is there are one of the languages around quantum computing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't have them

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What's it's they're telling you to get development like damn it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's so that's what they want to see  So you have to do quantum based algorithms so that function in the so I don't think you're developing languages yet  You're really at a smaller

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Q cl is one of the first implemented quantum of broken languages  There you go that allow the expression of quantum algorithms using high-level constructs  Not so much a tool for programmers  But to provide tools for researchers to understand better how quantum computation works and how to reason formally with about quantum algorithms  Hmm. Thank you, Wikipedia  There are two kinds  and functional quantum programming languages

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I I'm all for functional quantum. Yeah, that's me  This way past mine my skill set here, I don't I mean I'm reading Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google purchased a quantum computer from D wave  googling  Is a competing quantum computer company that has been doing this for like like 15 or 20 years it is ridiculously long  And D wave and IBM have this whole like quantum computing argument in like research papers like where they college it's  big drama  Oh NASA and Google are working  But I think Lockheed Martin then has bought their own computer  quantum computer too, so  And I think it was a 50 qubit computer. So this is Wow  An effort to be commercial and like D waves how many cubits

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What should reference but should not channel Cosby these days certainly national women's day

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The story one of the stories I saw it was the paper in nature on IBM's effort  This was saying I think five cubits a machine that has five cubits is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hold on the equivalent of I don't feel like they're equivalent in that, you know, I don't know  I mean the the fundamental question would be you know, okay if we were gonna calculate this  How much faster would it do it than a traditional?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Turing machine. I think it also is that it it's faster, but it also can calculate different types of problems. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. I've actually poo-pooed this for a long time  I I'm I don't know about I don't know what this story means is are they have they are can they make them in quantity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. Do you need to make them in quantity? That's the other thing cuz some people make one for the NSA and the rest  Well, it is kind of like does this mean the I don't think it really means the end of computers  Like kind of like was it Bill Gates in his statement about all you're gonna need is some kind of hard drive. I don't remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's here's what IBM says classical computers are extraordinarily powerful will continue to advance and underpin everything we do in business and  Society but there are many problems that will never be penetrated by a classical computer  To create knowledge from much greater depths of complexity. We need a quantum computer  We envision IBM Q systems working in concert with our portfolio of classical high performance systems to address problems that are currently unsolvable  But hold tremendous untapped value, I guess with big data big giant data sets  There's all sorts of stuff that the traditional computer just can't things like climate change simulations to come Monte Carlo, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Maybe we move from an age. I think this is this is true of journalism  I think it's another show before we're in journalism or reductive. We reduce everything to an 800 word article  We can take any complexity and bring it down  but the truth of the world was highly complex and now you have systems to be able to  Map and analyze and present that complexity and we have no idea we're gonna do with that. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Agree that was a show. Right? Yeah, I agree  I got a story. I got a story. That's right up Stacey's alley  We're gonna talk about nest when we come back just a little bit. Yeah, yeah, cuz some big nest news  But first a word from rocket mortgage by quick and loans when it comes time to buy or refi your home  You're gonna want a mortgage lender that you trust a quality mortgage lender  I would submit the quick and loans is the best just look at all their their tops and customer satisfaction year after year after year after year  And they're one of the biggest lenders in the country, I think $92 billion in loans last year, but  More than that they they understand and love the geek because they've created a mortgage approval process processes entirely online  You what you don't have to go to a bank you don't have to collect papers you don't have to go through the boxes of  Documents you just do it all on your phone on your tablet. It's a transparent online process  That gives you all the information you need that's what the internet is all about  You can adjust the rate and length of your loan in real time  You could submit the paperwork they need like pay stubs and bank statements online  And because it's all online. It's fast. You get to turn around in minutes for a loan  That's exactly right for your financial situation  You got to check it out. Skip the bank skip the waiting go completely online quick and loans  Dot-com slash twig for rocket mortgage quick at loans dot-com slash twig  Equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access org number 30 30 quick and loans  Dot-com slash twig and we thank them for their support of this week in cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  How you seen pulse what's possible?  twitch released a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Competitor Twitter. Yeah. Yeah, they're doing but I think it's for twitch people aliens on twitch. Okay. Yeah  So it's yeah, I saw that I don't know if we wouldn't use it  We don't even use the Twitter chat be we put we point people to our own chat  but  Understand who uses twitch and how it's mostly uses, you know, I'm playing a game showing you video of the game  I've got a chat room. I'm talking to you  I'd like to keep my engagement going offline when I'm not playing a game. Is that what it's for? Okay. Thank you  Got it  This is by the way, they're brilliant. I know they're they're they're they're doing a really  I think  Not get out of the park and they're owned by  Amazon right those on yeah  Amazing Justin Khan who sold twitch we created Justin  TV remember way back when oh  He was crazy  On all the time and then that became just in TV and then he did social cam  Which is a streaming app kind of a periscope before periscope and then he started twitch which is gaming sold that to Amazon  He's actually just launched his own startup incubator program called zero zero F guy can't be more than 28  Zero F is zero to funding and he was a partner Y Combinator  So he's decided to go the Y Combinator roof route  He said I joined YC to recover from the brain damage of starting companies  But I want to get back more towards what I like doing which is starting companies  He has three companies already in his portfolio whale  Which is a Q&A video app the online pharmacy scripts dash and  One he hasn't yet named that will revolutionize the way law firms work  Interesting three new two or three new businesses a year, so it's not a big. It's not a big startup school  That's cool  Now on to nest yes, sorry. Yes. I caused it. I find this fascinating  I find it  What sorry no you go mark?  German who is the king of Apple leaks is now apparently expanded his portfolio to cover  IOT as well  He's got some rumors. He says that they're looking at a cheaper nest model under $200  That would also allow you to adjust  It's  Temperature we're on a room-by-room basis kind of like what is the one that does that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, okay, so you could be right that ecobee has a light which is cheaper  It doesn't have the external sensor at the expense of ecobee has an external sensor

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could put a  Sensor in your bedroom and have the thermostat in the hall  Which is our problem because our thermostats in the hall it measures the hall temperature  Which is a lot cooler than our bedrooms or bedroom overheats. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't think nest fixes. I don't I don't know reading this article. It's unclear if  the  remote sensors are for  The cheaper thermostats or if they're just remote sensors, okay  No, I just I was kind of like I don't know if that's the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they're also looking at a home security alarm system a  Digital doorbell to compete with ring and an updated indoor security camera  Nestea has been so slow to release new stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they they were apparently I mean well there was a lot of infighting there  There was a lot of drama happening there. Honestly these these feel like super derivative. They feel like  Tony Fidel would not stand for this because  God there's  Do I really need another home security smart hub? I don't I really don't and is the industry clamoring for this? I  Don't think they are. I really like I look at this and I'm like, where is the Amazon Echo?  Where's the surprise make my  Maybe I'm just just being a so here's a question. I should I should point out by the way the information

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Said this exact same thing exactly one year ago on March 24th of last year for nest products still under wraps and  Yes, they're still under wraps  So nest is having them. They this was Bluetooth tags wireless security sensors wireless hub and a voice recognition system  So you're right Stacey, they're having a lot of trouble getting stuff out the door

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, all right. I mean barker man's right and everybody and Jessica lessons, right?  Yeah, so I I'm not keen on this they did also do to fit they launched two-factor authentication on your I like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We talked with Mark Rogers on Monday. He's a hackers is security  Operations guy for Def Con which must be the most interesting job in the world  He also is a security guy like the security guy at CloudFlare. He said of all the IOT devices  He was most impressed with it that nest. He said those guys are doing it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They are I mean, and there's there's a lot of stuff  They don't talk about because they don't want to but I could I have talked to them in depth on their security stuff  and I can tell you that  They they treat it right in the sense that they are always  Security is an ongoing issue  They don't feel like it's ever done right and they've got a lot of things in place on the back end that make me feel really good  about having their stuff in my house

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let me ask you this

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was thinking because there's another story in the rundown about how Amazon is looking at building a new echo device that can act  Like an intercom and other things it's not let me think that we're going to end up with  Us every room in the house is going to have a set of sensors and input and output  And so is that become a  Does somebody try to own all of that that your your your echo is going to have temperature sensors in it, too  and and and other output mechanisms or is it going to be  Ten different things. How are we going to build houses in the future around that notion of input and output for every room?  So I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wanted us to do this in I and many other people  Wanted to do this along the principles of the house  Um wanted to do this along the principles of kind of the open web, right?  Like you create hardware standards for these input outputs and sensors and kind of data standards  so you could pick your platform of choice where you  Ran that data too to me. That makes the most sense from a consumer and even from a business perspective  If you're not one of the big platform players, what's actually happening is everybody wants to own  the physical hardware and the data and mostly the data that it's  Generating and they want to build services on top of that  what's  kind of worth looking at is how many people can actually figure out how to monetize that because  Consumers right now don't see a really compelling use case to pay for you know sensors in an  every room and  You know input output on their wall, right?  One of one of the reasons why is you know, it's it's new and we need to figure this out  So amazon's done a good job at like convincing people with like the echo that it can be worth it  But over the long term, I really think if it doesn't follow the standards of the open web  we're never going to get there because  All of these things should belong to your house. They shouldn't belong to  You as an individual because we we move right and so  There's a fundamental  Kind of disconnect between how we're trying to monetize it and thinking about it today and how we probably should be  That's just me  I spend a lot of time thinking about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel like echo is in the best position to do all this in fact doesn't surprise me that they want to do  It or comes and all that because uh people who buy echoes tend to buy more of them all the time  And they provide a voice and they've been smart about being open so they can provide a voice interface to a whole bunch of other stuff  Like your harmony hub stacey or your nest or your automatic in your car  I think I think it's amazing what amazon has done from in two years  from zero to sixty because uh, you know they they  I guess because people fell in love with their echoes bought more echoes more echo skills were created. What are there 10 000 now?  It's amazing. And so  I think we have a de facto winner and it works quite well  I love the idea of an intercom because I do have echoes in every room

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you might have to buy a new one, oh I wouldn't like that that's not good  I'll give you a sneak peek my podcast this week is  You know, I think the episode's titled something like should I wait to buy a new amazon echo because interesting  Couldn't do it with the current one  Well, that's that's not what the rumor said and I so I was chasing down this rumor for  A story so I was kind of sad that that recode got it to it first damn that  Darn you and your good journalism and reporting  so my understanding from the reporting that I was doing is that this will be  This will require some new  There will be a new device that will have new hardware in it. What's unclear is  If that hardware is required for  All of those features are just some of them. I'm just thinking about this if the the uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Intercom  Totally could be done in software you could say echo speak to the bedroom  boom  Hey lisa, um  Is my watch in there boom now there would be a delay it wouldn't be  A real time back and forth. I don't think it could do that  But I think it would then a second later play in the bedroom  Hey lisa, is my watch in there and she could go echo respond?  No, it's not  Boom, and then I would hear it back. It wouldn't be like a conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's like the airport thing where they were they yeah, it's a paging system

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But but I think it would be real time enough that it would be more than adequate what you really want  Boom echo tell the kids dinner's ready get down here now. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, we can get a little a little smarter, right?  So google home is looking at multiple people if if echo if there were a mechanism to  Define who is in what room you don't have to say the bedroom and just say ask lisa

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's a little trickier that would a little trickier  But again, because it wouldn't know where lisa is how would it know where lisa is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so one of the leaked images was an echo with the camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, you know what? Oh, that is a non-starter. No, that ain't gonna happen. I'm already hearing so much paranoia from people about echo  Uh this new vault seven which we haven't talked about these new vault seven revelations  people are  Terrified and the and normal people it's really sunk into them  That there's all like my samsung tv can listen to me. It's got a camera  Amazon's got to be very judicious. I think about how they roll out features like cameras. That's scary

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is this is a this is a photo of a leak and this is all rumors

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is not anything I have heard. Yeah, and they may have prototyped it without  I mean we see this a lot in apple world. You'll see prototypes of things that they may or may not release  I I love the intercom thing. That would be awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the intercom. I love the ability to make phone calls. I would also say um  You know and here's what's cool is if the echo could actually talk to from a cloud to cloud with the sensors in my house  That I would authenticate  Then it could find the people in your room like they could do geo location you already you already get a sort of  Cobbled together version of that with like the euro because the euro skill on the echo where you ask where connected devices and it'll tell you  Which euro hub it's connected to?  So you can ask the echo  To ask the euro where your phone is and it'll tell you your phone's connected to  The hub in the router in this room, whatever you've named it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's try this  Hey echo post the twit mission statement on the wall in the hall outside the studio  Look it worked  Why are they using a blowtorch to put that up there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's your new offices. That's that's scary. Wow  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is the mission statement? Uh, I can't read it from here. Let me see you. You don't have it  You don't know your mission statement  I wrote it but I don't remember twit is dedicated to building a highly engaged community of tech enthusiasts  By offering the knowledge they need to understand and use technology today  Is that okay?  And blather about whatever they did. Well, please well, sometimes we don't have any knowledge to offer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This happens

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think in aggregate if you listen to a lot of twitch shows, uh, you kind of that's the goal is to uh,  How long how old is that mission statement? Oh, it's pretty old. I think I uh, it's evolved slightly mostly in terms of cutting out extra clauses

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know mission statements. Yeah clauses. I'm not i'm not a fan of writing them. They're they're paying to write

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but so I really wanted to boil it down to the most important things which you got developing a community  We're aimed at tech enthusiasts and the way we serve them is giving them information to understand and use technology today  And we heat that up  Yeah, I guess uh, I don't know. Maybe those are I don't know. That's weird, isn't it?  Yeah  I can see in a in a in a month. They're gonna just kind of curl up and peel off  after the apocalypse i'll come in here  in my uh  My worn out shoes and torn t-shirt and i'll see that curling off the wall and say those are the days  I remember  So do you want to talk about vault seven  Yeah, I want to hear what you have to say about this ian thompson, uh did the work so we didn't have to he actually  went through all 8 000 documents  8761 caa documents published yesterday  on wiki leaks  wiki leaks again, uh  While it's you know, there's it's hard to tell the provenance of these  It seems highly unlikely that wiki leaks could have generated this much content spuriously speciously  So it's probably real or something like it  They were they were good enough not to include the exploits the actual code just the descriptions thereof  Most of this like the snowden revelations is several years old  Some of it was misreported initially for instance  You might have seen that the cia can break signal whatsapp and telegram encrypted messaging not so  um  As ian points out what it actually says is that the cia if they can compromise  The device the computer the phone that's using signal or whatsapp or telegram  They can get it before it's encrypted that does not say that they can decrypt it in transit. That's fairly important  um  So one of the things of course is that your samsung tv  One particular model could be used to listen to you. They've got the  The code to hack it and turn on a full-time speaker and microphone, which is funny because there was a big brouhaha  Samsung in its terms of service last year  You know, let slip in there. Oh and third parties could possibly be monitoring you  Scaring everybody and we we said oh, that's just boilerplate. That's not possible. Well  So edward snowden tweeted yesterday still working through the publication  But what wiki leaks has here is genuinely a big deal looks authentic  I guess edward would probably be a pretty good expert on that  with regards to  particular operating systems  cia has a modest collection of attack tools for systems powered by microsoft's windows  Keystroke loggers sandbox escape ropes antivirus avoidance mechanisms  cia analysts found flaws in control panel  The ability to add data streams to ntfs without detection so you could put data onto storage drives  Dll files a popular attack vector  There's a program called ricky bobby  Which is will ferrell's character in the movie taladagan nights  It uses windows powershell and several dotnet dll's to put a listening post on a target pc  You know all of this you kind of expect they have the one big takeaway was how much more?  uh humor in the code names the cia's stuff had  then  Then the nsa stuff like names like swamp monkey eggs mayhem ricky bobby weeping  Weeping angels. Yeah, weeping angel. We like that one. That's of course a doctor who wrote it  Doctor who reference I didn't know that but I was  informed  Lots of pages of hacking tools for os 10  Including at the time it was the most recent version os 10 of capitan of course  This is this is an old dump. So presumably they've updated those there's a project called harpy eagle  That analyzes the apple's airport extreme firmware for private keys and then cracks it also time capsule systems  there's a  Project called quark matter  That puts persistent spyware on an os 10 system using an efi driver stored on the system efi system partition  In other words something that wouldn't be wiped by formatting the drive  snowy owl  Uses open ssh to pull off remote monitoring. I mean it goes on  And on and on this is a very rich set of stuff now android  Lots of exploits chronos creatin  Uh star me snubble  Bowtie sucker punch and roid rage  SMS stealing chrome based attacks for android  There's a huge number of exploits escalation of privileges allowing malicious apps  barren samdi, which is a voodoo  Named doug trio and salazar allow for remote access  They're fixed or mitigated by later versions of android  But remember a lot of people have older versions of android and of course, this list is three years old  Uh, the cia stash contains this is all for me and thompson on the register.co.uk the cia stash  Contains rundowns on most of the popular antivirus systems and how to defeat them  Much of the information has been redacted, but there are a few snippets left  So they they're that's interesting that they're working

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  To defeat antivirus software because it's a pathemic right? Yeah virus. Yeah. Yeah, what about chrome? What the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry, go ahead smart tv. I haven't got to chrome yet. Uh smart tvs  We mentioned weeping angel which takes a samsung tv and turns it into a fake off mode  Which makes it look like it's powered down, but it's still on and can be used as a bugging device  That's really handy actually  But the tv has to be compromised by a usb stick inserted into the device

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that one wasn't as stressful. Yeah, although, you know if they're gonna come into your hotel room or whatever to put a bug in there  I've been watching the americans. They could stick the usb

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly  Uh, how how easy is that? You know, you don't have to drill holes or anything  Apparently they're looking actively at the internet of things now three years ago iot was not such a big story, but it is now right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like it's almost exactly in the same place to be totally honest. Yeah  three years of iot excitement and  Basically, the most advanced devices I have are my nest and my echo. Yeah, so you're living brigadoon

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One analyst included his favorite ascii characters for conversing online with japanese people along with games  He likes to play in some music suggestions  I guess they had a kind of a jaunty way about them as cia operatives  So ian will get ian on soon because he's been a poor guy  He said a really rough night because he's been reading all 8 000 pages looking for the exploits

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, this is where machine learning could totally help. Yeah  You run the sucker through i'm i'm not I mean like a way to be better at your job is to you know  Yeah, really write a program that would be this way. You should probably learn how to well you you saw that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  article about  journalists upset with uh  You must have put that one in right? No, I didn't no no it was already there my benefit. Let me find it here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, we could we get upset so easily

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You journalists stop the press's journos not happy losing jobs to journo bots say journos  Once again, they register with its great sense of humor

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did they use the word boffin because it's not a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They gotta use boffin  Um, do you have been paying any attention to this problem of fake news on the google home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Have you tried it jeff you probably have yeah, yeah, I mean, you know, so yeah, it's the worst problem  so google knew that the  Auto-complete was a problem, but they see that as a feature and they got rid of it  Doesn't try to tell you what the truth is or anything. So if you ask your google home is obama planning a coup

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It will say well, yes according to western center for journalism  I mean that's fake news, right? Yeah, have they figured out a way to get an issue there?  Have they figured out a way to get it out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Um, they should bring back matt cuts. The fact that matt cuts is gone is doom for them doom

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Matt we need you

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I've been saying i've been saying everywhere that we need a matt. We need a matt cuts for fake news. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean you have to ask it that that leading question is obama planning a coup

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  so I I don't want to reveal much but but I had a discussion authoritative discussion with some some  top engineers at a certain technology company and  and  it was a fascinating discussion because  Part of what they try to do is to anticipate the user's desires, right?  Now what that means is if they anticipate that that user  Is a sweaty paranoid, uh guy in an ill-fitting t-shirt in a bunker somewhere  Then they will do one thing and my response was well, no imagine if the same question were asked by a third grader  Try this now try this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, ask us say, okay, oh are women evil?  Oh, jesus really don't ask that international women's day. It's gotta go my permanent record. It's gotta go my permanent record

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm so sure  It's journalistic research  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are women evil talking to fetch my calendar oh shut up. I hate these no, okay  Sorry, do you want to give my calendar a try? Okay. No  All right, you might like fetch my calendar  F you google  You want to talk about my calendar? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, she's pissed

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  She is she's giving me the silent treatment it's women's day, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if what if you know google home has been I don't want to fetch my freaking calendar. No  It's been glitchy  This this may be an issue it has been really glitchy for people have been seen it did a story on it and  Actually, it happened to me for like two days. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Are women evil?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh fixed it. They fixed it. Yeah, so so, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  features like that  Our fixable one can be fixed  The holy grail of either google or facebook is the ranking and they need  Rule sets to decree that ranking so the interesting to me was when it gets to to what you see  You know if you ask is the holocaust real versus holocaust deniers versus holocaust  What results should you get?  In each case now if you want to find holocaust deniers  You should be able to search for them so you can do research about how awful and horrible and evil and miserable they are  But if you ask for the holocaust and you ask for is the holocaust real?  To my mind  You should be true to the knowledge

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, danny solomon in his article for search engine land  uh  Shows in the past in 2015 if you asked google what happened to the dinosaurs  It would say dinosaurs are used more than almost anything to indoctrinate children and adults  In the idea of millions of years of earth history. Here's what he here's what he got when he asked  This was a couple of days ago are women evil

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, are women evil?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's a summary from shedding of the ego every woman has some degree of prostitute in her

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Every woman has a little evil in her. Oh lord. She said that now  That's the snippet that came up and that's is that based on what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What is that based on? Why would it pull that up? Why would it pull that? Why would it give that authority?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so we had a story on the rundown. So it was about caramelizing onions. I'm not i'm not real sure why but it was uh  Uh  But it's the same issue there is it google?  ai or I assume it's an ai that's pulling these snippets  Pulled, you know the wrong information  It pulled basically a quote in the article  About caramelizing onion takes five minutes and the whole point of the article was to refute the idea that it takes 25 minutes or five minutes  so  It sounds like

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it misunderstanding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it's  Again training a model for ai is really hard and you need lots of hardcore examples and the mistakes will make it better  um, so google fixed it  but  We don't actually know what part of the model is telling it what's important

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, let's also acknowledge that  We're complaining because a  Machine learning system doesn't fully understand this long prose article and misinterprets it  The fact that you can ask an inanimate object how to caramelize onions and it gives you anything back. It's kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Incredible. Okay, but we're relying on it. Well, we should

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  According to slate blend in the salt and sugar raise heat to moderately high and let the onions brown  Stirring frequently until they are a dark walnut color 25 to 30 minutes. I love that 10 minutes  25 to 30 minutes equals 35 to 40 minutes. So they fixed it read more look for the link in your google home app

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I I love it that you can ask for recipes, but I you know, it doesn't turn off your brain

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it says well, but if you don't know how to caramelize onions, that's actually a really good use case because okay  It's not like it's not like holocaust  Real

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, I don't understand. Yeah, okay. Is the holocaust real?  My apologies, I don't understand. Okay, what's their block is climate change real?  According to wikipedia global climate change and global warming are real and observable  It is highly likely that those human activities that have increased the concentration wrong again  Have been largely responsible for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This left wing what it does do that's really well wait what it what it does do that's good is it says according to  Yeah, so it gives us a sense of the source which is and it tries to give you the link in your

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, it didn't do that. It said I could get the link from my home app. Oh  It like oh my home app not my not my ai. Okay, right. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Uh, what else did I find? I found some other things

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's interesting that their their solution to  Cutting the bad snippets out is just I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, exactly  That's actually it's like a five-year-old

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't know what you're talking about. Well, if you if you go so the famous case in the guardian was was autocomplete for jews are right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But we've seen this for years  People yeah, but I mean you've got I mean you'd have to hand cultivate how many millions of results. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When it changes all the time doesn't it yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, i've argued that what we part of what we need to do and this is part of the fake news  The big one thing I want to see is it doing a better job of mapping manipulation?  And that the platform should be better at understanding manipulation not just in advertising and spam but also in in facts and news and then  Acting differently upon that  So if you take if you just took the the data set of wikipedia  Are articles that have to shut down because they're too controversial that means someone somewhere is creating  probably fake  Controversy around this and so so they have to be careful how their algorithm how they're sensing rather looks at  The data coming in because there's going to be some fake heat somewhere and they're going to give you bad results  And they'll learn how to do this eventually. It's what they're going to need some needs more effort

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I mean, so that's actually something that people are pretty good at  um  Or maybe actually we're terrible at it. I don't know. Um, that's hard for computers to do. Let me put it that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love I love the caramelized onion story because it's actually written by a guy who was pissed  because he  Kept seeing recipes that said five to ten minutes at caramelized onions and it always took him  Half an hour to 45 minutes and he thought he he was doing something wrong or his bad cook  So he wrote a big article on slate and got the new york times and others to fix their  Incorrect recipes and then he says and but nevertheless google still gets it wrong. They fixed that since too  It's funny do not try to caramelize onion in five minutes and you know and do not listen to google, but apparently they've they fixed it  It's pretty funny  Is it's I mean the only reason that article exists because this guy it's like personal a personal umbrage umbrage took umbrage  Which by the way is the same thing as shade

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay, go ahead. Yes  Did you know about steve martin's comedy course? I did I tweeted it you did. Okay. I was hoping that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is the story with this company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's a it's a san francisco company that got venture capital  To use to do celebrity courses sounds a little bit like trump u but I think actually no

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they're real courses and they're not expensive. I thought if i'm gonna learn comedy from steve martin  It's gonna cost me a lot of money or acting from kevin spacey or singing from christina algarara, but it's or tennis from  Aaron sorkin teaching screenwriting gordon ramsey teaching i'll skip that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  This about a potential another potential

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pause on here. We didn't mention the gray ball tool, which is apparently a tool uber's been using to prevent investigative  authorities from taking uber rides  If you hail a ride  From uber and you're on the gray ball list. It's kind of like a black ball list  They'll avoid you and the idea is that the regulatory, uh  Code enforcement inspectors people like that try to hail ubers  To see if they're, you know doing everything right and it just they'll just ignore you. They'll just shine you on  That's not illegal  But it just shows kind of more of the kind of sketchiness of the whole uber thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know why people are surprised. I mean like I know I this is this is a case where i'm kind of like  Like  It's like people are surprised that trump has done some of the like he's going to build a wall actually  Like the people who are like, well, we didn't think he was serious  I'm like really? I mean we we knew that uber was not staffed by people who I mean we know  They're jerks for using a nice word. So the mayor of portland kyle mclaughlin said

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm very concerned that uber may have purposely worked to thwart the city's job to protect the public

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It did. Yeah, I mean that's exactly what it did

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's not illegal  um, but nevertheless it shows that you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They why this is just really interesting. Yeah, sometimes you don't follow the letter of the law, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Follow the spirit, but this is disobedience. I think they should get an award for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was gonna say should they get the prongs?  Some people would argue that uber does better society. I would argue to the opposite

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lift is looking for new funding saying here's our opportunity. We're gonna we got an opening here  They're talking with investors.

Transcript:  Okay  Either way, I kind of like seeing these little small local ubers better than some giant billion dollar unicorn multinational

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no because I was in the line for a cab at the airport  Because I got home at a weird time or something  I don't remember and the woman behind me was just like I can't believe they don't have uber here  They don't even have lip called and like  She was genuinely frustrated  And you know, you you don't know the local right quote unquote local uber local uber  So I I told her a couple and she was like, oh, thank you.

Transcript:  So, uh microsoft is putting arm-based servers in its data center

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. Oh, yeah, we talked a lot about that earlier on windows weekly. No, not on this show  That's a big story but that we've  Microsoft's announced that they're going to do windows on arm and now the fact that they're doing arm-based servers is interesting  and I think we concluded that while there may be economic reasons because of course there  Lots lower power about a tenth the power of a silicon of a silicon from intel  But a half is fast, but that still gives you you know, 500 improvement in uh in  well and in some apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like if you're running like  For in a cloud setting when you're splitting up a server you're virtualizing a server and splitting it up into multiple instances  It doesn't matter, right? Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean and then the other uh point of course is it's also political strategic because they don't want to be beholden to intel

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. You can make intel drop its prices finally  The other thing so  Another benefit of that is because arm licenses its core technology. You can actually design chips that are  Specific to especially for microsoft. Yeah, that's what apple does apple apple's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A nine chips a ten chips the chips in its iphones are arm  Based but they are tuned for apple's needs for instance because they don't do flash  They were able to apparently simplify the chip design considerably because they didn't have to support  flash

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. So that's that's actually really interesting because it could lead to  Greater efficiency or better performance for certain things on certain platforms

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is an interesting experiment by ryan broderick at buzzfeed  He made a facebook profile completely empty  No friends  In fact when he started he had no news. There was nothing in his news feed. He added a profile picture  Some personal information that was true  um  But unrevealing about his politics, but unrevealing about his politics  And then he wanted to see how facebook's recommendation algorithms work if you have no friends  So what kind of content would it suggest?  if  It had to go on what I liked rather than who I liked  Facebook said this is an experiment. It's a stunt  Well, they have a point it's not how you use facebook, right? So he started liking first the republican national committee  Didn't didn't change anything in his feed  But most facebook pages have a liked by this page so he went down there and he liked chief of staff rights prebus  and then he got some more and he  Liked hillary and he liked barack and the democratic party in other I guess he was trying to balance it  Just to see what would happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Creating a farron's balanced profile farron balanced profile

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then he said I liked every page presented to me by facebook's suggested pages widget  Which gave me my first illuminati and new world order sightings. Oh, that's interesting. So it's a bit a bit  Meta it's getting it's getting more and more out there, right?  It also threw in new york magazine. I don't know why  But the effect was almost immediately noticeable  He got a very even though he was liking, uh left wing  Uh sites too  He started getting a lot of interesting  uh  memes from the right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then he generated maybe those they're advertising more and promoting more on facebook is my guess. That's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess that's part of the question, right?  um is  Then his right wing soft core pornography memes  He was getting uh, it's what's interesting is how this all  Works and then he got banned because he was liking too many pages  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't matt honan do this with like he liked everything. Yeah, he liked it, but that really screwed him up

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think don't we're matt. He's like a living living entity. He's like bad. I love matt journalism. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So but the point I guess is it's so hard to figure out what facebook's doing  And even even doing these things. It's kind of hard to figure out  Why did what it did right?  It doesn't seem it's not obvious. No, it's not well, that's that's what algorithms are you guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's the black box argument, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I would know I would think that you could put something in and see what came out and make some deductions about how the  Black box works. That's how you would do it, right?  But he's putting stuff in and it's not  He's after three days started seeing white power memes was asked to join a vladimir putin fan club  He's starting to get stuff from the daily stormer  Um  Anyway, it's worth reading trying to understand  What is facebook up to?  Is now of course, this is his news feed today and it's just it's just crazy  But you know, I look at my news feed. It's the exact opposite, right? It's all left-wing politics  By the way, all politics all the time pretty much  In my facebook feed now  Uh, I suppose it'll calm down a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I have a story for you yes dear this explains dear  My friend

Transcript:  Instead of the htcu ultra my pick of the week is this cable?  I really I thought I was gonna have the I was so excited. I was gonna show the phone. I was gonna do an unboxing  Nothing now. I'll have to stick with the pixel. I still like the pixel. It's a beautiful thing  I will mention that if you're using a google pixel  That you should probably get the free lightroom mobile  for it  lightroom is uh  Adobe's photo editing application and lightroom mobile on  Only a few phones and pixels one of the few android phones does is will shoot not only  Uh raw but now they've added hdr  So you can and that's one of the reasons it can only do it on this phone  Because it takes three images very very rapidly. Let's see if I can find a situation with some dark and some light  And it you can't see it, but it took three images very very quickly right there to do high dynamic range  It's free if you have an adobe account, it's even better because you can you know have your lightroom photos go from your desktop  to here  This is this is nice. I think it's a really it really turns the pixel camera into something even better  So if you have a pixel or an iphone late model iphone to six six s or seven  Adobe lightroom great great choice the interview's box office  Was 11.3 million dollars the budget was 44 million dollars  So I hope they made it up in the rentals  Yep  Ladies and gentlemen, we are what?
