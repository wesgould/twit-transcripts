Plus Jeff Jarvis on the plus buzz machine dot com on the blog.  But the good news, the really good news is coming up.  Yeah, it was kind of a bad news, good news day.  Daily show, we're losing.  What's his name, John?  But that guy, yeah, that guy, I forgotten his name already.  Do you remember the name of the guy who preceded him on the Daily Show?  Kilbourne.  Craig Kilbourne.  Yeah.  Right.  But we are what we lost on the Daily Show, we gain for one brief shining moment.  Gina Trepani is here.  Hello.  How's things going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Things are good.  Things are good.  I miss you guys.  We miss you terribly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How are things at ThinkUp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good, good.  Things are good.  We got some press this week, Fast Company included us in their top 10 most innovative  companies in social media.  So that was nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just been hacking through the night, shipping a lot of code.  And things are going well.  But I do miss you guys a lot.  And in fact, I've been far away from Google News.  It's been fun going through the rundown.  A lot going on, it seems like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there always is.  Why do you still have to write code?  Isn't ThinkUp done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, our current issue is that Amazon Payments decided to sunset the payments product  that we use and that Kickstarter use.  So at some point, I think it's June 1st, we stopped being able to collect payments from  our subscribers, which affects our business slightly.  But Kickstarter moved over to Stripe and we've been evaluating different options and we're  actually moving to Amazon's new product, which they pitched us on.  So I've been sort of deep in the thick of writing billing code, which is the worst kind  of code to write.  You know, like I so much more enjoy product development.  Thanks, Amazon.  Yeah, thanks, Amazon.  Well, you know, it's one of those risks.  I know we've talked about this on the show before about kind of depending on a particular  API or a particular product that's not your own, right?  But it was interesting to me that Kickstarter moved over to Stripe because even  Kickstarter doesn't want to store credit cards.  You know, even a company as big as Kickstarter, you know, they've been hacked in the past.  They do not want to be responsible for storing credit cards.  So, yeah, so that's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.  And some good insights.  Look at this one. Eight days without a picture.  I haven't posted a photo on my Twitter.  Actually, this is Facebook and my Facebook stream in eight days.  So it would be a good idea to find something to share.  I had one more tweet this week than last week.  13 tweets. I'm pretty consistent anyway.  You can see what your most popular tweet was.  You know, it's really fun as going back four years, my most popular tweet was when I was  in Argentina about to go to Antarctica.  You know, it's really sad is that I've unfortunately post some of my images on Pick Please, which  has since gone out of business.  Yeah.  So this is a picture of us, of Wozniak and others finding out we don't get to go to Antarctica.  It was a great picture.  Gone forever.  That's a bummer.  So that's really frustrating when stuff was, but that I guess is the way of the web.  We just kind of assume that everything, you know, where we're starting our pictures is  going to go on forever.  Fortunately, now I store all my images on Google+.  I figure Google will be around, but also on Microsoft's OneDrive and Dropbox.  I figure of the three, somebody's going to stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to stick around.  It's going to stick somewhere.  One of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of them.  The first out of my tweets said, I mean mine.  That's, that's good.  That's improvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's only a third.  Man, I came in somewhere close to 70 this last time.  I was like, oh, that's harsh.  I need to, I need to back away from myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Biggest time for tweeting, biggest response.  Three and four PM.  That makes sense.  That's, that's good.  So late afternoon tweets are good for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh crap.  I like the, oh, what's better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I said the word great more than any other word on Twitter this week.  Last week.  Help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Help.  Help.  Very positive.  I like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody, somebody once told me, I think it was a 12 step program that there are only two  prayers.  Help me, help me, help me.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Great.  It's close.  Well, thank you everybody for coming back and doing it.  Guess what?  This is the 10th anniversary of Google Maps.  It was February 8th, 2004, the launch of Google Maps.  And it's fun to look, but this is what it looked like when it launched in the, in the  original early days of the web looked so crappy.  Those we didn't know though, did we?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So crazy.  That just doesn't feel like it was that long ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at the underlined links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at that.  Yeah.  Look at those blue links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then they turned to purple when you click on them, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That, yeah.  And that's like browser default now, right?  That's like no zero CSS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what it would look like if they had no styling.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Google Maps, it's so funny at the time when they launched it, it was very much  like Google search where I was just kind of like MapQuest.  It works.  Right.  What do we need another tool for?  What do we need another search tool for?  What do we need another web based email product for?  Right.  But it was one of those things that Google just knocked out of the park.  And you know, fun fact, Google Maps was started by the brother team, Lars Musins, right?  Who went on to do Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then went on to Facebook, right?  Yeah.  Lars is like CTO or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He is.  Yeah.  He's got a big, he's got an important title at Facebook now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But wow, man, Google Maps and Google Maps was one of the first applications to usher  in sort of the super dynamic JavaScript based, you know, web apps.  Right and that was before Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There he is.  Lars Musins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's at Facebook now.  I don't know what his title is.  Ten years ago.  Boy, that's a fast ten years.  By the way, interestingly enough, our 10th anniversary for this week in tech is in April.  Wow.  I want to get, and anybody has, if you're a designer and you watch the shows and you'd  like to help us out, go to our website, twit.tv.  Look at the logo.  I'd love to modify that in some way so it says, you know, ten years or something.  Yeah, like that.  In fact, if you want, just email leo at leoville.com and I'll send you the Adobe Illustrator versions  of them and you can play with it.  Because I'd love to, I don't know, around a size.  You know, I was thinking one of those curly banners with little birds carrying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or maybe just like a party hat on top of the bug.  Ten years of Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ten years.  Don't do that.  Don't do that.  Ten years.  He's already planning our 10th anniversary Twitter, which will be in April this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  That's incredible, Leo.  That's incredible longevity.  For a podcast network, yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I think for any kind of web based company, but yeah, for any kind of startup,  a web based company, I think it's huge.  Now, I remember when Gawker turned 10, I was talking to Nick about it and he was like,  God, I feel just old.  You know, you see these little companies getting snapped up within a year and I just feel like,  you know, we're this old company kind of plodding along, even though Gawker is not that at all.  But I actually really respect and aspire to be one of the companies that sticks around  for 10 years.  Gosh, I hope to think that makes it to 10 years.  That would be amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How old is ThinkUp now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, we, well, we've been, we've had a couple of different forms.  And if you go from the day we established the LLC, that was like July of 2013, I want  to say.  Okay.  So yeah, so it'll be two years in July.  But yeah, we're an open source product before that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you write, you wrote ThinkUp yourself first, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was called Twitalytic.  It was like a weekend project.  I bought the O'Reilly Hacking the Twitter API book and spent like a weekend and literally  it still has like, it had bits of sample code from that book for like years in it.  Yeah.  And, you know, it underwent a few different forms.  It was named a couple of different things.  It was called Think Tank at one point.  It was a nonprofit.  It was funded by, we had a MacArthur grant, but yeah, but we founded the LLC in July of  So I've got another, another eight years to go before I reach your milestone.  Leo, it's a lot to be proud of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm very proud of it and the team we have.  And I'm trying to think if anybody's been with me.  Well, Frederique has since almost the beginning and Tony Wang has since almost the beginning.  So there are a few people who are still here.  It's fun to watch.  Look at the Christmas card and watch it grow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I love the Christmas card.  The Christmas card's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So what did you think, Gina?  Actually, this is timely of the announcement that Google was going to start once again  re-indexing tweets.  They got the fire hose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They got the fire hose.  I actually hadn't heard that.  Man, it's, I need to come back on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're missing all the big stories.  So I'm actually of mixed opinion.  I'm sure Jeff is as well because we, we both would like some of the tweets about us to  be buried forever.  But I don't know what the deal was.  I don't think we still know what the deal was between Twitter and Google.  They used to have the fire hose.  Remember, they used to search tweets.  Then all of a sudden they stopped.  Google Plus started around then.  Right.  But now apparently there's been a deal sometime in the first half of the year after more than  two years not doing this, Google's going to start once again putting tweets into search  results.  Bloomberg reports that they, that Twitter gave them access to the fire hose.  We don't know what the deal was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The presumption is that Google paid for the fire hose.  The Twitter, what did you generally say, Twitter?  I know, don't you hate that?  Twitter got more...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a mayonnaise commercial because the stupid web page I was looking at, start auto  runs a mayonnaise commercial.  Stop it.  It's killing the page too.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's your objection?  You feel like you want tweets to go away?  Yes!  I mean the Library of Congress gets the Twitter archive, right?  I mean at some point...  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't care about that.  Here's my objection.  Nobody looks at it.  Yeah.  Here's my objection.  That somebody will search my name and not only finding all the good stuff that I do  in my blog and stories about me in Wikipedia, they'll find tweets about me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I hear you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hear you.  I don't want some of those to surface because people...  I get a lot of nasty tweets.  Yeah, I'm sure you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you also, you have some nasty websites too, right?  I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's not a big deal because nobody links to those.  So those don't show up in search.  I see.  So how is Google going to rank these tweets?  Because it's not going to be using PageRank.  Well, I think it's more of a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw some come in and it was more sample...  It was a sample.  It was a couple of tweets in a search result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But how do they choose them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems like they should rank them.  I don't know.  If they have access to the fire hose and they're getting the API results, they're getting  number of retweets, number of favorites, number of followers by the author who posted them,  whether or not the author is following the person.  So presumably Google is going to use those signals to rank those tweets.  If a tweet gets a couple hundred favorites, I imagine that that would rank higher.  That would be fine with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got no problem about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  But do we know?  How do we know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this isn't any different than Twitter's search itself, right?  It just exposes...  Yeah, but I don't care about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I think if you're going to Twitter and searching for tweets about me, that's  fine.  But it's a little different if you go to Google and you search for my name.  I feel like that the stuff that's on Twitter is so ephemeral anyway, this is giving it  more weight perhaps than it deserves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's sort of the eternal debate about whether or not to log IRC conversations, for  example.  People go into a chat room and I think a lot of people use Twitter like a chat.  It's this idea that these are just ephemeral short messages that you type off the cuff.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, well, it's funny to think of community had this big debate.  Do we log the IRC channel?  Some people really didn't like the idea that it was logged.  Look, I'm just dropping in for some quick help.  I don't want this to be on the web forever.  But others argued like, hey, there might be conversations that happened here that might  be helpful to someone else in the future.  And it's all about...  I mean, what we're talking about here is just the expectations, right?  Leo, you don't expect that tweets are going to show up on Google because they don't, they're  so fast and they happen so quickly and they're more like chat.  But that's changing now.  As far as I'm concerned, if they're in the Library of Congress, then their tweets are  out there.  They're permanent, whether or not we want them to be.  So I kind of feel like...  So here's my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the debate we have a lot of time, I say that Google can't own content, can't pay for  content.  So if you're a German publisher, do you look at this deal and say, oh, you paid for tweets.  Why don't you pay for us?  Or is this different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question.  Because it's definitely in Twitter's interest.  Not only would they get the revenue, but in a way this...  I mean, that's what this Bloomberg post says.  It draws more people to Twitter, right?  And it helps grow Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  So in a sense, it should be without revenue, but Twitter does charge...  It charges for its firehose.  It allows Google to buy it.  But I just...  I see some oil on that slope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, it's funny because Twitter's former chief operating officer, Ali Rogani, according  to Bloomberg, was against renewing the Google agreement.  He wanted to keep more control over Twitter's content.  Anyway, this is an interesting story.  By the way, notice the new Bloomberg business.  It's nice.  Yeah.  Look at this.  As I scroll, look at the top, there's a little...  You're almost done.  You're almost done.  I'm showing how far I am into the article.  Is that weird?  I like that.  I just noticed that.  That is bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's too similar to the progress bar of whether or not a page is loaded.  So I was like, oh, is this page not loaded?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't do that.  And besides, what is the message?  What does it say?  Is this information I want?  Like how far down?  I've got a scroll bar.  I've got a scroll bar.  It tells me where I am on the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems like it's this vertical...  Yeah, horizontal scroll bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's different from the scroll bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The scroll bar might include comments and other stuff.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The scroll bar includes ads.  And this does not.  Well, maybe it does.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it does actually.  It stops right...  Oh, you know what it's also trying to do?  It's the infinite page.  So it's trying to...  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ...to find you to go to the next page.  Oh, now it's reset.  I'm in a new page.  Exactly.  Oh, that's even weirder.  I don't know why we got into this.  Because my mind's on web redesigns.  You're on web design.  Have you solved their problem, Liam?  Yeah.  We've got it all figured out.  Yay!  Yeah, I feel really good about it.  We're working hard to make...  I think it's going to be a beautiful new website.  And the challenge is we're doing some stuff that people just haven't done much in the  past.  Things like an API, a public API for our content.  That's a big chunk to chew off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The old canary in the coal mine.  It's brave.  It's brave.  But it's good.  Oh, I feel good about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know that some of our audience, some of you watching and listening right now, if we  had a public API that you could say, hey, give me all the shows that talked about lollipop  in the last five days.  And you could generate an RSS feed of your very own and maybe even give it to friends.  That would be something I think people are very interested in.  And that's the kind of thing we can do with the API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Guardian has a public API of its content and it sets conditions for its use that are  interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We all have rate limiting.  I'm learning so much about stuff.  That's what's fun for me.  But you go through an API provider that there's a documented API.  The API provider authenticates users of the API.  So you'd have to create a code and get an API key, as you've seen, whenever you...  And then there's some rate limiting and we can figure out how that works.  We don't want somebody sucking all our bandwidth with their custom program.  It's interesting.  It's really cool.  So there's so much stuff.  The web is moving so fast that it's hard to even imagine putting a place in the sand and  saying what we're going to do.  The tide comes in and now you've got to get a new place.  It's very interesting.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Once you become an API provider, you start to realize why other API providers have limits  in place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  We'll see.  I may live to regret it, but we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm fascinated with the sites that have started without homepages and now without sites.  Vox and...  Not Vox.  Yeah, Vox and Quartz and Marshall Project started without homepages.  And now you have Contently with no site, really.  And now this news has gotten rid of its site entirely.  It just lives on the internet wherever it lives.  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what you're saying is there's no front page, but there are pages of content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no.  Not for NowThis News.  Let me see how this works.  How do you get to NowThis News then?  It comes to you.  It comes to you.  It has a page.  Like and follow NowThis News everywhere.  So you get it on Twitter, on Facebook, on YouTube, on wherever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just made this change last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I can't follow them on the web, but I can get their apps or I could go to Tumblr.  So it's the service without the site.  This is something, we've been talking about this on Twitter because Nick Bilton wrote  an article in the New York Times about Snapchat and he said he's become a real advocate of  Snapchat.  This is the Snapchat homepage.  And by the way, this is also nothing because you need the app.  But these are all brands that are posting stuff on Snapchat, including Yahoo News.  Katie Courx doing a newscast on Snapchat.  Maybe that's where Brian Williams could go.  Hey Brian, the good news is 24 hours later, no matter what you say, no one knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  I feel bad because I like Brian.  I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel bad for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what do you think, Jeff?  You're the journalism professor.  Wait a minute.  Let's take a break before you say anything.  Let's do an ad.  I'm actually really curious.  It's kind of not, look, anything's in our purview, right?  This show, we can do anything we want.  So let's talk about it because that's an interesting question.  Was the punishment too harsh, too lenient?  I mean, what did he do?  Let's talk about that when we come back.  And of course, lots of Google stuff, including the return of the change log for one day only.  A one day engagement.  I like it.  And Google has announced that it's not just a search engine anymore.  And Udi Manber has moved on.  And we'll tell you why that's important.  There's a lot to talk about actually.  Google I.O. coming to town.  Our show today brought to you by LD Products, ink and toner, my friends.  It's all about the ink and toner.  Look, can you imagine how many ink and toner cartridges are in landfills?  What they are doing to our environment.  Wouldn't you rather buy ink and toner cartridges that are from recycled cartridges that are  as good as new, but save the environment a little bit, keeps oil and plastic and waste  out of the landfills?  You want to find out about LD Products, LDProducts.com.  Of course, you can go to LD Products and get a great price on the original OEM cartridges  and toner.  But you might want to try.  Let's try their own quality alternative.  Some as much as 75% less than the OEM product.  And all their products are risk free with a two year, I don't know, I guess you could  buy a head, a two year 100% customer satisfaction guarantee.  You can return a product for any reason.  And then what's really, really, really cool is their call center, their warehouse and  their headquarters are in a giant 110,000 square foot platinum LEED certified building  in Long Beach.  LEED is an environmental building certification and a platinum LEED means this building is  green all the way.  I love it that they did this.  LEED certification comes from the US Green Building Council and platinum is as good as  you can get.  So if you're ready to get ink for your toner or your inkjet, you got to go to LD Products.  Somebody sent me the funniest, let me see if I can find this, Valentine's Day ink.  I don't know if I'll be able to find this meme.  It was really, maybe it was on Twitter.  It was very funny.  The cost of ink is more than, you know, solid, molten gold, molten gold.  Anyway, this is the place to go to save a huge amount.  In fact, not only are you going to save, we're going to get you an additional 10% off ink  and toner and free shipping, excluding OEM products.  When you go to LDProducts.com slash twit, LDProducts.com slash twit, use the offer code  TWIT.  We started to use this.  This is a toner cartridge for our HP.  Remanufactured means just less waste.  It's better for the environment.  And you're getting a great product that is totally guaranteed.  LDProducts.com slash twit.  I wish I could find this.  It was the funniest little cartoon.  Oh well.  It's a problem when people tweet you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If only you could search for it on Google, Alio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you're right.  You know, if only there were a way.  Oh well.  So what did Brian Williams do, first of all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As I think David Carr at the New York Times said, he gilded the lilies so much he turned  it into a different flower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, by the way, here's the image.  I did find it.  This Valentine's Day surprise her with a cartridge of magenta.  Nothing says I love you like printer ink.  Gasoline, $2 a gallon.  Coffee, $15 a gallon.  Extra virgin olive oil, $150 a gallon.  Nail polish, it's pretty pricey, $1,500 a gallon.  Johnny Walker, 21 year old, black label whiskey, $4,200 a gallon.  Chanel number five, perfume, $6,060 a gallon.  It all pales compared to printer ink.  $16,218 per gallon.  Printing check.  So give her a cartridge of magenta.  Except if you get it at LD products.  Don't tell you got it at LD products because it's a lot less.  All right.  So he gilded the lily to the point where there was no lily to be found.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And of course he misremembered.  There was a great Twitter memes, right?  There's a picture of Brian Williams on the moon under the hashtag of Brian Williams misremembers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like though that that was the kind of misremembrary that could have been accidental  or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It could have.  The problem was how the story changed and how it amplified over time.  And then I think that both Brian Williams...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brian Williams who's been the anchor, he started as the anchor of MSNBC's Nightly Newscast  and I worked with him at the site at that time.  In fact, I was on the show a few times and he was part of our launch of the site and  my virtual reality character did not interact with him.  And I really liked Brian a lot.  I thought he was funny.  We've seen him many times on Letterman and Fallon and he's just...  He's wry, he's funny, he seems smart.  And most importantly for a news anchor, he seems like he has integrity.  He started working...  He started anchoring NBC's Nightly News.  What is it?  15 years ago?  10 years ago?  It's been a while.  I feel like it's more than 10 years ago.  And is currently the highest rated news anchor in the United States.  Our generation's Walter Cronkite, if you will, makes $10 million a year just to sign a new  five-year contract.  Well, not this year.  He's not going to.  Well, that's right.  But that's leading up.  So that's the kind of who Brian Williams is.  And disclaimer, I don't know him.  I didn't hang out with him, but I've worked with him and I always thought he was great.  So he was talking about two things, right?  One was his experiences in Iraq.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I thought he was shot down by an RPG and helicopter.  Turns out not so much the case.  Some debate is whether or not he was behind that helicopter.  Some said it was a sandstorm.  But in any case, it definitely wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And in 2006 when he said this, by the way, I'm told that the pilot who was flying the  helicopter ahead of him that was shot down by an RPG wrote to NBC News and complained  and said, no, no, he was in the one half an hour behind me.  He was quoted as saying, I looked down the tube of an RPG as it as it took us out of  the sky.  OK, that's one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He kept bringing it up and bringing it up and it got bigger and bigger and worse and  worse.  And then he thanked the guy who saved his life when he got shot down by the RPG and  that pilot's just kind of had it.  And then there's some debate about I think it's still debate about his coverage of Katrina.  Did he see a body float by?  Did he get dysentery?  They said there was no dysentery when he drank some water or did he just have too much, you  know, too many banniers?  He did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, he said that I thought he said that he saw a body float by in the in the French  Quarter.  Well, there was some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but then there was some flooding in the French Quarter.  Was it enough for a body to float by?  There's a picture of him standing there with, you know, the water barely went up his soles  of his shoe.  Right.  So the point at the end, a couple of things.  One is from now on, when Brian Williams, if he goes out and covers a big story, what's  going to happen?  We're all going to question everything he says.  He's suspect.  And and how is that going to affect his reporting to?  I think he and NBC both waited too long, weren't transparent enough, didn't really dig into  the story.  My friend, Jamie Rosen, says that if he was really the managing editor of NBC News, he  should have dug into his own story.  He should have been interviewed by people, you know, he came up with a statement and  then kind of they all hid.  And so, of course, he was suspended for six months without pay.  Thus, he'll only make five million dollars this year.  And Lester Holt is is in his place.  Now, the problem I have with this, I wrote a post on media about this morning.  Problem is that they're treading water for six months.  Number one.  Number two.  I think it's an insult to Lester Holt, who I think is very good, though I happen to know  that they don't think he has enough personality.  But maybe good right now.  But you could have an African-American soul anchor on a nightly news show and they're  not doing that.  He's just there as a placeholder, which I think is insulting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we should explain that during the investigation, Williams recused himself from the nightly  news and Lester Holt, who was the weekend anchor, filled in.  NBC did an internal investigation, which apparently was entirely done by people who know and love  Brian Williams.  The decision was to suspend him for six months without pay.  Five million dollars.  But the implication is he'll come back as the anchor of NBC nightly news in six months.  I don't believe that's going to happen.  I said when I heard this and I heard that he had suspended himself, I said, that's it.  You're never going to see him on nightly news again.  I still believe that's the case.  Yeah, I think that's the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I happened to be sitting in Starbucks and ended up in a conversation with a crisis PR  person.  And I asked her, what would you advise NBC for Brian Williams?  And she said, take him off, lie low, have him come back and do a couple of really big  interviews in a few months and then test the waters.  For all I know, she advised him of this.  But I don't think that works.  So my argument today is that NBC has already been kicked in the kidneys.  They have the opportunity to really reinvent TV news now.  And I fear they're not going to.  They could make the news and all kinds of things.  You know, start with the punch line that was all over Twitter yesterday.  Comedian Brian Williams and newsman Jon Stewart trade places.  Turn it into get rid of the commodity news that we all know and like vice do stories  we haven't seen and wow us with your narrative and your journalism.  Turn it into a town square for America and have civilized smart debates.  Explain really difficult stories for us.  Get rid of the show entirely.  Go digital first and and serve everybody on digital and on mobile.  But use the show as a byproduct and a promotional vehicle.  There's all kinds of options for how they could remake TV news.  TV news badly needs to be remade.  You've been saying that for some time.  Yeah, we've done events at CUNY on this and I'm going to do some more events on this.  So I think there's actually an opportunity for NBC here.  But what's NBC doing?  Instead, they're in a self-imposed limbo like a Star Trek episode trapped in the glass  of the screen, not changing for six months.  And that's you know, what is that going to do to the reputation that they have?  What is that going to do to the show?  What does that do to Lester Holt's reputation?  What does it do to Brian Williams reputation?  I think that's that's the worst that could happen.  And they've got to do something bold now.  And the question is Comcast owns half the world.  Google owns the other half.  Is there anybody with any guts in Comcast to say, you know what?  Yeah, we make money on it.  But the audience is dying.  The audience is over 60 years old.  We're fighting for the exact same audience with ABC and CBS.  Let's do something new.  Let's turn this into an opportunity.  So that was my very helpful suggestion to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is certainly not related to the Brian Williams incident, but it is an opportunity.  It is.  And rethink what Nightly News is and something that's probably long overdue,  although obviously still makes them a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they wouldn't they wouldn't do it as number one.  You know, don't rock the boat.  Don't mess with. I happen.  You know, now they have to because they've got to figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have to.  I attend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They bought themselves six months, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but that's what I'm saying.  I don't know that they really did.  I think that  everybody is going to see it as, you know, just just as I say, treading water on hold.  Nothing new there.  They're not going to do anything bold in those six months.  I think they've got to be bolder, faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree. I just I think that they're probably in panic mode right now  when you're in panic and frozen in fear.  That's not the time that you're sort of emboldened to make a,  you know, to kind of upend, you know, the whole thing.  But they bought themselves a little bit of time.  I mean, I agree.  And six months from now, I would be very surprised if he came back on the air  and everything was was just the same.  They're probably going to make some changes, right?  But they had to buy themselves some time.  Is there any precedent for this, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it seems like this has never happened before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there was Dan Rather on 60 Minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, Dan stood up for Brian, which I thought was nice.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina, let me let me just push back on that for a second, because I think  yes, I think you're right.  I think they're in panic mode.  But when they're number one and making money,  that's when they are least likely to disrupt themselves and do anything.  That's true. There's there's a moment where you say, oh, WTF.  We've got nothing to lose here.  Yeah, we suck.  And they're not in that mode yet, but somebody in Comcast could be  somebody there could say, you know, well, let's send in something new here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you're right. You're right.  I mean, I think it probably depends on how much money they make and how,  you know, whether how well they think they can spin this and recover from it,  you know, back into the status quo.  Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in full disclosure, I attended a couple of NBC news executive off sites.  I didn't get paid for it. God damn them.  But I found it interesting.  That was, you know, it's off the record, so I'm not going to reveal it  particularly, but the impression that I took away, you know, I'm talking about,  oh, it's like my book, you know, the new relationships for news, new forms,  new business model, this to that.  They're in a different business.  The entire business all, you know, is Brian, Brian, Brian, Brian, Brian.  It's a star business entirely.  They don't think that we watched the news. They think we watched Brian.  And and so that became a single point of failure, as we like to say,  in tech world for the entire business.  He he tripped and the entire thing trips.  And so there's a there's a there's a fundamental business problem here,  business model problem here.  And that's what they've got to realize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of antiquated, though,  on the other hand, to put that burden of veracity on a person  when we have news sources,  many, many, many news sources making crap up every minute  and or exaggerating or.  And of course, you have a fall guy, but isn't this I mean,  we're in a new era and the notion that there is a  news source of record anymore  is kind of meaningless, isn't it?  I mean, the days when Walter Cronkite could say  we've lost the war and that would be it.  Nixon said, oh, crap, or Johnson said, oh, crap, we've lost the war.  Those days are long gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina, what was the last time you watched evening news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I used to visit my grandfather in law

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and he would watch it would be right after Lawrence Welk and right before Jeopardy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was 93 and we watched 60 minutes together.  But like as like, you know, that was a thing that we did together.  I mean, maybe five years ago before he passed, I don't watch nightly.  My mom, when she cooks, I mean, everyone that I know that watches nightly news,  you know, is is well over 65, 70.  I know that's just not a thing.  I mean, you know, when I was a kid growing up, that was my mom had the five  o'clock news on kind of while she was making dinner.  That's not part of my life at all.  But to go back to the to the news of record and this idea of like this one person,  I mean, right now, the thing that's I mean, what compels people  and compels an audience is a personality and stories. Right.  So like we love Brian Williams because he's a trusted person and he's a personality.  And he's he's he was telling a story and obviously trying to make it more compelling.  This this whole thing reminded me a little bit of the Mike Daisy  thing that happened when he was telling the story about Apple.  And of course, he's not Brian Williams.  But I remember just being so just absolutely outraged that this guy could have,  you know, stretch the truth so far that it no longer resembled anything  that was actually true.  But I think that he that Daisy is a storyteller at heart  and embellishment is part of storytelling.  And it's about, you know, creating this narrative and creating this emotional  pitch for an audience and bringing them along.  And I know I'm a writer. I do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's no material that what he lied about or made up  or exaggerated is probably the right word.  Didn't have any material impact on the news itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It didn't. And I'm sure in a lot of ways, Brian felt like he looked down  the barrel of an RPG, even though, you know, right.  Because, I mean, he was like, wow, I was half an hour behind or following  a helicopter that got shot out. That could have been me. Right.  Like I've made these connections in my mind.  I mean, even when I look back at 9-11, which is kind of this big, dramatic thing  for me, I think, you know, it's funny.  I did a talk at XOXO about my 9-11 experience,  and I did the Google Street view from the corner where I was standing.  And I swear that my memory is that I could see the towers burning.  But you really, but you I couldn't see the Freedom Tower  from the current Google Street. And that was just my memory.  I mean, our memories change and superimpose images that you see after them.  And every retelling, it changes.  So I really I feel kind of bad for him because I know how this works  and how this happens. Like, I mean, you know, you could say that he was  it was malicious because he was trying to embellish and make the story  more compelling and build up his own personality and and and, you know,  make it seem like he was more important in the middle of it than he actually was.  And maybe that was part of it.  But memory is a weird, weird, strange thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And also, you know, the quote, I look down the barrel of the tube  of an RPG that had been fired at us was not as part of the nightly news,  but was in an interview with a student  tell a Fairfield University student TV network.  I mean, it wasn't exactly.  On it wasn't on his nightly news show, the story, the story did change.  He apologized, saying, you know, I confused what happened.  He was riding in the helicopter behind the one that was hit  and it confused the events of 12 years ago.  But I think the issue is that story changed more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I think that's really it. I think it's the reaction to it.  I think you're very right, Gina.  I mean, I worry about this, too.  You know, I think about me in 9-11.  And and where I was, we all do that.  It's normal. Yeah.  And but I mean, David, David Carr, again, tried to say that  that what he did didn't have an impact on what he does for a living.  And I'm sorry, I got to disagree there.  You one should try to hold oneself to a higher standard.  At the same time, he's human.  At the same time, I go back as part of the problem is TV.  Jay Rosen again quoted, said somebody from TV, you know, tweeted him and said,  you got to understand that on television, the correspondent  doesn't actually do much of the journalism at all.  The producers, these other people do in the correspond.  But but then they may not take credit for anything.  The correspondent takes it on. Right.  And that's what they do.  And and and you're right, Gina, they make you know,  they're they're about trying to make compelling narratives. And  you can see how he got carried away.  But I can also see how once exposed  and not having dealt with it, I think in a very forthright way,  it affects his credibility and thus the credibility of the network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, that's true. I think that's true.  They definitely didn't handle it well.  But I mean, you know, look, this is the human human reaction.  I made a mistake is, oh, like, how can I how can I cover this up?  Or it wasn't so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or, you know, and I think, oh, that's really important, too, I think.  You know, I always say I always credit blogs with having I Craig Silverman,  who wrote a wonderful book called The Regret the Error.  I wrote the forward for it.  And as I as I did that, I thought about it.  I remember my early days in journalism.  You're right. The last thing you ever wanted to do was admit  that you made a mistake was the most shameful things were perfect.  And what blogging taught me,  you know, the first time I made a mistake and erased it and got slapped for it,  I learned a lesson about how to make mistakes openly.  And the primary lesson I learned is that when you correct yourself,  you don't reduce your credibility, you enhance your credibility.  TV doesn't know that.  When was the last time you saw a correction on TV before Brian Williams?  It never corrects itself.  It doesn't have that ethic that we now take as our norm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's so funny. That's so true.  Lifehacker, one of the one of the earliest,  most difficult editorial decisions I had to make is that we never pull a post  and that we show any edits that like change the content, you know,  a typo we would fix without showing that we change the typo.  But if but, you know, if we had published the wrong piece of information,  that we would strike it out and then do an update, a dated update.  And now that was tough.  And it was tough for me because I didn't want to forever and ever for there  to be a note of the fact that we made a mistake when we first published something,  a particularly painful situation we had.  We were putting instructions on how to edit your Windows registry,  which can really bark a machine.  And we screwed up the instructions.  And I felt like a complete jackass.  And, you know, and my first response was like, let's just change it,  you know, change it and not not acknowledge.  But, you know, there were a bunch of comments from people that said,  you guys got this wrong.  But it's true. Blogging is, you know, and that's when we see the, you know,  Wikipedia revisions and things like GitHub is that you see things  are a work in progress and they get changed and fixed.  I think it doesn't really have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it make any difference that he didn't do this on the nightly news?  But the exaggerations always occurred  with, you know, interviews by student reporters or David Letterman or Alec Baldwin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, why would he be interviewed?  Because he was on the nightly news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But. All right.  I mean, I think you're right.  I think the damage to credibility.  I think the point.  But if it's not like he lied on nightly news at all, ever.  These were in later recollections within kind of more personality driven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he did it in a huge stadium.  Yeah. You know, that's that's the issue.  He did it in very public places using his fame and notoriety.  Listen, if he if he lied to his wife about where he was last night,  that's their business. Right.  That doesn't affect his credibility.  If he lies in public.  I again, I have sympathy for him, too.  I think he's a good guy.  I don't think he did this maliciously.  I don't think he tried to say, I'm going to I'm going to  hornswoggle the world here.  I think. But but he was still has come back to it affects his credibility.  He's probably inflating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The couple of possibilities,  but that he was inflating his own reputation,  which would be bad, or that he really wanted to make it  a more interesting story because he's on Letterman.  And it has to be more interesting because he's on Letterman  than just a news report.  Anyway, I feel bad.  I guess there's nothing more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what we know that that nothing wrong has ever been said on the Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  network. Well, maybe that's why I'm so I feel so bad for him because.  Yeah.  I make up crap all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've never told any kind of embellished story.  No exaggeration is nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, actually, actually, the problem with being every week  is that when I do screw up and I have screwed up on this show often,  I have to remind myself to remember the next week I should correct myself.  And that's not easy to do. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The the post twig walk home is always filled with I wish I had said this  or I wish I had said that.  So look at the inner mind of a host.  I'm always like, yeah, I should have said this.  Yeah. I wish I put that a different way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Udi Manber, who is a name you might recognize, has left Google.  He was nine years at Google, then later at YouTube.  He joined in 2006 from Amazon.  He founded the A9 Lab, which was Amazon's attempt to create a search engine.  And then, in fact,  one of the reasons I recognize the name is because he's featured in Brad Stone's  The Everything Store.  He went to Google, led Project Nol, which was kind of like  knowledge and short for knowledge.  It was a database of information.  Didn't really take off.  He helped create help outs using Hangouts, which is actually a great  and very little used, I think, a Google feature Hangouts feature.  And then he worked on YouTube search most recently.  He's going to the National Institutes of Health, which is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And other departures,  Krista Barat, who created Google News as a extra project,  just announced on this weekend on Google Plus that he's leaving after 15 years.  And what's his name?  The head of knowledge who jumped off the who set the new record for jumping off.  Oh, he left, too. Really?  What's his name?  I don't have the knowledge of his guy who jumped out of the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the thing set the new record for skydiving.  Oh, come on.  Looking down the barrel of an RPG over Hurricane Katrina, I believe.  Oh, what's his name?  I can't remember it.  Google I.O. May 28th to May 29th.  We're going to have to go through this rigmarole again, getting you guys in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, Gina, I don't know if I can I can I can leverage your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I think as long as if only if Gina comes back full time,  she can get into Google.  I think you might have to make you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Leo, I was going to say to you, I want to be I would like I would be happy  to be of service in whichever way.  I mean, if if it would be easier for me to watch the stream and cover the stream.  I think we'll have you do that.  Like I'll certainly I will absolutely at minimum do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I presume, Jeff, you're planning to go right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if they let me in, it's notice this year, it's Thursday, Friday.  That's different. Oh, Wednesday, Thursday in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm going to throw an application in, you know, of course.  Or of course, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, it was Thursday, Friday. So will I.  Maybe maybe we'll get Mike Elgin to see he wants he wants to go.  I know. And Jason, you want to go, don't you? Of course you do.  Yeah, I have gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would a few years, but you know, every single year, it's the same song and dance.  Right. Right. We have to work right up until the bitter end.  We're we're we're in a cold sweat and somehow somehow it happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  March 17th, 9 a.m. Pacific tickets go on sale.  But that really is a meaningless information,  because if it's anything like in the past, tickets will sell out within a few seconds.  Literally some reference to a lottery.  Well, they did a lottery last year, didn't they? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's an application process and the and the people they offer tickets to.  It has no like the order in which you order or apply has no bearing on.  OK, so it isn't going to be this rush where it's like everyone's refreshing their web.  You know, it doesn't need to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of cool. Did you see that?  This is very material design, isn't it?  This is the Google I.O. page. Here's the countdown.  It looks like cut out piece pieces of paper counting down  till 33 days until registration begins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, I love the new lower third here, Leo.  I like the nice, I like the blue light.  Yeah, you got material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who did that? Anthony Nielsen do that?  Yeah, I believe so. Yeah.  Yeah, we've got material on our  on our album. Well, you know what? We had to do that.  We had to take this. There was this person on the album art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you're killing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kill me. Kill me.  Abandon us.  Oh, he has a residual feeling.  We're going to have to talk about this. No, no, it's OK.  It's all good. OK.  You still like me. I still love you.  That's the problem. That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. I didn't like you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It wouldn't be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an unrequited podcast. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You guys are too kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alan Eustace. Thank you, Virgil, in the chat room.  Alan Eustace is the name. Thank you. Thank you.  Google I.O. two days of inspirational talks,  hands on learning and a chance to hear more about Google's latest developer products.  Developers really want to go to this, right, Gina?  This is that's this is where you find out what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you want to go.  You want to go to I.O.  because you know you're going to get some mad goodies that maybe no one else has.  You know, you're going to get to be in the room.  Listen, there have been a couple of I.O.s that have been amazing.  The the the wave demonstration, I wasn't actually at that I.O.,  but that's when I decided I would start going skydiving with Google.  Wow. Amazing.  You have an opportunity to get that.  I mean, you got to remember before anybody had Google Glass,  Google Glass was really exciting.  You know, Android Wear.  I mean, you're just first on some really, really cool technology.  So if you're a developer, you definitely want to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's doing I.O. extended events for developers who can't get to I.O.  or don't get tickets.  So you'll be able to attend live streamed sessions, local developer demos,  hackathons and more.  And they do intend to stream the keynote as they have before.  And they say select sessions as well.  So I think they're they really understand that people, not everybody can get to I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel a little guilty taking up a chair as a non developer,  but I also find it just so telling as to what they're doing and how they're thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason, turn on the audio on my laptop, because I just noticed on the website  there's this little slider thing and when I tap it, it says Chrome experiment ahead.  The experiment features WebGL and Web Audio APIs.  You might want to grab headphones, have your audio, make some noise.  And I just clicked to make some noise.  Let's go. Oh, what am I seeing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was. Oh, he's so nervous.  There's always something in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. Jason, I actually haven't played with this.  I knew that there was something going on here, but I hadn't checked it out yet.  Move the big circles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whoa. Wow.  So that they get hit by the dots, because every time they get hit by the dots,  you get a drum beat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, this is very similar to an app called Nodebeat.  Oh, you've seen something like this.  There's an Android app called Nodebeat.  We had it on all that Android years ago.  And it's similar to this in some ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, this changes the beat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what's very interesting here is this is all happening inside the browser, right?  This is a WebGL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is the Google IOS site, and I just happened to click a link.  So what else can I do? I ask you.  So should I record my?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get ready to record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is such a nerd, but this is so cool.  They did this. They always do this.  They always have something, right? Yeah.  And in a way, it kind of is a little bit telegraphs  the kind of the kinds of things we're going to see.  So what does this thing do?  Oh, this is like a rubber band machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that is crazy.  That's happening in a browser. That is all HTML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is like these are like rubber bands and you put them in the peg holes  and then but what happens?  And then you can play them. And then I have to strum them.  See, I don't know how hard or easy this is to do.  But I bet you this is a lot of agile points to develop.  That's all I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot of agile points here.  We need this functionality built into the new Twitch site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to call our developers and say, guys, I need the.  OK, should I record? All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Drum a little recordable line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, I think you can get a new twig theme this way.  Yeah, this might be the new twig theme.  This is twig.  Wait a minute. Does it have a higher pitched if I stretch it more?  I can't.  Yeah.  All right. Now what?  But I already did this one.  Did this one. That's it.  Now, what do I do?  Let's pause.  Share song reset to default exit experiment.  So it's just a little it's a little little instrument.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So my my this is really cool.  But my cynical response to this is like every year, the site has some crazy,  you know, cool Chrome experiment with this, you know, insanely dynamic,  neat functionality.  And Google does make beautiful Chrome experiments.  You just don't see anybody else making anything like this.  Yeah, you know what I mean?  Yeah, it doesn't feel like it's working.  Like, I think this is a really cool showcase of what's possible.  I just don't see a whole lot of uptake on it.  Yeah, that's a good point.  I'm looking at the wrong sites.  I mean, maybe there are browser based games and other and and and things that I'm just not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that I'm missing. But I could just tell you right now that knowing what I know about  the cost of web development, this is the last thing I would ask for.  Oh, incidentally, can we have a WebGL experiment in our website, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think one person made that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably, right? Yeah.  Probably took them all year.  Is this somebody saying this is going to die when HTML five comes along,  isn't this HTML five?  It's a WebGL as a plug in.  Yeah, WebGL is a plug in and Web Audio API would probably be an API within HTML five,  I would guess. Right.  But I think you'd have to have the you know, in other words,  this only works in Chrome right now because no other browser.  Experiments. Yeah, no other browser supports  or do any browsers  besides Chrome support WebGL.  Seems like a Google thing.  That's a good question. Google WebGL support.  I wonder how we could figure that out.  Browsers that support WebGL.  Yeah, apparently some browsers do.  Here's a table.  Eleven, IE eleven and up.  Firefox.  Thirty five and up.  Oh, iOS Safari eight point one and up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chrome is way ahead there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Light green is portions partial support.  Red is no support.  Dark green is full support.  So that's opera light is partial support.  Safari actually is far in the desktop.  Partial support Safari on iOS full support, oddly enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an interesting Chrome for Android is partial support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's harder to do.  Yeah, Apple, if you want if you want WebGL on a mobile device, get an iPhone.  Oddly enough.  Wacky method of generating dynamic 3D graphics  using JavaScript accelerated through hardware.  That's what WebGL is.  That's all. And this is in the US.  But that's for market share.  Oh, no, that's global market share.  Huh? There you go.  Wow, it's amazing what you can learn these days.  All right. Moving along.  So you will all try to go to Google I.O.  We will certainly cover the keynote or notes live Thursday and Friday.  It's great. Thank you, Google.  Usually they've overlapped with this weekend, Google.  But now we can will they'll be out of our way and we'll be out of their way.  Google has added a virtual genius bar.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Have you seen this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think genius bars trademarked surely.  They're actually using help outs.  It's called Google Device Experts.  It's kind of like May Day from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So employees involved with the service told TechCrunch it's been in testing since November.  Google spokesperson said we're in a limited trial of an experimental support  feature gathering feedback not yet ready to share.  Ready to show up, share.  Is this the thing we call that day?  Oh, no, it's different.  This is in the devices section of Google Play.  So you're in you're on the web, you're in Google Play in the devices section.  Click the help icon top right corner and then under contact us, there will appear  a video call button and that will give you a Google Hangouts with a Google expert  who can help you.  So we can't call anybody now.  Well, I can try it. They say you can share your screen.  So this is very much like May Day, isn't it?  So let's go to Play.Google.com and see what we can do.  I don't think it's rolled out yet.  I think it's just something they've spotted.  So there's devices. Here's help.  Is video video call video call?  Yeah. How can we help you?  What do I need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can broke my nexus six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use. Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I use Skype on Chrome OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Skype on Chrome OS?  Question mark. Start a video call.  Wow. Sorry.  This is going to be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm trying to troll them, but, you know, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the first one here.  Ready to join.  Now, I think would you like to share your screen?  We have to kind of tell somehow.  Don't show this.  We have to tell them we're doing this before we actually do it somehow.  Share my screen.  Google Hangouts is sharing your screen with plus dot Google dot com.  Your screen sharing present to everyone, but I'm not.  They hear my audio, but no one is coming in the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they're they're getting something out of the microwave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, hey, how you doing?  Can I I'm on a don't play his audio yet.  I'm on a podcast called This Week in Google.  My name is Leo.  And I'm wondering if I can show because we're showing people this new feature.  If I could show people your screen and and we can record your voice.  But Doug, before I can show this, I need your permission to record it.  Go for it, Leo. Go for it, Leo.  All right. Thank you, Doug.  So everybody's going to see you now.  Yes. And I have nothing confidential on my screen.  So go ahead and look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will. Thank you for sharing your screen.  But yeah, so that you had a question about using Skype on Chrome OS.  Yeah, can I?  So currently, Skype is currently not supported on Chrome OS.  There are, however, great alternatives for video chatting on Chrome  on Chromebooks as well, as well as  as well as communication apps that are available on the Chrome Web Store,  including Hangouts. Are you familiar with Hangouts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am. We love Hangouts.  In fact, we're using this is help out, isn't it?  Is that what we're using right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're actually we're on a hangout right now.  I know Hangouts is kind of similar to Hangouts,  but we're actually just straight up on a plain old hangout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Doug, are you where are you a Google employee or are you a third party or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I work at Google. We're here in beautiful Mountain View.  You're in Mountain View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love your set.  That looks so cool with the Android stuff there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, we are very googly here at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. How many how many of you know how many of you are there?  Doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know we have a we do have a small team.  I wouldn't be able to put a number to it, though.  I'm really bad at math and counting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's OK. But there are other people and you're all kind of near  each other doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, kind of.  I'm I'm not too sure how big the team is, but I do have my own team here.  And we are all kind of our team of device experts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, did you were you a Google employee before this or were you hired  specifically to do this kind of support?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, actually, because you are kind of our press, we do kind of.  You can't talk to me. I understand.  Doug, I do have a link for you if you like, if you like.  It's a press at Google dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm familiar with that.  And I apologize for ambushing you, but that's why we asked you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't know.  I just hear if I can, you know, help spread the word or what you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What we're doing this is that what we're doing.  Yeah, lots of people now are going to try this out.  And I love Doug, how you shared that link with me and I could just  it was a little window down here.  I could just click that to go to press dot google dot com.  That was cool. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. Hey, this is really neat.  Hey, Doug, you're great.  You want to be a good host at Google?  Yeah, we could hire you as a host this week in Google.  We've got to replace Gina here.  Hey, it's very nice to meet you, Doug.  I really appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you. It was really great talking to you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. It's a great demo of what you guys can do.  Thanks. Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Take care. You need help. Go ahead.  It's just another hangout. I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it. Just another bye, Doug.  Bye, Doug. Bye, Doug.  Bye.  That is so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was really good sport.  That that never gets old.  Calling Google support on this show never gets old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know you did it first on all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. But I think it's great.  I think it's awesome.  And and I would imagine you guys are pretty darn impressed as impressed as I am,  because for the longest time, Google and support have not been two words  that have shared like a human been associated with good.  Yet both of these times that we've done it on this show,  the response has been super quick.  They've you know, I'm sure if we would have dove in with a,  you know, pretty hardcore question, probably would have got a good answer.  I'm pretty impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, he did not refer to a notebook or anything,  at least not that I could see. He knew the answer.  Yeah, he wasn't doing a small page.  Yeah, let me go to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  So so you do that by going to the Play Store and  looking the question mark icon and then under contact us.  There's a video call.  At least there was online.  There's also live chat and phone.  And that is impressive for people who have in the past said,  oh, I don't know. I can't get support from Google.  Now, they don't do this for Gmail  and stuff like this, although.  He did answer a question about.  He answered a Chrome OS. Yeah, yeah, he did.  Wow. That is sweet.  Well, they sell Chromebooks here.  So, you know, but they sell products here that  are cover the entire spectrum of Google stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, if I if I've been obnoxious, I could have asked whether there's any  possible use for my Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be interesting?  Because Glass is still available in the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And no, it's not. You can't buy.  I think they can't buy it. They just have it.  They don't think you buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think they would still support it if you asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then let's let's just for the record, anybody listening to Google,  don't get the guy in trouble for not going to press first.  He was a great demo of the product.  This was a wonderful thing to do.  He was he was he was wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I felt like he pretty like at the appropriate moments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He handled it beautifully.  He handled beautifully and beautifully.  And I think it was good for people to see in real time  what it looked like to actually make a call, how long it took.  And I apologize.  You know, we're in the state of California, which is what they call a two party state.  We cannot in any way broadcast the audio or video of the call  until we have permission.  Unfortunately, in order to do that, I they had to have a little bit.  Yeah, I had to put it up in just a tiny bit.  So we can edit that out or something.  But yeah, so the live audience got a little little  leak of something that they shouldn't have.  But I thought he did very nicely.  And he could have said, no, you know, you can't.  If you're press, I'm sorry, I can't talk to you.  But but I think it was appropriate that he did what he did.  We got a very good idea of what could happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the great thing is Google is indeed human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there is a human face of Google love and very human.  Nice. I liked him.  This guy, that he was standing up, which is impressive.  That's an interesting.  That's a conscious choice, right?  Obviously, he's not standing right now.  He's waiting for somebody else to call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's obviously standing on a set with with lighting background.  And yeah, that's certainly better than mine with the sun setting and my light changing.  But yeah, no, he was he was ready and set up.  Although that so that was device support.  Right. He said this is support for devices.  What I'd like to see is somebody whose Gmail account was shut down  because of a service violation or somebody's AdSense account  that's in some sort of suspended state.  I would like to hear the script or the response to, hey,  I can't log into my Gmail account. I'm locked out.  You know what? What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting, too, is that having an employee in Mountain View,  that's a very high expense item.  No kidding. Real estate and such.  No kidding. That's interesting.  Maybe it's just a test and they're figuring it out.  But that's that surprises me. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but good, that's what they need to do.  Chickenhead to and I chicken 21 in our charm says you should show this to Comcast.  Oh, Comcast.  Actually, I want to show Comcast Google's new robotic dog.  Oh, this thing is so cool.  Boston Dynamics, that's the one that did that crazy running robot.  They've got a new one.  This is called Spot.  Google owns this company.  So oh, he's so cute.  Mm hmm.  Notice, by the way, the previous running robots had big long wires attached to them.  This guy does right now. He's wireless.  Yeah, wireless. Look, he's coming to bother people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They just ignore the dog.  No big deal. We see this all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This guy's like, look, he kicked it.  I feel so bad about them kicking this.  I know. I totally agree.  Just bring this one right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just like, oh, nice.  That wasn't nice to do to the robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that shows you how I don't want to say anthropomorphic because it's a dog,  but how realistically you kind of assume this is a live creature.  Yeah, I know. Because it's not.  It's just a machine.  You kick your computer all the time, right?  It's just a computer with legs. Sometimes walking on ice, on gravel.  Look at this. And again.  I don't can we hear audio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have audio potted up, but I don't know.  I don't hear the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we heard with the other robotic dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Is there is there a volume in the player?  Maybe I don't have the player turned up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Let me turn on the audio. Let's see.  It's pretty quiet.  What's that like for a wheelchair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is a wheelchair? What would that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't didn't the guy who created the segue created a wheelchair  that could go upstairs. Yeah, that's right.  It can run along. Oh, that's so cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, that looks like Stormtroopers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, those two looking Stormtroopers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not sure. I'm coming for you.  Yeah, we are human.  You're puny humans. You rang fire rocket guns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The future of war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. Yeah, that's pretty terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, what would you do if you had an army of those things  headed right towards you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I just wanted to carry my groceries home.  Remember Boston Dynamics

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  before they bought Boston Dynamics?  The company did have, in fact, some defense contracts.  So this is what is that a pig?  It's a motorized pig.  And so and I think Google said that whatever contracts,  existing contracts they had, they would continue.  No robots were harmed.  Show this in the making of this video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It knows the kicking. The kicking is disturbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very disturbing.  So this has got to be electric.  They've come a long way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was that noisy one? Was that a gas engine?  That was one that looked like a pig.  But there was the what was noisier.  Was that because it was a gas engine?  I think it must have been. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got LIDAR on the on the head.  See that spinning thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's how it's self-driving car when you have a self-driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just sort of sad.  It just kind of gets back up and keeps going.  It's like, go ahead, kick me again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's cool. Just kick me again, man.  Fine. Whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The good news is these robots have four minutes battery life.  So all you have to do is run for four minutes and you're OK.  Wow. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can watch these for hours. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're actually rerunning the video just because we like it so very, very much.  Our show today brought to you by Makes Me Want a Nap.  So thank God I have my Casper ready to hand.  Our show today brought you by my new mattress from Casper.com.  Who would ever think you'd be buying?  But who would ever think you see walk and robotic dogs?  Who would ever think you'd be buying mattresses on a website?  Don't you want to lie on the mattress? You might ask.  How about this? Of course, you want to lie on the mattress before you buy it.  But the problem is five minutes on a mattress in a showroom with the  saleswoman looking down her nose at you is no way to test a mattress.  With Casper, you get free delivery and 100 days,  100 days to sleep on that thing, 100 nights to decide if you want it.  And then if you don't, painless returns, they'll take they come and they get it.  And it's fine. You know, you get your money back.  It's completely risk free.  The Casper mattresses are long lasting.  They're comfortable. There's there's good back support.  They combine memory foam, nice, firm memory foam with latex.  I mean, sorry, nice firm latex with memory foam.  So it it conforms to your body, but gives you a nice support.  You can see I'm very comfortable on my new Casper mattress.  I they're made in the USA.  They are premium mattresses.  But by eliminating the resellers, the showrooms, they save you a lot of money.  Casper mattresses start at five hundred dollars for a twin,  nine hundred fifty dollars for a king size.  And we're going to give you fifty dollars if you use the offer code twig  TWIG at Casper dot com slash twig, even Ozzy.  Loves our Casper mattress. I liked it so much.  I got one for my son.  He's, you know, in college and living off campus.  He needed a mattress. No way. He's on the third floor.  They were going to get a full size mattress up three stairs.  So three flights of stairs. So we got him at Casper. He loves it.  Casper dot com slash twig.  He says, Dad, I sleep on it every night.  I said, really? Every night?  Well, most nights Casper dot com slash twig  save fifty dollars when you use the offer code twig.  I'm telling you, I love my Casper. You will, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think maybe it might be a time for some trumpets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so sorry. I didn't even think of that.  You got Gina. Could we do the changelog?  The Google changelog.  Our live studio audience is applauding.  All three of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's music to my ears.  You guys have not have the trumpets been retired?  Yeah, we don't do the changelog without Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina is here with the latest from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google takes on Yelp elites with its new local guides program.  This is a new feature in Google Maps where you can opt in to become a local guide.  If you go to Google dot com slash local slash guides.  And it's a program that's meant to kind of encourage people to go out and post  well written and informed reviews for local places.  And basically, if you opt in to become a local guide, you get you get a couple of benefits.  You get access to a special email newsletter, an opportunity to join hangouts with other reviewers.  You get to host and attend special events.  You get to moderate local guides, Google plus communities.  Google just gives you a couple of couple of goodies here and there for for for beefing up their their reviews.  So if you're into that, like I said, Google dot com slash local slash guides,  it's very similar to Yelp's elites program.  If you're looking for a little bit more Google Drive storage,  you can get two gigabytes of extra drive space for free by completing Google's security checkup.  This is just a little quiz, it seems like.  I haven't had a chance to run through it myself that basically checks to make sure that your  your Google settings are up to date, your security settings and privacy settings.  So you'll run through a couple of checks that will make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very simple. I did it.  It takes two seconds just to make sure that you have a backup phone number and an email address in case you get hacked.  Make sure that it shows you where your your your your your your authorizations are so that you can review that and you get in the habit of it.  It's very simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like this is just stuff that you should be doing anyway.  But Google's just sweet sweet in the pot a little bit by often as texture, two gigabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, my view is I think that if you do two step authentication,  they ought to send you a T-shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was for safer Internet Day.  That's kind of neat. Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  We talked about that on Sunday because Larry Magid was one of the guys behind it and was down there at Facebook with Cheryl and a bunch of other people to to promote this.  So thank you, Google, for participating in safer Internet Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It also shows how much two gigs has been devalued.  Yeah, seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll give you two gigabytes.  It's like like S&H GreenStamps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I I've got I didn't even have to do anything.  I just got three check marks just because I'd already done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boom, boom, boom.  Oh, because you recently you recently had said, yes, my recovery information is correct.  Look, it's correct. My recent sign in activity looks good.  Yeah, I do that all the time.  So yeah, I'm sure you surely you have to wait to check to see if you have two factor enabled.  That seems kind of advanced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not they're not requiring you do that, which is too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, two factor is it's a lot.  I guess it's a lot to expect of regular of normals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Still, grandma, they also have this nice safety center that shows you, you know, how to prevent cybercrime, manage your privacy and safety and security.  And then there's safety tools here.  These are all the tools that Google offers.  It's great.  Love this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, speaking of Google giveaways, if you've got a Chromecast, Google wants to give you six bucks in Play Store credits.  And it works.  I did it.  I did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two Chromecasts, two six bucks.  I have three Chromecasts.  Yeah, you get 18 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very, very nice.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you just have to be on the network that your Chromecast is.  And if you go into the Chromecast app on iOS or Android, you can go to the the check for offers button.  It's under it's in the hamburger menu, I believe.  And if you check for offers, there's often a few different things in there.  But this offer is basically it's a six dollar gift card to Google Play.  I mean, I guess they're hoping that you're going to rent a rent a movie for Valentine's Day, I guess, or or, you know, buy something from the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't we get something just when we bought the Google Chromecast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, at this point, the Chromecast is at least in the US is pretty much paid for itself.  I had bought it.  They want to make money.  Yeah.  I mean, Google has been I've just been pretty impressed with how how loosely they're giving away content.  X-Men also, if you log in to the offers page with your Chromecast, they're offering the first X-Men movie for free in HD.  Just a bunch of free content that they keep giving away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, just real quickly, they if you have two factor turned on, I just redid the security check up.  They do have you go through the two factor settings and verification.  So I actually have five check marks.  Oh, yeah, you're super safe.  It's worth doing this, though, because it does remind you of what apps you've permitted, what what Android devices you're using and things like that.  It's good to do this.  And six, how do we get our six bucks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Six bucks is in that you want to go into the Chromecast app on your on your mobile device.  You should be connected to the same network that your Chromecast is on.  Cool. I think, you know, look, the reality is that these giveaways, they really want people to use the Play Store more.  And I think it's about movies and TV more than it is about Chromecast, more than it is about like apps or devices.  So, I mean, if I had an extra six bucks and I never bought from the Play Store before, I might rent a movie.  Right. And then once you start to sort of amass a library in the Play Store, it's like, OK, you know, at this point, I've got libraries,  I've got iTunes videos that I purchase, I've got Amazon, you know, Prime, InstaVideo, I've got Google Play.  I'm like, where? I know I have this movie, but which one is it?  You have to check, you know, all the different places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that it? That's it. That's all I got.  It's the queue. Play the tripanis.  The tripanitipanis. The tripanitipanis.  We call them tripanis now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The tripanis.  Tray the tripanis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the Google changelog.  Oh, we missed it. We missed it.  Nice to have. See why we like the changelog.  Look at that. You made us money.  You got me gigs.  Really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you to Jason for putting that together, because I was utterly unprepared.  So thank you, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what, Jason, unfortunately, he's so good that I've stopped doing any work at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's all right. I have my sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just go, what happened today?  And he tells me it's great. It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's one that Jason, actually, you guys talked about last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, we didn't. This actually kind of popped up today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's up with Android Wear?  What's the story?  Research firm Canalys says only 720,000 Android Wear watches were shipped in the last six months of 2014.  That's the same period that Apple sold 114 million iPhones.  You can pretty much guarantee that they'll sell more than a million Apple watches in the first day, I would guess.  Does this mean Android Wear is, as research analyst at Canalys says, not very good?  No.  No, you dope.  We love Android Wear. In fact, I think it's very good.  He says the battery life is one of the reasons they haven't taken off,  arguing Google should have further streamlined the mobile operating system so they can last longer than a day.  It gets me through every day.  I don't think longer than a day. I don't know where that comes from.  I've heard real people say it too.  But don't you plug in your phone at night when you go to bed?  Don't you put your watch on the stand at night when you go to bed?  I mean, it's just what we do now.  Yeah, you have a pebble, Chris.  Chris is shaking his head.  But you have a pebble and your pebble can't do doodly did, diddly squat.  And it's not even in color.  And you don't have a sweep secondhand.  You don't have a touch screen.  Or a touch screen. And you can't talk to your pebble.  I think that actually Android wears really good.  I think it is too.  But we shall see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jason's note in the law is...  Jason made a great note. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said compare that to the number of iPods sold.  In 2001, it was 125,000.  One eighth of that. Or whatever, one sixth of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, between 2001 and 2002, iPods sold 725,000 units, which is roughly about the same as this.  Ah, in two years.  In two years.  And, you know, they're comparing it against the iPhone, which, you know,  there are different categories.  I just don't know if it's a very fair comparison to compare a watch, which is an accessory that ties to something versus an iPhone that's like this full function thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do have to say, though, the comparison that will be relevant, important, is in April when the Apple Watch comes out.  And you know...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Lemmings are going to run to the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I even switched to an iPhone so I can get used to this so that I can buy the Apple Watch when it comes out.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but then you have Tim Cook, who I thought these quotes were a little obnoxious.  He gave a keynote this week and he basically said there's no such thing, nothing you'd call a smart watch yet.  And I thought that would...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think that's fair. I think that the Moto 360 is great.  I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They also said that sitting is the new cancer so that your Apple Watch is going to buzz at you and bug you if you sit for too long.  No, thanks, Apple. No.  What?  Sitting is the new cancer?  You can turn that off. You can turn that off.  I know, but I thought it was obnoxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it makes Jason Chubbs proud.  I mean, you know, that kind of trash talk is kind of what Apple does.  I just added to the rundown.  My friend Paul Ford wrote a piece on Medium actually about...  It's called It's Kind of Cheesy Being Green.  And I didn't even know this and I do use iOS a little bit, but he was pointing out that when you use iOS and you get an iMessage from someone else using an iOS device that the bubbles are blue.  But if someone is using another operating system, quote unquote,  Shame on them.  This bright, bright green.  And then he did this search on Twitter of people basically saying that, you know, that they hate green.  And if somebody texts them back and it's green, that they judge them.  They never date a guy in green.  Which of course is ridiculous, right?  But he was saying that he really feels like Apple sort of reinforces this weird, this kind of weird class war.  This is great line in the last paragraph.  It would probably be one line of code to change the color, to reduce the tension between the blues and the greens,  to make it possible for a broke dude stuck on Android 4.1 Jelly Bean to mack on a rich girl with an iPhone 6 without her knowing that he's not in the same ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a really interesting point.  I mean, I think it's...  I don't think Apple's trying to dis the other phones.  So I just want you to know that this is an SMS message versus a web-based, an internet-based text message, right?  So the blue means that it came over the internet.  It didn't come through your cellcarries SMS system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, right.  Right. And that's probably...  That's true. You can argue that.  I was like, well, it's an SMS versus an iMessage.  But it is really a pretty strong indicator.  Oh, this person's an iOS or not.  Right?  You know when you get a green message.  And it's interesting that it's green because Android is green.  And I had no idea that people didn't like the green bubbles, that it was such a different...  Look at these tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The people are so mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People are mean, right?  Mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so awful.  But I stopped trusting a person once I text them and it's green bubbles.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little bit how I feel when I encounter someone with an AOL email address, right?  Like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, we all do it.  We all have these brand associations and judge people a little bit by them, right?  Sarah tweets,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll never seriously date a guy who texts with green bubbles.  I'm sorry, but never.  Elvin, which what kind of name is Elvin?  Elvin Broket says,  When she texts you back, even though you got green bubbles, you smile like Leonardo DiCaprio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like a disease.  I got the green bubble disease.  I got green bubbles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you respect me even though I'm on Android?  Not really, now that I think about it.  Wow.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  A non-iPhone.  So anyway, I had to share this piece.  It's a great piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.  It's funny.  Hysterical.  Medium does, by the way, a very nice job of formatting this and making it pretty.  Is that just...  Yeah, they sure do.  Is that very easy to do?  It's just like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very easy.  You're using Bedley.  So you don't put any embed codes in.  You just put the URL of the thing you want to embed in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it puts it there.  And these are the Twitter cards.  So it automatically knows Twitter cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Medium and Twitter probably talk once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's Ed Williams.  I've heard he had something to do with Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've heard there are a couple of people in common there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, Ed Dumble we love.  He is a deep data guy and an O'Reilly guy.  I mean, he's been on our shows.  And so he's the one who actually discovered the green bubbles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it was Ed.  It was Ed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Too legit to quit.  I can't deal with you if you still have green bubbles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can't deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's stupid.  People will find any reason to be discriminatory.  Green bubbles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're still living in the I'm a Mac, I'm a PC era, right?  The hips are good.  The business dude.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although, OK, I'm just going to say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, boy. Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now that I'm using the iPhone, there's two things that are great.  One is the Touch ID really works and that's really nice to unlock stuff.  And the other is messages is...  Now, but it's totally wrong because it only works with people who have iOS  and an OS X devices, but it is a nice way to communicate.  You can do audio.  You can... I mean, it's really...  It's a nice system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's similar to Hangouts.  I've never... I haven't used iMessage.  It's better than Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's better than Hangouts.  I wish Google would add some features.  Well, for instance, let's say I'm going to send a message to Lisa.  I could, of course, text an iMessage.  And if I tap in the text field, I'll get the keyboard.  And just like Hangouts, I can attach a file.  But look at this. See the little microphone here?  If I press it, I could start recording a message to Lisa  and then swipe up and it sends it.  You can't do that on Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I could use Hangouts to type it for me  without making you go to the trouble of listening to the darn thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but you see how fast that was? Look at that.  And it's much easier.  I use Dictation all the time.  No, this isn't Dictation. I'm sending her the audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm saying I prefer Dictation  because I would hate to have to listen to the darn audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Lisa, do you prefer Dictation  or do you love hearing these great messages from me like...  And then I send it.  See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, see?  You're disgusting.  Spare us the newlywed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, geez.  Says the old married people.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, geez.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, all right.  Public displays of affection.  Disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Disgusting.  No, but I do use Hangouts,  which is a second class citizen on the iPhone,  but it's not a completely second class citizen.  But I find that little audio thing really sweet.  Also, without any additional feature,  there's messages on the desktop or the laptop or the iPad,  and those all work together.  But it's only when somebody's in on a Mac,  which is frustrating.  I guess I could SMS somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, but then you get green bubbles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hate them green bubbles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those green bubbles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Samsung is going to make a new Galaxy smartphone,  which I presume they'll announce next month at Mobile World Congress,  with not one, not two, but three screens.  This is a story from, again, Bloomberg Businessweek.  We'll see a lot about phones.  How three? You got the main one, the curved one.  What's the third one?  There'll be a curve on the left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, both sides, right? Both sides.  Well, here's the problem. The reason I like the one curve,  I never know easily which is upside down, right side up.  When I pick up the phone, I feel. Oh, you know that, right.  But you really know that.  It really does make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They ought to leave it on one side.  Samsung got a lot of attention doing the right thing, I think,  which was putting a disclaimer in its user manual for the TV  that Samsung Smart TV, some of them you can talk to, mine you can talk to.  It says in the disclaimer,  if you enable voice recognition to interact with your smart TV using your voice,  some interactive voice commands may be transmitted along with information  about your device including device identifiers to a third party service provider,  Nuance Communications, that converts your voice commands to text  and to the extent necessary provide the voice recognition features to you.  Google does the same thing.  When you say, okay, you know who, sorry.  When you say, okay, you know who, Google will be listed.  The phone's not always sending it to Google, but as soon as you say, okay,  or as soon as you say, hey Siri or press the button,  it sends that back to Apple or to Google.  In this case, Samsung doesn't have a voice recognition department,  so they sent it to Nuance, who by the way,  provides a lot of the recognition for Apple as well.  Samsung will collect your interactive voice commands  only when you make a specific search request to the smart TV  by clicking the activation button on the remote  or your screen or speaking into the microphone on the remote control.  Now Samsung says, don't worry, that's not ominous, calm down.  They do not monitor living room conversations, and of course they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the wording in the yield before was...  Kind of applied that.  Well, it was translated badly, I think.  And yeah, it applied that suddenly everything you say...  Because it said, be careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was the interesting thing, and I think that that was actually Samsung  trying to do the right thing and warning people.  And we talked about this with Steve Gibson yesterday on Security Now.  I think that it's probably good to disclose what you're doing  and even to say, hey, if this bothers you, turn this feature off,  because if you say sensitive things, it could be sent up to our servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and it probably is discoverable in your divorce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe, maybe not, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I mean, they want to limit their liability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're erring on the side of caution.  Yeah.  But as you and everybody else knows,  if you have an Xbox One in your living room,  and you say, OK, Xbox, it then starts listening  and sends the content back to Microsoft.  If you say, OK, G-O-O-G-L-E, your phone will start listening  and your browser will start listening and send the stuff back to Google.  That's how these work.  They don't constantly stream it because that would be prohibitive.  I don't know. I feel like Samsung kind of got...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, OK, Leo, here's...  There's this security chic now  that everybody is supposed to put tape over the camera on their laptop  that we share for the show.  I think it's ridiculous, right?  So is this the same kind of thing that everybody should, you know,  chop the ears off their TVs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's very easy.  And I think that to Samsung's credit, they explained it.  And then they said, and you can turn it off.  Here's how you turn it off.  And I actually have turned it off on my Samsung TV,  not because I'm paranoid or worried about privacy,  but just because I don't want it.  It does not a useful feature for me.  But I love the Amazon Echo.  We played with that same thing.  When you say the word Alexa, it sits up, takes notice,  and then it will answer your question.  And it does that by sending it back to Amazon.  None of these devices can do it locally.  They don't have enough brains.  Certainly not your TV.  However, this one I don't like.  I don't know if this is true,  but a number of owners of Samsung Smart TVs,  and I am one, I haven't seen this,  say that their TV sets have started to interrupt their movie viewing  with a Pepsi ad.  What?  They're dynamically inserting ads.  If that's the case, I'm going to throw my $9,000 curved OLED TV  out the window and cry.  I'll be standing at your window with arms wide open.  You bought the TV.  There's no reason.  I meant many TV, but the Panasonic Viera also has TV,  has banner ads, some of which play movies on the interface.  And you can disable some, but not all.  But for it to insert an ad into a movie I'm watching...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  From your hard drive, these are like people watching a movie from, like, Plex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Samsung said...  And outreach.  We are aware of a situation that has caused some smart TV users in Australia  to experience program interruption in the form of an advertisement.  This seems to be caused by an error.  And we are currently conducting a full and thorough investigation into the cause.  It's only happening in Australia.  We'd like to apologize.  And I have to say, I don't use Plex, but I've never seen a Pepsi ad inserted  into any of my content on my Samsung Smart TV.  Might have to do with Foxtel.  I don't know.  There should not be ads on your TV anywhere.  Because you bought it.  But it's just a matter of time, I suppose.  Let's see, anything else?  Good news, we talked yesterday about the ProPublica article.  Werner Koch, who is a German who has since 1999 been the one,  mostly the one guy who supports GPG tools.  I use it, I love it.  It is an open source version of PGP encryption for your email.  And it could be used to sign other things and encrypt other things.  And the article by Julia Angwin was just, it kind of broke my heart.  He created GNU Privacy Guard actually in 97.  And since then has been almost single-handedly keeping alive with patches  and updates from his home in Germany.  I'm too idealistic, he says.  In early 2013 I was about ready to give it all up and take a straight job.  But then the Stoden News broke and I realized this is not the time to cancel.  Thank goodness, he's been making about $25,000 a year since 2001.  He did launch a fundraiser in December, which has raised $43,000.  Here's the good news.  When this article came out, the Linux Foundation gave him a one-time grant of $60,000.  Facebook and Stripe each pledged $50,000 a year to GPG Tools.  And donations flooded his site and he almost immediately reached his funding goal of $137,000.  That's great.  So he's now got $300,000 more to support his efforts.  And he deserves it.  By the way, apparently there's a launch.  This is the Deep Space Observatory, a SpaceX launch, which has been scrubbed twice.  And it looks like they're going to be able to do it this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kind of timely because Google just confirmed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Almost a billion dollars to SpaceX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Elon Musk is just coolest, coolest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm getting all these people who are saying, I had no idea I was a blue bubble.  Or green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got to discover off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When is this supposed to come back onto the barge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When is this supposed to do that?  An hour.  That's the launch vehicle after it gets the whatever it needs.  It's time.  Yeah.  Cool.  It's a Deep Space Weather Satellite, which I think, as I remember, is going to be in  space four times the distance to the moon.  Three times.  At the Lagrange point.  It's at the Lagrange point.  Ah, OK.  Which is roughly three.  It moves around, but it's roughly 750,000 miles out.  So, that's cool.  The Deep Space Climate Observatory.  Successful launch.  Very nice.  Congratulations, SpaceX.  And yeah, Google, an investor in SpaceX.  We just learned $900 million into SpaceX's billion-dollar round.  So, that's like pretty much 90%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, basically the whole round.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My math is correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A few people were allowed to follow on, is what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's nice.  Good for them.  Google and Fidelity.  And for their, by the way, for their billion dollars, they get about 10% of the company.  So, I guess that values the company at $10 billion.  So, SpaceX did that launch, that launch vehicle.  Not the Discover Satellite.  That's a government satellite, but the government pays SpaceX to put it into space.  Successful launch.  I don't know what they're going to announce, but Google and Mattel have a thing coming up.  I'm sorry.  I've got to turn my phone off.  A lot of people.  I'm getting all these, all these blue bubbles all of a sudden.  So many blue bubbles.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  It's for a major international toy fair this Friday.  Mattel invites you to view what's possible with an exclusive announcement and product debut.  And then at the bottom, Mattel and Google.  Do you think it's Google Cardboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds cardboard to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does Mattel make, doesn't Mattel make that 3D viewer, the View Master?  It could be View Master 2.0.  Or it could be a tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's lots of things it could be.  I don't know.  They've got View Master in the invite.  So, it's kind of...  Oh, that's what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  View what's possible, of course.  I didn't even look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe it's a tablet shaped as a View Master film roll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be great?  Cardboard, which was really the most interesting giveaway at the last Google I.O., really hasn't been exploited well enough, I think.  I think Google's kind of stepping up a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  LG just announced that buyers of the LG G3 now get for free LG's own version of Cardboard Viewer.  And it's made of plastic.  So, I don't know what you call it when cardboard's made of plastic.  But, you know, so more and more we're seeing it.  And we're seeing more app support for it as well.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems like they could just make a simple app that you pull on the magnet and it switches the viewer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it kind of already is a View Master, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  I think that that's the little magnetic thing that...  And there's a little RF or NFC in here that triggers the program to run.  This is the one Gina built in her lap as she was driving up from Google I.O. without even looking at the instructions.  That's why it's really not quite...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not quite put together so well.  I refused to look at their instructions.  I was like, I will figure this out.  I will unfold this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I loved watching that.  That was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish I could have seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It got done.  I wish I could have seen it.  I was so impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, of course.  It was determined that Gina, the maker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, determined Gina could have done that a lot more efficiently if I just read the instructions.  No.  If I had RTFM.  No.  Determined photo Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the idea is you have to have an Android phone.  You put the Android phone in here and suddenly you get a new world view.  It actually is the coolest thing they handed out at Google I.O.  I know you guys got two Android Wear watches, but this is the coolest thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's awesome when the coolest thing from Google I.O. only costs like $7 to buy on the internet.  It was under your chair.  Everybody can get one now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, let's take a break and we've got a tool, a number.  And yes, Gina's tip or thing or whatever.  Coming up.  We've missed you, Gina.  Our show today brought to you by my razor.  See how smooth, baby smooth my face is.  That's because I know a guy named Harry.  Harry's razors.  We've been talking about him a lot.  I love it.  If you go to H.A.R.R.Y.S.  .com, you could take a look at the best deal in shaving out there.  Shaving who likes to shave?  Nobody does, especially if you have a bad blade or a dull blade or heaven for Fendt.  You're using you're so cheap using those disposable razors.  Hey, actually, I don't blame you when it went up blade, a Gillette blade in the drugstore could cost as much as $4.  It's tempting to go get the 69 cents, you know, big.  But I'll tell you what, it's bad enough.  You have to scrape your face with a super sharp blade every day to do it with a badly made super sharp blade is ridiculous.  And to spend $4 is ridiculous.  Harry solves this by giving you the best razor blades I've ever used.  Better than anybody else's for about half the price of those big brand names.  Part of this is because Harry's was smart enough to buy the factory.  When they first started the company, I love this is Silicon Valley, man, right, right there.  When they first started the company, they did all that research.  What makes a great razor blade? Where do you get the best razor blades?  They found out really it's only two factories in Germany that make these blades.  They bought one of them and they and they said engineer these for sharpness, for performance.  They're shipped for free right to your door.  And because they make and ship the blades, they save so much money they could pass the savings right onto you.  Basically getting razor blades factory direct and your satisfaction is guaranteed.  Start with a Harry's kit.  They've got the new Jimmy Chin limited edition razors that are so cool looking.  They also have the Truman, the Winston's.  I have I use Winston.  They're nice metal handles with engraving and so forth.  But this is Truman said is a really amazing deal.  $15 and for $15 you get as you do with all the kids, the razor with a handle that looks and feels great.  Three blades, the foaming shave gel.  And I they never mentioned this in the ads, but I always add it.  My favorite part of the Harry's kit, that thing you know, you know, I'm talking about it's the travel.  The holder do hickey.  At first I thought I was just like, oh, I threw this away.  But then I realized, no, you put the razor in it and it and it put.  Then you put in your docket.  You don't get cut.  It dries out.  It's really awesome.  Harry's is the best.  I love Harry's.  This is a nice Truman set.  There's the blade.  You put it right in here when you travel and never again will you get cut.  But your blade will always be protected and never nicked.  So it never nicks your face.  Twenty five dollars for the Winston set.  But I've got to I'm going to sweeten this this deal for you because when you visit Harry's and use the offer code twig, your first purchase.  Five dollars off.  H.A.R.R.Y.S. dot com or offer code T.W.I.G.  Now we're talking ten dollars for the Truman set.  Now we're talking.  Don't forget to try Harry's really nice aftershave too.  That's that's something new.  And the aftershave moisturizer and the and the lip balm.  Harry's you need it this winter.  Harry's H.A.R.R.Y.S. dot com is the offer code twig.

You've been collecting them no doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yes indeed.  In fact I had I had the I had the bad luck of having to Google stomach flu recently because you know two year old daycare.  And it turns out that Google is adding health related information into the knowledge graph.  So if you take your you take your phone for example and search for tonsillitis or laryngitis or gastroenteritis or whatever.  And it is the season to get sick.  You'll get a card with a bunch of a bunch of information about the about the about the condition how contagious it is whether it's self treatable or self diagnosable with the ages effect ages affected.  I mean this is exactly what we're talking about earlier that Google's trying to give you the answers right there.  You know that they're an answer service right there not a web search as much anymore.  That's great.  But yeah really really nice way to to quickly for those of us who like to self diagnose by searching by scaring the heck out of yourself by searching for symptoms and for for illnesses.  Google's there to help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've noticed my doctor tells me less now that he just assumes I'm going to Google it.  Yeah.  Do you ask that like they don't have to give us all the education they used to spend a lot of time and I was very bored where they would say well let me explain what this all mean.  Now they say hey you can Google it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's fine.  Yeah it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's true.  I don't mind that as long as you go to like somewhere reliable or use now Google's knowledge graph because they have actual physicians reviewing it and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which I think is great.  And I think it's important.  I think it's the right thing to do.  However you know it's going to be controversial.  Web MD Web MD stock went down.  Oh because Google's competing with Web MD.  The argument is going to be oh Google's trying to do this because they're trying to get they're trying to avoid us seeing irresponsible information.  I think it's the right thing to do.  But it's Google entering farther into content.  Yeah.  I don't I don't know that there's any ads associated with it.  It's kind of a knowledge graph.  I think you do.  It is.  I agree with all that.  But but Mark my words somebody with a German accent is going to complain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's blog post is about about this is one in 20 Google searches is for health related information.  So we're all looking for information about why we feel a certain way or our kids or that's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis your number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So just a minor minor little thing here.  Where do I go with it.  A Scottish researcher named Ronald McDonald insert laugh track here.  Ronald McDonald.  It's all the better.  It says that now I've lost the screen.  You can predict elections based on Google searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can predict elections based on results based on the first time we've heard this right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No but I think it's I think it starts to get interesting to me.  Plus I didn't have any other numbers.  So you know like like standards this week.  But I thought it interesting that that that you know TV gets accused of having an impact on elections because you were not supposed to reveal the polls before they're closed.  But basically one way or the other between five thirty six as recline and Google search and all these tools now.  We're going to get better and better and better I think at polling to an extent that says that you don't people.  The question is will people stop going to the vote.  Because Google already told them who's going to win.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazing.  This makes sense because the only reason that information works is because people are Googling the candidate or the measure.  Right.  So if people stopped getting involved then it would stop working.  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I didn't say it was my best number.  What was the number.  I there's there's no there's no number.  I got a number.  You want a number.  Nine hundred ninety eight.  Ask me what that number has to do with how much you're going to end up spending the thousands of dollars on your website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Oh God.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ouch.  Ouch.  No we're going to get.  Wait till you see the new website.  And you tell me then if it was worth a quarter of a million.  How much does it cost.  How much.  See it's my fault because we went to a really big great firm that does sites for big companies.  And and you know and of course as soon as I told people this everybody and their brother who watches the show said well I could do it for you for fifteen dollars and ninety three cents and stuff like that.  We're going to wait.  You tell me I think you're going to see every dollar on the screen.  We'll see.  But I mean you'll see because the tricky thing that we're doing and I think it's kind of expensive we're doing an API just and then the website calls the API.  It's just one of many consumers.  I really feel like we need to get past the notion of a web page especially for podcasts.  Oh there you go.  Yes you do.  Yeah.  Yes we will have a beta test and actually we're going to have it sooner than we thought.  So stay tuned.  We will be looking for beta testers.  My number nine hundred ninety eight though doesn't apply to that.  It applies to the number of Chrome experiments.  So we the newest we just played with which is the the I.O. 2015 experiment.  But I realized we've probably talked about this before.  But if you are using a WebGL capable browser preferably Chrome that there is a place where you can go Chrome experiments dot com where you can see all of the experiments collected into one place.  It is a Google page.  So these are all approved experiments.  You don't have to worry about you know the harm that these could cause.  They actually do a nice job.  They show you the website it's from.  They show you QR code that you could use.  So if you're on a phone you don't have to enter in any URLs.  If you're on your browser though you can you can try these.  Here's one.  Pop the bubble release the fish.  This is called traveling fish.  It's loading very slowly.  But there's quite a few.  These are that's probably because it's a featured WebGL attractors trip.  Everybody.  This site is proving me wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was saying that no one but Google makes these things.  Nine hundred ninety eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nine hundred ninety eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at the Helvetica clock too.  Oh this is fun though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to I'm going to go home take some shrooms.  Let me let me what is it the Helvetica.  Helvetica clock.  Helvetica clock.  All right.  Whoa dude.  Helvetica clock.  Two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  I'm guessing the sequel is comic sans clock.  Yeah wouldn't that be funny.  Here you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Helvetica clock.  Two.  Oh wow.  That's pretty.  So there's a 3D render of the digits and each new time crashes into the previous time.  That's hysterical.  So that's showing WebGL because it's showing the physics engine as well as the 3D rendering engine because you have to predict how these things fall in real physics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And unfortunately doesn't look at all like the time because there are no colons and it's 24 hour clock.  But yeah once you know it's 152 and 7152 and yeah.  Yeah.  It's 320 right 1520 is.  Oh sorry.  Yes.  What time is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay now I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is kind of that is kind of I could stare at that forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.  Mesmerizing.  There's lots of these quite a few of these.  So if you were kind of intrigued by the Google I.O. thing.  Oh you ain't seen nothing yet.  Here's some volumetric particle flow.  Enjoy.  I want to thank you for you can change the particle count the speed the turbulence the color.  Wow.  I don't know what this is good for but let's increase the number of particles.  Oh how about a million particles.  I am animating two million particles right now.  Yeah it looks like it might be.  And your browser is a.  I don't want to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Definitely in the millions right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's a lot of calculations.  That really is.  Wow.  That's pretty impressive actually that it could animate two million particles like that and the shadow.  Wow.  Yeah.  This is actually a good way to test your computer.  See where it see where it shows.  Yeah.  Wow.  This is this is a great speed.  This is a good benchmark.  And what's nice is the the the code for this is actually visible on the site so you can  see how he did it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Turn the color wheel.  Well never mind.  It's a it's a kid hub.  Oh nice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

It's in testing right now internally.  And so, yeah, really, really excited about that.  Yeah, so if you design an insight using this, this kind of editor, you can write the headline  of the body and show us an avatar.  And then there's a button at the bottom that says file a ticket.  It will automatically create a new GitHub issue.  You can save it and we'll see it.  You can kind of propose it for development.  So a lot of fun.

There'll be a lot more photos, a lot more visual.  Instagram really doesn't have a whole lot of analytics available to it,  unlike Twitter and to some extent Facebook.  So it'll be fun to add that to the product.  Yeah, so there.
