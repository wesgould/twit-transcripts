Transcript:  Our top story this week, it's hard to choose a top story.  There was a lot of big stories, but this one I thought was important.  And we'll talk about it on Sunday because Zabrianna Wu, who has been horribly stalked  in her life, will be one of the panelists on this week in tech.  Supreme Court this week decided seven to two to protect stalkers if they don't know that  their threats are deadly.  This is a weird case, the case, Counterman versus Colorado, a guy named Billy Raymond  Counterman.  He was convicted under a Colorado anti-stalking law because he sent a ream of threatening  Facebook messages to a woman he'd never met.  The Colorado law did not require the court to consider his mental state when he sent  the messages.  It only had to consider his behavior and how the recipient would feel threatened.  Which seems to make sense.  Yeah.  But.  Whether he repeatedly, according to the law, repeatedly contacted, followed or surveilled  his target in a way that would cause a reasonable person distress.  He was of course found guilty because she was highly distressed.  And by the way, I've been harassed.  Anybody in the public eye has had this happen.  I've had it happen for 40 years.  I once had a young woman praying for me on my stoop of my house, following me to grocery  stores and commenting on my food and things.  And I didn't blame her.  She was obviously mentally ill.  Had she been, had she brought a knife.  Different story.  I would have been felt threatened.  Now here's the thing.  The Supreme Court said that if counterman didn't have any awareness of his threatening,  of the threatening character of his statements, it would not be a problem.  And in fact, any restriction on his speech would be a violation of his First Amendment  rights.  The majority of the opinion written by Justice Elena Kagan said the state prosecuted him  in accordance with an objective standard that didn't show any awareness or did not have  to show any awareness on his part of statements threatening character.  That's a violation of the First Amendment.

Start time: 564.34

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But Barrett in the dissent did say that someone who's delusional can be dangerous.  Yeah.

Start time: 573.52
End time: 615.19
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And by the way, both Amy Coney Barrett and Clarence Thomas have probably had harassers  and people attacking them.  I know they have in restaurants and so forth.  If it's a threat, it's always been in the case of the law that if somebody tweets at  us something of bodily harm, that that's considered a threat and prosecutable.  And I think it should be.  This sounds like if you're crazy enough not to know that that's a threat, oh, you're  all right then.  I think about...  Let Stacey go first because I interrupted her.  Go ahead.

Start time: 615.84
End time: 658.19
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, there's a couple things.  One is I know that with protesters outside of an abortion clinic, a lot of times they  will justify their protests and getting very close in your face and screaming at you as  a First Amendment right.  But legally, they're harassing you and it does count as harassment.  So I'm really struggling with this because it's terrifying being on the other end of  any of this.  And it's not a First Amendment right.  I mean, we talk about yelling fire in a crowded theater.  And so I really don't understand the legal distinction being made here.  So I'm trying to figure that out a little bit more.

Start time: 659.30
End time: 708.30
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, Jeff Kosef would say that the fire in the theater thing is actually a misnomer,  but we'll leave it to the side.  Probably.  Yes.  Yes.  So I'm very torn on Stacey because I'm a big believer in the First Amendment freedom of  expression.  I think we head to a doctrine, not just in the court now, but also with Elon Musk and  company, is this belief that free speech means there is no consequence to speech.  I have free speech.  But if I libel you, if I cause damage, if I incite violence, there are consequences.  Or simply, if you think I'm a jerk and say so or disagree with me, that's a consequence.  But we move to consequence less speech.  And I'm not sure that's first.  I agree with you, Stacey, because I'm not sure that's First Amendment really.

Transcript:  Is this put in place for autistic?

Start time: 713.43
End time: 750.49
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, that's the point.  Here's what a professor at George Washington University said in their amicus brief.  A delusional speaker may lack awareness of the threatening nature of her speech.  A devious speaker may strategically disclaim such awareness.  Right.  I don't know.  That's a common strategy of the right.  I'm not.  I didn't mean I get this a lot.  Oh, I didn't mean harm.  You know, you misinterpreted.  I'm just speaking.

Start time: 751.20
End time: 761.84
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I was just pointing out that this is where your house is and that you don't exactly lock  your door at night.  And there is an unlatched gate and you have a dog that might eat.  I'm not advocating violence.

Start time: 761.88
End time: 826.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm just saying, you know, I think you're exactly right, Stacey.  That's exactly how it's used.  The EFF and the ACLU both sided with countermen and thought that, you know, free speech rights  were abridged.  I think this is insane because, you know, the reason you and I, Stacey, know about this  is we've been harassed and we've had these oblique threats, which, you know, I think  don't rise to the test of countermen.  And so they would be allowed as free speech.  You absolutely have the right to say, Leo is a complete jerk.  You have the right to say that.  And I would never disagree.  But if you said, by the way, Leo lives, you might disagree with that statement.  I don't even disagree with it.  If you say where I live and the door is unlocked, that's an hour.  That's a threatless threat.  And it's not nice.  And it should be absolutely.  You should be liable.  There should be, just as you said, Jeff, consequences for what you say.  I understand the issue, which is that you have the right to free speech.

Start time: 828.39
End time: 844.71
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  And well, in Jeff, with the consequences, we're talking about two kind of different  things, right?  Free speech is, you can have consequences, but you can't have free speech consequences  from the government.  The government can't.  So but in this case, well, the government's prosecuting.

Start time: 846.86
End time: 848.71
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that's why the government's prosecuting this guy.

Start time: 850.41
End time: 884.84
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  But I'm also like, this guy is.  Yeah, but I don't.  Yeah, like it's not easy if someone's well, it is someone's mentally ill and delusional.  I feel like you can take a case all the way through, prosecute them and say, I mean,  if their defense is indeed, I didn't know I was like genuinely.  I didn't realize I was threatening this person.  I feel like that's in sentencing that can come through.  But to strip the ability to prosecute someone for that and to have real consequences for  that as terrifying as I agree.

Start time: 884.88
End time: 898.76
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, ACLU and EFF argued that if anyone can be found guilty of making a threat based  on how the threat is received, there's not how it was intended.  But it's a reasonable person standard.

Start time: 899.04
End time: 901.84
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  It's not like just like you hurt my feelings.

Start time: 901.84
End time: 902.02
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 906.09
End time: 913.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just this, you know, this was the concern that Barrett, justices Barrett and Thomas  had, which is that it opens the door to all sorts of harassment.

Start time: 914.72
End time: 917.56
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I wonder where Kathy Gellis and Mike Pasna came out on it.

Start time: 919.23
End time: 949.80
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.  I should look and see.  I haven't looked at it.  I look at tech dirt and see what tech dirt has to say.  But it's a class in any event.  This is it.  And it was seven.  It wasn't a it wasn't close.  It was 72.  He, you know, counterman is now off the hook.  And so I think this opens the door in a social media era for all kinds of harassment.  I mean, the harassers are smart.  They know not to make a threat of, you know, and that's always been the case.  There are smart harassers.

Start time: 949.84
End time: 965.04
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  And then those are the ones that are truly terrifying.  Yes.  In all honesty, the smartest harassers probably don't actually want to physically harm you  because they're too smart and they recognize the consequence.  What they want to do is make your life absolutely miserable.  They know how to get to the edge, if you will.  Yeah.

Start time: 967.91
End time: 971.68
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Anyway, just you know, the Supreme Court has been very interesting.  This is a full surprise.

Start time: 972.92
End time: 983.43
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think I was saying with the with the with the voting decision this week,  I think that the public pressure on the court has an impact.  I think I'm trying to prove no, no, we're OK.  We're all right.

Start time: 983.86
End time: 993.21
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're all right.  Well, a number of people pointed out, though, that the way that decision went down  could open the door to other problem.  Voting rights.  Yes.

Start time: 993.84
End time: 998.06
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Issues.  Yes.  Yeah, it opened a portal to a bad doctrine.  Right.

Start time: 999.50
End time: 1001.84
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham

End time: 1059.43
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm like, oh, Google, Google won in the Supreme Court this week.  It well, one in a way, the court rejected a lawsuit.  Do you remember this?  There was a site called Rap Genius later, just genius.  That was a great place to go to get the lyrics to a song.  And they did a clever thing in the lyrics.  They stuck some some hidden secrets in there.  And they found that Google was actually just lifting the lyrics from genius  and putting them in the Google search results.  So the genius media group sued Alphabet saying you stole millions of song lyrics.  They they lost in court because it turns out genius didn't own the rights to any.  That's exactly what I said at the time.

Start time: 1061.92
End time: 1062.45
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's not old.

Start time: 1062.84
End time: 1063.68
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  That's that's the old news.

Start time: 1063.86
End time: 1122.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So genius wasn't saying we have the copyright.  They said Google violated our contract by scraping lyrics and boosting them in Google search without attribution,  which caused millions of dollars in losses for the website.  This lawsuit has been going on for four years.  Yeah, well, well, this is the I think really that's the issue is these lyrics are floating around.  Right. The copyright holder is a songwriter, the publisher.  Right. Not genius, not Google.  If that information is in the air, does it matter where Google gets it from?  Now, this is kind of goes back to link text because Google is eliminating a click to genius to get that lyric by quoting the lyric on the search results.  You don't have to go to genius anymore.  And that's really what this came down to.  A lower court had ruled in favor of Google.  The justices did not revive the lawsuit.  They didn't give cert to to the appeal.  So it's over for that.  Google's off the hook.  But it's an it's an interesting.

Start time: 1123.34
End time: 1138.76
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I feel like if you're on the Internet today, if your core competency is just being a middleman.  Yeah, that is not that that is never going to be a tenable business model.  You were like the dropshipper of.  I don't think so.  I think newspapers can create real value.  They can.

Start time: 1139.38
End time: 1149.64
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But their past has been as middlemen when it comes to advertising and to news.  Right. We run the AP.  You have to come to us to sell your car.  You don't need to do either with us anymore.

Start time: 1150.28
End time: 1177.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I should point out as often the case with these kind of stories, there is a deeper, subtler legal issue at stake here than the obvious one.  Genius was suing of her contractual matter, saying, well, you know, our terms of service say Google can't scrape the site and put the results up.  In fact, they say now the Supreme Court has opened the door to people, you know, ignoring contractual.

Start time: 1179.00
End time: 1184.84
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  That would be amazing, actually.  Yeah, that's like, oh, I just clicked through or got help.  You didn't actually even click through.

Start time: 1184.84
End time: 1189.30
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. So the agreeing to that to to large language models.

Start time: 1190.06
End time: 1244.82
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, before you do that, because that's a whole nother cutthroat.  Yeah.  Talking about a sidebar.  But before you do that, let's just I just want to point out that federal law.  This is a subtlety.  Right. Federal law preempts lawsuits over issues that are similar to copyright.  So Google was saying this genius is bringing a quasi copyright claim.  It's not really about the terms of contract.  They're kind of saying, hey, we we kind of own the rights to these.  And and I think that the the court and the lower court were basically saying no, no, the law says very specifically you can't kind of infer some sort of protection because it's like copyright.  And that's why that's why they lost.  So, yeah.  Wow.  By the way, the White House wanted wanted the court to skip the case, saying it was a poor vehicle to resolve the tension between copyright law and contractual rights.

Start time: 1246.49
End time: 1250.46

So but I think it's really more commentary on because it wasn't the first time we've tried a photography broadcast.  Catherine Hall and I did this week in photography also failed because I just think I don't know what it is.  Is it your audience?  It's our audience.  It's there are other photography shows.  Yeah.  Kelby does a bunch of them that maybe maybe they're doing better.  I don't know. I just don't know.  But for some reason, we didn't attract an audience.  So and the same thing, I think Android.  I hate to say it on this week in Google, but I don't think I think Android, which is still the number one smartphone platform.  But phones in general are just aren't that interesting anymore.

Michelle, all these people are great.  They had a great rapport, but they just was a dwindling audience.  And I think it's just lack of interest in the subject matter.  I don't think it has reflection on them.  So I didn't buy that way.

Transcript:  So, you know, it's going to very much be a part of the network going forward, especially in our club and here on Twitter.  Jason and Jeff are working on a show, which means much needs to be done.  And the good news is because we have the club.  Thank God we have the club.  Thank you.  The club can subsidize an A.I. show, even though there's, you know, as any show, when it starts, there's a small audience and no advertising.  So this is going to be a club only exclusive for the time being.  And we're hoping to launch it soon.  But Jason spent 90 minutes yesterday in the in the discord talking to people about ideas.  But one of the ideas I thought was kind of interesting, and I've been asking all our hosts this and Stacey, please recuse yourself if you want.  I'm ready.  It's been my contention from the beginning that A.I. is very poorly named.  It's nothing intelligent about chat, GPT or stable diffusion.  All of these are computer programs that the distinction between these computer programs and traditional computer programs.  You know, I've written a lot of computer software.  You tell the traditional programs, you tell the computer exactly what to do.  If this happens, do this. If this happens, do this.  Yeah. And computers are really good at doing they only do.  And it's only by the way, even today, a norm, a computer can add subtracts do division and multiplication in some cases can move stuff around and can make decisions based on a condition.  And it does all of that in concert so quickly that it looks like it's thinking or at least word processing or doing spreadsheet or playing a video game because it's very, very fast.  A.I. is a little different.  And you I know you're an expert on this, Stacey, because they've started using data and training models using generative adversarial networks or large language models or neural networks, a variety of different well known techniques.  And the difference is that instead of a human writing all the rules, the computer can generate its own rules.  So AlphaGo is a good example, which is a Google's DeepMind program that learned to play Go by playing a lot of games.  They told it the rules of Go, which are very simple.  And then it played a billion games in four hours and actually taught itself to be better.  That's pretty awesome.  Because it was doing endless A, B tests.  Yeah, that's pretty awesome.  But it generated in effect generated the same kind of thing that a human would write just a lot more of it a lot faster.  And so it created a rule set.  In my opinion, those things are deterministic computer programs, regardless of how it was created, that don't approximate thinking in any way.  They just are fast.  So it looks like it's writing.  It's regurgitating.  But it's regurgitating.  Well, wait.

Transcript:  So you're not wrong here, except we're talking about intelligence.  And I don't think you're talking about two things.  We're talking about intelligence.  And then you're talking about thinking.  And I would definitely agree that a computer isn't thinking.  But I would say if you think of intelligence and you define it as being able to develop a system or a way to react and adapt to your environment.  Well, that's a good point.  I would say that that AI is perfectly named because what a computer is doing is you're giving it a set of parameters and it's adapting and it's teaching itself basically how to write its own code.  You're absolutely right.

Start time: 1688.86
End time: 1705.55
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're absolutely right.  In fact, I'm looking at the definition of intelligence from Oxford.  It says the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills.  That's pretty simple.  And you're right.  That's exactly what AI does.  But wait till he gets the next step.  But is it thinking?  There we go.

Start time: 1738.15
End time: 1751.65
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think it is not thinking in the way that we think.  I do think it has developed an intelligence in the same way your dog has developed an intelligence.  Well, I think a dog thinks.  Allows it to react to.

It's not our fault.  It's the machines.  In point of fact, every malign use of AI face recognition or is really just some human composed algorithm doing something that maximizes profit or control at the expense of people.  I say don't let these companies off the hook.  They're in charge, not the machine.  Pay attention to the man behind the curtain.  It doesn't have to be at the expense of people.

End time: 2006.82
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So I think there's a couple of things here.  I think that people should be aware that AI and these algorithms are only as good as their training and they are fallible.  I think that's really important for everyone to realize.  I also think there is a link between the marketing done by tech firms and the people, the end consumer who don't have knowledge of this and the tech firms are being quite disinterested in this.  And I do think there's probably a case to be made for them being liable for their marketing.  And then once they have assessed an algorithm and know it's bad to so like that lawyer in his case, because he's a professional deploying and using the algorithm, he does have some liability here.  I would argue that whatever legal algorithm he used also has some liability because they're making claims.  Liability is probably too strong.  Responsibility.  Responsibility.  I argue this in my piece that when you just put a box there that makes it look like Google, you think you're going to get Google like results back and Microsoft associated with their search engine is being irresponsible in giving that impression.

Start time: 2006.86
End time: 2019.18
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I mean, I.  Yeah, I think it's not germane to the issues that we're facing.  Exactly.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's a fun philosophical argument.  And if I were like drinking and we were on a patio and it was late at night, we could have discussions.  Why does everybody every time I bring this up talk about that?

Start time: 2094.58
End time: 2117.66
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a philosophical argument.  But it is.  But from a practical point of view, I guess what I want to kind of emphasize is we don't want to get in the hype cycle with AI either.  Right.  And I think part of the hype cycle is the scientists writing letters saying it's a threat to the human species.  It's an extinction.  It goes both ways.  I think that's hype.  That's like saying.  That's just marketing.

Start time: 2118.23
End time: 2127.84
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  That's like.  It goes both ways.  It helps them wash their hands of it, too.  I mean, that was my point.  There needs to be more middle ground on all of this.

Start time: 2139.33
End time: 2186.70
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, but it also it does have larger implications.  And I've said this on the show recently, as I've dug into the rat hole that is long termism that drives Sam Altman and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and company.  And they argue that they're going to we're going to reach artificial general intelligence or super intelligence and that the machine will be basically as much as a human better in some ways.  And that we can build countless 10 to the 58th made up humans on computers on Mars.  They go, why?  Why does Elon Musk want to put things in your head and go to Mars and have a lot of babies?  And so we owe to the future.  But we can forget about the present.  That's no big deal.  This is also a great curse.

Start time: 2187.79
End time: 2226.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is also a great curse.  Well, said the singularity is near.  And this is if you believe that the singularity being the point in time in which you can no longer distinguish a human and a machine intelligence.  And if you believe that, then, of course, once machines get that smart, they will start designing better and better and better machines at an exponential rate.  And yet maybe that is an extinction event.  So the reason I bring that's why I bring this up is I don't think we know what makes a human and what makes consciousness.  And I think it's a lot to say that we're, you know, we're approaching a GI.  Is that Stacy?  Does that is that right?  I mean, you you.

And I think it's a problem that is oblivious to like it's easy to think about this because the current work to fix things here and now is really hard.  So if you can keep building better toys or come up with like some cool philosophy that lets you kick the can down the road without actually acknowledging that you're kicking the can down the road, then I agree.

And the problem and it also includes.  OK, Stacey's going to hop up on a little soapbox for a second.  Go ahead.  This includes the real issue, which is everybody here wants to use AI for optimization for  their own end goals, which I'm sorry, capitalistic society is making as much money as possible.  You're building these machines to optimize for this in a way and to hide all these other  issues.  But really, if we built these algorithms to take into account and optimize for maybe not  producing as much carbon, but throwing as much carbon into the air, then we would have  different algorithms that would not make us as much money.  And we would all as a society hate that because that's antithetical to how we are kind of

Start time: 2392.84
End time: 2427.27
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  that's well, but I think that's I mean, that's a real issue here, because that's a lot of  the marketing hype around this stuff is like, oh, we're going to solve all these issues  that are actually caused by a lot of the late stage capitalism, like the not accounting  for externalities that matter.  And so then they're like, oh, shoot, they might see it.  Let's talk about it ending the world and this being a threat that way.  But really, we just have to make a we have to make a collective decision to care about  something that's not money.  And we can use this technology in ways that would really actually be quite helpful.  And we might not be having these discussions about it.  I like it.

And and malign uses.  But there are good uses and trying to figure out what that and concentrate on that.  And then you're right, Stacey.  This is what the Stochastic Parents paper says is also pay attention to the environmental  cost, pay attention to the human cost of people who are training your models for you and looking  at horrible stuff.  Pay attention to the bias in in what you bring in.  Pay attention to trying to get ever bigger measurement and losing sight of the ability  to manage what you have.

You did very well.  Well, and unfortunately, it often goes right to that thing of and Steve Gibson's position  was, oh, you know, it's just a matter of calculation, calculating speed, RAM and, you  know, just add as it gets faster.

We have a great sponsor, the AWS insiders podcast, a fun, fast paced, entertaining,  insightful look behind the scenes of AWS and cloud computing.  Now, this is not your typical talking heads tech podcast.  High production value, high energy, unlike us, and high entertainment, full of captivating  stories from the early days of AWS to today and beyond the hosts.  Rahul Subramaniam and Hilary Doyle dig into the current state and the future of AWS by  talking with the people and companies that know it best.  Rahul is very funny, but he's also a veteran AWS pro with over 15 years experience managing  more than 45,000 AWS instances.  He is known for pushing AWS products to their limits and for believing AWS is truly the  operating system of the future.  AWS insiders is a show that's full of opinions, takeaways and untold stories about the challenges,  innovations and the mind blowing promise of cloud computing.  Take a look at this.  The brand new season just came out, season two, episode one, filling the cloud talent  gap and talk about staffing and optimizing your cloud team, how it's a critical step  right now.  Also possibly one of the most difficult.  Rahul, Hilary and their guests discuss solutions to finding, retaining and leveling up cloud  talent.  I was really interested in episode three.  It's all about Moderna, the mRNA vaccines and AWS.  Did you know that?  Rahul, Hilary and Moderna's director of data engineering and cloud architecture.  I, this was a revelation to me, discuss how Moderna depends on AWS and the cloud.  Search for AWS insiders in your podcast player or visit cloudfix.orea.com slash podcast.  That's cloudfix.aurea.com slash podcast.  We'll also include a link in the show notes and my thanks to AWS insiders for their support.  And now we have no bumper music.  We have no trumpets.

Are you surprised that people would then use AI to generate a bunch of junk?  Nonsense.  Let's talk about China.  Because this is one of the things I mentioned to Jason.  And we're talking about AI.  It's behind this now, the new Iron Curtain.  But you've got to think the Chinese government is working hard on AI.  This is a story from Bloomberg.  Billionaires and bureaucrats mobilized China for AI race with the US.  Now their position is...  Yes, of course the Chinese tech sector is very interested in AI.  But they're somewhat behind.  Nevertheless, there's a considerable amount of investment.  I'm not so much worried about private industry as the Chinese government using AI.  I have to think they've got some stuff going on.

Transcript:  It's not clear from the article.  The article says the aggregate size of US deals and AI outpaces China's.  They're 26 billion in investments in 2023 for the US, just 4 billion for China.  But that seems to be talking about private industry.  And I have to think that we have no idea how much effort the Chinese government is putting into AI.  We have a lot of anecdotal evidence that they care a lot about it, don't they?  They probably care.

Start time: 3014.86
End time: 3030.18
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  They probably care.  But again, I think we're just being a little bit narcissistic in assuming that they care enough about AI to use it against us, where they probably just care enough about AI to do something for their own good.

And then also idealizing a hyped technology, in this case, AI.  I mean, we could equally throw in like material science and have something really to worry about because that's how you get like weird nerve gases and new bombs and all kinds of crazy stuff.

Start time: 3064.32
End time: 3080.78
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this article does say an interesting thing that one of the reasons private investment in AI in China is slow is because the Chinese government has lots of restrictions on what private industry can do with AI.  They would like a monopoly, I would imagine, of AI in the government.

Transcript:  It's also relevant to the US's policy towards AI.  US is considering new curbs on AI chip exports to China.  There's some serious concern that Chinese might be using AI for weapon development, for hacking, using it against us.

I mean, the benefits of globalization have been pretty clear.  And I think it leads to less conflict over time because we're all like, oh, well, this benefits me.  So I'll ignore that.  And so the way we're going about with this is scary, personally, to me.  I don't know. I just. Yeah.  We're not heading in the right direction. I'm like, oh, it's very depressing.

It's capable.  Gemini is a large language model that works with text like chat GPT-4.  But Hassabi says his team will combine that technology with techniques used in AlphaGo  aiming to give the system new capabilities such as planning or the ability to solve problems.  Yeah, he's not very specific, but of course it would be over my head if he was.

Start time: 3503.90
End time: 3528.53
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is from Wired.  It was based on a technique DeepMind is pioneering called reinforcement learning.  Which software learns to take on tough problems that require choosing what actions to take as in Go by making repeated attempts and getting feedback.  So as I said, the way AlphaGo learned to play chess and then later Go was by playing a lot of games.  Did it win? No.  All right.  These things are prediction machines now.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  It's trying to understand its environment and what went wrong when it takes an action.  So it's not actually predicting.  It's taking an action.  It's going down that stream like in playing a video game or using synthetic data.  And then it's getting feedback that says, oh, like in a game, the game is probably the best.  Like, oh, if I keep doing this, I die quickly.  If my goal is to stay alive, then I'm going to do this X, Y thing.

Start time: 3596.72
End time: 3626.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You could argue that that is the whole reason open a I put out chat GPT because it gets reinforcement from human users.  Right. That was the whole point is to get the effect.  They even ask for feedback.  How do we do? How was that answer?  Was that what you wanted? Right.  And that that's the that is the the reinforcement learning part of of chat GPT.  But maybe Gemini will have some more efficient is for the large language model for chat GPT.

Transcript:  So, Stacy, going back to your we're going to get back to consciousness.  Watch out. So I mentioned this book a few years ago called How History Gets Things Wrong by Alexander Rosenberg.  And what he what he says to your point is that the theory of mind is false.  In fact, we don't come to things by having a desire and knowledge and then make a decision.  Instead, we are doing just what you're saying.  We are replaying games, video of life over and over and over again.  And we choose, OK, I'll go down that path.  Now, if you're an addict, you're going to go down the wrong path because it's the path that's well grooved.  If you're, you know, trained and go, then you go to the same thing.  So in a way, what you're saying is that the computer's brain in that sense to add to more positive does operate, according to Rosenberg, like our brain.  And in the end, it's all about survival of the fittest.  And you don't know why the decision works.  Why does it make you live longer than the next guy?  But if it does, you win. You go on.  There's more of the same.

Transcript:  Right.  We are a big computer, but we've done it because it's survival.  Not any of the fittest or of the.  That's a it's really interesting.  That to me was the most.  My father's an evolutionist.  That's what he teaches.  I taught Darwin courses for years.  He's a paleo marine paleo ecologist.  But one of the great.  So I should have known this my whole life.  But one of the great revelations for me later in life was this notion.  It comes from this Richard Dawkins, the self and selfish gene that really.  You know.  And.  The universe tends towards entropy towards disorganization.  Right.  Except with us, we are heading towards organization.  How does that happen?  How does that happen?  How does it?  We get more organized when in fact entropy is what is a driving force.  In the universe.  And it is the desire of a gene to reproduce and to succeed.  That that forces this organization.  It's kind of an amazing thing.  If you imagine.  All you needed to create at one point was one thing.  That was capable of reproducing itself.  That's all you needed.  Let's say you had two molecules and they somehow figured out how to make another.  Of the same.  That's all you need to trigger this whole thing.  Because then what happens is the molecules that are better at doing that.  Outpace the ones that are worse at it and they become better and then became better.  And suddenly you have instead of entropy, you have an organizational arrow.  You move in the direction of organization.  John, you disagree with this?  You're shaking your head.  Huh?  But Earth is a closed system.

Or really just really the drive to reproduce.  And reproducers succeed.  And as they succeed the more they succeed the more of them there are.  And on and on and on.  And you get this bigger and bigger organization.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  Anyway, Warner Brothers has just signed a deal for AI driven film management.  We'll just cut that part out.

And I love the Hollywood reporters lead on this.  Resistance is futile.  Warner Brothers has become the latest studio to publicly embrace artificial intelligence.  But this is a perfect example of kind of link bait.  I hate the headline.

The integrated online platform can assess the value of a star, you know, an actor in any territory, how much a film is expected to make in theaters or on other ancillary streams.  It becomes formulaic.  We've always done this imperfectly.  We've always tried to do this.  Humans are imperfect.  Sometimes a good movie sneaks through.

I mean, AI can only build on what has historically been successful in the data it has.  And you even see this with hit pop songs.  Yes, there will be millions of also hit pop songs.  And then there will be the random new success that will then drive changes to that.

Transcript:  Right.  So the idea is instead of executives spending time trying to figure out what a star is worth and what a market can deliver, the machine will do it.  In fact, the founder Tobias Kweiser says artificial intelligence sounds scary, but right now an AI cannot make any creative decisions.  What it's good at is crunching numbers, breaking down huge data sets and showing patterns that would not be visible to humans.  But creative decision making, he says, you still need experience and gut instinct.

Transcript:  Very famous chess family, the Polgar family, the the head of the family who wasn't a great chess player himself, the father decided that the best way to become a great chess player would be  see as many positions as possible.  Laszlo Polgar.  So as part of an educational experiment, he wanted to prove that children could make exceptional achievements if trained in a specialist subject from an early age.  He taught his three dollars, three daughters.  He taught his three daughters how to play chess.  He homeschooled him.  This is in Hungary.  They also taught him Esperanto, which didn't work out so well.  But he taught him chess.  And in fact, the all three daughters became chess grandmasters.  And one of them, Judith Polgar, is the woman's world was the woman's world champion.  Nice.  And it wasn't based on some sort of child, you know, ability, job and ability.  It was based on. Yes.  It was reps and what and it was reps.  And it was, in fact, Polgar put out a very thick book, which I have, that's just thousands of chess positions.  And you look at it and say the move here is this.  The more you play, the more you look at these positions, the more you absorb, the better your pattern recognition, the better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, but what's interesting is in chess, at least it's the only thing I know anything about.  Humans aren't capable of the kind of calculations a machine is.  So a machine can, in fact, calculate 20, 30, 40 moves ahead.  Yeah.  And it does have to at some point assess a position, but it can do much more calculations.  So humans actually have to do more pattern recognition than machine because we can't calculate.  So we have to after four or five moves go, well, that look, that's the right that's that pattern.  I recognize I want that.  And that's not quite as good, unfortunately, as a machine can do.  Machines now beat all the best human players.  Math, math, math.  You know, frankly, you could have a program on your phone now that beats the best human players, which is mind boggling.  So we still do play chess.  Yeah, I love chess.  Yeah, I bet you played it.  I was I was much better as a young man.  But but the more I play, the better I get.  And the more positions I look at, the better I am.  It's very much about pattern recognition for humans.  Not I think a little less so for machines, actually.  They're able to calculate a lot better.  And that's our A.I. thing.  Oh, that was exhausting.

Each state will receive a minimum of $107 million.  Nineteen states over a billion. Texas, $3.3 billion under the program.  That's amazing. Just so they can censor it.  I know. More than 7% of the country, more than 8.5 million homes and small businesses are underserved.  The government standard is, and it's a pretty low standard, 25 megabits download per second.

Not devices, because that I'd really be, but I have gigabit at home and that serves us.  We got that during COVID when Lisa was zooming, I was zooming, Michael was going to school via zoom.  We needed a gigabit and we hardwired all the workstations and all that stuff.  Anyway, a lot of people don't have that, obviously.  And I think given that it's going to be government subsidy, it's reasonable to say, look, 25 megabits per second for downloads, three megabits for uploads.  Yes, that's that should be higher, but it's it's a good minimum anyway.

Transcript:  And this is this is the sad thing about this.  And of course, you know that the big telecom companies are very active in their lobbying.  And while a lot of this, I think should go to rural, you know, ISPs and municipalities.  The Comcast and Cox's and AT&T's of the world are lobbying like hell.  And I think they're getting the lion's share of this money, sad to say.  Pretty sure of it.

Start time: 4662.58
End time: 4736.72
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, there's a couple of things happening.  Yes, they're trying the argument.  Also, if you were in a rural area without access to broadband, one of the reasons you don't have it is because it's broadband historically up until about 5G.  Some 4G has you haven't been able to deliver it wirelessly at the speeds that even at 2530 or 2530.  Right. And so you'd have these small rural ISPs that would come up and try to deliver it.  But then they also had to pay for backhaul back to Comcast.  And Comcast would be like, oh, you want you want backhaul to the fast, real Internet?  Yes, we'll charge you a lot.  Or they wouldn't even offer it.  So wireless with 5G and Verizon's actually doing it.  They're actually doing wireless, broad, like fixed wireless broadband to homes with their wireless service, which allows you to do it economically without having to dig trenches, which is super, super, super expensive.  So I don't know what Comcast is doing.  They're not going to be laying cable in those areas.

Maybe his is the only one.  He didn't handle it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  People seem to like the aspect ratio of the screen because it's more square than maybe the Galaxy Fold, which is taller.  Paul Thurotte just got his and I asked him to do a little review.  He's trying, he bought one. He's trying to decide whether to keep it.  And he has like, he's leaving to Mexico in five days.  So he has to decide before he leaves for Mexico.  I did order, you might remember during the Google I.O. this one on sale, the Pixel tablet.  Tablet, because I liked the idea and Gula talked about this earlier of a tablet that docks on a little base.  Pogo pins.  Via pogo pins and a magnet, obviously.  This is really just like a regular tablet.  Unfortunately, a number of people have said that it, and I have to agree, it's just kind of an everyday Android tablet.  Utility.  I'm not, I have to say I'm not.  What did you expect from it?  Yeah, well, right. Good question, right?  We did talk to somebody on Sunday who loves his Samsung Galaxy Tab.  Those have always been pretty nice.  I think those are. If you're going to get an Android tablet, that's probably, but Samsung has a lot of features, multitasking stuff.  This isn't just a, you know, it's an Android tablet.  If you look at it, it looks just like an Android tablet. It runs apps.  Not cheap. Google apps.  It's 500 bucks.  And I have to say, if you put it side by side with the Nest Hub Max, which I did not ask the tech guys on Sunday, it looks very similar.  And it functionality, at least when it's docked, is very similar.  So the really the main thing this has to offer is it is you can undock it.  It's a standalone tablet in addition to, you know, one of these.  That's interesting.  It does not have a thread radio in it.

Transcript:  So it's not performing the functions of a plugged in tablet in your home.  Oh, that's a very important point.  Google. It's not a smart home controller.

Start time: 5438.14
End time: 5442.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's an Android tablet as opposed to a fuchsia tablet with those smart home features.  Yeah.

Start time: 5443.62
End time: 5452.82
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Right. So it's, I mean, it may look similar, but it doesn't have the same functionality.  Like, and if you bought it to actually control your smart home in a matter world, it's not going to.  It's twice as much.  That's an important distinction.

Start time: 5452.88
End time: 5456.62
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's twice as much as the Nest Hub Max.  But it is a tablet and it's a nice tablet.

Start time: 5457.36
End time: 5465.98
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I mean, you don't buy this because you want a smart home hub.  I mean, we said that from the very beginning.  This is not a smart home hub.  You buy it because you want a tablet.  Yeah.

Start time: 5468.53
End time: 5480.11
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I imagine the use and this is certainly how I plan to use it.  It's replacing the hub Max in my kitchen, which we use as a kitchen timer.  It still does that because Google Assistant is enabled.  Oh, no, no, don't do that.

Start time: 5480.94
End time: 5484.81
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  This is terrible.  Because what happens when somebody walks by and takes your timer away?  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 5485.84
End time: 5490.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 5490.84
End time: 5500.25
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  This is not, do not use it as a smart home hub.  This is not the intended use at all.  And I think it'll frustrate most people if you tell them to use it that way.  That's a good point.  Because they're going to encounter that.  Can I see that?

Start time: 5500.84

Start time: 5519.86
End time: 5560.80
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Basically, you know what Google did here?  What did Google do?  Google was like, hey, let's make a really cool smart home tablet slash smart home hub slash tablet.  It'll be awesome.  And then they realized that the bomb was going to be way too much if they added all this radios and functionality and made that dock anything more than just a charger, like by adding a microphone or any sort of computing into it or radios.  So then they ended up with this weird, stupid product that doesn't.  It's a good tablet, but has this weird docking thing.  And then they doubled down on it being like, it's a real problem.  You've got this tablet and people leave it out and they don't charge it.  Such a big problem.

Transcript:  I mean, it's got decent speaker.  It's not an iPad.  And that's one of the problems I have in general with Android tablets is a lot of Android apps don't really use this screen realist.  Android is not as mature a tablet ecosystem as Apple's.

Start time: 5591.32
End time: 5600.82
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I asked for it because just looking at it over there on the table here, I was like, that sort of looks like a cheap sort of...  It's a medium.  Look at the camera.

Start time: 5600.84
End time: 5611.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's not a great camera.  I'm holding it in my hand.  It feels fine.  It feels substantial.  It just looks cheap.  The screen's decent.  The refresh rate's not as good as the Samsung, but it's decent.

Start time: 5612.00

Start time: 5615.71

Transcript:  I like the idea.  I do like the idea of it docking.  When you do down accidentally dumped into a gin and tonic on Android.  Because it's not a super strong magnet, but it shouldn't be because otherwise, I mean, I can lift up the base.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I mean, you don't.  Kevin tried it and he's like, hey, look, as a tablet, it's fine.  And I was really excited about it because I thought it could be a smart display that I could also use as a tablet.  And I was like, hey, that's pretty cool.

Transcript:  No, we're going to talk.  A tablet needs bezels.  Hold up my phone.  No, but a tablet needs bezels.  Because you have to have somewhere to put your thumb.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  But that just looks like a lot of lost green real estate.  They could have given you another quarter of a time.

End time: 5729.30
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll use it.  I will use it in my kitchen.  I'm just bezel shaming this tablet.  I have YouTube TV, so I'll put news on there.  I'd take one.  I just don't think it's $500 worth is all I'm saying.  I think it's another Google flop.  I hate to say it.  And I wonder how well they'll do with the fold because honestly, Samsung owns that category

Start time: 5730.92
End time: 5732.84
Speaker: Ant Pruitt

Start time: 5732.94
End time: 5745.94
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was thinking though, Stacey, of buying the next Flip.  We're going to cover the Samsung event.  I think July, they're going to announce a new fold and a new Flip.  And I was thinking of buying the Flip.  If I get tired of it in a month, can I send it to you?  Sure.

Transcript:  Matter?  It is matter, as a matter of fact.  TP-Link has announced new switches, light switches that are, they're Wi-Fi light switches,  but they are matter.  And I thought, now they're 25 bucks each.  And I was thinking, and I asked my wife, I said, if I, would you mind if I replied to  my wife, would you mind if I replaced all of the light switches in the house with these  TP-Link switches?  And she said, well, she said an important thing.  She says, what happens when the Wi-Fi goes out?  Yeah.

Start time: 5815.94
End time: 5816.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 5818.60
End time: 5823.84

Transcript:  If you are missing, and I will tell you, I've literally been doing this now for 10 years  and experimenting with it.

Start time: 5823.94
End time: 5826.43
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's why I wasn't going to buy it until I talked to you.  You bet.

Start time: 5827.98
End time: 5850.54
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  The only way you should make your light switches smart is via Lutron.  I'm so sorry.  You have to buy the Lutron hub if you do it.  Pop those babies in.  They don't support matter yet.  I really hope they will one day.  Most reliable, most functional, freaking expensive.  But they support, because like these don't support three way switches, for example.

Start time: 5851.40
End time: 5853.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They do have dimmers, but this is exactly what Jason said.

Start time: 5853.84
End time: 5874.84
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  You have to buy a dimmer or an on off.  I mean, they're relatively inexpensive.  Like 25 bucks for the switch.  I think it's 28 bucks for the dimmer.  They're matter certified with Wi-Fi.  If your Wi-Fi goes out, you can still use the switch and go bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.  You're going to have to double hit it probably to make sure.

Start time: 5875.06
End time: 5882.94
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you could turn the lights off.  Although Jason said with the casetas, the Lutron casetas, they work just like a regular switch does.  Yeah.

Start time: 5884.16
End time: 5893.84
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  That's why, just go with Lutron.  It's so freaking relevant.  I mean, I wish I, I'm still waiting for a technology that's better than that.  And so far, no.  Just Lutron all the way.

Start time: 5893.84
End time: 5905.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the thing, of course, the thing that got my eye was matter.  Because then I don't need a special hub.  It will work with other matter devices.  I think if I'm going to go home automation in the long run, I should have everything be matter compliant.

Start time: 5907.70
End time: 5922.06
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yes.  And I think Lutron will eventually support matter if it becomes necessary.  But for the reliability, for the ease of programming and use, and everything works with Lutron, basically having Google does, Amazon does, HomeKit.  Even Apple.  Yeah.

Start time: 5923.32
End time: 5929.64
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Has Lutron responded to any questions?  I ask them like every week.  And these days, they just go quiet.

Start time: 5930.46
End time: 5936.84
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Hey, could you tell me if you're going to matter?  They're like, no news on that front yet, Stacey.  Oh, spin, huh?  You'll be the first to know.

Start time: 5939.65
End time: 5956.13
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I promised Lisa I wouldn't do it until I talked to Stacey.  And then Jason said, no, don't do it.  Now it is the Lutron switches are a little more expensive.  The TP link are 25 bucks.  And the Lutron.

Start time: 5957.22

Start time: 5973.86
End time: 5980.62
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Okay, yeah, don't buy them on Amazon.  Just go to Home Depot and you can buy like a 10 pack for a more reasonable amount.  That's what I'll do then.

Start time: 5980.88
End time: 6000.70
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay.  And you will need a hub.  And I'll need a hub.  But I don't mind having a, I have a Hue Hub.  I don't mind.  The problem is right now I have to have Hue lights in everything I want to control with my voice.  What I'd like to do is be able to have all the switches be voice controllable.  One of the things that...  You know, oh, go ahead.

Start time: 6000.94
End time: 6019.84
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  If you are using Hue and you have...  Now Lutron makes a device that you can like literally, and I think I just threw mine away.  Well, that's great.  You can put it on your toggle switch.  So you have rockers.  So that's not going to work.  If you have a toggle switch, they make a device.  No, I don't want to, I don't want to rub Goldberg.

Start time: 6019.98
End time: 6041.62
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I want to unscrew.  And by the way, you need a ground wire, which I have.  I checked.  Do you need it?  So I have three wires.  So, but what I want to do is I want to...  That you couldn't tell that I've done this.  Right?  And Lisa could still go up to switch, turn it on, turn it off.  She won't know, but I will know that I can then open my phone and turn all the lights on or off in the house and that kind of thing.

Start time: 6042.11
End time: 6052.47
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah.  Just get Lutron.  And they actually have a device.  They actually have one that doesn't require ground.  I can't remember which like P64 or five or whatever version of it is.  But if you have a neutral wire...  Well, I have ground.

I'll use the existing wall plate and then put the rocker in the wall plate.  Okay.  All right.  That's why you are here.  Shopping with Leo and Stacy.  Can I ask you an unrelated question?  Yes.

Yeah, the large space.  Yeah.  So yeah.  And then, but they're expensive.  And then this is the one that I ordered.  I told you this story.  I ordered it refurbished on Amazon to save me a lot of money.  Then come with filters.  I used it for a year during COVID without the filters.  I didn't know.  I didn't look.  I just got it.  I opened the box, set it up.  Hey, honey, we're protected.

Start time: 6405.73
End time: 6472.32
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay.  So the big takeaway for me that I thought was so VidCon is a John and Hank Green started this now almost a year ago.  It was 2011, Jeff, 2013, something like that.  Like that.  As a way to bring creators, at the time YouTube creators.  YouTube, yep.  Together and there with their audience.  And so there's a big fan contingent of young.  And you told me this, Jeff, you warned me.  A lot of teenagers there.  Oh yeah.  But then there are a lot of creators there.  And now, of course, it's since been bought by Viacom.  Yes.  So it has a slight, there's an industry track.  That's what Lisa was there for the industry track.  That's on the third floor, well away from the children.  The second floor is the creator track.  And then on the ground floor is the conference.  And there's the fans, there's booths.  You know, there was a guy, there was a long line trailing around.  I thought, oh, this got to be somebody big.  And it was some Minecraft guy who wears a mask.  And he's standing there, standing in autographs in his mask or doom.  Actually, more like selfies.  Selfies.  In his mask.  And people were just all of Twitter about this.

Start time: 6472.90
End time: 6484.40
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you get wristbands and you get a lottery.  Oh.  As to who you sign up and you ask for people.  And then you get choices.  And so you get like three guaranteed selfies.

Start time: 6486.80
End time: 6563.30
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And then there are some little kind of auditorium sections inside the conference area.  There were two of them.  And they hold maybe a couple hundred people.  There were two side by side running at the same time, both filled.  One was some sort of Ghost Hunter YouTube show.  And there was another show.  And the people there are rabid fans of that thing.  In fact, I was standing there watching the guy and there's four guys in a panel saying,  yeah, you want to see the next video?  And the fans are screaming.  Ah!  And suddenly show the next video and they're all excited.  So what I really took away from it is how...  It's really...  Programming has changed dramatically since my youth where we had three channels, three networks.  And it was that.  And everybody watched one of the...  Dilligan's Island.  Now there's a thousand niches.  We're one of them.  We're a niche broadcaster.  Everybody's a niche broadcaster now.  And so this Ghost Hunting show had its real solid constituency.  And to them, they were superstars up there on that stage.  But the people on the next stage, I don't know who that is, but this is...  And the guy in the mask, he's got his thing.  So each of these is as famous to that constituency as Paul Newman would be to my generation.

Start time: 6563.32
End time: 6579.28
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That to me is the new scale of everything.  It's the massive niches and things come down from this ridiculous scale that we all have to like the same thing to the smaller scale.  The other session I loved there, I presume they still have it, is their mental health sessions.

Start time: 6580.02
End time: 6646.77
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, they have a lot of attention to mental health, to inclusion.  I mean, it's very conscious.  And of course, that's probably because of John and Hank initially, right?  And because they were very forward thinking in that regard.  So yeah, it's good.  You know, it's good, clean, fun.  It was very interesting.  It feels very alien to a person of my generation because it's so different from the media landscape I grew up in.  But it is, I mean, what's obvious is this is what Twitter is.  You know, we have a small...  Twitter army.  Yeah, we have 700,000 unique listeners every month, right?  That's our... and that's actually pretty big.  Maybe not compared to a Marques Brownlee or a Mr. Beast, but that's decent for a niche for new media.  And I think it's enough, it's certainly enough to make a living on.  Mr. Beast was not there because weirdly, Canlion was at the same time.  What is Canlion's?  You got me.  It's the International Festival of Creativity.  Oh, Canlion's.

Start time: 6647.61
End time: 6651.28
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis

Start time: 6655.66
End time: 6675.30
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This has always been a problem for VidCon, is that they occur just by happenstance.  They occur at the same time.  And so VidCon's been trying... because I was on the industry advisory board for a few years.  Trying to get the advertising executives to come and respect this kind of creator video is always the quest for them.

Start time: 6676.24
End time: 6699.89
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, and of course, here's Shira Lazar's pictures from the French Riviera.  You know, she's at Canlion's.  So, you know, the Wall Street Journal's at Canlion's, right?  So this is the problem.  There's two sets of creators and they're split.  And the ones who are most successful are probably in France, I hate to tell you.  They're not...

Start time: 6700.32
End time: 6703.18
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, because who would not go to the French Riviera as opposed to LA?

Start time: 6703.34
End time: 6750.28
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's also where the money is.  The fans are at VidCon.  But the money's at Canlion's.  The investors are over there.  Was John Green there?  I didn't see him.  And as I mentioned before the show began, I didn't know this,  but I later read an article that said, oh, actually all the action wasn't at the conference center, at the Anaheim Convention Center.  All the action was over at the Hyatt a few blocks away where they...  That was where the creators stayed.  And in fact, when the CEO of TikTok came to VidCon, they sponsored it last year.  They were the key sponsor last year.  YouTube's back again this year as a sponsor.  But when the CEO of TikTok came, he didn't even go to Anaheim Convention Center.  He went to the Hyatt.  So really, maybe we didn't see the best of VidCon.

Start time: 6751.05

End time: 6771.52
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And only 50,000 attendees, I think, was the final number.  It's smaller than it's been in years past.  COVID hurt it.  I'm sure it's coming back.  Or maybe not, because one of the problems with being all these niche shows is there's no central place to go, right?

Start time: 6774.11
End time: 6793.17
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, and Hank tried.  He announced this at VidCon some years ago where he wanted the Creators Guild.  He wanted to create a union around creators, and he couldn't get it going on the negotiation side.  It's trying to bring together a critical mass of creators.  And that's what VidCon really stands for.

I can really sell it, can't I?  There's a changelog?  I sold that good.  It was fit off.  YouTube Music now automatically adds songs to your last playlist.  Crickets.  Google introduces a new shop tab for rentals and purchases on Android TV.  This is Google's response to the fact that they took away the Google Play store, right?  You can't buy TV and movies on the Google Play store.  So they are now going to add this slowly to Android TV.  If you want to buy movies or TV shows, that's where you're going to do it.  And it will also show anything you've already purchased or purchased in the past from Google Play movies and TV.  Or YouTube or Google TV or Android TV.  I actually I really think that Google Chromecast with Android TV is quite good.  Or is it the Google Chromecast with Google TV?  I can never get so confused.  One of them is really good.  I have no idea which.  Google Search is rolling out a perspectives filter for more personal and human results.  This is because this is part of SGE.  Right.  I think it's also part of the Reddit problem.  Oh, this is a response to the lack of input from Reddit if Reddit goes away.  Because, of course, everybody knows the real way to do a good Google search is to add the word Reddit to the end of whatever you're searching.  I never knew.  Yeah.

Transcript:  I think it's really interesting, Stacey, that you said, and I agree with you, that Google search results have gone to hell.  Oh, they're terrible.  They really are.  I've been looking for a replacement, but I don't know what it is.  I don't know if it's Google's fault.

Right after this is announced, right after this is announced, the Toronto Star Company,  formerly TOR Star and Post Media, which is the conglomerate that's taking everything up,  announced they're going to merge, basically taking away all competition in news.  They pushed for this law and there's going to be less news all around.  Facebook's not going to link to news.  There's going to be no competition.  It's a bloody the TV stations are now trying to push hard to take away their requirement for local news or reduce it.  It's a bloody mess.  And it all comes because the hedge fund owned big companies and investor companies went after their political.  They bought their votes to get this protectionism.  And it's a disaster.  And what's happening is I submitted a letter to the California Senate because the California  Journalism Protection Act or not protection preservation act is I think coming up for debate this week.  And it's a disaster like the Canadian one, like the J.C.P.A., which is the one in Congress.  It's boxish for news companies.  Full disclosure.  Google gives money to my school, but it's still stupid.  It's dangerous.  It's as bad as that hot dog.  It's not bad.  It's good.

The latest is Turner Classic Movies, which is arguably the greatest gift to movie lovers ever, especially in the Marvel cinema Star Wars universe world of movies.  Warner has now fired the five most senior executives at TCM through a mix of buyouts and pink slips.  Warner Brothers Discovery.  We need a new name for this.  The Evil Empire.  How about that?  Has promised the viewers would no long would no see no change to CCM.  The management's all gone, but there's no change.  The channel will remain free of ads, but it's losing money like crazy.

Transcript:  My eyes are watering.  All right.  So my thing this week that I forgot completely about because I didn't put it in the link.  My bad.  Is Nanoleaf released something that is only cool for people who like are really into the  television or gaming.  But if you're into it, it's actually a very affordable way to do ambient lighting.  So it's the Nanoleaf 40 screen mirror and light strip kit.  And this is a what this does is you stick this over your TV.  It's got a little camera that's like processing the colors of what's on the television and  then the light strip.  Oh, it's a bias light.  That's bias.  Yes.  Yes.

Start time: 7825.42

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 7826.67
End time: 7827.93

Transcript:  OK.  So you think has done this.

Start time: 7829.32
End time: 7852.99
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  For a while.  But to get something like this, you have to pay like it's like four hundred dollars to  get the lighting and everything.  And the same box.  It is only ninety nine dollars.  Sorry.  A hundred dollars.  Pretty cool.  And then an 85 inch light strip is like one hundred and twenty.  Oh, this is really.  Did you do.  Have you done this?  So we've I've done it with the Hue.  Yeah.  So I haven't tried it yet.

Start time: 7853.32

Speaker: Leo Laporte

End time: 7885.77
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I haven't tried it yet.  I've done it with the Hue.  Yeah.  So I haven't tried this one out yet because it's not going to ship until July.  But if this is something you're interested in, I love the Nanoleaf lighting.  The camera is pretty cool.  They have a little privacy thing if you're worried about it taking.  So there's two ways they deal with privacy with this camera that like overlooks your  TV, which admittedly is a little unattractive.  They let you cover it or they also don't do any processing except like in the cloud.  It's all local on the device.  I trust them.

Start time: 7887.33
End time: 7889.32
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 7890.31
End time: 7903.65
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they can't really do.  Yeah, they basically know what you're watching on TV, but they won't know that because none  of that data goes to the cloud.  They're literally just saying these are the colors on the screen quickly, mimic it to  the thing.

Start time: 7904.77
End time: 7913.42
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I might actually do.  That's pretty cool.  I've always wanted to do bias lighting.  Yeah.  And this is an inexpensive way to implement it.  You do have to have that camera looking at your TV.  It's like dark mode.  Yeah.

Start time: 7916.13
End time: 7917.32
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham

End time: 7949.96
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  The other cool thing they, and I didn't know this was a thing because I'm not a gamer.  They actually synced their lights with Overwatch.  Oh, that's cool.  Okay.  Yeah.  So when you get kills, it'll like turn.  Oh, blood red.  It's like fun colors.  Oh great.  And if you die, it'll flash it red.  And I'm like, why don't we have like an API like this for sports?  Yeah, you shouldn't need the camera.

Start time: 7950.32

Start time: 7962.48
End time: 7980.32
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  It was a lot of integration on the media side.  Yeah.  And so it was very custom for, it wasn't basically scalable.  But now you could do with, I mean,  this is actually using computer vision and AI to, to quickly say,  Oh, these colors will work here.  Go.  And they can do it rapidly.  I'm a sucker.

If you have a BMW or a Mini and you want to play around with your car and its software,  Beamer Code allows you to connect to your OBD with a particular OBD dongle.  And you can play around with some of the things because with my car, I recently had some issues  with my daytime running lights and I got tired of seeing the air until I fixed the light.

Transcript:  What's funny is the first three episodes are nothing like the rest of the show.  Like there's a big thing happens.  The people who are in the first episode.  Well, I don't want to spoil it.  But it changes dramatically.  And then, oh, that's not they're not the stars.  Oh, OK.  Yeah.  Such a good show.  It is good.  And the books that it's based on, the Wool series, will be the topic tomorrow as Ant interviews the author Hugh Howey.  That's exciting.  It's so crazy.  1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern.  That is a great get.  And I am thrilled to watch it.  You should call it triangulation.  You should.  You should.  Because that's really what it is.  You're interviewing a sci-fi.  I guess so.  Anyway.  Yeah, I guess so.  Tune in for that.  That's one of many things we do in the club.  These are club exclusives because we want to make you feel bad that you're not in the club.  Really.  Yes, I do want to know.  We want you to think, gosh, I'm missing all the.  We still offer all these shows for free ad supported.  But if you want ad free versions of all the existing shows, if you want special content created just for the club and an awesome show,  and honestly, the real reason they're in the club is because club members are paying for it.  They're supporting it.  Stuff that we can't sell ads to on because it's one off like that Hugh Howey interview or it doesn't have a sufficient audience.  Home theater geeks.  We had to cancel it with Scott Wilkinson.  But we could bring it back thanks to you club members.  So if I think it's a very, very fair seven dollars a month gets you ad free versions of all the shows,  gets you a bunch of shows we don't put out in public like Hands on Macintosh, Hands on Windows.  Scott's home theater geeks, the Untitled Linux show, the Giz Fizz, Stacey's Book Club.  I mean, it goes on and on.  We're making the club a great place to be.  You also get access to the Discord, which is the best social network ever because it's filled with club members only.  And many of our hosts.  Lots and lots and lots of gifts.  Yes, there's no gifts.  But there are gifts.  Great art.  Animated.  Yes, Joe has done some great stuff this episode.  Anyway, seven bucks a month.  What's your thing doll is now memorialized.

Should be at least 10.  If we had 10, we would do more shows.  We would probably have no ads.  It would be a very different thing.  That's the kind of thing we need to keep going because it is getting really tough out here.  Especially because of me.
