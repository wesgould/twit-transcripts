I don't know why it takes four weeks, but that's the way it is  We miss her we will have her back January, but meanwhile  Still got Jeff Jeff Jarvis  rid of me  Better not get rid of you around I know Jeff in fact  I welcome this opportunity to spend a little time with Jeff because he's one of the smartest guys I know and  And Gina just slows us down with like facts  so  Jeff Jarvis professor of journalism City University of New York is the author of public parts a great book about living in public and privacy  also many other things including Gutenberg the geek the single from Amazon which is now an audiobook read by Jeffrey and  Many people don't know but you for many years were a television critic

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Indeed I was TV critic and people a TV guide and people yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you worked for the examiner right yes, San Francisco  And a column way back in the day called take five  That's what I read religiously and I and I was I've been a Jeff Jarvis fan since then since take five  You're always too kind no. I loved it  The examiner now is I don't know what it's like a free a free weekly or something  It's not well what newspaper isn't a poor thin miserable shell of itself, but the Hearst Corporation which ran  It was really great. We had it was it like many towns a two-paper town  The morning paper in your afternoon paper the Hearst Corporation ran the examiner it was William Randolph Hearst's first newspaper  I think or one of his first and then the the young family ran the San Francisco Chronicle  And then what happened was you know like most cities you couldn't support two newspapers  so the Hearst bought the Chronicle the young family retired and  And they said well we got we can't we'll just give up the examiner and we'll run the Chronicle so in a way  The examiner continues named just change his name. Yeah, that's all think of it that way  So Jeff lots of stories, but one that is really applicable  To the to media coverage and and frankly  Makes me every time these things happen wipe my brow  There but for the grace of God a Google shuttle in San Francisco  blocked by protesters  mostly because  San Francisco has gotten very expensive and there are a lot of people who feel that  It's the fault of all these dot-com millionaires Google and Apple and everybody else living there and these companies all the big companies  Yahoo Google and Apple have their special buses and these buses use public bus stops  So protesters blocked this private shuttle saying it's not right. You shouldn't be able to use the public bus stops without paying fees  The San Francisco displacement and neighborhood impact agency they call themselves and a guy gets I guess gets off or is in anyway  they're surrounded by television cameras and a guy claiming to be a  Google employee  Starts shouting at them saying hey, you know get a job  You know all the things you'd expect an insensitive  Rich guy to do you want to show we watch the little bit of the this is from the San Francisco Bay Guardian  Here is the you can't hear me  Why don't you go to a city where you can afford it turns out it's all staged this guy's a labor  protest labor leader the whole thing is staged the whole thing is fake and of course a lot of news organizations got bit by it and  I always when I look at something like this I go. Oh god there, but for the grace of God go I  How do you avoid getting bit by something that's so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Blatantly a fake. I mean also I think you try to cover the story the way it is  I this I what I tweeted about this whole incident was this is I'm sorry  But this is the reason why I'm glad I am NOT in San Francisco anymore. It's it's the obvious  Proto-liberal and I mind you I'm a Democrat  I'm a liberal but but I got sick of fellow liberals because they can really be pains in the butt and and what do I  You what what do you expect?  These people do right so it's okay. That's fun kill all the buses every employee is gonna drive a Mercedes from San Francisco to Mountain View  Oh, that's good, and they're all gonna have to park on the street  With the parking spots yeah, but they but you know what the heck you know what the buses you don't like the buses  That's fine  Or suddenly they're all gonna leave Google's gonna pick up and go to another city and you're gonna watch the real estate places drop  Okay, maybe that's what you want, but that's not good for the economy. They're gonna take the jobs away with them  You want that what is it you really want?  Why is he just complaining somebody's making money now there are issues to the new tech?  1% that I think we have to deal with there is a new creation of wealth in the tech industry  That they've got to deal with responsibly, but in this case it's your neighbors who have a job somewhere else  they'd rather live in San Francisco than Mountain View and  They are using a form of public transportation to get there and not clogging up the streets and not clogging up the roadways on the way  to the peninsula  and I don't see anything wrong with that and  So it's just one of these stupid things that tries to make nothing into a cause and that pisses me off so from that level  Right there you say we TV news cameras are getting gamed at that level  If you even go out and cover this crap  And then you play along with the next level of being gamed which is this guy making the stuff up beware

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Within an hour of the original post the Guardian learned that the guy was not an actual Google employee  Even though they ran the story at first as if he was but Max Bell Alper as a union organizer  with unite here local 2850  They asked him what what were why did you do that?  And he said this is a political theater to demonstrate what's happening in the city. It's more than just the bus  These are enormous corporations that are investing in this community these companies like Google  Should be proud of where they're from and invest in their communities. I'm confused. I think what they  Don't invest in Mountain View invest in San Francisco. I guess Google has an office in San Francisco pay for the bus shelters  Well, they do because the taxes that they pay taxes all of yeah just as much as Max Alper paid for the bus shelter  He didn't pay for them. He didn't give the city of San Francisco money to use the bus shelter  When asked if he intentionally intended to deceive media  He said people are talking all over the country about what's happening in San Francisco  That's the debate we need to have here the more we talk about it the more we think about it the more we're gonna see  Tech companies need to contribute he that didn't respond in other words whether he intentionally deceived the media  He did say he didn't intend to engage in theater before going to the protest  But when he was there he made the decision spontaneously to stage the argument  I got to point out the protesters were wearing as you saw in that video were wearing  You know reflective vests he wasn't I don't think it was that spontaneous  He did not when asked repeatedly by media who he was and then they asked to talk him. He did not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean it was pretty a lie. It's a lie plain out and simple. Yeah, but it plays to the weakness of TV news  You know I want to start writing about that topic and I was gonna talk to you Leo about this is I we need to reinvent television news  We were assuming that it has to operate in its old stupid  Orthodoxies and and and we know what they are we know what they were all they are covering fires  Being taken in by PR events like this  You know what's wrong with TV news and how do we reinvent it and if I look at new models  But when I speak to company I've spoken to video you know TV news companies around the world  When they come in and say oh, what's hot in New York, and I always bring you up Leo  I always always show them twig and I and I twit and I show them the you know this magnificent absurdity you've created  People will sit here for an hour and a half  You know I just loved it on on on the chat room beforehand Steve went on Steve Steve  God bless him who can talk security 24 hours said Leo. It's already been a hundred minutes. You know this a little long

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Turning over a new leaf. I want to be clear about this Jeff two hours security nows are with the norm until recently

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so that then somebody in the chat room complained said  No, no screen now should be two and a half to three hours  We should be all day  Yeah, so they'll just take as much of you as they can get versus you know mine  So you got everything from six minutes to six hundred minutes six seconds yeah, and and or six seconds  Thank you, and everything in between and TV can be rethought  But but this is just silly story as an example of TV news assignment desk taking up  You know whatever flackery is sent their way set on cameras as if it's real news when it's just made up BS

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well and and by the way, I think that they by doing that do a disservice to the story so  I mean there are all sorts of things that media does wrong that he said she said kind of coverage that CNN is is  espousing but also you know if it bleeds it leads and news has always done this the  More yelling there is the more controversy the more  Visceral and emotional and everybody knows this that's why YouTube  I remember talking to Tim Street who's a great video maker and he did a lecture on how to become a viral video  He said the more emotions you can engage in a shorter amount of time the more likely you are to get viral if you can  Bring people make people laugh and cry and be scared and jump for joy  You're gonna be huge and that's and local television news has known that for years  What's unfortunately I think anathema to television is the idea of abstract ideas you can't illustrate yes with pictures  It's so hard to do because people have to sit there and watch people like us talk  And think and I think there's legitimate. I don't know what the answer is  I mean that the city of San Francisco is becoming gentrified that means

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's been gentrified for years and years and years and years when I was there you couldn't I couldn't afford an apartment

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are people in the Mission District  It's a beautiful district where a lot of low-income people live and they're being evicted and forced out now because it's also happens to be  very popular place for  The yuppies do we still call them yuppies for the yuppies to move in they're called the Googlers now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Googlers dinks dual income no

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right the center of San Francisco in the center of you know the center of the universe

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You go through the tenderloin and it's still the tenderloin hey you could still shoot up in the tenderloin on the street and  Nobody will bug you yeah, so there are places to stay. I feel I do feel a little bit bad for  For people who have been living in San Francisco and one of the one of the points these guys make is that San Francisco has been  Always been a very diverse and interesting culturally and now it's getting more uniform. It's just a bunch of nerds

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Guys invest guys have hipsters

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, that's okay eat your heart out Chipotle  Lisa Lisa just brought me lunch is that what the hell is that is that a macho burrito?  That's the medium

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jesus it's an overhead shot of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well you know what's nice is it kind of looks like the Mexican flag where's the where's the microphone where's the camera  It could be it could be the the Mexican flag. I'm gonna eat the Mexican flag and  This my friends is why you can't get an apartment in San Francisco  You can't fit actually the same things happened in Petaluma the San Francisco the Petaluma hotel  Which is across the street here was a residence hotel that means low-income poor people older people were living there cheaply  And somebody bought it and it's turning into an actual hotel and kicking them out  So I mean I think that's terrible so I do think that there's an issue a societal issue  I don't know what the answer is because we live in a free-market economy  You can't you can only go getting mad at the workers who are going to their job

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know all mass rather than individual cars and bringing money economy. That's the wrong way to go  They're not the enemy your neighbor is not the enemy in this case. Yeah  Your neighbor is not the enemy in this case yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now more news from Glenn Greenwald as we continue to leak out more and more about the NSA the latest is the NSA  Uses Google this comes from the Washington Post  Uses Google cookies to pinpoint targets for hacking. They're secretly riding on top of  cookies

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The there's usually they're anonymized they're not people, but I guess it helps them string together  Communications into one person yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly and then what they're gonna do then with these apparently according to this slide is offensive hacking  They're gonna go out and spearfish them. They're gonna try to get malware on their computer where we were learning now that the FBI  Has used malware?  to investigate  Crimes they they literally put key loggers and stuff on your system using spear phishing attacks

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder whether this has anything to do with Google  Trying to create new advertising targeting mechanisms and giving up cookies

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got to kill Google because of course this is the fear everybody has about all of this oh you're tracking this you're tracking this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, we're not says Google, but the government is and using Google using Google cookies

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently the GCHQ in Britain and the NSA have found particular use for a part of a Google specific tracking mechanism  Known as the preff p.r. EF  Cookie no personal information  But that but a numeric code that is a unique identifier, so you got the unique identifier  You know this is one two three four five six seven eight nine  And then you can continue to see that code as the person travels around  Knowing where they go so according to these slides the cookies are used to quote enable remote exploitation  The slides don't say exactly  How this is done, but I guess if you know where people are going you could then hack a site for instance that the person  Frequents waiting for them once it sees the cookie it can literally just attack them  I mean it's not it's not too hard to figure out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This they could I presume use anybody's cookie to do this that just Google's the most ubiquitous

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anytime a browser makes a connection to any Google property at all a pref cookie is created  Giving it so that it's a unique identifier, so I have a unique identifier. You have a unique identifier  Maps Google search of course Google plus YouTube  And even if there is a like button so a lot of sites are not Google sites  But they have a like button or they use Google connect  If there's a Google plus widget  And even you know think about it Google ads and sense ads are everywhere right and also it says that there was a program called

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  happyfoot  which uses  mobile

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  IDs I love I love that the NSA's hackers are so inventive in their naming  Yeah, that that's how you know. They're really hackers

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Codename happyfoot through as far as they didn't even matter for Flintstone characters

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is even better than internet geolocation services happyfoot  Even when GPS is not able to can can track you down

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What are you gonna? Do so did you did you what did you think of the the Google letter the Google at all the eight?  tech companies letter to the president and  Congress on Monday makes for a great full-page ad in the New York Times

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm-hmm at which it was yes  and of course  You know there's two things going on one is  Of course these companies are pissed off because it hurts their business or in is overseas and it makes their users suspicious of them  Regardless of the fact that some or all of these companies probably have cooperated with the feds for years  Particularly Microsoft when I see Microsoft going oh no this is terrible  Am I am I the only one maybe it's just maybe it's my bias who feels like come on Microsoft  You've been helping them out for years and now oh no no we don't want

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah  But on the other hand I think that there is real economic damage that's being done to the industry in these companies  Yeah, I wrote a piece for the guard the Guardian called me  Was this this come out Monday? Yeah, Monday after noon  I got I got a little bit of me and said you know already commentary was embargoed till midnight and  So as I thought this through yeah, my first point is this is in their economic albeit  enlightened self-interest  Right what's what's bad for spying is bad for the internet?  What's bad for the internet is bad for Silicon Valley?  What's bad for Silicon Valley is bad for America to rewrite the old GM saw so there's definitely an economic factor  Yeah, that's a good way to push about yeah, but I also  Was delighted to see you know I want to see this discussion raised to the level of principles and the eight companies put forward proposed  Principles that for instance government should not be hoovering everything up  They should be doing what we the law had expected before which is they go after specific targets for specific reasons and have some  specificity to what they're they're seeking which nobody's gonna argue with  That there needs to be some level of transparency there needs to be oversight  And also that that an oversight clearly has failed and finally that  We need to avoid the move toward a Balkanized web which is occurring here. Sorry. It wasn't a better picture there Chad  And I took downstairs here, but the principles also say that this idea for instance from Brazil that  Brazilians data should be stored in Brazil where by the way the Brazilian government could get to it more easily  We the data shouldn't have to respect national boundaries  So these principles are reform government surveillance calm and and I'm glad that's where they're trying to push the discussion  I think that part is good  Then I argued that there are things that are missing here. Sorry my light thinks I'm dead now  I got a stand-up all the way  Pink

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is something the university implemented to save power and I noticed you also you're also freezing your ass off  So they must have turned off the heat save guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bring a safety vest

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bulletproof yeah  So so what's missing from this? Well, what's missing is a letter to David Cameron on the GCH q  American companies thinking this is an American problem, which to some extent it is but it's a worldwide problem  What's also missing are various other companies and parts and industries. Where's Amazon?  Amazon runs a lot of the cloud Amazon  Also has big contracts for the CIA as Jeff Bezos mentioned on  60 minutes last week  So where's it Amazon where other cloud companies like Salesforce that depend upon the cloud and its health where certainly are the telcos?  Where are is Verizon and whereas AT&T and where is level three?  Which allegedly are in a position to hand over our metadata and enable taps straight into the internet  Whereas Cisco and other hardware companies whose hardware is used to turn off and also turn off the net  There's a lot that comes next and then finally I argued where are the  Technologists as a tribe, you know that we have the two Google engineers who when they found out about the direct taps in lines between  Google servers  Issued a big fu to the NSA and that's fine. But anger is not a principle  It's just a reaction after the fact and I keep on hoping for a larger discussion among technologists  mathematicians programmers developers statisticians to  Look at the limits of what of their power. They have great power. They are the nuclear scientists of our age  They have  Technology that can be used for good or bad and they as individuals I argue and as a as a as a society  Need to get together and need to discuss what their limits are and what's going too far  And so that when a spy or government or an employer asked them to do something  What what standards do they call upon the NSA? Once again is the largest employer of mathematicians in the United States  What are the standards? So so I finally just argued that that it starts with  A Hippocratic oath for technologists, which is first harm. No user little obvious and little little oversimplified  I will grant but we have to have a discussion of what harms the people who make your tools and your  platforms and the internet work and  Just because government has done it even if it's legal  That's no excuse and so we need a bigger discussion  Nonetheless with all those caveats with the economic self-interest with all that  I was delighted to see the eight companies send the letter to the White House because they do have clout  They do have and they are fighting for us  And I think that we're we now have to have the real debate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  AOL Apple Facebook Google LinkedIn Microsoft Twitter and Yahoo are the a companies and look who's here Matthew Ingram joining us  Hey Matthew, thanks for a dialing in we appreciate it. No problem. I feel a little underdressed  Well, Jeff's wearing a vest  You guys have unit clow in San Francisco. I've heard of it. Yeah, we do I think it is the greatest  It is the Ikea of clothes  Is it so it's not a brand it's a store

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chad's going yes, I know it's both it's both and they have a very sort  It's it's very much like the Ikea of clothing. They have a very that stylized brand  You have to you have to sew it yourself  No, but they have like silly things like they have like a wake-up app, you know  That's just an alarm clock app. That's from Uniqlo and it's just is  Close no, it's just where the Android phone are they American company who are they Japanese companies? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well, this is is a is a  Fake down vest. It's the lightest thing and it weighs nearly nothing  I have a whole coat that is this down that weighs like two ounces  It's incredible and you can roll it up into a little ball and I can put my briefcase a winter coat  The

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The first Uniqlo  29 bucks was opened in 1984 in Hiroshima or Hiroshima Japan  It was a chain of roadside stores to an international leader in style quality and fun. They're a leader in fun  Anyway, we were talking before we started talking about clothing  About this the the big eight  Talk asking the president and the government to adhere to these principles one live in it limiting government's authority to collect users  information  And they say that this is it's time for the world's governments  So they did address this to the US but they say it's time for the world's governments to address the practices and laws  regulating surveillance of individuals and access to their information  So it isn't just  President Obama's everybody  oversight and accountability  Transparency about government demands. These are the companies by the way  well, at least  Facebook Google Apple  Twitter Yahoo and Microsoft who have been publishing those transparency reports taking Google's lead  But they can't say much because the government but the Patriot prohibits them from saying anything too specific  Respecting the free flow of information and avoiding conflicts among governments, you know  You got to start with that if there's no more war if there's no more conflicts between governments  And who needs all this spying  What we really need is a global world government run by corporations  That's what we need Larry Page for Emperor

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's how you become and then you become the president of the internet Leo and thus the president

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The world we need the League of Justice the league that's what we need. That's right yield

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can read it all at as Jeff said reform government surveillance comm I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Guess you mentioned that term motherhood at all. No apple pie or motherhood. I mean  You know, I'm in favor of all those things too, and it would be great if we could make them happen, but but how?  Are they going to help that happen? Or is it just a statement of wouldn't it be?  Great if we were all free. I'm not so cynical about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I think that that you know, there there there is no or you know, the discussion had to wait until  I'm disappointed or remain disappointed  I've said on the show that that Google and company all those eight companies and more who aren't there didn't do this  Six months ago in this seven month long story  They tried to hide I talked with executives at other companies who said no  No, we don't want to get anywhere near this. We just don't talk about it  It kind of goes away and I said BS not going away and and so when it finally affected them so directly  With with taps in in their own lines among their servers  They got mad enough to do something the same as Diane Feinstein your senator Leo  Was the was the love girl of the NSA until they went after Angela Merkel. Oh, that's one of mine  Enter that  And and and you know, God helps her they're tapping Diane's phone  So yeah, this took too long, but I still think it's important that it's happening  There is now a discussion there is going to be review and reform in this country of some form  So it's time that we start getting the specifics. So I think is proposing principles  Like these is a very constructive act and and the first principle of trying to limit what you do  To what's needed to do to define a need rather than saying just because we can't gather it all we will gather it all  That is the crux of the argument and certainly in the US

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I doubt that GCH Q cares one wit but certainly in the US these eight are important for camp  I mean this is when when when President Obama was running for president  He came to Silicon Valley and talked to these people. These are these are important thought leaders in the United States  It's a very important part of the US economy  And I guess we could take it  I don't want to say at face value  But I guess we could take them as being sincere and saying they'd like to solve with with with the given of of their economic

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Interest I mean there they do have self-interest at work. Yes, their company  That's all required. I'm also happy that we're having this in the US and in my my putative  Sometimes boss Alan Ruspert or the editor of the Guardian was called before a Parliament select committee  We could go and it was a shameful horrid  performance from some of the MPs there who questioned his patriotism for  revealing government's actions to government citizens and and the attitude in the UK is  Oddly very different from what it is here. I understand there  Hmm. What is the attitude there? The attitude there is?  A it said that Brits like spies over simplification, but there's less hostility to a spy structure  You know James Bond and all that John le Carre  more substantively  You also have a war going on among the newspapers and because the Guardian  Reported on the bad activities the spine and the phone hacking of News Corp  That's leading to new talk of regulating all newspapers and I'm not actually in favor of that  But be that as it may and so all the newspapers hate the Guardian and so nobody's standing up with the Guardian even as the shameful  performance occurs in Parliament

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think it's just that though. I think there's a and this is just my based on you know, no scholarly research whatsoever  But there seems to be an attitude in the UK and and in Canada as well that  freedom of information is not a sort of absolute and that when push comes to shove it's  Society those societies are much more likely to say well the government would be do wouldn't be doing it if there wasn't something important  Behind it therefore  There's a reflex to regulation  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There that the reflex to trust when I when I talked about public parts in Germany at the Republican conference before I wrote it  and I talked about what I call the German paradox of  About privacy somebody in the audience said well, what about the American paradox?  I said well, what's that and they said the American paradox is that you Americans have probably the best government of anyone in the world?  For the last 200 years, but you have the least sometimes the least trust in government  You have some of the worst companies but you trust companies more than we do in Europe and so in Europe  It's the opposite. There's there's much less trust of companies much more trust of government  There's libertarian streak here, even if you're not  You're so you're right  I think that that's the difference too  And I think you're absolutely right Matthew that Canada is certainly not only because it was part of the Empire  But Robertson Davies used to say that Canada is more like Scandinavia than like the US

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The principles peace order and good government, right? Right not life liberty and the pursuit of  You know a big gulp or whatever. It's it's a sort of a good government. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, I want to take a break because we have to but I'm really glad Matthew's here Matthew talked a little bit  Wrote about hoaxes on giga-ohm. We were talking before you got here about the Google  protester hoax  And what this means for new media? I want to talk about that  It according to the Financial Times YouTube could be stand to make as much as five point six billion dollars this year  advertising whoa and  And the up worthy problem. I think you'll I think you and Matthew and Jeff will know what I mean when I say that  Facebook and up worthy we'll talk about lots more  This is a good panel for this kind of thing in just a bit as I mentioned Gina is off this month, but  Contrary to rumors, she is not off the show. She will be back in January. We're doing a special show actually  For a Christmas Day, we're gonna do a best of is it too late now to contribute to the best of Chad  I've already edited it.

I don't know about you, but all of a sudden  I'm seeing all these up worthy posts in my Facebook feed and  Now up where these not new I thought maybe up where these doing something really good. They do you know, they have these great  Headlines that make you feel good about life  And then when you when you go to watch that silly kitty video at up worthy they they make sure that you have a big button  that says  Pass it on  And they have a big Facebook button  so  But there is another reason why up where these showing up all the time in your Facebook feed Matthew you wrote about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's I mean the biggest reason is Facebook so this happened right the same time that Twitter's IPO happened  What did Facebook do they are fiddling with the algorithms that run their newsfeed and so  They're  Interestingly enough it sounds to me at least  as though they actually want to downplay things like up worthy and  Buzz feed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What what gets what gets on the top of the feed now for some reason Dan Lyons fake Steve job?  Jobs lives at the top of my newsfeed now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's funny. I've seen his a bunch too  And I know I think it was BuzzFeed wrote about  Some sites are seeing huge increases in the amount of traffic that Facebook is sending them  So they're clearly fiddling with the gears. You know that determine what gets displayed and what doesn't and  You know up where these incredibly viral content. I see it dozens of times in my Twitter stream and my face  I don't wanna

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you seen the up worthy generator comm yeah? Yeah? Yeah?  That's it's become a cliche. It's just just as BuzzFeed has become its own cliche up with these become its own cliche  And all it is is the old scum. I was a tabloid guy. I wrote those headlines  I know what it's like to do that and it's it's tabloid. That's all it is up worthy generator

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's an up worthy generated headline trying it try not to let your jaw hit the floor when you hear these two words  And then a video of a woman crying, and how can you not click on that?  Let's create let's create another this is so awesome watch a legendary high schooler become a role model with one question

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Their favorite is this guy did something and you'll never believe what happened next

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's what happens when a director stands up for people who can't and a teary woman  Here's what happens when an NBA coach gets real about the biggest problem in America

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sound like real headlines

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need to drop everything and here the tear-jerking two words this trailblazing author found  And then a woman in tears

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is it's going to people click on them like in a way it reminds me of spam  the early days of spam the reason why they did those things was because people clicked on them and  Up where he works because people click on them. Well, you know what? It's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I talked to Tony Hale the founder and CEO of chart beat a wonderful company that does great  Analytics on pages and and we need to have for Tony on sometime  But he said that what they're finding in part is that a lot of people share things before they read them. Yeah  And so the belief that oh it's shared it got it got read it really this really engaged people not necessarily  You just kind of see that little  Reflexive moment and you send it off somebody else and you're and that's how this crap rises

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and people see a headline like, you know, this coach did something amazing to stop racism or something  Well, you you want to be seen as someone who doesn't like racism. So you're gonna share it  It doesn't matter what it says and you don't read it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, of course not. You don't watch the video who has time for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I only have time to share and in fact Twitter. I was just noticing today the the mobile version  You know, they've added  retweet  Buttons right below the content so you don't have to click on the sadly and so you can retweet it literally without even

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's much more convenient that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To Matthew is all the time  I'll put up a post and I'll tweet it and before anyone could possibly have read the post. Yeah, I start getting reaction  Yeah, yeah, yeah and retweets

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I know some of it is bots like some in particular  Mashable stuff gets retweeted 500 times before you even a robot could read the text  Because everyone's trying to sort of draft off of their social  But and and the you know, the comparison for me to up worthy is is SEO  So SEO headlines remember when we were all upset about those  This is sort of a similar thing. It's emotional SEO, you know  So these headlines are sort of being being sort of calculated to tug at your heartstrings and it's a human heartstring optimization  Yeah, except it's gonna it's gonna fail for the same reason SEO did people will get used to it that cuts  So now all the same, right? They're all in Matt cuts  So and you know Google and Facebook are both gonna write  Particularly Facebook is tweaking its algorithm to try and drive that stuff down. I think what is Facebook trying to accomplish?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook wanting to be a new a news front page. What would do you what do you take on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So well, that's what I wrote about today because I you know, they queue for you Matthew. Yes, Mike Mike Isaac  Talk to some anonymous sources at Facebook about what Chris Cox the VP of product  thinks about and what Mark Zuckerberg thinks about when they when they think about what they want the newsfeed to do and  What they want it to be is like a newspaper a place where you get all the stuff that's important to you  and so the tension there is  obviously lots of people just want to share cat gifts and photos of their  child or whatever  Stupid things like up worthy posts. So but Facebook doesn't want them to do that. Facebook wants it to be  High quality and sort of important in a way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why is there algorithm looking at what I what does their algorithm look at what I consider high quality or what is generally?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Considered high quality. I think it's looking at what's generally considered high quality and there were fails  There were some other sort of clues, you know, a lot of this is sort of  Trying to it's smoke and mirrors in a way  So it's all suggestions and so so Peter Kafka talked to someone about the newsfeed and they said, you know  We want fewer internet memes and more kind of thousand-word  serious analytical pieces  but I'm not clear on whether that's because  People seem to like a thousand word analytical pieces or because  Facebook wants them to like long analytical pieces and you know whether they see internet memes or  Getting tired. I don't know. Well, I think they they want the feed. Let's put to me at least  I think they want the feed to be more serious because they're hoping that it will attract advertisers. That's my own sense  I obviously know that's funny newspapers don't attract  Advertisers and and you know, my point was newspapers as sort of gatekeepers  the problem comes when when editors decide that they know what you should read and  You don't and so and I think that's part of the tension between  newspapers and other ways of consuming information if Facebook just wants to take over that role and  Say we're gonna show you a bunch of stuff that you're not actually interested in  We got people to do that. We don't need that. We already have people

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's not a lot of future in that don't we know Matthew right you say in your article on giga home comm that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook actually you're quoting Mac Isaac, but the Facebook is delaying support for animated gifts  for this reason fearing that the stream will fill with memes and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've specifically like Chris Cox the VP of product has apparently specifically mentioned that he doesn't like BuzzFeed  And so, you know if I was BuzzFeed that would certainly make me a little nervous because Facebook's a huge platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yeah, how much of their referrals come from Facebook, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So a lot of that sort of brings up the same issues around building your business based on you know  Sharing through another platform if Facebook suddenly decides like they did with social readers  Remember when the Guardian and Washington Post had social readers and their content was shared millions and millions of times and then Facebook made a tiny

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Change in the algorithm book dead. Well, you know, it's actually there man. It goes back to your analogy about SEO  Twitter  Puts your feed in whatever you asked for. There's no algorithm in the way  Facebook has an algorithm in the way Google Plus has an algorithm in the way, right?  SEO is an algorithm in the way  Those are the new gatekeepers and so they can adjust for these things  and and so yeah BuzzFeed figured out how to game Facebook and  Facebook's is evidently gonna fight back know whether they have the right  Formula for what people want but if they don't they're gonna see the numbers right off the bat. They're gonna stop

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They care about engagement and in a way it's like so you figured out a trick, you know  That involves card counting or something you're at the tables in Vegas. Well, the house always wins, right?  Facebook is the house so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and you say your headline kind of says it Matthew the new meet the new boss just like the old boss  Yeah  and and  If you have any question as to what Facebook's motivation is note that while they haven't turned on animated gifts or GIFs  They have turned on videos that auto play in the stream, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly extremely annoying but it's something advertisers would obviously want incredibly annoying and and and a big part of this is it's obscure  Right the same way newspapers were obscure. You didn't know right why the editors were choosing those stories that were on the front page  You don't know why Facebook is showing you certain things in your stream and not other things  You don't know whether it's because an advertiser  Paid them to or because their algorithm says certain things about you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just have no clue and I I feel like we can see it now  I mean I can I notice this algorithmic because it's not it's weird and I'm seeing Dan Lyons like every other post  That's can't be right and the same thing with Google+. So do you think Jeff? This means Twitter wins because it is on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's no intermediary. Well, or does it lose because  It can be junked up with memeified. Yeah, and even it has started changing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's no longer just the sort of chronological for example conversations  I don't know what you think about that, but right where where tweets are connected by a blue line  Those actually alter the flow of Twitter. So you will see old tweets show up. In fact, I see  Conversations multiple times  Sometimes that's interesting because it might be a conversation. I didn't see sometimes it's hugely irritating

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, I love you Dan Lyons. I'm not I don't want you to think cuz I follow him and I think he's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and I think he's hysterical and we're gonna have him on our show soon, but  It's just an example, but I look through my Facebook feed. Okay, so the number one post from a guy  I follow is from I can't believe it org  Strange and improbable animal friendships 30 pictures. I'm gonna click on all of these then there's an ad  For free meals from plated. I don't know what that is. I don't care

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I got that ad too  And by the way, go back up and look at the label on that the label on top of that ad says I think it's something  Like recommended post or something. Oh, it doesn't yes suggested post. It doesn't say ad it doesn't say yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does down below say sponsored it is a bit above suggested by who?  Suggested by the advertiser who paid us good money  suggested  Then it's very this is very annoying and I think maybe it also has to do with the new call-out the way these  Articles are called out. They really feel like you know, here's college humor  Here's a hub spot, which is Dan's company  Here's your chance to write a happy ending for the most heartwarming Christmas story ever  Obviously hub spot has figured this out an up worthy headline. That's very up worthy and it's got a picture of a guy and  You want to know more and what is the most heartwarming Christmas story ever? I've got to find out  You know, I mean my feet is full of this crap and it doesn't really  Endear me to it. It's become very obvious that it's algorithmic, right and you have no control over it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you don't know what's happening or why you can use the pull down and say hide this post and then maybe it will or  Maybe it won't you can use the pull down to say, you know block this user  But but you don't have a lot of fine-grained control over what you see and what you don't see and then there's this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Portray Radcliffe great photographer love him got a capital one ad because Trey Radcliffe likes capital one  And I'm bet you anything Trey Radcliffe couldn't care less about capital

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what?  I've been seeing those a lot too and I've been making a point of asking the people who supposedly liked that thing  Whether they liked it and over 50% of them said no, they never did  Well, that's really bad. Yeah, I don't know how that even happened Trey lives in New Zealand

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I doubt very much. He has a capital one credit card

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd be shocked if he does so how did that get in there? So how did that get algorithm liking things on their behalf?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I could tell you the upshot I visit Facebook much less than I used to a lot of this  I hardly ever go there now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and I think they're actually shooting themselves in the foot if what they want to become is is a  newspaper that chooses things for you to see based on what they think is quote unquote high quality or  Serious or or whatever they want to call it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's about your friends Facebook. Yes, I want to see my friends and family and what they're up to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and if they're sharing some stupid up worthier BuzzFeed thing  That's what they're up to. It's what they're doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm getting a lot of people who I follow  I mean, obviously these are all people you have to be people you follow right in your newsfeed except for the advertisers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I remember I mentioned in the post I remember in 2011  Larry Page was talking to I'm trying to remember who it was now at an event about Google News  and this person was complaining that Google News was just full of you know, frivolous stories and  There wasn't enough important kind of journalism surfaced in Google News and Larry Page said yeah, you know what?  You're right. We should fix that we should we should make more important stories show up and and my alarm bells went off  And I started thinking well, I don't want Larry Page to decide what the important stories are in my  Well, but they do already Matthew they do already there's already the choose placement

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah on basic various things and some odd things get up. So so they're already in control of that  But that was what appealed to me about Google News

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the idea of a machine doing it unbiased machine doing it but and they pick they pick authoritative sources and then let a machine  But it's not that obviously it's tweaked highly tweaked

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's obviously based on what the accumulation of media are doing. So right now the top story is  House to vote Thursday on budget deal, right?  The signal that the algorithm gets is my god. Everybody's right about a budget deal must be important  So so it's already the the agglomeration of the media

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook's playing a dangerous game here. I think a lot of the problem is the black box issue, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't know what Google's algorithm is doing. You don't know what Facebook's algorithm is doing  There's no option to say I want to see more of these things less of those things or there's no obvious way to do that  Or there's no obvious way to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so you're not even working to Matthew is that the the I think and I guess there's some new editing possible on the google news  Android app which I haven't i've gotten yet and played with but i've always been surprised at google news  Which is moving toward relevance and personalization elsewhere  Away from the one size fits all search result, for example that google news be one size fits all is rather absurd to me  Um, yeah, I could pick certain categories, but that's not that's not learning enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know and I keep I keep saying it over and over and over if for the last probably three four years  I don't understand why google they've got to have  Reams of information that would allow them to help you customize google news and yet they seem to have no interest in doing that whatsoever  I just don't understand it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's take a break and come back I want to I want to get our timing right on this one  We've got Matthew ingram giga home here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh  It's the biggest it's the biggest set top box roku last time I checked this is so this is a few months ago  Roku, I think was it 13 million  And then it trails off rapidly after that  But you know time magazine said the chromecast is the gadget of the year 2013 and google's chromecast added. Uh, I think 10 new  channels, I guess what we've what it seems to be now is that  Google has become is the gatekeeper and what they want to do is do kind of big rollouts  So they want to do it in clumps. So um hbo go which I was watching the other day on my chromecast. That's awesome  Vivo the music service beyond pod, which is a podcasting client  Unfortunately paid a podcasting client. You have to have the paid version to get the chromecast working  Um  Some oddball stuff vicki, which is I don't know what it is korean and anime and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's an odd list. It's not a very exciting list. Yeah hulu plus though. That's exciting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh pandora's been out for a while. So  You know, I think I don't know how well these are selling but I think chromecast is getting more and more interesting, isn't it?  And that was the idea and it's so easy to use and it's so cheap  So then the new stuff includes red bull tv  Inspirational programming from red bull songs is great. It's a music service. I love that  Plex is great because it means you can and this is important play local content  Yeah, plex is great through your chromecast. So if you've got a plex server and you have to pay for the  Uh the paid version of it for this right now, although I bet it'll go free  post from the washington post post tv  Uh vicki  And the real player cloud. I didn't even know real player was still in business. Yeah, I was gonna say oh real player

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  real player cloud enables you to move watch and share your videos the idea is  That you can watch your own content and including some, you know divx and mkv and xvid and some of the oddball formats. So  Uh, I don't think you have to install a real player on your  Chromecast I think it's just you install it on your iphone your android phone  And uh the real player cloud is what you need to install  I like the idea that you could play your own local videos finally without the tabcast  That was kind of always a little funky  So now you got one two, three, four five six, seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen services  And now we are not a revision three's in there. We are not um, I I think that's because revision three  Uh, first of all is discovery channels company and that helps, uh, but I think they also have their own app  I know houdini7. We have our apps are not done in house. They're done by third parties who decide to they're volunteers  And I know houdini7 said he was going to add chromecast capability to his twit app  For ios and android the problem is I think that google has to approve you  and so you have to be in some sort of and I I presume that this is what we're going to start seeing is every  Every week or so leading up to the  Holiday, I guess you get two more weeks before christmas. Uh, they'll announce another chunk of stuff  Um, you can you can stream us from a chrome tab that does work  Um houdini7 says yeah, i'm just waiting on google houdini is uh,  Craig milani of shift key software. He says he's waiting on google approval  So, uh craig we're gonna we're gonna be in touch because I think what we want to do is see if we could  Hello google i'm pulling these strings. Hello google  Are you there is anyone there from google anybody at google? Are you out there? Please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Well, they have the new interface, you know, you know, it's nice. It's a slideshow  Every 10 seconds beautiful pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but oh audra mcdonald was amazing in it though she can sing she was the  Seeking actually saying the head sister whatever they call that she really can't  What was she good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry  It was um, I noticed that twitter in particular  You know one of their big sort of selling points is that it it makes live events  like that more enjoyable and  I since I was watching it anyway, because my daughters and wife were watching it  um  Twitter made it more enjoyable because it you know  There was live snark sort of while it was going on and basically live reviews of the show as it was going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So mad that I didn't launch twitter  But see we're in the western time zone. So it's kind of screwed up because right all the twitter people I see the  You know first three hours earlier all of the tweets  A lot of them going nazis nazis that seemed to be a big one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Son jake was gonna was gonna build that app a few years ago didn't but yeah, what a great idea  You should be able to watch something socially whenever you want to watch it. Yeah. Yeah  The irony of twitter is it adds the necessity of live we got away from live and everything except sports  Yeah, and now an event like that. You're right. It's it's it's so much worse if you don't have twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google says 91.4 percent to be precise  Of non-spam email sent to gmail users are now authenticated  Using anti-phishing standards and you're explaining that to me. I know it's so funny. I was gonna ask you  There's two systems that are used  And it's up to your isp or your email provider to do this the domain key identified email or sender policy framework  The reason there's two is because microsoft wanted one everybody else wanted another. How does that guarantee you're not a fisher?  It authenticates you  That this is coming from your domain that this is you sending it  Right. Um, so it's in effect. It's like us. It's like without your knowledge. It's in the background. It's signing it  It stops spoofing. Yeah  And and if you're gonna fish or spam you don't want to you're gonna spoof. You don't want your real email on there  Right, right, right. Okay. Now I understand. Thank you  Interestingly is a lot of isps hedged their bet and did both 74 percent almost 75 are both dkim and spf  Over half a million domains are using dkim  Spf which I think is the microsoft standard is only three and a half million domains. Anyway, that's that's good  Um  It is the way to end spam and and certainly is effective in phishing too is to have authenticated email  The problem is users don't want to do anything. So this is all done kind of behind their backs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  spf is also the  sunscreen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has an spf of 30  For no spam passing through I I may my memory on this is pretty  This is old this is old stuff, but yeah, it was microsoft's um sender id framework  Spf  Sender policy framework, so that's good news. Anyway, uh  so  The time has come for us to go to the store to buy presents. We can't afford for people who won't like them  We call it christmas

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have daughters and so now my oldest is old enough. I just get her to buy everything  Because a she knows  What's good and what's a good idea and b she knows what her mother wants and what she doesn't want  And so like I just outsource all my shopping to her that's smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's smart. See my see what kids buy you something you hate. That's cute  Yeah, like my son last year. He's 18  Last year and I hope he's not listening right now. He bought me a novel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What did you do with it? It's like you can you do it's on my bookshelf? Yeah. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the other great thing is my my  Let's just put it this way grandparents can also buy magnificently ridiculous gifts. Oh, yeah, and there's that moment  When you sit around say oh, let's open those now so we can have a good laugh, right? We open those on christmas eve

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The aunt gift the grandparent gift my mother bought I think it was last christmas or the christmas before  I'm not kidding a pound of coffee  and  Pound of coffee and uh, uh a hat like a baseball cap with the ear muff things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that was very baseball cap with ear muffs. That's very canadian. That's very yeah, but one of those in canada. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it was with you matthew in brine kubernetes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I bought it. It's a brisk brisk commerce and ear muff based bar caps in victoria. I mean, they're actually they're very comfortable

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, it was a lovely thought the reason I bring it up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course is because uh this year more than ever and it always is true every year now  People are going to be doing this stuff online, you know, somebody suggested an amazon wishlist  That would be one way to let people know what you wanted  um  According to a danny sullivan writing in search engine land two recent surveys suggest google shopping  Uh google's paid shopping site isn't leading searchers to the best prices on products and that's no surprise because it is a paid

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's advertising  advertising which which danny's always been very mad at google for switching this and I don't blame him actually  He's been outraged. This is this to him and I think is the lowest thing google's done is get rid of its legitimate  Shopping engine and put it in an advertising mechanism. I'm not disagreeing with him necessarily microsoft actually, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's part big part of their scroogled  Is you know, you think shopper is an independent search engine. It's not it's ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think part of what what danny's problem is that they said they wouldn't do that, right?  So they're specifically doing things that they used to say they would never do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you um do a google search  And he shows by the way  According to some surveys consumer watchdog said there was a  20 dollar price gap between what was listed on google shopper and what was listed as the lowest price for the same item on  price grabber or shopzilla or next tag which are actually  shopping comparison engines  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I think google should not have gotten out of the I think they should have it was an opportunity  Friendly thing for consumers to give real prices. I don't think the revenue was that much on that shopping stuff  Uh, yeah, I think I think it was wrong to drop it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So do a search he does a search here for hamilton beach two sliced metal toaster the kind of search somebody who  Knows what they're going to get uh, but wants to find the best price would do  He gets of course the uh yellow box with ads in it and everybody knows to ignore that although it does go quite  A way down the page then he gets this sponsored box  from google shopper  And these are all paid ads only people who pay sears kmart jc penny  walmart only the people who pay are going to get on there and these prices  You might because you're seeing the dollar amount you might reasonably say we've seen boxes like this on amazon and elsewhere that these are the  best prices  Google does not show the prices in the regular search. So I think it's not unreasonable to think that these are the best prices  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is what you would expect. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think there is an opportunity, right?  And of course if you click it you get pulled to the google shopper site, which again is just advertising  Yeah, maybe go to amazon or price  you know next tag or  One of these other price grabber one of these other sites

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I saw a story today. I think in the times where where I see it keith kelly has come out with his new  um tools  Piece is basically basically a print blog  Kevin kelly tools kevin kelly. Sorry kevin kelly cool tools is so good  Cool tools. So now he has a great product. He's a print product based on that. I have it. It's awesome  And you the qr code takes you straight to amazon and I presume he's getting a spiff on every sale made that way  I would hope I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope he does. Oh, it's so good that book. We're gonna have kevin on him  Let's talk about it mark fronfelder. I think helped him on it. It is the is the whole earth catalog  That's the point. Yeah, it was the back. I got a really pop  from it  Really? Yeah, but I you know, they have qr codes in there  But you know I did probably what most normal people are going to do which is I made a note  Oh whirly pop went to amazon got the price and bought it. Although I have to say I do not do price comparison  I just figure amazon's going to be the best price  And it does have uh free shipping and free shipping

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hmm and soon it'll be a drone coming to your door and then how can you resist that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, wouldn't that be cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the chat room is telling me that uh, according to tech crunch confirming it from multiple sources  Instagram which is having a bit of a show tomorrow. We thought it was going to be all about printing  Will be surprising people it isn't just about printing instagram is launching a messaging service  This year. Yeah, actually ohm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ohm wrote about that had a bit of a scoop saying that that was coming. He knew what is it?  He knew a couple days ago, right?  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Messaging is huge. You look at uh, what was the amount of traffic? What's app?  Handles and this is in a very competitive field too. I mean, there's dozens of these guys  So it's a very pop very powerful stuff. And of course google hangouts, uh, and apple's message messages are  Doing this using sms on your phone in addition to the internet one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, I just got prompted by google, um to swap out my messaging app for hangouts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've done that on my phones and I don't know if I hate it. I don't like it. Why?  Um, it's a it's a heavyweight and sms was lightweight

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I know what you mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's just too much ui. It's hard to get back to the messages. It's just it's it's not cramming too much in together  Listen, I like hangouts. I use hangouts to leo's consternation. I use hangouts  But they're they're trying to throw in too many kitchen sinks into yeah, I agree there's too much in one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  SMS was so simple. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm really you know, I have the hang you know in the in the doc on my android phone  I have phone and then used to have messages, you know sms and now I have hangouts, but  I think i'm going to go back to messages

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They actually kind of screwed up the phone thing too. I don't know about you but on my nexus  the whole display  I know it's the same thing when you pull it up. It's now so confusing. I can't tell  So I I tap on people and accidentally call them but I really just wanted to look at their information. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so they need to do some work there. I think they made a big deal about oh the new phone ui and kit kat  It's so great. It's no they're putting too much stuff in there. This is we need just we want to  simplicity was it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and of course that used to be google's big thing, right?  We just have a bar a box right simplicity was the whole deal  And now I wish they could get a little bit of that back. This is the entropy of technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The entropy of technology is complexity. It's feature creep. Yeah, and there's nothing anybody could do about it. It's a law of nature

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and the only people who can prevent that are guys like steve jobs who basically has people killed  Right, you know when when they had new features  No, no  because designers and developers well  I would just add this little thing because five people might think it's cooler because we think it's not just technology when I when I started

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  entertainment weekly I  They were basically done with the design six weeks beforehand and then they the designers kept futzing and I didn't know enough to stop them  They futzed and futzed and made it awful look at car designs. They get over futzed  What seems a real danger in design anyway futz no more futzing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stop futzing. That's why you need a steve jobs who really wasn't a designer

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  he was nobody he knew the most important principle, which is  It's what you take out right what you don't include that has a huge impact on the usability. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, we need another steve. So oh malik scooped him november 22nd on giga ohm  He said what's instagram's next big thing messaging perhaps tech crunch is saying now more sources confirming that  That's an example of feature creep  Instagram did the same damn thing they started with a very simple clean  You post pictures and then it became videos now. It's gonna be messaging. This is not good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and that's you know, it's facebook, right? Right the facebook the king of futzing  Yeah, the whole reason they bought it was because it was part of this huge wave  That they want to be part of and so they're they're they're trying to write it  Um, you know, they've tried their own messaging how many times now they've tried to  To do that kind of whatsapp or to get their messenger app to be used by more people and people just won't do it  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gene munster  Who depending on  Who's me on that show? Yeah, mr ed munster herman munster gene munster of piper jaffray is an analyst and um  Apple guys he does a lot of apple stuff and apple guys just you know mock him frankly  But he does do something which I think is quite good and I think he's attempting to be very objective and serious  He does a annual comparison of  Google now versus siri google voice search versus siri and they do this pretty rigorously 800 queries  Under a variety of controlled and uncontrolled  conditions  He gave google a c plus which was better than the d minus it got a year ago and siri  A c plus up slightly from the c  Last year and it's based on  You know ability to answer questions  To correct when correctly heard whether it was correct or incorrect when correctly heard heard correctly heard incorrectly in a variety of environments  um, and you know  Really if you look at the numbers, they are very similar

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I get so frustrated. I mean, you know, this is this is I should complain you can talk to your phone and it does things for you  If it's right half the time, that's pretty amazing  But when it's wrong, there's no way to for me correct it. No way for us to learn. Yeah, that's what's  You know, can I just spell the word for you? You idiot?  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well in in normal as a speech to text like drag and dictate you do have that capability  Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I don't know why they didn't put it here because it's because it's you know  I have a restaurant I go to often called urban table and it'll get you know, 25 variations on it  And and I and I you know shot it's in my phone book words are there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are just certain things that  You know, you can't dictate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's one of my that's one of my sort of  theories about speech recognition and actually other things that are computer aided  Even if they're 98 percent accurate that two percent is so irritating  That's that's all you think about is the irritating part not the 98 percent where no you're exactly right that's exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How I measure the quality of those old style text to speech. I'm sorry speech to text systems like dragon dictate is  How what the percentage is correct and it usually is, you know, 95 98 percent  And more importantly how easy it is to fix it if it's wrong  Because you're going to spend if you spend two percent of the time fixing it. It's got to be easy. So it doesn't get in your way  What was that? You can't usually  Realistic telemarketing robots. This is related. This is crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  um  Let me just play it. There's there's two and you almost have to have to listen to both of these these are from telemarketing

Transcript:  That's pretty this is this is like the great howard stern  Stick where where richard and sal will take ridiculous pieces of audio and call somebody with them, but they'll just have a name  um  Yeah, and and oh they're doing still and it's they use a soundboard. Yeah, yeah  They can keep going for five minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, who is your daddy? Who's your daddy? That's exactly  I am not a robot. I wonder what that platform is because now I can imagine sal and richard

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're just typing away things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, you have not me. Uh, that's because we've gotten better at this. It's not that hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does he do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now wouldn't it be interesting if we learned that the amazon mayday gal is a robot thinking of that  No wonder she didn't mind when the guy hit on her

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What was her little aw aw aw

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh  nexus tv this comes from the information jessica lessens do  Uh pay walled blog which I paid for although now that I think about it isn't such a deal  It costs about the same as a wall street journal and gives you maybe an article or two a day  Nevertheless, they've got really good people. She brought amir afrati who has excellent contacts at google over  From the journal, of course jessica lessens has been a really good astute reporter on the apple folk to me. It's worth it  But because I bought it I can now show you the whole article  Um, which I probably shouldn't do actually ask jessica. She was on twitter. She said no  No, that's why we expect people to do that didn't somebody uh business insider somebody say we're gonna publish every single article

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah business insider said if they get anything good, it was fascinating nick carlson said  Uh, I think jessica and the information are gonna work out pretty well  And he and he said if she gets this many subscribers, right she can turn it into a pretty good business  But if she gets anything good, we're gonna tell you all about it, right?  So don't bother subscribing she actually interviewed her and wrote a post about it and she said the same thing that  She actually expects and she's hoping that sites will do that because that's going to help market the site

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and and presumably if you're a subscriber, you'll get it quicker and sooner and  She's smart enough to say i'm going to target people just as the wall street journal does who's for whom this information is money  Right, uh, that's the only person who's gonna pay 400 bucks for it  And so for those people having it right away instead of waiting for nick carlson to  Synopsize it or or determine what's important will make a difference and she does have very good people. It's an interesting  You know, i'm not a fan of the paywall  But I do think that the journal has succeeded and she may very well succeed because of the audience

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there's a high end  Possibly but but but it puts the requirement on her to work really hard because in the tech blog world  So much of the junk is just repeated over and over and over again and weakened along the way  It's over covered

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But isn't that I mean wouldn't she say that's the opportunity for her? Yep. She's gonna have unique stuff  It'll she'll be the first. Yes. That'll be repeated again and again in  you know, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Telephone fashion, let's be honest at some point. It's about leaks right michael larry's about sources  It's about sources and sources leaks. Yep, and and what's the interest of the leaker?  Which is a few often a official company person putting in trouble or not  What's their interest in putting it on the information versus putting it on?  Gigo

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah, that's interesting. That's a good point if they want  If they want specific readers, then the information might be worthwhile. But if they want  broad

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sort of readership that might not be right. Yeah, and and you know, i'm sure amir and jessica  Uh  Have the contacts because they were at the journal  The question is whether those people will continue to feed them information right at the information  We want to do that. We want to we i'm really tired of of this network being just an echo chamber for  Uh, I want to have I don't want to read what the verge said. I want the verge to read what we said  And that requires spending some money hiring people with connections  Um, it's that's it's challenging. Is that is that some of your plan for the news?  It is I think that that's what we need to do. We need to be um,  Uh, we need to have people working for us who have contacts who can get the story  Yeah  Uh, and it's it's I don't know if we're gonna be able to do it  But I think that's the way that's what we need. That's what we need to do  We you know, we've got the analysis side down great  I mean, I think we have really smart people matthew and and jeff and and steve and paul and mary joe and all  We got great people  Authoritative voices john cd work who analyzed great. We just now we need

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For some reporters to be quoted. How does that work out in the timing of video?  So if if something breaks well, you've got a stupid love and a clock do it at 11 o'clock  You'll do it 11 o'clock break in and then and then put it up as a video that gets quoted

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why i've hired a full-time news director. Yeah. Well, there's lots of journalists being laid off from lots of  Yeah, they are cheaper than they used to be  Market pool, um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's like, you know, it's still challenging because I mean, um, you know  This is we're making the transition from being a podcast little podcasts to being a information network  That's expensive, you know  To do it, especially without venture funding  So one of the stories jessica had in the information google's latest takeover attempt for tv  nexus  tv google's tried of course with google tv and they've got the chromecast but the  Nexus tv would be a set top box  Amir afrati actually writing this story in the information. What's the difference between that and chromecast then?  Well, that's not a set top box. It's more like a google tv, which is a set top box  It's powered by android  Uh, it has been designed to both be a television, you know thing and a video game console for playing android apps  So think uya  It might come with a separate touchpad remote control  The box which doesn't carry live tv like a cable box does may be controlled through a smartphone or tablet  this does sound a little bit like a  Like a high-end chromecast  And will be aggressively priced  This is a tough business I mentioned the numbers, uh the the number one product the apple tv  I'm sorry. I said 31 millions 13 million. I apologize. Oh wow. I reversed the numbers 8 million for the roku  The total for all of them is well under 30  So no wonder apple calls had a hobby  Yeah, I got the numbers reversed I apologize  Yeah, 13 million is not like anything to go right home about  Did you guys read the vanity fair article about uh marissa meyer? I didn't  No, I skimmed it  Is it a hit piece? That's what some said

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think it's a well, I wouldn't say it's a hit piece. I mean  It's not a sort of fawning. You know, she's the best thing that ever happened to a company piece, but it's critical in  some spots particularly of her sort of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  personality, um, they call her the arrogant imperious  Cold  Uh, and yes others say best ceo i've ever worked for

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And a lot of that is is and the arguments made before but I think it's true  It's sexist that there are things said about her that wouldn't be said about men

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know if a man if a ceo a male ceo is  tough

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cold imperious has to be tougher, right? Yeah, she has to be yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But anybody if a man was as tough as she was nobody would say they would say he's good. He's aggressive

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's a tough ceo that'd be good. It's all about how she she makes people wait, you know outside her office  for  appointment well  Okay, yes, why who's that boss?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean you think andy grove didn't do that paul avalini didn't do that larry page doesn't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no cookies and milk and she doesn't  She doesn't give you a happy face on your you know, and your view performance report

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could she just please put a circle above her eyes?  Just a little circle dot maybe a heart once in a while

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She interrupts people. Oh, so I got a question pretty late. Okay. Yeah, if you were katie kurik's producer on yahoo  What would you make news on yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is katie kurik has for years been a pigeonholed in this soft feature news thing, right?  She's done some hard news. Well, sure. So she was the anchor cbcb news. Sure  She has yeah, but you know why they made her anchors soft in the news. Oh, yeah. Okay  Um, I don't know you don't come from the today show and it'd be seen as a hard-hitting journalist. Yeah, that's true  Yeah, so I don't know and what she's done most recently is a daytime

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gab fest does it does it make sense to you making her some sort of global anchor for yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does that make sense to you? Well, she's a name and she's probably the best name they could get but what's she gonna do?  Like that's what jeff's saying. What what do you do with katie kurik?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's not be cynical let's let's let's let's treat this  You know, I as I said earlier today  I I want to reinvent tv news because it needs reinventing  And and I was I was asked by weekend edition to come on and talk about katie kurik  So I decided to make it into my own agenda. My own agenda was I hope barissa is very smart katie's smart  They can break away from the stupid conventions of tv. They can reinvent what tv news is  So I still want to come back to the idea of what should it be? What could it be?  Let's let's let's help them out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think part of the problem is and this is a really difficult one to solve that  It's still the person up  On a stage had as well. Yeah addressing the crowd  Agreed and um, I don't think that's what the internet era wants or needs. I think they want a conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so there's one thing go ahead the morning stream watch the stream on al jazera. No, I haven't  Um, I I haven't watched it in a while but I I was on a few times and it was it was  Trying to do a show  You know informed by social media informed by the audience with bringing in members of the audience  um, uh  akhmed she had  Elden i'm gonna get his name wrong, but he's on he's with hovington post live now  He was a co-host and they they would bring on  Uh bring in people who'd been commenting about a story as well as news clips  so they're trying to turn it into more of a  You know a social thing which which a lot of media and information is now instead of just  Here's a clip  with our guy  standing in front of a building downtown

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, right and you see the same thing with cnn you saw, you know shepherd smith with his big ass tables  Uh, you know the whole idea is let's get the twitter feed involved

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we got to cut cut down to the fundamentals of what what video can do  Well, this is what again why I raise you one thing that it can do is explain  Yeah  Uh, another thing it can do is it can summarize. Yeah  um  You know, what are the key attributes?  and advantages that video  Whether it's broadcast on the internet or broadcast on on the airwaves  What are the attributes of that that one could capture and rethink?  Rather than the stupid conventions of standing in front of the building that burned down 12 hours ago when things happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's the hard part is that a lot of stories particularly some important stories  There aren't any visuals

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's just nothing visual about it. No exactly and that doesn't stop. Look at this. It's just a bunch of guys talking about stuff  That's true. Yeah, that's true  I think that's what kate and by the way, that's what katie kurik should do. She should  Uh have conversations on maybe it isn't bringing in the twitter the twitter roti  Maybe it's maybe it's it's having conversations with with people who knew nelson mandela or something  But that's what it should be conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It shouldn't be I think it's a claiming and actually huffing post having to post live does a good job with their they use google hangouts  They'll have five or six people  Um, they're all you know in the hangout admittedly the technical quality is not great  Um, but they at least bring in lots of voices instead of yeah  I want to do more with that actually the one person academic they can fly into the studio, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's challenging. I don't know what the answer is. Believe me if I did i'd be doing it  Somebody in the chat room by the way says and I this is I didn't know this she's that katie kurik's  Uh, it's rsx 11m in our chat room says on the day of 9 11 katie kurik's coverage was the best of all the mainstream media

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Channels, maybe he's very smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not in fact, this is not a reflection on her and as he points or she points out  The it could be the it was the way she was managed. It was it could be the way the executives saw her as opposed to what her capabilities

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Were I just don't understand what yahoo is going to do  That's different, you know and jeff your point is a good one. They need to reinvent the format somehow

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do they the worst thing that can happen newspapers have been trying to mimic tv  Right, let's have somebody sit there in front and tell you a story and go to video a lot and  Yeah, and scripts just bought a company called newsie that does that that that tries to mimic hate that television  Let's stop that. There's nothing to mimic there. It's crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we are I mean, this is very much a tv meme a tv trope. Yes. We got cameras, you know angles  Yeah, that's true. You do a table

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you you you added them on as they were valuable if you go back to the cottage

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we didn't well we didn't have a table. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you didn't have a lot of that and and so then you added them on as you felt they added value and i'm fine with that  But doing them because big tv does them is not the reason to do them. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Holograms, that's the future

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who do you ask? Do you ask you ask the internet native right? What do they want?  Well, what do they do right now? They watch youtube, but that's because they're so young

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had tim pool, you know tim pool  Tim's the guy who who live streamed occupy wall street for 21 hours straight and and vice very cleverly hired him  So I had him in my office  And I had a class in my office and I sat around I said, you know, what's the future tv?  I'm asking people this now and his response  Was not to rethink the video screen. He thought what was around the video screen  He thought about the interactions of people about topics and and a bunch of video streams people who are witnesses to something  And then some structure where you kind of kind of pull up the best or what's important into it  So so he didn't think that video was this isolated thing this window you look through that instead it was something that added  To the notion of what we see on the web

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's what that's exactly what the stream was trying to do pulling in youtube videos pulling in eyewitness  Photos pulling it wasn't just twitter chatter. It was actual it was trying to in real time  You know sort of crowd source the news instead of just picking one talking head  And talking to them for 15 minutes and then going to commercial. Can we even watch it anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it on algerzira english or it's on at 7 30?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Eastern yeah, and as I say, I haven't watched it in a little while  But I thought they really did some interesting things and and it was much more open  You know what? I think one of the criticisms of of tv news is that it's just  It's the same talking heads and it's the same format and it's the same questions and you're getting virtually zero

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, here's the other thing about it, too  It's the same plastic voice, you know what I love about the twit network is that I think that like I read it man  I am what you're seeing  This is exactly what you get. I am what I am  It's not what I go on cnn and you automatically go into well howie, right?  Uh voice, you know and and the thing I tell people about leo  All the time is that even though you have a radio voice, you're as nice as the radio voice  Maybe you get more angry sometimes off the air than on hey chad, does he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, but no, but I don't do it off the air. I mean I mean in fact somebody  Somebody tweeted me boy. I wouldn't want to work for leo laporte. He is so mean to his employees after the show  And I said hey, I am what I am. That's why we want you to watch it. I realized that this is a reality show  Oh, it's real reality because I appreciate that  So maybe that's what you do. That's what you do with katie kirk. You break the wall break the wall exactly  Because you know what I bet she's really likable  Yeah, she is  she is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's what you do and irreverent and things you can't be when you're when you're reading a script. Oh my god katie kirk real

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, what would that be like and the problem is for somebody like katie kirk who has so many years doing this  And it's so contained. It's very hard and scary and risky to be real

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, what did it take for you though? You you're on tv, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're on radio  I was lucky and early in my not so early 10 or 15 years of my radio career  I had a program director who said you're not genuine  And uh, he said go take improv classes. I want you to break it down. I want you to see that. Yeah  And it was very good advice  I did all that and because he what he said is I think you know, and that that is the advice I give to everybody  Who works with me?  Here is what we're looking for is who is your real  See what people do they get on camera and they get lights on them and they get a microphone they put on a  Mask, it's protective  So if you can get the mask off and be yourself and then the problem is sometimes people won't like that person

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you're kind of like i'm just gonna say some of those people who have masks they're just  Unpleasant people. That's right. But then you then you're then you're not gonna be a star. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You gotta get a real job

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's part going back to stern it's it's it's metaphorically it's our stern small penis, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's him saying I have to be he was genuine and it's and it was so refreshing  He was such a huge success because nobody on the radio was normal  Right, right. No, that's a good point and nobody's willing to talk for endlessly about boring stuff or personal stuff  And he was and that was that was refreshing and I think that's where katie kirk  If you could make her be like howard stern just you know, let it all hang out kari katie

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if you look at the successes of even even people like anderson cooper during sort of crisis events  One of the things that I think resonates with people is when they respond right as human beings to those events, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is very rare  But I do but there are sure, you know, I I for a long time I did live with kelly and regis though  They were very genuine on the air  A daily show does that it's very hard and I think maybe because of her today's show experience  It wouldn't be so hard to do that. I think that's that's what she should there you go. Yeah, we got there  We got to your answer. Let it all hang out katie

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I actually I I I when I after I I tweeted that I had done the weekend edition thing  With this hope about katie and she tweeted back really so yeah, so awesome

Transcript:  So you don't know who it is. He wrote a a great post about how he was hugely skeptical of twitter because  He's kind of a leadite and you know his his lifestyle and his his work goes back centuries hasn't changed in centuries  Um, but he's he really took to it and he shares a lot of photos  Um that are just fascinating and it's it's strangely compelling  So it's it's as completely kind of the other end of the spectrum as you could imagine from sort of  tech and silicon valley and so on but he's really got away with um,  Just sort of giving you a snapshot of his life and what it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, kind of strange, but I really enjoy it. Well, if you're gonna do that i'm gonna do stephen cron  Who is drawing underscore daily?  He does if you follow him, he'll draw you as a monster  Disclaimer monsters may vary in quality and monsterness  So if you if you read his tweets whenever anybody follows him he draws a little monster for that person, right?  So the poor guy is going to now be flooded  But isn't that cute?  Yeah, it isn't amazing that even after all these years some there's still new and original stuff on twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's what amazed that's why I wrote about it because his sort of he was so new to it and he was so  Not interested in that type of stuff, but he got an iphone  And he said now I have the ability to take pictures and share my lifestyle with people and he's had a huge response
