Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but not all.  You have a very brief window.  It's great to see you from Fortune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's been a very long day in the summer.  Yeah.  And there he is in his garden with his orange trees.  Kevin Mark showing off his California backyard.  There we go.  Jeff Jarvis has the week off,  but I think we'll muddle through with these two great minds.  It's always a pleasure to have you both.  Thanks for joining us.  And it really is true that this show  has not restricted itself to Google in a long time, if ever.  But it's when you get great people together  to talk about technology.  One of the things I was asking before the show,  and Kevin Marks, of course, one of the mavens  behind the Indie Web camp and the Indie Web movement,  the idea of the web for the rest of us.  One of the guests we had on this week  on our triangulation show was the inventor  of the Wiki, Ward Cunningham.  And his newest effort, the Federated Wiki,  which is a really interesting idea that,  if it baffles you, Kevin Marks, it's well over my head.  But it was an Indie Web camp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was shown it at the Indie Web camp.  And it was one of the things that,  when Ward shows you, you think,  that makes a certain amount of sense.  I can see what I can do with this.  And then I installed it on my own site.  So I've got wiki.kevinmarks.com,  and I haven't actually used it.  So it's been sitting there for a couple of years,  and I've been going, oh, well.  And I don't think to go there, which is interesting.  And I think the challenge with Wikis is that Wikis,  you can use a Wiki on your own, and I have friends who do,  but it makes much more sense when you're using it  with a group of other people to curate something.  So they're like, indiewebcamp.com is a Wiki.  And basically, the way we run that community  is a mixture of continuous chat that we have in IRC  and on the web and in Slack, all mirrored to each other,  and a Wiki to collect the stuff  that should be a bit more permanent.  So we can chat about stuff.  And then when somebody has something that makes sense  to preserve or when somebody asks a question, we answer it.  We preserve the answer on the Wiki.  So the Wiki becomes this sort of community  repository of knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's cool, isn't it?  I love Wiki. I love the idea of Wiki.  One of the things I told Ward right away is this is,  I think, really what Tim Berners-Lee's  original conception of the web was,  was a collaborative document with hyperlinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  I had one that was all about me because of the fact ...  Well, A, because I'm fascinated with myself.  It's a great subject.  But I thought I could have a spot  where instead of waiting for someone  to do a bad Wiki page for me,  I could just create my own Wiki  and put a bunch of stuff in there.  And if people wanted to look at it, they could.  And it just, I don't know, there was no point to it in a way  because there was no one else contributing.  I think, to Kevin's point,  it doesn't really become interesting  until there's other people in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or we've got a reason to document it or do stuff with it.  Yeah.  Tantech Chilick has his own Wiki. Tantech ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's where I got the idea.  Well, I've used Wiki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I, for a long time, the radio show website was a Wiki  because I had this silly notion  that the listeners of the radio show  might want to go in there and contribute to it.  I did that.  Not so much. There was a lot of spam.  And what I ... I mean, of course,  Wikipedia is the, you know,  the paragon of what Wiki is all about.  But you need a community around it,  an active community and people who will patrol it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually started one when I was at the newspaper,  The Globe and Mail.  I don't know if you remember, I think it was at the LA Times.  Someone tried a Wiki editorial.  Do you remember that? Years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. What an interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was an interesting idea and a total disaster.  Of course it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they did that on purpose. I mean, that was their way of ...  Was it?  Of course. And they said basically,  we're writing an editorial that's a Wiki  just to show that Wikis are a bad idea.  That was my sense of it because ...  Oh, really? Okay.  It set up an interesting thing.  I mean, so it was a no editorial  which would not be edited by the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So anyway, they were right because it was a disaster.  But so I tried one when I was at The Globe  and what I wanted was people to discuss a specific topic.  So if the newspaper was talking about the Middle East,  I thought it'd be great to have kind of live,  not a discussion so much as people contributing  their thoughts or links or commentary that they found  or interesting things because there's no real way to do that.  In a newspaper, you can have an op-ed piece  and then maybe someone writes a letter.  So I was exploring the sort of almost real-time  but asynchronous contributions from readers.  And it was fascinating because it wasn't a disaster,  but it wasn't actually a huge success either.  You know, I got maybe a few thousand people contributing,  but we got some really smart contributions  that just never really kind of gained any steam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then that was that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's always about, you know,  work practices and whether you use it.  So way back when I was at Apple,  I set up a Wiki for the Quartime team  internally inside the firewall.  Really?  Because we were, because Wikis were cool  and we were getting fed up with mailing around Word documents  to describe new features and things.  So we built, and the PMs were grumpy  because the engineers would never respond  to their Word document emails.  And so I set up a Wiki for the Quartime team  so we could discuss, you know, upcoming features  and things we wanted to do.  And the engineers went into it  and actually started documenting things,  which made the PMs happy because they had something to read.  So it worked fairly well for a bit.  And then one day, my manager called me to his office  and said, that Wiki you've set up,  you need to put security on it.  I said, did someone outside see our plan?  He said, no, but the other group can see what we're doing.  Well, there you go.  It kind of sums up the map.  It kind of misses the point.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had multiple, I had a Wiki for our digital staff  and sort of social media.  And then some other department had a Wiki  and then someone else had, you know, a doc  or they had Microsoft SharePoint or something.  We could never get everyone on the same,  using the same tool.  So it was sort of duplicating things everywhere.  Actually, the Federated Wiki would have  worked really well for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm very intrigued by Wiki still,  but Ward's particular iteration is interesting  because of the Federation,  the idea that the Wiki will live in multiple places.  But then,  Federation is a challenge because for instance,  there have been attempts to do Federated Twitter.  That's what Evan Padromo tried to do with app.net.  And the notion, which notionally seems like a great idea  is that there are multiple servers  and that what you tweet to app.net on one server  is then somehow migrated to the others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Evans was something different though.  Evans wasn't app.net.  Evans was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he was did app.net.  They just renamed it to something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, Evan Padromo did...  Status.  Status, they changed it to Status.net, but it was...  It was Identica and then it was Status.net.  Identica, that's right.  Right.  And now that code base is GNU Social.  So that's perhaps been open sourced.  And there's actually a...  There is a fairly widespread federation  of GNU Social instances, which is kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it and I love the idea,  but I don't understand really...  How it works.  Yeah, federation is bigger than my mind, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's not the way we think about...  Yeah, you think about site, site, site, site, site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are thinking about sites as being a canonical thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that is the challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you go to quitter.no or quitter.se,  this is GNU Social  fought with a sin that looks like Twitter,  or looks like slightly retro Twitter.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're losing your bandwidth here.  Tell your daughter or your son to stop bit-touring.  My son's in London, that way.  That's right.  Well, he can't mess you up from there.  We're a federation of micro bloggers,  quitter.no, who care about social justice and solidarity  and want to quit the centralized capitalist services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Power to the people.  So that's quitter.no.  And the thing is, quitter.se did this,  they've took GNU Social, which looked like,  I don't know if they did,  and then they made a skin for it  that makes it look like Twitter looks...  Looks so much like Twitter.  A few iterations ago.  This isn't quite like today's Twitter.  It's not today's Twitter.  Early Twitter.  And it's federated.  And it's federated.  So if you go to...  If you go to the...  Actually, I'm gonna have to do this logged out,  because I'm logged into mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This might be timely, because I feel like,  the only thing keeping Twitter alive at this point  is a lack of a reasonable alternative.  You know what I mean?  I love what Twitter does.  I really do.  And all you have to do is watch the Academy Awards  on Sunday night.  Actually, you better be watching it live,  because if you're not,  then Twitter will spoil the whole thing for you.  But if you're watching live,  and watching the tweets live,  it's like sitting around with your friends.  Exactly.  It's really fun.  And so I love Twitter.  But it has problems, right?  I mean, it's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it has...  Part of the problems are because there's too many people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter was actually great when there were fewer people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think that's not it.  I think I've written a long essay about this,  The thing is, Twitter actually worked as a place  where different sets of people could coexist originally,  because you chose who you were following.  And so what you primarily saw was the people you followed.  And yeah, originally they had a public timeline,  which they close now as well,  but Twitter doesn't have that anymore,  because it would be too big.  It would scroll past too fast  if you didn't make sense of anything.  But the primary thing you had on Twitter  was a set of people you decided to follow.  And it was a list of what they were saying,  and that was what you saw.  And then eventually they added at replies,  but it was a separate thing you clicked  to see responses to you.  It was another column that was not the default view.  So your default view of Twitter  was the set of people you'd chosen to see.  Right.  And that's still kind of true with Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's rapidly becoming less true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Except when it became mobile,  and it became an app and got notifications,  they got very excited about notifications.  And they said, what can we notify people about?  We don't want to notify them with every post.  That would be annoying.  Though actually, original Twitter would do that with SMS.  That was part of the way it grew originally,  was it would send you an SMS with every post.  So it was mobile before everything else was mobile.  This is like pre-iPhone.  And then they let you turn that on and off.  And then when it became an app,  they made notifications out of the app replies.  And originally, we still had the sort of conventions  around out replies and how they behave  from the previous model,  which was that was the secondary thing you looked at.  But gradually, the out replies become more important  than the main feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because that's where the conversation happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But also because it's notifying you.  So one of the wonderful things about Twitter originally  was it didn't have an unread count.  It was just this thing you could dip into an app.  It was a stream.  It was a stream, and you would, you know,  it's like, oh, I've got five minutes in the line  at the shop, I'll dip into it for five minutes.  I'm waiting for a train, I'll do it in five minutes.  There's no pressure, unlike email,  because it doesn't say 27 unread or 2500 unread,  if it's my email.  And then once they added the notifications,  they put an unread count on it.  And so now if you've got an iPhone,  you've got a big red number on your Twitter,  which is all the out replies that you want.  And they've made the out replies  the most prominent thing about it.  So they've taken what was a different space,  had a very different social construct in it,  and made it back into an inbox.  And the problem with inboxes is it prioritizes  other people's agendas over your own.  So if you've got an inbox and they want to send you stuff,  then they are sending you stuff,  and then they're putting stuff on your agenda.  And so that was the basic problem of email  that anyone could send you stuff.  And Twitter has recapitulated that with out replies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it actually got better.  The out replies were actually part of what  started getting me interested in Twitter.  When it was just a stream,  not that following people who I liked wasn't interesting,  but the conversational aspect was what I became  more interested in.  And there was a brief kind of honeymoon period,  like Camelot or whatever,  where there was just enough people with different interests  to make an interesting conversation,  but not enough people with dramatically different interests  who could dive bomb your app mentions  and create some of the social problems  that we're having now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, well, exactly.  But also the app mentions,  first you had to click to get to them.  They were a thing on the side.  And secondly, the initial app back and forth stuff,  you only saw if you were following both parties.  Right.  So they deliberately did that  to stop everything being a flood of ads,  because people found it,  if two of you get into a back and forth row,  not necessarily everyone wants to see that.  So that was part of the dampening thing.  And the challenge with all these systems  is bridging between the,  show me the stuff I've chosen to see  and connect me to what's going on in the rest of the world.  And that is always the back and forth  that goes with all these systems.  And so initially they had the public timeline  and get a good start what was going on  because there were only a few thousand of us in there  and it wasn't changing that often.  And if you look at these new social things,  they have these-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm starting to get mad at me for retweeting something.  I don't know if you remember,  because retweets were new.  And I kept retweeting people  and this person got really mad.  And they're like, why are you retweeting these things  into my stream?  I'm not interested in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Get your retweets out of my stream, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I thought, well,  this was actually what I thought was part of  what was interesting was people retweeting things  that interested them.  And he saw it as an intrusion on his feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, then he can unfollow you and go away.  I mean, then that was the other point.  That's what I said.  So, all right, so I will-  The other point is that retweeting  was an important piece of this  because retweeting was a way of amplifying something  you saw that was good.  So it creates this signal that is useful  and spreads it further,  but it's a natural thing.  But it can go bad too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It can go bad too, but-  Particularly the quote retweeting.  I actually got called out by Chris Zaca,  who called me the king of the witch hunt retweets.  For a second, I didn't even know what he was talking about.  What does that even mean?  But I think what he meant was me,  quote retweeting someone as though I was saying,  hey, followers-  It was a pile on.  Right.  Which is not, well, okay, I've done that a couple of times.  But that's not typically what I do with a retweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, part of the retweet is,  so there's three gestures in Twitter now.  There's the like, which is like, this is interesting,  but also had a bunch of other nuances  and we got the star-  The exploding part.  But then it was,  but you could see other people's list of likes,  but then they started sending those notifications as well,  or sending you friends of yours like this thing,  and notifications and stuff like that.  So again, they made that a higher state,  stakes thing.  There's the retweet, and there was the classic retweet  where you actually had to do it by hand,  and then there's the new retweet,  which is a button that just basically puts that thing  to the top of the post in your timeline,  shows it to your followers,  and brings it up to the top of the people who already see it.  So that's a very useful way of restructuring the flow  to give more weight to certain things.  So these things all end up,  somebody says something very witty or shocking,  then you will retweet it and it will go up there.  And then the new one is the-  The quote.  The retweet quote, which is basically,  what they've done is they've taken a thing  that you could always do, which is point to another tweet,  but they give you a preview of the tweet,  and they let you write above it.  And so that, it doesn't thread  like the back and forth that replies.  So it's a way of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know you got mad at me,  you got mad at me about that,  because it breaks the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It can break the conversation.  I mean, but it's a way of responding to something  for your audience, not for the person you're talking to.  So it's basically, you're quoting something.  It's like doing a block quote of somebody  and commenting on it, which is a classic thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which you can do for a number of reasons.  You can say, this is interesting, or this is dumb,  or I like this, or I have something to add.  I mean, if you get into a canoe,  like a tweet, multiple tweets with multiple people,  you get like eight characters  to put something in your tweet.  You can't really have a discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But also, I mean, the other thing it's like,  is it's like quoting something on your own site,  or it's making, you know, Facebook,  when you quote something,  you create a separate conversation thread  for your followers.  You're not in the same thread as everyone else.  And so if you do that kind of post,  you're creating, you're basically saying,  let's talk about this amongst ourselves, kind of.  Except that the notification does go back  to the person who you're quoting.  So they can get dragged into a conversation.  And then you can get the pile on problem.  And the pile on problem is,  you know, I'm holding this person up for sacrifice.  I nominate you for the Hunger Games.  You will be shat out by my followers.  And the reason that is a problem,  and you know, sometimes that is calling out,  can you believe what politician X just said?  And that is the purpose of it.  But often it is,  here's, look at this idiot, let's all pile on him.  And the reason those pile ons are problematic,  is that they then become ways of destroying  that person's Twitter experience  and filling up their app replies with noise.  Which is the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can be, they can be.  But I think that also, if you,  so if you are genuinely trying to broaden a discussion,  right, assuming that ever happens  or anybody actually wants to do that.  I mean, that's part of what I, why I do those things,  because I think there are probably other people  who don't follow either one of us,  who may have some thoughts.  So, but the problem is there's a sort of gray area  between let's broaden the discussion  and maybe people have some thoughts,  and let me call out this person and the mob can take over.  And that sort of, that gray area  is where most of Twitter exists right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So-  But the thing is because, you know,  so the structural thing of the app replies  becoming notifications is the thing  that makes that a toxic behavior.  If you were just discussing it amongst your followers,  then that would be, you know, a thing.  And it may be, you may be obnoxious,  but you're not, at least you're not like,  it's not being thrown in the face of the person  who you're talking about necessarily.  They'd have to go and look for that.  Whereas because of the structure,  and so it would naturally dampen down.  Whereas because of this structure,  it actually feeds this thing.  And the feeds, they're sort of out grouping  and shouting at each other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a lot of what I think Twitter,  a lot of the things that Twitter has done  to make these problems worse,  are things that the company did to try and boost engagement  because it was trying to become more valuable  and justify its, you know, IPO and so on.  And so a lot of the things that were aimed  at increasing engagement actually boosted  the sort of pile on problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now let's talk about an alternative,  like GNU Social.  Does this fix the problem or is it just a-  Sorry, you get to be.  I'm sorry, I'm just wondering about GNU Social.  Is this just a Twitter clone  that replicates Twitter's problems  or does this fix those problems?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It ends up with a different,  interesting different set of problems,  which is always fun to look at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's always a different set of problems.  Different problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what happens is each of these,  basically there is a bunch of separate sites  and you sign up for one of the sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just sign up for quitter.no for instance,  which seems to be the biggest of them, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think quitter.se may be a bit about any.  Did you just sign up for it?  Yeah.  Okay, so if you look at the front page you've got now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have a timeline  because I'm not following anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, so you can follow me.  I'm Kevin Marks on there.  Who are you on there, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo Laporte.  I'm the same everywhere as you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, so I'll follow you on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm gonna search for Kevin Marks as I would on Twitter.  I haven't customized my profile.  I'm busy doing a show right now.  But let me, but I was able to do this.  There's Kevin.  So I'll follow you.  This looks very much like Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, exactly.  This skin is made to make it look exactly like Twitter.  You probably can reskin it, right?  Yes.  If you look at your top left, you've got timeline.  Click timeline, it'll be me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll just be, it's the Kevin Marks timeline.  Actually it isn't because you haven't tweeted since,  maybe if I refresh it, it'll bring in your tweets.  So I need to write it.  You need to say something.  I'll follow some more people.  I presume I could follow Evan and a few more people.  I ran, we ran a status net.  It was Identica at the time,  and Identica, it was called the Twit Army for a while.  It was really cool to have our own Twitter.  Now, federation, often when people talk about federation,  they say, well, Twitter is not federated.  Email is federated.  Email's an example of a federated.  So, okay, now I see you, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, so now, so you see, you've got a timeline link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Under that, you have a notifications link.  Now that, click timeline, that's followings.  Top left timeline.  Okay, timeline, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's me. Welcome to Quitter.  I'm in your timeline.  You said dot com, but we won't, nobody will quibble.  We won't quibble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you look at notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I, by the way, have they added editing of tweets?  No, because it's federated.  You wouldn't want to, right?  Because it's too late.  Are they even tweets?  I'm sorry, what do they call them?  No.  Not ganous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there's a debate about what to call them.  They were calling them Queets, which, Q-U-E-U-T-S.  That's not good.  But it's not a good name.  No.  They're Swedish, they thought it was funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the days of Identica, what do we call them?  I'm trying to remember.  Dents, they were called dents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're now talking about calling them quips.  Quips is good, let's call them quips.  But then re-quip is a bit weird.  But it's not a bad name.  No, re-quips is exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, so quip is a fairly good name.  Anyway.  And I'm gonna email you one, that'll be called an e-quip.  Anyway, you've got a timeline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.  You've got notifications, which should be one in there  because I asked you and I got your name wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's go look at notifications, yes.  That's correct, I see one.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then you've got favorites, which is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nothing, because I haven't favored you.  Let me fave this here.  Oh, they only have a star, they don't have a smiley.  All right, all right.  No hearts.  No hearts.  They're in the doubts and my favorites, yep.  But then you've got public timelines.  So public timeline.  That's all the people.  That's how I would find new people, right?  That's, so click that.  Corey Doctorow's on here, so that's enough for me.  It's loading.  We've just brought, by the way,  the web's administrators are going, what's going on?  This is gonna be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They'll probably shut down registrations for a bit.  Anyway, so public timeline is all the people  who have accounts on this server.  On this server, that's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This server.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Whereas there's a thing under that  called the whole known network.  Which is not related to known with known.com.  This is just an unfortunate name.  What that is, is not just everyone on this server,  but also all the people on other servers  that the people on this server follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that is actually bigger.  And what you're seeing is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute though.  It's not the whole known network.  It's the network, the GNU social network  that contains people followed by people on quitter.no.  Yes.  Important distinction.  Yes, it's not everyone.  But that's actually good because what you're getting is,  if you've got this social network that's quitter,  you're getting people that other quitters are interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  So the thing is, you can see,  what I'm seeing on this one is something in Greeks.  Yeah, it's very international.  Bunch of other stuff going on.  As it should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But isn't that a problem?  But if you actually hover over them,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you can see that some of them are on different servers.  So they're a quitter.se,  where's that one?  Someone's local.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can even go to the original quip.  I like it they're calling them quips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you can go through to these other servers.  So there is some federation between them.  There's also a sense that each of the servers  has its own house style and you join a server  where the public timeline makes sense to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Should you run your own server?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can do, it's up to you.  I know you can, but should you?  It's like running your own Wiki.  It's like, if you've got a set of people  that would make sense to you, you can do that.  If you just want to have a place that's all yours,  you can do that too.  It's up to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then if you tweet on, I'm sorry, quip on your server,  it would federate to other servers?  So somebody could follow you.  So what is my, what's my namespace?  Would be the name of my server.  It would be Leo Laporte at the server name.  At quitter.no, yes.  Yeah.  And then if somebody followed Leo Laporte at quitter.no  on another server, so that's how it federates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They would get the federate updates  and it would also add you to the whole  known network on that server.  Yeah, got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there any way I can tweet  and also have that appear on quitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are ways to do that that I won't go into,  but yes, you can do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And vice versa, right?  I could post on, more to the point,  I could post on my, what I really want to do  is run the server locally, my have mine own,  that federates and also can then syndicate.  In other words, I want to with known,  I want to known for-  For Twitter.  For Twitter, for GNU Social.  Can we get Ben and Aaron working on that?  I tried using app.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tried using Identica.  I was on app.net for a considerable amount of time.  But there's nobody there.  There was no presence.  There's nobody there.  It was quiet.  Not nobody, there were people there.  Yeah.  But, and I did do some cross posting  and I actually got yelled at for cross posting  from Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's zealots everywhere, aren't there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But so then, so then you're creating-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so what we find with this is  that the different sites have different personalities.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, but the top is network effects.  So everybody I know or want to interact with  is on Twitter.  Right.  Virtually, almost everyone.  So then now I've got a separate place

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that I have to go to-  It's the same reason I use Facebook Messenger  because everybody I want a message is on there,  but prefer Telegram because I like it better.  And it's not-  And this is why Twitter,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  even while Twitter was going through-  That's why it continues.  Yeah, all the problems of it's going down all the time.  It was, and they keep adding dumb features  and people just keep using it  because everyone they want to interact with is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Patterson in our chat room says  he just wants a CB radio for the internet.  But you know, I kind of understand that.  That's kind of what this is, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it would be nice if Twitter  were a little more open with its API.  Maybe you could make it easier to federate  from Twitter and to Twitter.  But I don't see any chance of that happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the challenge you see with these  is that they all end up with different personalities.  And so they get grumpy if you put things  in the public timeline you don't want.  Right.  So there's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the interesting thing.  See, nobody follows the public timeline on Twitter.  That is the timeline of every post.  First of all, because it goes by a mile a second.  But on these, they're smaller, it's very common.  We found this on ours as well,  that on the Twitter army identica,  everybody would follow the timeline.  That's what you would mostly visit is all posts.  And I remember doing that on Twitter too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember doing that in 2007 on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but it's the one thing that makes sense  at different scales.  You're able to follow the whole public timeline  on one of these, and it makes sense at that scale.  And there's other ones like, there's sea lion.club  and there's other ones that are designed  for people to be trolls on.  Sea lion, yes.  And do, you know, and talk about trollish things.  And that has a very different flavor to it than,  and we probably don't want to put that one on the screen,  come to think of it, than-  So what flavor would that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  Actually, believe it or not,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't even follow my own timeline.  So all the people that I follow,  I cannot look at that timeline  because it goes by too quickly  because I'm following too many people.  So all I do is use lists.  I gave up.  Yeah.  I mean, I should just unfollow a bunch of people,  but that would take so long.  So now I just use lists.  And if it wasn't for lists,  I wouldn't probably be able to use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But this is the problem.  I mean, it's the, this place is so crowded,  nobody goes there anymore problem, which is-  It's just too popular.  But the thing is, but it's also the sense,  it's the balance between the chosen conversation  and the public space and the bridges between the two.  And it's really the bridges between the two  are these at replies that connect things  and they can be toxic.  It's also the hashtags that connect things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which bridges across.  So yeah, you can put hash Oscars in  and then you can all be talking about the Oscars at once.  And you can't, you couldn't follow that whole tag  on the same site.  But you could follow,  but you could follow if amongst your followers,  it would actually,  they would actually make some sense potentially.  So, and, you know, even,  and they're just watching your stream of followers discuss  that the public event can be a useful thing as well.  So it's the, it is the challenge  of bridging these things together.  But the hard part about it is,  you're really talking about social dynamics  and how they get interacted with by software.  You know what fascinates me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had this conversation earlier today.  This has been going on for some time,  but the discussion was about how part of the problem  with Twitter is that it's not really,  it's sort of verbal.  So sort of like conversation,  and yet it's sort of like publishing, right?  So it's actually good and bad parts come from  mushing both of those things together.  So it's a little like having a discussion  with people in a bar, but then it's also-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But those discussions are preserved forever  and thoroughly analyzed and create outrage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when you say something dumb in a bar  because you're drunk-  Everybody understands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, and no one, no one like writes it down  and then hands it out to everybody,  so that, or publish it in the newspaper.  I found it fascinating that Mark Andreessen left Twitter  for, in fact-  In chagrin and embarrassment.  Still hasn't tweeted.  No, he tweeted once.  Like flanking.  Yeah, no, he congratulated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A benign, yeah, business tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because of a tweet.  This man, Facebook had to apologize to an entire country  and so did Mark Andreessen because of a tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the power of the Twitter.  Well, that's, I mean-  Good or ill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's something he said, if he had said it to you and I,  or even in a public place,  it would not have lived on and created-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if he said in a public place,  somebody would have written it down too.  He's enough for public figures to, but he-  But yeah, there is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's that PR person who made a vaguely racist  comment before she got on the plane to South Africa  and had been fired by the time the plane landed.  She wasn't famous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Part of what we're trying to figure out is how-  She became famous.  How does that change your behavior?  If the things you say, things you just shoot your mouth off  or you're tired or you haven't thought about something  properly or you had too many drinks,  what happens when those things become,  take on the power of basically publishing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've said extraordinarily dumb things on Twitter,  hurt friends, there have been consequences many times.  Maybe you hope you'll learn your lesson, but it really is,  it's very easy to say things on Twitter  that you deeply regret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it, yeah, because it feels like you're not,  it feels so-  It feels informal. Inconsequential.  Yeah, it's not. Yeah, so informal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's, so that was, I mean, originally,  I wrote a thing about this in 2009 or something,  where I was hopeful for the future of Twitter,  precisely because your mental model  when you're reading Twitter is the set of people you follow.  So you see the set of things that people you follow say,  and you respond to those,  and you're having a conversation with that audience,  except your audience is actually the people who follow you,  which is a different set of people.  And they probably overlap, but,  and the thing is, if those things are all soft overlaps,  then that can work very well as a way of idea sharing,  and some of them being amplified,  and some of them being dampened, and so on.  The problem comes when people start outgrouping each other  and using it to fight other wars  and fight battles between people.  And so rather than following the set of people  that they want to follow,  they will go and find people who say things they disagree with  and argue with them,  because they know that if they out-reply them,  that will get into their face.  One of the, somebody in the channel was saying,  I like sending gay porn images to a homophobe.  Right, just the pictures.  And it's like, yes, I can think you probably do like doing  that, but that isn't actually gonna change his mind at all.  No, it's just gonna annoy him.  It's his position, and he'll say, look at these people,  they're terrible, look at these things they're doing.  And it goes back and forth and amplifies the thing.  It doesn't actually contribute to the discourse.  So the easiest way to build a group  is to find somebody who is in the group,  point to them and say, look at them over there,  aren't they terrible?  And that reinforces the group.  And the challenge for Twitter is to reinforce  the in-grouping rather than the out-grouping.  And originally there were, partly this was an outgrowth  of how it was originally built  and the social structure it built,  partly because it was built by people who were activists,  like Rabel and Blaine who had thought about this stuff.  And then as you say, it gradually got sort of,  we've got a increased engagement,  we're increasing engagement.  And the easiest kind of engagement to increase  is people shouting at each other,  because once you start doing that, it's hard to stop.  So once somebody says the homophobic thing,  and this chap sends him gay porn  and they start shouting at each other,  and it's gonna be very hard to get closer to a  sensible discussion again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very obvious kind of incentives.  I don't know whether they did this deliberately  or whether it just happened,  because it's one of the things about Twitter is it's,  it's impossible to know what was planned and what wasn't,  because so much of what has become was totally unplanned.  But the incentives are you see the likes,  or you see the retweets, or you see the,  and you get a little endorphin rush, right?  Every time, oh, I said something funny.  And so you maybe push it a little bit further,  or maybe you, because you want that,  that actually encourages bad behavior  just as much as it encourages good behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't know, you know, I don't know what to do.  How do we fix it?  I do feel like if there were a solid alternative to Twitter  that people would be glad to go to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They would not.  You don't think so, because there's nobody there.  And I think, right,  that's the problem you have to get over.  I think every, all of these things have been,  they're great alternatives.  Lots of them have great features.  And the Federation is a great idea, but there is nothing.  If like, if people were gonna do that,  they would have done it by now.  There's nothing that is gonna move people,  enough people off that or off Facebook  to some other network.  I just don't, I don't see what could possibly offer  that would make people do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, you can say that,  but this has happened before.  We could have said that about MySpace five years ago.  Who could actually get to the scale of MySpace?  So people, these things grow exponentially  and then they collapse fast too,  when people start leaving them.  And Twitter's fear is that they're in that state now.  That post from Julianne and Maude

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zero grows, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was saying...  Boobs rattling.  Boobs rattling.  It's like, not Julianne, what's your name?  God, I lost my last name.  Smolensky. Sorry, sorry, Julianne.  Look, I realize a minute.  But she was saying, it's like, it feels like,  Julianne Smolensky, it feels like I'm going through  the neglected park now.  And it used to be this nice place.  And now it's, I have to hold my purse carefully to myself  as I walk through it.  And it stopped being nice.  And that is the problem that it has become.  And part of that is that they coasted for a while  on the initial culture, which was this sharing culture,  following people you knew or were interested in,  not necessarily knew,  and having that back and forth with them  that was somewhat dampened because it took some work  to find who was replying to them to go back and forth.  And by amplifying that feedback loop,  they've flipped the culture of Twitter  to the point where Twitter is now synonymous  with shouting abuse in public.  You know, if Twitter is mentioned in popular culture,  they're either saying, you know,  tweet to save the person on American Idol or whatever,  or they're describing it as a byword  for people shouting at each other.  And that's the piece they've got to fix.  And that's going to be hard to fix because they need to,  first, they need to adjust the technology such that  the app replies aren't the most important thing  in the app again.  Rather than having an algorithmic filter on the timeline,  you need an algorithmic filter on the app replies.  I should probably see out replies from people  that I'm already having a conversation with  over random drive-by people who are shouting at me  because I mentioned Bernie Sanders or something.  I mentioned a keyword that somebody decided  to go and shout about today.  Right.  And the structural thing they need to think about there  is changing the culture back to this culture  that reinforces in-group discussion  rather than out-group shouting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think that that could actually make it worse as well,  but in a different way.  Because I think if you, I mean, we've had  any number of arguments.  Well, this is the food about a argument show.  So if it encourages you to just talk to people  you're already connected to and agree with,  then you're missing out on one of the biggest  sort of potential benefits of having a broad network  like that.  But the problem is your, and this happens with comments  that have looked at a lot,  that if you want a low barrier to entry, right,  you want to lower kind of the obstructions  to people interacting because that's where you get  a lot of the benefits.  But as soon as you lower those barriers  or make it easier to do those things,  then you get lots of trolls and morons.  So you can't actually have one without the other.  You can't get something without giving something up.  So Twitter's big issue is how do they,  what are you prepared to do that will actually give up  a certain amount of growth or engagement  in return for these other benefits?  And then users would have to make the same choice.  What are they prepared to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the point is that it's more that you have to model  the engagement better.  So if you're just modeling it on number of tweets sent  and number of people signed up,  then you're actually modeling people shouting each other  and creating spam accounts to shout at each other more  and creating, assuming that's a positive value.  Agreed.  So actually what you mean is in a more nuanced metric,  which is, is there actually a useful conversation  going on here?  When they Twitter said that.  Well, that's the problem.  First of all, you ask people.  You know, you have, if you do some qualitative stuff first,  and if you do a qualitative survey of Twitter,  you will get the answers from like Julie Hensponinsky's  asker, which is, it doesn't feel comfortable anymore.  I feel like I have to back away from it.  And that is the quality of answer.  You need to say, okay, what is causing that?  What are things we can do to fix that?  And the answer is make the,  make it closer to the things you choose to see.  Basically it's swung too far into the public shouting space  as opposed to the filter bubble.  The big fear five years ago was we're building  filter bubbles, we're only gonna see  our own corner of the world.  I mean, actually what we ended up building was  the filter bubble where they gather together  and then go and attack the other filter bubble  and then shout at each other.  And that's the game of it.  And yes, this is as old as the internet.  This is, this is,  well, this is the original Usenet raid on wreck.pets  or whatever.  Yes, it's a structural problem.  It's a problem we've had with email.  It's a problem we've had with blog comments.  And the reason people fear those,  we've had it with YouTube comments.  And the problem is always that-  But who's been able to fix it?  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Has anyone been able to fix it?  Twitter early on was a better space for this.  The reason Twitter took off was that you were able to have,  as a sort of public figure,  in the sense of a journalist or even a famous person,  you were able to have a conversation with people  that wasn't swamped by the replies.  Now, part of what they built with the-  It's just the sheer volume of people.  It's both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So maybe the solution is for people who are fleeing Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to use Twitter as a read-only public broadcast medium  and then have their conversations in a quieter place  like quitter.no or quitter.se.  And then they can have their conversations  with quitter.no or quitter.se or GNU Social somewhere.  What about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doing that with DMs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  DMs become your private area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, becomes your private discussion area.  And then you sort of withdraw as much-  I kind of regret, though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that we can't have a commons of some kind.  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that the rise of Slack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but Slack is now about to, it's starting to get-  I see a lot of posts all of a sudden,  people saying, oh great,  I just replaced my inbox with Slack,  which has now turned into my inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  No, and it is the same notification issue again,  except that I've now got 27 inboxes,  because I'm in 27 Slacks or whatever.  Sure.  And yes, it is a problem of success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's too many damn people on this planet.  That's the real problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that is the problem.  There are too many people.  You cannot follow everyone.  You cannot have every contribution to the discourse  on the same page.  It just doesn't make sense.  Right.  And these things are powered or distributed.  So what works for one end of the tale,  where there's a small conversation,  doesn't work with the other end of the tale,  where a thousand people are trying to be in the conversation  and 500 of them are making the same lame joke,  and 250 of them are shouting abuse.  And which is the whole sea-lining.  You also have clashing sort of,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  not worldviews, that's too grandiose a term,  but so like filter bubbles, I guess,  but bubbles running into bubbles.  So you and all your tech friends think this thing  is hilarious and so you make fun of it.  But that thing happens to be racist  or it's offensive to someone in some way  that you haven't thought of  because all of you think it's hysterical.  And so then those things clashing into each other creates,  if it was just you guys going bowling  and talking about this thing,  it probably wouldn't turn into anything.  That's what Twitter used to be, right?  What you had for lunch.  When all of those things are happening out in public,  then it becomes you shouting obscenities  or offensive things  instead of you just doing it with your buddies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does GNU Social do about harassment?  I mean, do they have tools built in?  This is the other complaint, of course, about Twitter,  is they've become a wonderful platform for harassment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing,  is that the harassment comes with the out replies.  If I'm just writing horrible things about Leo  somewhere on my own blog  and they're not being sent to you,  that's much less of a problem.  Right, by the way, that was Twitter's response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you're being harassed, we'll just mute them.  Right.  But that doesn't stop people doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what happens is whoever's running the individual server  has some tools of it because they're the server admins.  They can kick accounts off.  They can put blocks on them.  The challenge is in this whole no network view,  if I follow someone on another server  that is posting offensive things,  that will show up in that view on this server.  And so then they have to do a federation block on that server  or they have to block accounts and that.  So there are some tools for doing that.  And this has come up recently amongst,  because a bunch of Gamergate types  have been setting up new social servers  to argue with the other new social servers.  And then- That didn't take long.  And then they say, well, you can post what you like,  just don't post porn on this.  And then someone says, well, I'm gonna post porn on this.  And then they set up a server for posting porn  and then they follow them on the other server.  So yeah, basically if people have decided to mess with you,  then federation is hard  and you have to start putting those in place.  The challenge is, are you trying to do this  for everyone on earth,  which is Twitter's problem and why it's hard,  or can you do it locally within one server?  So when there was a lot of fuss from the Breitbart lot  on Twitter about being banned and so on,  a bunch of them went to quitter.sc and said,  okay, we're gonna create accounts here.  Really?  And the quitter.sc people said,  no, actually we don't want you here.  We don't like your politics.  Go and set your own one up if you wanna have one.  And then that disclaimer they put on the top about,  we believe in social justice  and linking the communist manifesto and things,  was their way of saying,  actually right-wingers, we don't want you on this server  if you want to set your own server.  Oh, that's recent, they've added that.  So it's a few months old or something.  So the thing there is you can exclude the bubble  and then you can follow across the bubble,  but then the admins,  if people start trying to troll each other,  then it creates problems for the admins.  And I follow a bunch of the admins on different servers  and see the problems they're having with this  and trying to work this stuff out.  Should Kanye create his own GNU social?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He totally could.  Kanye.no.  He's the best thing about Twitter.  The guy just goes mental and everyone enjoys watching him.  And I know Twitter probably thinks this is great  because it-  Oh, it's great for Twitter.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  But I think to Kevin's point,  Twitter has effectively created this problem  and I don't see how they get out of it.  So they're a public company,  the stock tanked by like 60% or something.  I don't know what it is now,  but I mean it's lost billions and billions of dollars  worth of market value that it once had.  User growth has slowed to a trickle, if at all.  And I realize there's a lot more people who don't sign in.  That was Fred Wilson's argument the other day.  And that is a huge part of the way people use Twitter.  But so you've got to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait a minute, wait a minute, say that again.  Don't sign in.  Yeah, there are a lot of-  And it really is read only and there's no at replies  because you don't have an account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but then you're-  A lot of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But then you're either gonna know someone's name  or you're clicking on, what do you call them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Moments.  Oh, moments, yeah, moments.  Love that moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And obviously the value of those people,  I think, is lower, but regardless.  So Twitter is public entity, right?  But user growth isn't increasing,  which when you're a public company is bad,  something is not growing, it might as well be shrinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In real life, in real life we have-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do they fix the problems,  but still create more value  without making the problems worse?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In real life, we have a diversity of spaces.  We have very public spaces where people act out  and we have private spaces.  And sometimes you want just a conversation  in a quiet neighborhood pub,  and sometimes you want to go to the stadium.  And we can have those experiences.  Can we not do that in digital or does digital,  or is there something that is more digital native than that?  I mean, I don't like it when we try to glom  real world experiences into digital experiences, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I feel like Kevin's right in a way  that Twitter could have had more,  a more sort of fluid, small, not so small,  a little bit larger, everybody kind of experience.  And now you just have DMs  or you're talking to the football stadium.  And maybe if they had tried a little harder along the way,  they could have created some of those different ways  of having that and not incentivized the bad behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's take a break because we kind of move on,  but I think a great discussion-  This week on Twitter.  This week on Twitter.  I told you at the beginning,  it's anything you can Google is the subject.  Twitter's always been,  this has always been the show about Twitter,  Facebook and Google, not just Google.  And it's just kind of historically called  this week in Google,  but really it's really about the internet as it's evolving.  I wonder if Google Plus could have become that space.  I feel so sad about what happened with Google Plus.  It just kind of-  The circles was an interesting-  They were attempting to do something, weren't they?  That was the point of the circles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The idea of the circles was you create subsets  of things to look into.  It was like a smarter version of lists.  But it was also a sense of you were publishing  to that subset of people.  And the challenge of it is how do you model those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not just that, lots of people didn't do it.  Some huge proportion of people just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because no one wants to spend the energy to make circles.  That's a lot.  Zuckerberg said no one wants to make lists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he's right.  He's right.  Very few people are gonna take the time to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook has lists.  Facebook has-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, it was the irony was that he said that  even though they had lists.  But I bet you he knows because they have lists  how few people really use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but what they have is they have chat subgroups.  So the way Facebook structures this is you build  a set of people you're chatting to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is, just before we wrap this up,  what is the style of quitter.no?  You said each one of these can do social sites  has its own kind of style.  Is it programmers?  Is it open source folks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's sort of, kind of, I don't know.  It's like Norwegian social justice to people.  That's what the original thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love that.  That's a small means.  That's who I want to hang out with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it when people are very dirty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want more of those.  All right, we're gonna take a break  and return with actual Google news.  But first, the Google car gets in its first accident  caused by the Google car.  And Brad Templeton, who is a autonomous vehicle guru  and celebrant says, that's a good thing.  That's a good thing.  Our show today brought to you by our friends at Squarespace.

I'm posting some stuff up there,  customize my little profile,  followed Kevin, Matthew.  So the Google self-driving car,  it was the Lexus, it was the big one,  not the little one without pedals and steering wheel.  So there was a driver behind the wheel,  struck a bus in California on Valentine's Day.  It was in Mountain View.  It was on the city streets.  It was an interesting situation  and it's kind of an interesting test of the software.  So they're coming up to a red light  and the car wants to make a right turn.  So as it would, it's instructed to,  it gets in as far right as it can  so it can make the right turn.  But then there's a storm drain with sandbags around it  in that lane.  So the car correctly senses the storm drain  and the sandbags and stops.  Now the light turns green, the car is stuck behind stymied.  So it's going to pull around the sandbags  and get into the next lane over.  Unfortunately, that lane occupied by a city bus.  The vehicle's operator saw the bus approaching,  but quote, believed the bus would stop  or allow the Google autonomous vehicle to continue.  About three seconds later, it hit the bus.  Now it was only going two miles an hour.  The bus was going about 15 miles an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's-  This is a classic human being thing, right?  You expect it to let you in.  Right, you try to move and you're like,  dude, why are you not letting me in?  Don't you, I don't know what you do in Canada,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but don't you just kind of start to edge in  and just say, he's going to have to stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, and so you expect the other person  to look at what you're doing and then decide.  So for whatever reason, the Google bus or the bus decided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You look like a funny, maybe the bus looked at it  and said, hey, you got LIDAR, I don't need to let you in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's the other thing.  So there's a post I put in from autoblog from September  saying Google was trying to make the self-driving cars  more aggressive because other drivers were confused  by how they behaved on the road because they were too timid.  Right.  Now, my suspicion is that any Mountain View bus driver  has seen these things for years  and knows that they'll get out of his way  because that's how they have been.  They have been very rule following.  And so the bus driver was like,  oh, it's one of those things.  Well, I can carry on through  because they always get out of my way.  And, you know.  But it didn't.  But it didn't because they made them a little bit more  aggressive because they're trying to make it drive  more like a human.  But I suspect the other thing is they probably haven't  realized, haven't thought through this whole,  how big is the thing I'm trying to cut off problem,  which is that if it's a bus, if it's a truck,  you don't play that game.  No, exactly.  Yeah, humans do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's this what humans being do, right?  Humans know you don't get in front of a bus.  Those guys are nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't care.  Right, but also it's a matter of physics.  It's like that thing cannot stop very easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was this whole.  It wasn't just a bus.  It was an articulated bus.  One's with the joints in the middle.  It was a big bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those are big.  It hit it, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It hit it right in the joint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, so I originally thought this was like one  of the little tiny Google things,  which I would totally understand the bus like  trying to cut that off.  That was a Lexus.  I didn't realize it was the medium sized Lexus one.  But the point is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This makes perfect sense.  What you just said, Kevin, now explains the whole thing.  You're the first to explain this.  Because there's nothing worse than getting to like,  in California we have these things called four way stops.  And it's got arcane rules about what happens  at a four way stop.  First person, it's straightforward.  If people arrive in order,  the first person gets there, gets to go.  But if people arrive simultaneously,  you have to defer to the person on your right.  And it's a weird situation.  And the most annoying thing that can happen  is some guy sitting there whose turn it is going,  no, no, no, you go.  Yeah, right.  You go.  That's like, no, follow the freaking rules.  Right, you're not playing by the rules.  You're breaking the system by being quite polite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh no, you go.  No, you go.  But I find it fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I find it fascinating that Google is trying to find  the right sort of algorithm for aggressiveness.  Isn't it interesting?  So you need to be a little bit aggressive, right?  Because otherwise you start causing problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the other challenge is,  the four way stop thing is what you do is you make eye contact.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you're self driving, you can't.  I don't know if I can make eye contact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look at them, you can't see if they've seen you.  So you're relying on are they moving or not?  And they had another case, they talked about a while back,  which was somebody was on a fixie bike.  And so on a fixie bike, you're not stationed at the stop.  You're jiggling back and forth.  So he was jiggling back and forth waiting for the car to go  and the car was seeing him jiggling back and forth saying,  oh, he's going, oh, he's going.  It was like an impasse until the guy on the bike  said fuck it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You need nonverbal cues, right?  So if you're looking over your shoulder and you want,  like I would have looked at the bus and you'd be like,  could you, and then the bus driver would look at you  and you would get the sense that he was the kind of bus  driver who did not want to let you in.  And then in a split second,  he would kind of come to an agreement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's what Brad Templeton wrote.  I love Brad using that pioneer.  Very big into autonomous vehicles.  He has a blog, Brad's ideas at the ideas.forbrad.com.  Number four.  He writes, so why is this a good thing?  Well, cause Google is starting to work on problems like these  and you need to solve these problems to drive even  in orderly like places like California.  He talks about India where there's the lane lines  are purely a suggestion and nobody pays any attention  whatsoever.  So he says to solve this problem,  we have to solve, come up with a resolution,  get the computer to do the right thing.  He says, in this case, Google says it learned  that big vehicles are much less likely to yield.  He also says, it sounds like the vehicle's confusion  of the sandbags probably made the bus driver  decide the vehicle was stuck, right?  Oh, he can't move.  Nobody wants accidents.  Some will play this accident as more than it is,  but neither do we want so much caution  that we never learn these lessons.  It's also a good reminder that Google,  even though it's a clear leader in this space,  still has lots of work to do.  It's worth noting, and this is what you brought up, Kevin,  that sometimes humans solve this problem  by making eye contact to know, well, did he see me?  Turns out robots can do that  cause the human eye flashes brightly  in the red and infrared when looking at you.  That's why you have red eye with a flash camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't detect, well, it's-  So you can know if he sees you.  Right, but it's another whole level to detect intent.  Yes, he says that.  And if you've driven anywhere in India or China  or lots of places where traffic rules are just a suggestion,  you govern yourself a lot by what the person,  how are they looking?  Do they look aggressive?  So now the computer has to determine,  does the bus driver look aggressive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's the pedestrian crossing thing.  In Ireland, if you make eye contact with the driver,  then the driver says, well, he's seen me so I can go.  Whereas in California, if you make eye contact with the driver,  you're basically saying, I want to go.  And so that can cause a cultural collision as well.  It's a different sense of how you behave in those instances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When we moved to Edmonton, Alberta,  we were from Toronto where, for Canadians,  people are aggressive, not like in lots of other places,  but for Canadians.  And so then we moved to Edmonton.  If you even move towards, if you're walking,  move towards a roadway, cars will stop,  even when there's no crosswalk,  because they assume, oh, you're indicating a desire to cross.  In Toronto, you just have to dodge a ramped car.  But they literally stop.  And then you have to be like, no, I actually changed my mind.  I don't want to cross the road.  You go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you look at the visualizations they post for the thing,  they draw little boxes around the pedestrians and the cyclists  to decide where they're going to go,  and then they don't cross those boxes.  And so they are trying to work out  if someone's trying to step off the curb all the time.  And that's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know why, but for some reason,  I'm looking at a picture of Market Street  in the early 19th or 20th century.  Actually, if you look back...  Whoa, he's running in front of the streetcar.  No, watch out. Here it comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you look back to when cars first started driving,  it was chaos.  Yeah.  Is that what this is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, this is video film of a car,  of the early cars on the Market Street  trying to navigate around our street cars,  around horse-drawn carriages, and of course,  pedestrians who just don't know what to do with this thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There were games people would play trying to rush in front of cars.  This is the table coming in, it's not going to turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Where did you get that video, Jason Clantus?  That's a great video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just on YouTube.  It's from Market Street 100 years ago.  Yeah.  Go back 100 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, 1916, cars were very, very new.  There were a few.  And how people reacted was fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a huge legislative thing with jaywalking.  And in fact, the car industry, as far as I've been able to gather,  was actually pushing legislators to make jaywalking a crime,  because they didn't want cars to hit people, obviously.  That's bad marketing.  So jaywalking, there were people who were publicly  defending the right of people to just cross roads whenever they wanted.  And eventually, obviously, this all got sorted out, presumably,  by people getting run over.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It has a remarkably salubrious effect on the body-politter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know, Brad's right about the way you learn.  Even people learn by having accidents.  I've got three girls now who all drive.  They've all had fender benders.  They've all had sort of not big accidents,  but things where they made an assumption,  and someone else made an assumption.  It's true.  To some extent, that's how you learn.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the other thing is that you build a mental model of how cars behave.  So if you're used to cars yielding for you,  then you can be messed up by something that can't stop.  No.  The classic thing here is trains.  People's intuitions about how cars and even buses behave  are based on the fact that they can actually stop.  Whereas a train cannot stop.  If you're trying to cross the Caltrain tracks,  the train cannot stop if it sees you.  It takes it half a mile to stop.  And so it can't adjust itself to what you're doing.  And there was a classic thing that they discovered  where they had railway lines and roads that  crossed them at level crossing.  And they thought, oh, I know, we'll cut down the trees in between the two  so that the cars will be able to see the trains coming.  And that way, they'll stop and they won't try and get across.  And what they found was, if people could see the trains, they think,  oh, I can make that.  I can make that.  And they kept getting hit by the trains.  I can make it.  So they put the trees back up so you couldn't see the train,  and then people were more cautious.  Because the problem is your intuition comes from other cars.  And other cars can actually slow down.  The train's going 300 miles an hour.  It smashes a train.  Well, no, not in America.  If it's doing 50 miles an hour, you're lucky.  Maybe 70 if the track's heavy.  And I suppose the other thing is that if you see a train coming,  you may be stuck there for half an hour as the damn freight goes past.  So that's the other reason you try and get across in front of it.  But people's intuitions are wrong about these things  because they've built them in one space,  and they try and apply them in the other.  How funny.  There was this whole big thing some middle of last year  where people kept saying, making trolley thought experiment things.  You know, the trolley problem of, do you divert the trolley  to hit one person rather than five and all that thought experiment things.  And then they were saying, should your self-driving car  drive you off the bridge to stop you hitting the school bus?  And I'm like, have you guys seen a school bus?  If a school bus hits your car, you're dead.  The school bus is fine.  If you look up school bus car crash, what you see is destroyed cars  and very large school buses that are completely fine  because they weigh 15 tonnes and they can resist impact.  You know, they don't have seat belts in them  because they can't stop that quickly.  And that was the reason they built them like that.  You know, they actually understood physics there.  And this is the same, you know, this is an example of the same thing.  It's like there is a big piece of physics here,  which is that thing is a large piece of metal that is moving faster than you.  And you should get out of this way.  And if you haven't actually factored that into your model,  if you don't actually have an understanding of how different things  on the road can accelerate and decelerate, you're going to get it wrong.  So I suspect that's the piece that they have to go back and build into this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the part that interests me more is how these robot cars  and AI in general are going to build a sort of model  of predictable human behaviour based on facial gestures  or finger gestures or, you know, how are they going to use  kind of nonverbal cues and other things to determine the things  that we naturally determine without even realising it probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. So that's, yeah, the stuff we've got on the screen,  that they show them, they have an understanding and a projection  of the vectors of the existing cars and how they're moving.  And they project those forward and they understand  where there's a space that makes sense and where there isn't.  And they can cope with, you know,  they've got a compilation of weird random stuff we've seen on the road  in Mountain View, like people driving the wrong way down the lane.  Because there are some bits of Mountain View where you've got these six lane roads  and you take the wrong junction and suddenly you're driving the wrong way down the road.  And they've got a motion capture of this.  And they're like, OK, I will get out of the way of that thing until it comes the other way.  Yeah, so you're seeing it here.  So they draw boxes around everything else on the road.  And they draw these little fence things you can see there  are then projecting somebody might cross here. Wow. Look at that.  And so they don't walk through those fences.  That's the example of when to stop.  And when they come to a junction, they decide, am I safe to go or not?  Based on are these these these things here or not?  And the challenge is that there are times, you know,  Mountain View is a relatively easy place to navigate.  It's got wide roads. They've got wide lanes.  There aren't that many pedestrians or cyclists, except in a few little bits of it.  Whereas if you try to navigate through Boston or London or Bombay or something,  you would have to train it completely differently.  And this is part of the problem they have.  The other problem they have is they Mountain View has a very lovely climate,  like like climate here. Exactly.  These cars have not seen much rain.  They've never seen any snow or they've seen a little bit of snow  because sometimes they've taken a detour or something.  But it's not it's not part of their learned environment much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could probably wipe out border or more of the population of San Francisco  simply by having a little snow, because parking and driving on those hills,  your life would change dramatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Well, the other thing is when it does rain here,  you know, the first rain of the autumn after it hasn't rained for six months,  exactly, everyone crashes their car.  They don't because they forgot how to drive in the rain.  Also, all the water floods across the places in the traction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And theoretically, this is where AI could come in really handy.  Once the once cars build a model of one thing,  they're not going to forget what it's like when it rains.  They're not going to forget what it's like.  That's supposed to be the point. Yeah. Right.  And if you've got cars like Uber, every or not Uber, sorry, but  Tesla cars, every Tesla car that is encountering something new  is effectively building that database for all those other cars.  So the more you have, presumably, the smarter they get faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's that's supposed to be the point is that each of them  learns from each other, but it also means they will make the same mistake.  So, you know, if one of them thinks it's time to ram buses,  all of them think it's time to ram buses.  And they, you know, in this case, there was a complicated set of circumstances  it was trying to trying to solve.  And that and that it was it was an edge case that they hadn't found.  And but and this is there was a sort of weird ad where Mercedes said,  we've driven 10,000 miles in our self-driving cars.  That's nothing. Yeah.  Google has driven like I used to do that in a year.  Over a million. Yeah, I used to do that in a year.  But it's like, you know, Google's done over a million miles and they  and they've all learned from each other.  The other thing is that that and Brad's written about this a bit, I think, is that  they the at the moment, these self-driving cars can only drive along roads  that they've got properly mapped, which means some a human has to have driven  the LIDAR thing down that road first.  So they've actually got the sense of where all the lampposts and things are.  But also to some, I think they have to have driven it more than once.  So they've got at least a sense of which things are permanent,  which things are temporary.  So they've got they're building the 3D model of what they're seeing.  And the back to the 3D model level is established.  So they understand what they're doing in that space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody fired up the bit torn again, Kevin.  I'm going to have to interrupt you.  This is wiki.  It's that wiki going crazy.  We're going to take a break anyway.  It's a really fun conversation, of course, as always, is when we get  Kevin Martz and Matthew Ingram in the same room.  And I'm glad you could be here for it.  We'll have more with them in just a bit.  Here's a video somebody in the chat room gave us of driving in an intersection  in India and you just you don't know how how is this even how come people?  How how they don't have a roundabout, they don't need it.  We don't need no stinking roundabout.  Just drive, go where you think you're you need to be.  And let the devil take the hindmost.  Well, of course, it's sped up, but slightly sped up.  But I don't think it's that much.  Yeah, you can see how close the pedestrians on the right  come to getting clobbered.  I mean.  Wow. Just wow.  Notice how easily the bus got through, by the way.  Nobody they know that much.  Nobody gets in the way of the buses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But this is a video.  So it's like they build up a line.  So it's it's you know, in theory, that's what traffic lights are doing.  In practice, this is what these things do is like, OK, when there are eight of us  here, then we get to go because I wonder if it's more efficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I wonder if this is better than traffic.  Probably is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it is, I think people learn  different kinds of behavior.  I had this discussion with somebody about when we were in Europe,  we were talking about the driving where you shouldn't  and in lanes where you're clearly not supposed to go.  And and his argument was that this was actually better  than having too many rules and too many laws,  because then people are more prepared for paying attention.  Right. So they're paying attention because they know  that car might just suddenly swerve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Anna Roy, who's in our chat room, who posted the link, says  that per capita motor deaths in India are 16 times that of the UK.  So maybe not. Maybe not.  Maybe it's not such a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it's maybe it's not quite that good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've seen the comment about what did you people someone from the future.  What did you do before self-driving cars?  Oh, you know, we just drove cars ourselves.  But didn't millions of people die? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's OK. That's you know, that's part of the deal.  That's how it is.  I do I do remember being in Cairo and stunned  by how the traffic is downtown Cairo.  And somebody told me they had put in stoplights and it was such a mess  because people just ignore them. So they just took them out.  Right. They just took them out.  It's like that was a bad idea. They didn't work.  Yeah. So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's the roundabouts thing as well.  It's like in the UK, we have we have roundabouts.  We do in Canada, too.  Yeah, we're starting to do them here.  Stop sign junctions. Yeah, there are there are like, you know,  there are a few over here.  But the point is there in the UK, you will you will have them  at the place that before we stop sign here would probably be around  about there a lot of the time.  But also they will have a bigger junction.  So a junction like that sort of one in India would have a roundabout in the middle.  And that forces you to actually basically what it does is it turns a four way  junction into a series of three way junctions.  So it actually simplifies the calculation you make because your calculation  is is there someone coming from the left?  If there is a weight, if there isn't, I can come into this thing.  And then when you go out, can I get out onto the right here?  And the bigger ones will have two lanes in the middle  and you can join the roads at a point.  But the point is, the reason you put this giant circle in the middle  is to reduce that, you know, reduce  a complex junction into a series of smaller junctions.  And that's that's the design process for it.  And you think it would work here.  I think the thing that's weird here is you have these  you have these computer controlled ones before,  but you have roads that look like this.  You know, in England, you don't have eight lane suburban roads.  Right. Right.  You barely have anything in France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. Part of it is a volume problem.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the one of the reasons you need all these these  you need all these traffic lights and lanes and things here  is because the roads have been built that right.  And one of the interesting things in sort of urban design is rethinking that  and restructuring the roads rather than having a six,  you know, six, 12 foot wide lanes  going down to fewer to fewer 10 foot wide lanes and a barrier and a bike lane  and then rethinking the junctions so that the bikes can actually turn  without being hit by cars by putting pieces that are  almost around about in there as well.  And there's a there's a sort of growth of  rethinking junction design and planning that  has moved away from this.  You know, the cars must move and the traffic lights will make them stop.  The other weird thing here is that in California,  it's rare to have traffic lights that that understand that other junctions exist.  They basically will operate independently, whereas in Europe,  they will they will phase them so that as you drive up to one,  it will assume that if you drive through the speed limit to the next one,  that one will then be green and you can you can go through that.  You know, there are it's rare.  There's like three or four of them.  It's rare. There's like three streets in San Francisco that do it.  Most of them are autonomous junctions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we have timed lights in many of our suburban areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, not yet. Not so many.  You can go to Pine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can go all the way up Pine if you time it right.  All the way down Bush. There's certain certain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, there were three.  That's what I'm saying. There's two like thoroughfares that do that in San Francisco.  But it's not it's not an assumed thing.  They figured out the suburbs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's your use of space, right?  In Europe, there's so little space in the US.  The reason why there's so many giant freeways is because there's lots of roads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  Kevin Marks, Matthew Ingram.  We're talking twig. Jeff has the week off.  He'll be back next week.  Our show today brought to you by Carbonite.  Good thing to keep in mind.  Your hard drive will die.  And Carbonite is there to help you back it up.  I want you to visit Carbonite.com.  C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com.  If you don't have, by the way, this is exactly how backup should be.  It's automatic, right?  So it's not like sometimes some backup program.  Oh, yeah, we're going to on a schedule every Sunday.  We'll back. No, this is always backing up whenever you're online.  Continuous. So you change your file immediately.  It's backed up.  And because let's face it, a lot of data disaster is just from, you know,  human error, trashing a file that you need.  Having those versions there is great.  It's also great and very important.  If you bit by one of the crypto ransomware programs,  Carbonite, in fact, there's a white paper on the Carbonite site  about how Carbonite can help you not get bit by ransomware.  If that hospital in Southern California had been using Carbonite,  wouldn't have had a problem.  Automatic, continuous and oh, finally, it's off site.  It's in the Carbonite cloud where your data is kind of on vacation.  It's just relaxing.  It's enjoying the climate controlled data center.  The attention of of talented engineers around the clock, keeping your data safe.  Should you need it?  Boom, bam, it's back.  You can fact you can log on to a carbonite account on any computer and see your stuff.  Visit it. You can even use their free apps.  And they are very big on security and privacy.  That's paramount.  So here's the deal. I want you to try it.  Go to carbonite.com, use our offer code twig.  And even if you're taking advantage of some of their special deals,  like right now, it's 30 percent off for a limited time,  you still can get two months free when you use the offer code twig on sign up.  So this is a really good time to take a look at carbonite.com.  Big savings and two months free.  You got to back it up.  There is no less expensive cloud storage out there.  Sixty bucks a year for the single computer, the basic plan, unlimited data.  That is Windows or Mac.  That is a year.  That's less than five bucks a month.  That's a really good deal for all the data you can back up.  Carbonite.com. Use the offer code twig.  You get two months free. That makes it even better.  We thank carbonite for their support of this week in Google.  I don't know what this means.  Eric Schmidt has a new job.  He has been appointed the chair of a new Defense Innovation Advisory Board.  Actually, I think this is a great idea if he actually gets to do it.  It's the idea is to help the Department of Defense act more like a tech company.  Twelve individuals who have successfully led large private and public organizations  will be tasked with advising the Pentagon on areas that are deeply familiar  to Silicon Valley companies.  Rapid prototyping, iterative product development,  complex data analysis and business decision making, the use of mobile  and cloud applications and organizational information sharing.  The Department of Defense is massive.  The Pentagon is one of the world's largest office buildings.  They are faced with incredible organizational challenges.  Not, by the way, military strategy, nothing like that.  It's really just modernizing the office.  Which I think is a good thing.  Did you watch any of the testimony yesterday in Congress?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't. I saw tweets about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's all you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tweets. Darrell is apparently doing doing good work there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, good on him. He's a representative from your district, right?  Is he one of yours? Where is Darrell?  Is he Southern California?  The 49th district, wherever that is.  Anyway, he's a good man.  He asked the right questions.  And I have to say, director Comey, James Comey, the director of the FBI,  maybe didn't really get  get all the right answers.  Yeah. One of the things he admitted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like the shredder companies put the shredding back together. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, let's do that. Please unshred this.  Mr. Gorbachev, unshred this document.  He he admitted that they blew it.  And I think that this in the long run, this might hurt the FBI  more than any argument about public safety or the sanctity of encryption.  The FBI admitted, yeah, we changed the iCloud password  because we thought that would work.  We were wrong.  Had they asked Apple and Apple's been quick to say this,  including yesterday in front of Congress, had they asked us,  they would have just given them a copy of the iCloud backup.  They could have just brought that that iPhone into an area  where it's already paired with the Wi-Fi.  It would have backed itself up and we would have gladly handed that data over.  The FBI was too smart by half.  And apparently that impressed members of Congress more than anything else.  You mean you blew it and now you want Apple to go fix your mistake?  It's unfortunate because that's well, that's the problem.  It doesn't really get to the heart of the matter, which is should phones be  private or not?  Should there be a Kalia style back?  I don't want to use a word back door. It's loaded.  A Kalia style interface for law enforcement into our phones,  just there, just as there is an interface for law enforcement into telecommunications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's why if they were looking for,  you know, a case that would give them a precedent, they picked the wrong one.  Because this isn't. They blew it.  Right. Because they made the mistake that they're now trying to fix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stupid. What's going on there?  Is your is your wife? Is it raining in Florida?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you hear that? And Mrs. Ingram is stuck in there and going into a glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's really like, I gotta get out.  She's what she's pacing the floor like a taged tiger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not exactly. Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a vivid imagination.  He Darrell is of northern San Diego.  Darrell is a representative for northern San Diego.  Carlsbad and Ocean Signage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they kind of shot themselves in the foot, right?  What if they had chosen a case?  Presumably, there are many not just this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Cyrus Vance Jr., the district attorney in Manhattan, says, I have  he testified to this as if this is a good thing.  I happen to have one hundred seventy five iPhones I'd really like help with.  Like that was like that was persuasive.  Oh, no. Yes, we have.  We could really use this, Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That kind of craters the it's just this iPhone. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These guys got to get on the same page. Yeah.  There's also there's also  let's see the issue of this this case in Brooklyn, where the judge,  the magistrate said, no, Apple, Apple doesn't have to do that.  That's a that's asking way too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that was fascinating.  Yeah. But some of his arguments were really, really powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He just laid it on the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's also the insight.  I know I hope this doesn't get glossed over.  Walt Mossberg pointed out  that Apple does, in fact, have access to the entire contents of your iPhone  if you use iCloud backup and gladly, gladly will hand this over.  And as many times. Yeah.  And so that might be something you want to keep in mind.  I mean, it's it's hard on the one hand for Apple to say,  well, we fight for your privacy.  And on the other hand, to say, but we have built it a mechanism  we expect almost everybody to use that will make your data completely transparent.  What is exactly Apple's point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that there's a bunch of certain points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead, please explain to me, Mr.  Mr. Marks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the point is that they are saying you're trying to weaponize the software  update mechanism, and that's a bad thing.  I agree with that.  Because that will stop people using software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's a general vulnerability in almost all software.  Is that software update could always be used by the company that is, you know,  my Microsoft or Google could always be used to get in to the stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you know, there have been previously been exploits that have basically  been been fake software updates, update servers before they built

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  key signing changes. There is now on Macintosh.  There's an update or a lot of companies use, including VLC called Sparkle.  That is an updating service that they use, you know, as open source.  And in Sparkle, you have the choice of using HTTP or HTTPS.  And a number of companies, including VLC, chose HTTP.  So it's trivial to man in the middle of the software update. Right.  And a software update essentially means  we could do anything we want. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the point is, they have to.  So what they're what to some extent, what they're arguing about is not so much  the software side of it as the as the signing side of it and saying,  you are forcing us to sign something that is yours rather than rather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the free speech argument that we you can't make us sign this. Right. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that, you know, and that's so some of the debate was like, you know,  what if we kidnap the engineers?  Could they do it? And the answer is no, you'd have to kidnap the person with the key.  Right. And there's a revocation mechanism and so on.  And when we get into like this sort of pay, actually, that's an interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hadn't heard them say there's a revocation mechanism.  If you can you use that?  Because if you revoked it, wouldn't all the existing iPhones be unable to update?  Aren't they expecting the signing key from Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, they are. So I think I'd have to I don't know the exact protocol.  There are protocols for saying this case revoked, you need to go and fetch a new key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That that has been that was built into Blu Ray.  They've never invoked it.  But that was one of the ways that the Motion Picture Association responded  to the almost instantaneous cracking of DVDs, content protection mechanisms, CSS.  They said, well, this time we're going to have a revocable key because last time we didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. But it gets very messy.  And, you know, we we get into, you know, key distribution methods.  And the problem is, how do I get to the next key?  And how do when I've revoked that key and then I've got to go and get it.  And that may that gives you another surface for attack.  And you raised a really good point is if we can't trust software updates,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  no one will update.  And that is a bigger security flaw than anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And that's you know, that's that, you know, that's to some extent,  that's the problem that, you know, Google has the opposite problem in that people  don't install software updates because of the process for getting them is more complicated  and involves carriers and things.  Whereas Apple has built a straight path route to them,  which means they can deploy software if it's much more easily.  So what that means is that it is easier is often easier to hack Android phones  because some of the exploits go unpatched in a large proportion of them.  So there's a there's a there's a problematic trade off there as well.  All right. Some of the less informed stuff people were saying, well, I can get  I can get my phone hacked in any shop in the high street.  It's like, well, you can because they have a database of exploits for a set of phones  so they can jailbreak them. But that is necessarily the same as this.  And it doesn't there aren't no I don't know.  I'm not sure if there are some new news with me, but there aren't known good,  good zero days for that generation of iPhones, as far as I know.  Right. In a particular case. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me see here.  Somebody just said that Slice soft is back, but I don't see it.  I just went to Slice soft dot.  I'm sorry. Any DVD dot com, the Slice soft company that makes  Blu Ray Ripper and their page still says due to recent regulatory requirements,  we've ceased all activities relating to Slice soft.  So but somebody says that maybe they've got a way.  Torrent Freak says there's a way back.  Freaks says it's back. Yeah.  We'll have to see. Maybe they're maybe they're trying to do  under the radar so we won't say anything because Hollywood popcorn time is back to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you can't win the canyon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How about this? And I want you to try this, Kevin Marks.  One of the problems with tap to pay, at least as Apple Pay and Google Pay  and Android Pay and all these others are implemented is even when I do that,  I still have to enter my PIN code and say, do you want to do you want cash back?  And it ends up being the same interaction.  Not less painful because of tap to pay.  So now Google's trying hands free payments.  This is an April Fool's joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems dodgy to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is very much like the Apple Pay ad where you have to go  through your wallet to find your tap to pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So very limited release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're doing this in the South Best.  I want you to try it, Kevin McDonald's and somewhere else in your area.  By saying your initials, you say your initials.  Yeah, that's the cure.  That one.  No one knows your initials, Kevin X Marks, KXM.  I don't know what your middle initial is.  So is it voice recognition?  Must be voice recognition.  Well, now you just gave it away, Kevin KJM.  That's weird.  That doesn't seem like a very secure system.  Also, why Papa John?  Papa John's and McDonald's.  Maybe this is you think this is a joke?  And look at that URL, get.google.com  slash hands free only merch, though.  So what's the URL?  Get.google.com slash hands free.  It says it's secure, full card details will not be shared  once you complete a purchase, you received instant notification on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's a Google Commerce blog post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's an app.  Let me let me let me go see Google Play hands for you can download the app.  Oh, man, I got to install this on my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is crazy for your next trip to the South Bay McDonald's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I might drive down tonight.  Papa John's so he uses local services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, ask for initials and then uses the picture to confirm your identity.  So you don't even use tap to pay.  You don't even use your phone.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's facial recognition by the by the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you say I'll pay with Google at checkout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have a camera.  Oh, yeah, that's Leo.  What's your initials?  And if that matches, then they go, OK, thank you.  We're going to debit that guy Leo's account.  Thank you. We're going to debit that guy Leo's account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the images captured by the hands-free camera are deleted immediately, it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure, I was told to see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, well, you have an assignment.  You got to go to McDonald's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there Papa John's nearby or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it McDonald's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's funny that they're doing it in Silicon Valley only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it makes sense to that's that's that's where they can try it.  Yeah, so that's where employees are.  But yeah, I think, you know, there was somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they must have very strong confidence in their facial recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Is that it depends what you compare it to.  I mean, it's like credit cards in America are ridiculously insecure.  I can give my son my credit card and he goes shopping with it.  And this was true when he was 15.  You know, the physical possession of the thing with a magnetic stripe  is the thing you're competing with here.  So somebody did this thing of.  Imagine the pitch meeting for chip and pin.  It's like it's like swapping your credit card, but you have to stick it in there.  And it makes a bunch of funny noises at you.  And it takes twice as long.  So why would anyone do this?  And the reason is, it's a second factor authentication.  And it comes to have a second factor.  But also it's a  the reason they want everyone to upgrade their point of sales  so that they can use time to pay, because that's the thing  they actually want you to use, which is right. The  that confirmation thing.  And you have you know, there are cards with that.  There are very few American banks issue them, but they're widely issued in Europe.  And you can pay with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been using them for a year or more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's just America being behind a lot of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, now we're ahead.  Now we're way ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But remember this because we had to have to pay on the on the Android phone.  I know until Apple does it, it doesn't exist.  I'm sorry. It was I remember this because I saw they I saw the Lego in the store  and I tapped my phone on the thing and the first thing I did was like,  what did you just do? Did you hack my tool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The cash register door just opened.  Oh, my God. What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a thing. It's like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was actually reluctant to use tap to pay for the longest time,  because exact because for that exact reason, I thought they're not going to believe this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But also, Samsung have done that thing where they they they  emulate the swipe magnetic field as if you were swiping it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they use a magnetic.  That's what that original what was the name of that card  that I really thought was a bad idea where it actually did that.  You would you would you had one card for all your cards.  You'd press a button to choose the card and then you'd swipe it.  And it magnetically would change which coin coin.  Yeah. Yeah.  Remember that? Yep.  But but that's what Samsung Pay does.  Without that, it just kind of generates a magnetic field, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use Samsung Pay all the time. Do you?  Yeah. And people go crazy over it.  They're like, wait, you can't do that.  That's not a tap to pay terminal. Right.  Yeah, because the terminals, it doesn't require any update.  Right. The hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which, by the way, if you're going to a store where they haven't updated  the hardware to tap to pay. Well, you know, right.  Petaluma. Yeah, I know.  Yeah, we still have a video.  We still have a video story.  They have VHS tapes. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that's this is another story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we had one, but I'm pretty sure it was a money laundering run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it is here, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you see that post from KQED about Netflix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was interesting. KQED, our local public broadcasting station.  What about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the challenge is that the problem is that Netflix is catalog is rotting.  Now, we know this about the streaming catalog is that now if you  use that, there used to be more films available for streaming.  And now there aren't. And they've lost a lot of the classic stuff. Right.  But this is also true of the DVD and Blu-ray catalog, too,  because fewer people are using it and they're not replacing the old discs.  So their sort of library ability is shrinking.  So they're like the more obscure art films or the older films  that they only had a few copies of are falling out of the catalog  because they're not replacing them.  And they're not bothering to sign up rights to stream them  because they're mostly signing up TV shows instead. Right.  And they've and they've stopped trying to be the...  It's just Netflix changing, isn't it? It's just becoming a different thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all about original content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it is a problem is that the question is, is like, OK,  so who is going to have that archive? Where do I get...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No one. Your VHS store down the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And there's this sort of weird thing where those stores are coming back.  And part of it, there's also a structural thing, which is the doctrine of first sale,  which is if I buy a Blu-ray, I can rent it to you. That's allowed.  If I have a digital copy, I can't because there isn't a transferable license on those.  And so they have to do a per studio negotiation and the studios...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Could you buy a Blu-ray, rip it, put it on a USB key and rent it that way? No.  No, no, no, that'd be wrong.  Because it's a physical object.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aren't there any sort of niche torrents that are effectively,  you know, this is all the weird...  Ask Kanye West. I think he knows how to find those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, this is what's happening is that people are building like closed group  curated things of, you know, like my my uncle, who's like in his 70s,  has signed up for this opera torrent site because he's into opera.  And it's run out of Argentina and they have all the great...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a great argument for Bitcoin preserving this cultural heritage.  It's just like the the game rom sites that are technically illegal,  but they're preserving important artistic heritage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And this is the archive argument.  But a lot of what they're trying to do is digitize things proactively  and then work out how they can do it out.  So they do it with books.  So they just try to print books.  They'll show digitize in print books and lend them out  as if they were a digital library and try and look at Preston there.  But it's hard to do for films.  No, there's there's there's there's agreements they can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Public library, somebody's pointing out Brian NW in our chair.  And the public library often has Blu-ray and DVDs.  Yes. But I mean, I'll try and find the article because...  That's a very interesting point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Netflix has been our film reviewer at KQED saying,  I can't get hold of these things anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I wanted to watch an old Steve Martin movie,  and most of them have not been are not streaming.  Yeah. And so you have to buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  I tried to remember when Robin Williams died.  Same thing.  I wanted to go and find all the Robin Williams stuff.  And some of it was quite easy to find.  But there were some that, you know, you really had to.  There weren't that many people seating.  There were men because until he died, they weren't actually that popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You couldn't even get them on BitToy.  That's how hard they are to find.  Yeah, that's how hard it is.  You can't even pirate them.  Well, I think it's a strong argument for Internet Archive.  And but the problem is that there's far more stuff.  He doesn't.  At this point, I don't think he's saving a lot of old movies.  He is doing they I should say they.  I think of it as Brewster Gale.  But they are preserving roms.  No, they're preserving roms, though.  Yeah. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, they do do movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's what's that video we saw of San Francisco.  That was for the Internet Archive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have it. They have an archive of old films.  There's the Prolinger Archive.  Oh, that's an amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's not that's not like Hitchcock films.  That's just some guys home movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's it's it's a collection of things that have got out of copyright  and a collection of public information films, things like that.  Right. So they've they've got like older stuff before copyright  got extended to ridiculous lengths.  And they've got things that have fell out of copyright as well.  But yeah, I think they want to digitize more and they want to be able to do this.  But it's a it's a challenge of working out what's what's actually practical  and which order they attack these things in.  But it's it is an issue anyway.  So I put the link in the chat for the KQED one,  which was explicitly about I'm I'm trying to review this film  that is cited as a classic and I can't get a copy anywhere.  Even that even the public library and I had to go to the specialist  San Francisco cult video store to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the good news.  Mark Zuckerberg is is denying that he is the commander of a VR army.  The fact that he felt he had to respond to this is hysterical.  This is the picture Mark posted on Facebook of him at the Samsung event  where everybody in the audience, all the journalists were looking at video  on a VR headset and he was able to just stride in unencumbered  by this vision of the future. Great photo.  It's just it says so much.  But the fact that he felt he had to respond to this,  he did an interview with a German newspaper, Die Welt am Sonntag,  and he denied enjoying the fact that he was seemingly commanding a VR army.  He says, quote, Nothing could be further from the truth.  The exact opposite is the case.  Boy, when they start denying it, that's when you know  what was going on inside the headsets was a video of children playing soccer  in some faraway place.  You could look around and you could see the kids playing soccer around.  It was a shared experience with everyone in that place.  It would have been impossible to experience otherwise.  They were enjoying their their.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the point is that he posted that shot himself.  He didn't he didn't get it.  He still doesn't get it.  The motherland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He didn't see it.  He still doesn't see the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a vine going around of a guy sitting there  experiencing Oculus and there's a girl sitting next to him.  And she's got this look on her face.  She's looking into the camera.  Like, what am I even doing here?  Because he's like moving.  And we talked about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was this on the Twitter last Sunday about how you look  like the Star Wars kid, you know, the kid fighting with a lightsaber  when you're when you're doing VR games, you look impossibly dorky.  But you don't know it because in the next level, it's next level dorky.  It is as bad as it can get.  And that's why when you see on the cover of Newsweek,  Palmer Lucky, the CEO of Oculus, going like this and is in his thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I mean, this is going to be presumably interim technology, right?  Like magically, the whole promise of that is plug it in here in your environment.  Yeah, plug it in.  You don't have to put on a ski mask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'll still look dorky when you're fighting aliens that only you can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a business insider.  I'm trying to find it, but that's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can watch Twitter on Sunday and see it.  It was very it was it was hysterical because she's going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How epic it is inside the VR and how ordinary it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's not so epic.  Actually, gamers look bad.  We've just gotten used to it.  All gamers look bad, true kind of slack jawed.  And but this is this is worse.  Hey, here's a tool I didn't know existed.  And it's somebody's GitHub project.  Turns out there's geolocation.  I didn't know this in YouTube videos.  So he's made a YouTube video geosearch  where you can search your address and see what your neighbors are posting on YouTube.  This seems like a troubling phenomenon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't even know that was possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't.  But I didn't.  Well, there's there's like data in the stream.  So they put location of the camera, puts location in like you shoot up your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who knew that our video is posting our neighbors are posting  Mulchstock 2015, the largest peaceful lawn transformation on record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who knew that's that's this is down the street.  Actually, I could have guessed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mulchstock. Wow.  This is wow.  So there you go.  And that, by the way, that address is long.  OK, I'm going to stop mulchstock right now.  YouTube, GitHub, I.O.  And then Geo Dash Search Dash tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, great. Kevin put the link to the.  The video and she's a she's a design researcher, a research.  Yes. Oh, she's she's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the short version.  This is the this is just the single the single vine.  But it serves the purpose.  It's just the look on her face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Definitely. She's certainly mugging to the camera.  She's like, that's just a headband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just like he's like, you can tell that's how you would feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's how you look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And for you, it's a magical, miraculous experience.  Oh, man. For everyone around you, they're going, oh, dear.  What a world we live in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the thing that Zuckerberg didn't get is is that it is that photograph  is the sort of perfect metaphor for Zuckerberg controlling what everyone sees.  And he doesn't didn't see that.  You know, it it is like it's the Apple of the Lemmings ad from 1985.  And it is literally blind for except the one guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is pretty much literally the Lemmings ad.  All he needed was a hammer.  No, no, that's the Lemmings was the year after.  Oh, Lemmings, where they're marching off the cliff.  If they're actually with blindfolds on that, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  not nine eighty four because nine, you know, nine, eight, four.  He's the guy on the screen. He's not the girl with a hammer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. He's the other one.  The people I don't know.  He's the guy who's not what day we celebrate the first anniversary

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  of the information purification directive, you know, that that one.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fifteen thousand vibes sold in.  Ten minutes at eight hundred bucks a pop.  And that's fifteen thousand people are going to look really dorky  to their girlfriends.  Fifteen thousand.  And this is much more expensive than Oculus.  Yeah. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. Did you say in front of their girlfriends?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. If they have them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No comment.  Their imaginary girlfriends.  Well, they're friends.  Could be their boyfriends.  I feel like it's well, I don't know.  I don't want someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Someone also said is like, you know, what would actually make more sense  if you put this into a motorcycle helmet?  Because they look less dorky and be then when you walk into something,  you wouldn't hurt your head.  Exactly. That's a good idea.  Somebody has made a motorcycle helmet with a with a heads up display in it.  But it's actually fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is. I've been trying to get it.  I want to. Yeah.  The problem with that in all VR is you can't demonstrate it.  Scully, scully and that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, Scully is the company with the helmet.  Yeah. With a K.  Yeah, it was Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wasn't it? Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Crowd from. Yeah, we're trying.  I think we're trying. It was a demo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was it was in all the places.  Yeah. But when they build it, because we know the people who know them,  because they were the electric, the bolt, the bicycle guys, electric  bicycle guys know the Scully guys.  Yeah. It's a small community of strange people.  Strange to wield people.  Strange to wield people.  All right. One last story, and then we're going to take a break.  This is coming up later on Tech News Tonight.  Tech News Today.  Lindsay Turrentine, who wrote the piece in CNET about the last taco truck  in Silicon Valley.  It's actually it's actually, I guess, dystopian fiction.  But I don't know.  There used to be plenty of taco trucks in Silicon Valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But then it said, sorry, I need to get out of here soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because I just realized it's like you've got a storm coming is what you got, dude.  It is it is like you're going to you're going to blow away in a moment.  So let's take a break.  Stay tuned for the discussion.  TNT is just around the corner about eight minutes from now.  Our show today brought to you by Fresh Books.  Oh, I love Fresh Books. Nice Canadian guys.

Transcript:  Well, as always, there's IndieWebCamp events going on.  There's an IndieWebCamp two day event coming up in Boston,  well, Cambridge, MIT, the 14th and 15th of March.  So put that on your calendars.  And then there's also the regular homebrew website clubs every other Wednesday.  So IndieWebCamp.com, if you scroll down to the bottom, there's a list of events there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I feel like we did we did two mitzvahs for IndieWebCamp.  We did Ward Cunningham's Federated Wiki, which was started there.  And and now Gnu Social.  We are all in on the IndieWeb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gnu Social, we're still working on making them more more IndieWeb friendly.  The other news from that is that we're getting some of the IndieWeb  protocols validated by the W3C.  So WebMention and MicroPub are going through the draft process at W3C  at the moment in the social web working group.  They've just been published this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really good page at IndieWebCamp.com right at the beginning, the Get Started page.  You'll find a link right on the front there.  And it's a way that the things you can do to kind of support the idea of an independent  web where you own your stuff and it still lets you participate  in the social web. Absolutely.  And I plug for WithKnown.com because they really.  Yeah, you get it.  You kind of get it all if you have a WithKnown site.  It's all there. Webhooks and everything.  That's all. Yeah. Yeah. Love it. OK.  Thank you. Kevin. Always a pleasure. KevinMarx.com.  He's off to that McDonald's to try saying his initials and get a Big Mac.  I'll pay you that when I come. You got to do it. You got to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to go on the train now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Matthew Ingram, anything you want to give us a plug for?  Anything you want to talk about?  Hmm. It's getting dark in Florida, folks.  It is getting dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When the lights go down on Biscayne Bay.  I can't think of anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't have to. You don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you jealous that I'm sitting here with a Galaxy S7 in my hot little hands  and not just anyone? Gold.  It is it is aggressively.  Pretty sweet. Aggressively gold.  You know what? I like it. Yeah.  Now, there's a few things that you have to get used to with Samsung.  Physical home key.  And then and it's a little annoying that the buttons.  And by the way, they're capacitive on the metal.  So that's cool.  But they're reversed from how everybody else does it.  The the and the recents button is on the left and the back buttons on the right.  You know, yeah, if you're a Sammy user, you probably just kind of, you know,  you get used to it.  Fingerprint reader is very good.  Man, is it a gorgeous screen? 5.5 inches.  And while I even looks nice from here, isn't it?  Yeah. Even on Skype, it looks good.  That's how good it is.  Man, is this camera good?  Oh, my goodness gracious.  One F1 to seven, which means you're getting amazing images  that are really that rival DSLR.  I mean, this thing and this is pretty amazing.  This is low light here.  I mean, this is we're in a restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That clarity through the glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Clarity is in that is pretty good.  We're all in low light.  Oh, yes. So this is as this is our TV station.  Here's Anthony Nielsen running the board for TNT.  I took the same picture with a Leica Q.  And, you know, if I put them side by side, you'd be hard pressed.  You'd have to really do a lot of pixel peeping to tell the difference.  How big is the screen?  Five and a half inches.  But because of the bezel free sides, you know, the edge goes over the edge.  It doesn't. It's actually feels very compact in the hand.  It's a great way to get a giant phone without having it feel like a giant phone.  The only couple, you know, the other negatives are this edge.  And I've had this problem with the S6 edge as well, because it goes around.  It's there's nowhere to hold.  So you activate it by mistake. Yeah, you can get a stray.  You have to kind of learn how to hold it like flat palm, which is a little weird.  I don't use this edge mechanism that but you maybe maybe you'd like it.  To me, this seems like a silliness.  But, you know, Samsung always has to do something that makes it different  than every other Android device, which, of course, means it's not going to be updated as fast.  But it is Marshmallow at 6.01. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple has that now on the iPad.  And I'm constantly going to flip a page and flip board or something  and swiping out a menu from the right hand side, you know, because it wants to offer you  the ability to do two things at once, pull something open.  And then you on the sides, I'm triggering that thing accidentally, like half a dozen times a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's so funny because I have the opposite.  I can never get it to swipe over what I want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Only when you don't. It's only when you don't want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. No, I'm you know, it's it's way too early.  I've only had it since Monday.  But battery life looks pretty good.  It's a big battery.  They increased it considerably over the battery on the S6.  So I'll have a better idea of how good the battery is in a few days.  But so far, you know, it's honeymoon still.  We're still in the honeymoon. But boy, is it pretty, isn't it?  Oh, and I love this always on.  So LG is doing this too now because you got an OLED screen.  You can actually there's time and date and notifications are always on.  It's like all the time, all the time.  And actually, I really like that. It's very useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like I have an LG G3 or G3.  It's a G3 because I smashed my Nexus six  and haven't got the screen replaced.  So I got a G3 for zero dollars from my from my phone company.  You know, it's so but I do like the LG.  The tap that makes the screen come alive.  If you just want to check the time or see what the battery life is or  see what a message is, I think that's a great feature.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like, you know, here's the deal.  We have great choice now.  A lot of people just choose the iPhone because that's the default.  You can't go wrong. Choose an iPhone.  But I believe that we have excellent choices.  And I have to say, Samsung is just making some really beautiful hardware.  Couldn't be happier.  But that wraps it up.  Thank you, Matthew, for joining us. Fortune.  Com Matthew's writing is a must read every single day.  He writes longer, thoughtful pieces now.  And I'm really glad that they have you doing that because you're great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great. Well, thanks.  Yeah. And if if anybody fortune.com or at Matthew on Twitter,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  if you can, if you get any big scoops and don't forget, even small scoops,  don't forget, he's also on Twitter.  No, exactly. The worst name ever.  Quitter, you're a quitter.  Yeah, I quit. Twitter quitter.  I'm a Twitter quitter. Oh, I get it.  Is that what it is?  I don't know. But that seems like it should be a show title.  Twitter quitter. Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it sort of defines what you are.  I don't want to be a quitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah.  I might start my own. You could you you can join it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want these things to work.  I was going to say to Kevin, he's so passionate about this stuff.  And and, you know, I get caught up in his in his passion.  And and I and I also want things to be open and federated.  Yes. Really, really hard to get people to go and use those things.  And so then no one's there except people who already agree that that's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. In some ways, that's not bad.  I had some of the best conversations in the early days of Google Plus,  in the early days of Friend Feed, in the early days of Jaiku,  in the early days. So great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love Friend Feed. So good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And you're right.  The smaller, smaller sometimes better.  You have a better discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we need to have just as we do in real life, big venues and little venues.  You can use quitter.no without quitting Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And in a way, you know, I wish if Twitter had not.  I wrote a thing not that long ago about the Twitter that might have been.  And could we get the Twitter that might have been back,  the one that was federated, the one that was, you know, open API  and was just anyone could sort of put in or pull out.  And I think it's too late,  but I kind of wish they hadn't been going for the IPO and all that.  What could it have become?  What things could they have developed that would have solved some of these problems?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a bittersweet end to a very good show.  Thank you, Matthew. Yeah, thanks for having me.  Yeah. And and you have place on your couch.  If Donald Dumpf becomes the president, I can I can move up there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, sure. I've actually been having a lot of inquiries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you see that? Google searches for how do I move to Canada?  Spiked after Super Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not actually as easy.  No, it's hard.  People would like it to be. That's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to stick around.  The fireworks should be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Matthew. Thank you, everybody.
