Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, of course. Yeah. Who wants to be there? Look at those buildings.  They're so beautiful and... Cold and old and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Not at all interesting. Musty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Man, what kind of cameras does Lisa have? That's a good shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, if these are on her cell phone, I'm going to be really impressed.  I believe she's using the Olympus OM-D camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very nice. Very, very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, bye, Leo. Bye, Lisa. We miss you.  But what the heck? Well, life will go on without you.  Here we are. And this week I got some good news, I thought.  I got my Nexus 7 LTE.  I've been waiting for it for weeks. I've been waiting for it to go on sale.  I finally got to order it last week. It didn't arrive before the show.  And here it came on Friday. And I was so happy.  And all your dreams came true, right, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here we go. Watch out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All your dreams came true, Jeff. You waited so long for this tablet to buy it.  You have it now. This is it. This is what you've been hoping for.  I know you're a picky guy. You have very high standards.  You have very specific things that you want.  And now it's in your hands. What's wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How's that LTE working?  Yo, you're cruel. You're cruel. You're cruel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, so I am going psychotic on Verizon because Verizon will not hook up my Nexus LTE.  Now you remember when it was announced months ago. Google said it was going to work.  The first device that was going to work on AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon on LTE.  Wow. There was a slide. You see, in coming weeks, Verizon, right there.  And so I walk into the Verizon store on Saturday and I say,  Hi, I want to give you more money. I want to add this to my shared data collection there, right?  Well, one snotty little smart ass clerk came over and said,  You can't. You can't. It doesn't work. You can't.  I said, No, no, no, no. You don't understand. I looked up things on the line.  I should look. Verizon LTE, this device. Yes, yes, yes.  So I got a nice clerk and I got a manager over as I glared at the other clerk.  And they tried to put in the IMEI for this device.  Wouldn't take it. Wouldn't take it. All around.  So they said, Well, maybe it's just not ready yet.  I said, Oh, they've had months. How ridiculous.  But this happened with my Chromebook Pixel 2.  Where I went in and tried to get the deal, the $10 a month deal that they had.  And it wasn't in a SKU in there. I figured, OK, so they messed up.  Big old Verizon. Well, they're not rich enough, but fine.  I have them call Verizon HQ. They try to do something they can't do either.  I figure, OK, this is frustrating. I'm mad. I leave calmly.  I leave with smile on my face. I say, Thanks for your help, guys.  I get back home and of course I go to Twitter and I say, Oh, VZW support.  I need your help again. Can you get my device hooked up?  Because I want to be a happy customer. I wait until days and then I get this response.  You can put it back up again, Chad. I'm excited.  You got your Nexus 7, but not all LTE tablets are created equal.  It's not part of our lineup and can't be activated.  I'm laying there like the turd it is.  So I have psychotic fits all around.  And then people remind me that Verizon got the LTE spectrum C block,  as it's called, block C rather, in the 700 megahertz band,  on the condition which Google managed to push into the spectrum auction,  the condition that it be open.  And Chad, if you could go back to, and you see that first block quote,  that it must be offered, that no licensees, quote, shall not deny, limit,  or restrict the ability of their customers to use the devices and applications  of their choice on the licensees C block network,  except in so far as there's technical problems or other regulations or statutes.  Well, this is a device that has been approved by the FCC.  This is an LTE device. It works on AT&T. It works on T-Mobile.  And I have a SIM for T-Mobile, by the way, because it came with the device.  Nice deal, one month free. Thank you very much.  Everybody's saying, why did you hook up T-Mobile?  Well, because, number one, I have a shared device account on Verizon  thanks to my Chromebook, Pixel, Google, how could you have made this  a Verizon-only device? My family has their iPads on Verizon.  What can I do about that?  And so it's going to cost me more if I use this on T-Mobile or something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And plus, there's just the justice of it. The justice of it.  By God, Verizon, you will connect my Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I go around, I'm about to end this here. I go around and around and around.  I go on Twitter. A lot of folks come in, huge response on Google Plus  and on Twitter to this. People saying, yeah, why don't you learn Verizon sucks.  Verizon's awful good at T-Mobile. T-Mobile's better.  And I keep on saying, no, I'm going to force them into it.  And then nice folks at Free Press sent me their complaints to the FCC  more than a year ago. And last July, the FCC had a consent decree against Verizon  for $1.25 million because Verizon at the time was forcing Google  to take applications that had tethering out of the Play Store.  That's not open. And so Verizon was told you have to do this.  And Verizon said, oh, yes, we will. And earlier when Google had complained  about Verizon's behavior and sent a very tough letter, Verizon got back and said,  oh, Google, how can you? You're just being catty. No, no, no, no.  We're going to be open. Of course we're going to be open.  Look at all the ways we're going to be open. I tried to find that full post,  which had been quoted on Mars Tech and the government, of course, Verizon has erased it.  So this goes on and on and on around and around.  I then get another tweet from Verizon saying once again, or the technical equivalent thereof.  And so today I wrote and sent a formal complaint to the Federal Communications Commission  Enforcement Division saying, go after them, bastards.  And so I'm not going to rest. I am not going to rest until we bring Verizon to justice,  because this was the whole point of the notion of openness is that we have the choice.  We have the control and Verizon. Take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good for you, Jeff. Good for you. I love that you wrote a formal letter complaint  because, you know, you can go back and forth on Twitter, but that's it's 2013 to El Hel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I want to rename it Del Hel to Tell Hel now.  And it's just it's just absolutely ridiculous. It's galling and the attitude they have.  So Verizon PR didn't respond to me for days. And then finally, after I posted it, they came back  and they sent me a link to their certification requirements.  Hmm. But the problem is, if I go buy a phone here that's unlocked and on GSM and I go to Europe,  all I have to do is put a SIM in it and it works. There's no certification.  There's no this. There's no that. I've taken my my Nexus 40 Europe before, you know, it was sold there.  And no problem. It just works. That's the point of having an open standard, which is what GSM and LTE are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. On Twitter have said. That's exactly right, Jeff. I mean, these are protocols, right?  I mean, all you have to say is I adhere to the protocol, right?  So I've enabled the chip in my device adheres to whatever the standard is, whatever the protocol is,  and it should just work. That's why these things exist.  That's the whole reason people do these things, come up with these protocols.  And there should be no there should be no question about it. Right.  And I think that's why that's T-Mobile's whole value prop, right, is bring bring your own device.  Just come in and it should work and use us. And don't worry about Verizon and all this crap that they send your way.  The other thing is, I wonder how much of this is because they don't have crap where loaded on on the Nexus seven.  I mean, I wonder if they're trying to hold up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, not only that, the second tweet I got from Verizon support when they said, no, no, no, it can't be activated.  They said, here's a link to all the nice things will sell you instead of the thing that you brought.  So that's consumer fraud. That's bait and switch. That's a big problem.  And by the way, when they say it can't be activated, that is a bald faced lie.  Verizon, because I did take the SIM out of my Chromebook Pixel.  I did put it into the Nexus seven LTE. And guess what?  Well, it does work. So it's not a question of it can't work. Can't work on the network.  It's a question of Verizon won't let it work on the network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is Verizon's control. It looks like Verizon posted a statement about this today.  Virgil just posted in the chat room. I put it under your rant on the rundown of Jeff statement on Verizon wireless device certification.  The Google Nexus seven is not yet a Verizon four G LTE certified device, though it entered our process in August.  We expect it to be certified shortly. Once the device is certified, we will work with Google to enable the device to be activated on a four G LTE network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You see, that's that's that's such a bald faced lie right there.  Because, again, it already works on the network because that's the standards Aaron just said.  You can put it in there. Right. The Verizon won't do is give me a SIM and put it on my account.  So there's no matter of certification here. That's that's horse poopy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're saying that they're they're testing protocol is the most rigorous of any carrier and it's focused on guarding the safety and security of their network done by third party labs.  It takes four to six weeks. Hmm. Interesting. Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pot thickens six weeks. So what did you guys say about it on Android last night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we were just we were relishing the thought of your of your rant today.  I was promoting it because I said you get to hear about Jeff's LTE experience and we we we pulled up your post on the on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought I was rather rather reasonable. I kept I kept a less than usual pink face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a good one. It was a good one. I love that you filed a formal complaint with the FCC.  And I bet that this statement by Verizon looks like it was published today and 18 doesn't have a time. So absolutely prompted by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you guys look at the the certification process that they take a look at it?  It's it's it's ridiculous. Well, here's the thing.  I mean, so they have if you go to that that link that you just put in there, Gina, and then click on and go down under the certification process.  Yeah, go to that open network of Verizon.  And then under the little wrench there, there's certification process.  That's what I'm looking at right now. Yes. View our certification process.  So they've got four steps, right? Review pre certification, which is conditional.  What does that mean? Then they've got certification, which they test rigorously in our labs, but they say they can test the device live over our network and see if it works.  And then look at the last one. This is what I was getting at before. Go to market.  Why do they need go to market in a technical certification?  We build external and internal awareness of your device through joint public relations and the use of the Verizon certification logo, training our sales teams and listing your device in the device showcase.  So what they're saying is all that stuff has to be done before it's technically certified.  We have to train our sales teams and do all this stuff. I mean, that's a bunch.  I understand one, two and three. I understand review pre certification and certification.  I don't understand why they need go to market to say that this is technically certified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it's a CDMA device, which is what Verizon normally is, of course, then it has, as someone explained to me in Twitter, I'm sorry I can't give you credit because I can't remember your silly Twitter handle, that has root access to the device.  It is a security matter. But as you said a few minutes ago, Aaron, this is a protocol. This is an open standard protocol.  So I could go make a phone at my workbench. And as long as I do it to the standards and I put a SIM in, it's going to work. Verizon can't stop that.  And and and that's the irony of all this. Verizon doesn't understand that they've entered an open world.  This is the first time they've really worked. This is the first time they faced, I think, an open GSM device on their network.  And this was the condition. I can't repeat this often enough.  This was the condition of them winning the auction to get the LTE 700 megahertz C block spectrum that they got.  Remember that Google entered into that auction not to win, but to put the pressure on to have the assurance that open devices would work.  Why? Because clearly Google saw this very day coming. And here's the day here.  Now, mind you, there's another issue here. Google has been silent about this.  I'm a little upset about that. I've emailed Google PR.  But of course, the problem is that Google, love them dearly, have a show about them, wrote a book about them.  The one time they get in trouble is when they do deals with telcos.  And they've done devil's deals with Verizon.  And I'm sure they don't want to piss off Verizon too much.  But what's happening here is Verizon and Google are tweaking each other and we are stuck in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep. It puts the users in a pinch. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So can you you could pop in the T-Mobile sim and get your first free month.  And in theory, if what Verizon is saying is true, which I know you don't think it is true.  But while you wait for response to your official complaint and while Verizon reportedly goes through its certification process, maybe by the time your month, your free month is up, it'll it'll work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And I'm you know, I've thought of doing that.  But right now I'm trying to stay true to the principle of this.  I'm just going to keep forcing Verizon to to to do what they're supposed to do under the law.  And other people said, well, if you just take a sim out of something else, put it in there, it works.  Well, it's fine. But then my my.  Then you don't have a sim in your Curpixel. Yeah. Yeah.  Now, they also the nice guy in the store said, well, the only workaround I can really do is I could try to get a sim going on a phone and put it in there.  But then the problem is that in the billing system, I'd be paying forty dollars a month instead of ten dollars a month for adding it.  Right. So this is all about business conditions and Verizon control.  It has nothing, nothing, nothing to do with technology certification.  Any of that AT&T and T-Mobile are not idiots.  They have much experience with GSM, much more than Verizon.  They are happily running this. Now, Google, by the way, when it came out with this device a week ago, they sold it with a T-Mobile sim.  That lasted about a week. And then they went they took it down for a day or for for part of a day and everybody got suspicious.  Then it went back up. And a bit later, they offer it now without a sim, the T-Mobile sim or with an AT&T sim.  But notice not a Verizon sim. So here I am.  I'm trying to give Verizon business that Google is promoting to go to others.  I'm trying to give them money. And the only thing that's happening here is in some freakish, horrible anal control game that this corporation has to not let customers ever win anything.  Verizon, the truly evil company, the company that hands over all your metadata, the company that, by the way, we found out this week from the Guardian,  phone companies never even tried to protest handing all of our data over to the NSA.  A Verizon executive this week also called Google and Microsoft and Yahoo and company grandstanders for fighting the NSA for our rights.  This is a company that does not give a damn about us as customers.  This is a company that still thinks it's mobile and has a monopoly and can tell us to go below.  Well, guess what, people? We've got Twitter. We've got Facebook. We've got fax machines.  Yeah, I had to fax it to the FCC. And we are not going to rest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good for you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Best of right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. All right. Anything else to say about that, Grant? Anything that's brilliant in the chat room going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think the only thing in the chat room that I noticed as you were talking is there is a, you know, the only legal out they have from what you were saying is that there is a clause in there that says if a device could harm the network, then they can, then they can.  So then that's their claim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then there's a burden of proof on that. Yes.  There's a burden of proof to show it harms the network. And it's not harm in AT&T. It's not harm in T-Mobile. It's not harm in GSM networks around the world where, of course, it was available before it was available here, which was the subject of another rant.  Why France had it. We didn't. Maybe I now understand why. Maybe this has been a behind the scenes thing. I don't know. I am eager for Google to say something about this in public.  I have I've gone to their public policy people and to their PR people and we'll see what comes out and I'll report all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good for you. Yeah, good for you. Yeah, forget that T-Mobile sim. Stick to the principle. Let's put the screws to them.  Yeah, yeah.  Has anyone else have you found anyone else on Twitter or just sort of about out and about complaining about the same thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've found people. I found a lot of people who did a few things. Some who just took a sim from another device and before I did it showed to me that no, Jeff, this works.  And they demonstrated it to me very quickly. So that nice. In fact, while I was in the Verizon store, I went to Twitter immediately while I was there and I said, I'm having this problem.  Everybody know anything. And immediately somebody came back and said, well, I just took this. I just got the device. I took the sim out of another device. Put it in there. It works, Jeff.  So I got to be able to say to Verizon, no, this works on your network. Here's the proof.  That's that's amazing. That was that's the beauty. The beauty of all this, which also, by the way, always comes back to the power of Leo, to the power of Twitter, because I don't have those kind of followers there except for except for this wonderful show and network.  So so that worked out. A lot of people on Google Plus have been saying I was thinking about getting put on Verizon. I'm not doing that.  And a lot of surprising number of people, Gina. This is this a trend that I haven't seen.  Leo's been talking about how T-Mobile is pretty good. T-Mobile is good around here. You know, you use T-Mobile. It's fine.  And what was happening on on Google Plus is the number of people who said to heck with Verizon, not just because you have the sim, T-Mobile is actually good.  They have unlimited data plans. They care about people. I have a good customer service.  It was it was like 90 percent in favor of T-Mobile in this whole discussion, 10 percent of T-Mobile complaints, whereas the opposite, whereas 95 percent complaining about Verizon and a few hangouts trying to defend Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So were people saying I'm just going to switch because I can't I don't want to deal with these people at all because which is mobile in general? Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's where I mean, you got to follow the money, right? I mean, that's what's going to eventually get Verizon to take notice of this is if people start leaving.  I think that thank goodness for Jeff and his reach, right?  His his virtual reach out through the ether, so to speak, to people, because if it were just like a normal person that had this problem, I mean, no one's no one's going to notice.  Right. So thank goodness Jeff's making it because let's face it. I mean, how many customers are actually trying to do this? Probably not that many at this point.  Right. So it's not like someone pulled one of Verizon's key devices and says, hey, this doesn't work.  And it affects, you know, 80 million people. Right. So this probably affects a small subset.  And it's those that the small minority that doesn't have any voice really. So thank goodness for Jeff. Thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're raising this up. It's a very small concern. It's a very small audience for this.  But yeah, there is some level of responsibility. If you have this platform like twig and the blogs and such that rather than just surrendering because people said, I just give up.  And I said, no, I can't. I won't do that. So on we go. All right. I need a break. I need something happy.  I need positive change in the world. You know what I need? I need a change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've got a few new things in the Google first this week. First, we'll kick it off with Google Plus gets new photo editing tools with Snapseed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So while you're viewing your own photos on Google Plus, click on the edit button. You get new features like auto enhance, which we've seen already.  The auto awesome selective adjust makes you let edit your photos.  And filters like vintage and drama. You got to have your filters. These are all powered by Snapseed, which was originally a really cool iPad app and later an Android app.  And now we're seeing it kind of on the desktop for the first time. And yeah, Chad is showing us some of some of the new the new features there in the video.  There's selective adjust. Very nice. And then we have the auto awesome.  Very cool. You only drawback using all these features in Google Plus requires Chrome, but everyone listening to this show probably already uses Chrome.  That won't that won't be a big deal. Let's see. It's really neat. I've used it.  One of the things that struck me as odd is that there's missing basic things like I want to put a line on the photo or put a line on the photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really neat. I've used it. One of the things that struck me as odd is that there's missing basic things like I want to put a line on the photo or put some text on a photo or any of that.  I couldn't find any of that. It was a bit odd that there were some things missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right, right, right. So you can't actually like annotate annotate something or draw on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not that I could find unless the chat room will correct me within 30 seconds. If they don't, then I take it as victory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I honestly I haven't tried that. I mean, most of the stuff on Google. I don't I normally do that with screenshots and I use like skits or something else like that for that.  But I haven't tried to do a whole lot of annotation or text on top of images. And that seems like a very basic feature. It surprises me that's not available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's there. It's in Google Plus. I just I think it's a where if you go to Google Plus and click on one of your photos, because they rolled this out a while back because people wanted to  to do cat memes. Yeah, exactly. Like memes and things like that. Exactly. So I know I know that I've done it before on Google Plus. Let me just I think it's gone now.  Oh, that's what I'm trying to say. That's odd. I'm going to try it right now. Go ahead, Gina. I'm going to I'm going to try this. I'll report back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, cool. Cool. Google Voice made a little change to secure your voicemail access so you can call your Google Voice in order to retrieve your Google Voice voicemail.  But now you need to either do that from a phone number which you have registered with Google Voice or you need to provide that phone number or a pin number when you call from another phone.  You can create a pin lock that's up to 10 digits long, or you'll have to type in one of your registered your registered phone numbers and when you when you check your voicemail.  Google Wallet had got a really nice upgrade that makes it much more widely available across Android devices and versions, and you don't need NFC to use it anymore.  So while it will be available for all devices running Android 2, 3 and up, regardless whether or not they got NFC.  That's because Google has kind of broadened what what while it can do. It's, it's adding indirect money transfer.  So with the new update, you can transfer cash to anyone with the with an email address in the US. Once you've linked a bank account to the service.  This makes a lot of sense. Of course, Google wants to get more more more accounts more active Google Wallet accounts going on.  So I've had pretty limited interactions with while I mean I use it to because I sell an app to the Play Store and some of the back end is there.  But now that you don't require NFC and it goes back to older Android versions, I'm sure we'll see while it become a little more a little more widely available.  But it would be nice to have another alternative to PayPal, which you know, when you get revenue, Gina, like does it go does it like PayPal goes into the PayPal account in the case of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it go into a Google account or does it go straight into your bank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I set it up to go straight into my bank. It used to it used to be Google Checkout and then Google Checkout Wallet Merge.  So I have to go into a wallet to see sort of transactions and purchases and refunds and that kind of thing.  But I do have it set up and honestly I set it up so long ago. I don't even I don't remember the details, but it does it does do a direct deposit into my direct directly in my bank account.  So I did link I did link my bank account and I've linked my credit card to Google Wallet as well so that I can make purchases that make purchases in the Play Store.  Cool. Finally, Google Alerts, which is one of those lesser known Google products, but something I really like.  It's especially good for ego searches if you want to see when your name shows up on the web.  It lost the option to deliver your search results for things that you you've set to get alerted about as an RSS feed.  It lost that option when Google Reader got shut down, but that option is quietly gotten added back into into the product.  So so when you go to Google Alerts, you can set up an alert for a certain a certain term.  So if I wanted to see every time somebody mentioned the word twig, that's probably a bad example.  Maybe this week in Google or Twitter on any web page, I can get alerted via a feed an RSS feed that that features come back or you can do it via email as well.  But that feed that feed option is back. So that's good news for those of us who are still still using RSS readers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What feed are you guys using nowadays?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been using the old reader.  I don't use it very often, but I use the old reader.  And actually, for a while there, it went away and then it came back.  Yeah, it's it's it's still around.  I don't use it very much, though. I honestly get my news from social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, I've I used to use NetVibes and I used to plug in all my RSS feeds into NetVibes, but I haven't used it much lately.  I mean, ever since Google Plus came out, I've been more and more shifting towards getting my stuff on social  and other ways like Reddit. So I use Reddit a lot more than I do RSS feeds from various sites.  I just subscribe to a Reddit like, you know, our slash Android or our slash open source or Linux or whatever I'm interested in.  And I find that that's a easier way to get that kind of information because it's filter.  Right. It's not it's not just everything that a particular site wants to put up there.  I do go to tech meme a lot, but for that, I just go to the website.  So I guess I don't use RSS feeds as much as I used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you using right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Feed these looking very good on Android. Feed these beautiful.  It's really well designed, I think.  And it's actually so well designed to kind of come back to a little more RSS now.  But Aaron, did you have any success finding how I can do in photo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I stand corrected. They did remove that feature.  I guess I hadn't tried it since since the new photo editing stuff rolled out.  So it is gone. In fact, I found a bunch of posts on Google Groups and the help forums and things like that.  People kind of ranting about, you know, one person even said this is why I even use Google Plus in the first place is so they can add text to my photos, which I don't know.  I kind of find hard to believe. But so, yeah, people are upset about this.  And sure enough, it's gone. I couldn't find a way to get text back.  So you're right, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How are memes going to survive? What are we to do? Oh, no, I know.  We end up the change log on a sad note. After all, the confession confession bear will be awfully silent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There will be no confessions for confession.  I'll just be sitting next to a log.  I really want to confess something, but I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I sometimes I feel like Google makes changes to things and just sort of just like, oh, let's just take that out for now.  And then it kind of, you know, it'll pop back in.  It'll be a change log entry in a few weeks. It's like, oh, you know, text is back.  I just feel like things change so much that they move stuff around.  It happened with the Play Store, too.  They took out a bunch of features and then sort of slowly added them back in.  And I don't know if that's about them just figuring out, you know, how many what people are using or what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder if you can go into the PICASA web tools. Is that still around?  Can I go into PICASA web tools and use maybe use their tools to edit it and then it would show up on Google Plus?  I don't know. I'll have to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Gina, life is an A.B. test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Life is an A.B. test, isn't it? Ain't that the truth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there anything else that change log, madam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. On to Google News.  I told Gina before the show that this was going to be explained this to me, Lucy Week.  This was some things I don't understand.  For example, one thing I don't understand here is that Google swaps out my SQL and moves to Maria DB.  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so from what I understand and Aaron, you're going to get to have to help me out with this because you I know you're you're in into the open source world as well.  Maria DB, from what I understand, is a fork of my SQL, which is an open source database engine, and that's managed by another another group.  And actually, I've heard a lot about Maria DB.  I've heard that it's it's it's very good.  And so this means so Google is migrating its my SQL systems over to Maria DB, the register reported.  And this basically allows them to get away from Oracle backed open source databases.  So so so my SQL is maintained by Oracle.  Yeah, exactly.  So Maria DB, what I understand is a fork of my SQL.  So it is based on my SQL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So what happened here is Sun bought my SQL back when I was before the Oracle acquisition.  So when I was working for Sun, they bought my SQL, which was great.  Everybody's like, yeah, you know, this is this is OK.  Some of the users were a little upset, but it wasn't it wasn't Oracle yet.  Right. So it's like, OK, let's hope let's hope and trust that Sun's going to do the right thing with my SQL.  And then Oracle stepped in and people just went, OK, that's it.  Right. So, yeah, Maria DB is a fork of my SQL.  It's compatible with my SQL.  And I think that what's happened here is Maria DB is fine.  And lots of people have been switching.  You know, Google's kind of I think Google probably hasn't switched till now because they've been waiting for it to mature, waiting to make sure it's ready for primetime.  Right. Because you can't just throw things at new new software and hope it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think that kind of data that Google deals with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. So I think that this is a huge boost for Maria DB.  I'm sure they're going to be talking about this all over the place because what it does is it sells people.  Hey, look, if Google trusts Maria DB enough to use it, then you can feel free to go ahead and switch from my SQL to Maria DB, too.  So, you know, this is a this is a and this isn't the only place where this is being done.  The same thing happened with OpenOffice.  Right. Oracle said, hey, we got this from Sun and we don't really want to support it.  We're not sure what's going to happen.  And the user community was really freaked out.  And so LibreOffice came about and now LibreOffice is really the de facto open platform for for documents and presentations and things like that.  So so this isn't without precedent.  And yeah, Maria DB keeps getting more and more support.  So I think users are going to continue to switch from my SQL to Maria DB.  And I can talk about that now because I don't work for Oracle anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a huge it's a huge win for Maria DB.  That's a really good point.  And Maria DB is is backed by Monty Monty.  We didn't necessarily Monty.  I'm sure that I messed up your last name, but he he spearheaded the original development of my SQL.  So you have sort of one of the original my SQL developers there.  And Google has about five people working part time on Maria DB bug fixes right now, which is that's five people part time.  Five Googlers.  Or to get away from Oracle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or is this that are there are there are some functional reasons why this is better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think it's I think it's mostly to get away from Oracle.  I mean, there could be some functionality that they're looking forward to in Maria DB to implement.  But I don't think Google wants to be tied to a licensing structure from another company.  And plus, it's just good community involvement.  I mean, five developers part time contributing patches to an open source platform like this.  I think it's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems like the reasons are probably more political than technical.  And I think that the version of my SQL that they were running was probably heavily modified for Google's purposes.  I mean, Google's dealing with problems that, you know, ninety nine point nine percent of my SQL users probably aren't, you know, butting up against.  But so I'm sure that they're sort of contributing contributing some of those patches as well to Maria DB.  But that's great for everyone.  That's great for the community.  But it does sound like they just wanted to get away from Oracle, which is a pretty crocker moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell me there's a real Maria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually don't know where the name.  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't answer something.  I'm sure.  I'm sure the chat room will tell us in a minute.  I can't remember either what it stands for or why it was called Maria.  I know that they had we had some folks from Maria DB on Floss Weekly.  And I I had thought that right around this time frame that Leo had might have done a triangulation.  I don't know. I'm kind of looking around.  I don't know if anyone's here that knows there may have been a triangulation with Monty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or someone in the chat room is yelling at us because it's not my SQL.  It's my SQL.  I know.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Old habits die hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maria DB is named after Monty's younger daughter, Maria.  There we go.  Oh, that's cool.  And I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  It's so much better nerds to name your stuff after some, you know, after a real human thing and not a crazy acronym.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now clearly there must be an operating system of the future named ETA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Clearly.  Or at least a web app.  I don't know if I'm going to waste my time on operating system, but sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And every birthday, every birthday could go up like a revision.  Right. So one point two point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  In fact, that is reached one point out today.  She's one years old today.  No way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why didn't you tell us that at the beginning of the show?  What a happy note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So this this time last year it was a Tuesday.  So it was the night before twig.  And I hadn't told you guys that that there was that that my wife is pregnant.  So I was at I was at the hospital.  The doctor saying this is going to happen tonight, which it wasn't supposed to.  We were supposed to have another five weeks.  And I was in a joyful panic.  And then I think I emailed you guys like, I can't make the show tomorrow because I got some stuff going on.  I'll let you I'll tell you more later.  Yeah, I was on that episode as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We were all like, oh, congratulations.  Yeah, cool.  Well, congratulations again.  At a one point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, thank you.  Birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will tell me tell me her birthday cake didn't say at a one point.  Oh, did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course it's going to say that.  Of course it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course, you know what happens then is the kid gets older and they realize what the version numbers mean.  They're going to be looking for like minor revisions like, come on, it's it's one point five.  You know, it's four point five.  So it was like some speaking full sentences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll be one point two.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm going on.  It's those most.  I'm five and a half.  I'm five and three quarters.  Right.  Exactly.  Last for quite a while.  I was I was at an event some years ago.  You can tell me years ago in a second.  And there was a Murdoch corporate event.  I was brought in to to moderate Nick Denton and Mark Zuckerberg.  And one of the executives of News Corp came up afterwards and she was laughing.  She said, I just asked Mark Zuckerberg how old he is.  And he said, I'm going to be twenty three.  I'm twenty two and seven eight.  Zach, you have to have a special birthday for at his pie birthday, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, definitely.  Oh, yes.  Pie Day and her pie birthday are going to be.  Yes, I think right with I.  So indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, since you mentioned mentioned contributing to open source, this is a minor note.  But but both Google and Samsung have soared into the top ten Linux contributors.  I don't think it's a much great surprise in there, but it's but it's the back for them.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that is nice.  That made me feel good.  I mean, yeah, it's good.  It's good to see these companies with a lot of money and a lot of resources contributing  back to something that everyone can use.  I mean, I like that the number in this chart that Ars Technica publish here is a chart of  the the company in the rank of how many how many changes they've contributed and what  the percentage is.  I love that the first company is none like right.  That like people with no affiliation are making the most changes to Linux.  That's awesome.  That's the community.  That's the community.  Right. That's open.  That's OSS at work.  And Red Hat, of course, is the top one.  But it was yeah, it was good to see Samsung and IBM up here, although IBM's above them.  Which is interesting.  I think that Microsoft's contributions have definitely fallen off.  But yeah, a lot of these, you know, the suspects you would, you know, you would you would expect  Qualcomm and AMD and the Linux Foundation, of course, Nvidia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of these companies are the ones that make the drivers for for either their  products or somebody else's, you know, using their chips and other products and things  like that.  And I think that's why a lot of these companies have committed to developing driver open  firmware or, you know, something that goes in the Linux kernel, because, you know, they  want to they want people to use their products, including people that run Linux.  And a lot of these are also in the embedded space, you know, which which a lot of the  embedded products run Linux.  So this makes this list really make sense.  And I think that's why Samsung and Google are a little bit different, because these  are device makers.  They don't necessarily they use the chips that all these other companies make.  They don't necessarily make them themselves.  Although Samsung, you could argue that they do.  But, you know, even inside a Samsung device, you're probably looking at a Broadcom chipset  or something like that.  And that's where typically those those drivers get written.  In fact, Broadcom is on the list as well.  Also, I mean, just to play for both sides of the fence, Oracle is on this list as well  down below Samsung and Google and just above Broadcom.  So I don't want to completely bash Oracle if they're committing to open source.  Bravo.  Thank you very much.  But, yeah, so this is really interesting to see the device users, the software, pure  software writers, not necessarily for devices make it up this far in the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So speaking of things, Google is changing.  How's that for us?  For a slick segue, this is a big deal in my world.  Google ad ID could replace the cookie.  And I'm not sure I understand how this works.  I haven't seen enough detail at all on this.  But the idea is that it becomes a new identifier that becomes anonymous both ways.  So it's anonymous.  The user is better anonymized and given the assurance of anonymity in tracking for advertising.  And then there's some reference in the story that the advertiser is also more anonymous,  which wouldn't be so great because you want to know who the parties are who are doing this.  I have no idea how this is going to work.  I don't know what the promise really is.  But I think, as I've often said on the show, media technology and advertising companies  all blew it by letting the cookie be demonized by the Wall Street Journal.  It's out to get you.  And so an improvement on tracking that gives greater assurance of consumer control would be a great thing.  Do either of you guys have any idea how this could work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unfortunately, the source of this and gadget article is USA Today, which I don't have very high  expectations of tech.  Like, you know, my first question is, what is the technical implementation of this?  Is the implementation going to be similar to cookies?  If not, is it going to be a browser standard?  You know, it has to.  It should be.  It has to be right.  But, yeah, USA Today doesn't have a lot more information about how this is going to work.  But, you know, this might be more of a branding problem.  Like the cookie has a huge branding problem, as you pointed out, Jeff.  I don't know if I wonder if Google can make the ad ID the anti cookie.  Like, you know, this is an anonymous, safe, secure way for you to get better ads anonymously.  I don't know how many consumers are really concerned about getting better ads.  But, you know, I mean, besides people who kind of think about it like we do.  But if the ad ID could be, you know, kind of positioned as the anti cookies,  the anonymous secure way to do to, you know, do to track you or to watch you.  I mean, there's an opportunity there.  And I wonder how different the technical implementation will be.  And I do hope it's an open standard and not just an Android Chrome thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's a CNET article about this, too.  And they bill it as a proprietary identifier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A proprietary identifier.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I guess they could make it a standard, but they would control the way it works.  I mean, again, this is this is according to CNET, right.  And maybe they got it.  Maybe they maybe they don't.  I don't know. Maybe they got the proprietary part wrong.  But it seems like it would be in Google's interest to make it as open as possible to encourage adoption and not not make something some part of it proprietary to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're both right. USA Today is not exactly our source for technology news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But, you know, and Gadget did a post based on the US today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, that's what we do in technology now.  Somebody reports that everybody writes about it as if it's the same.  It's all back to the same source.  So my fault for not noticing that.  By the way, USA Today, just to throw this into the side parent, USA Today is increasing its price to two dollars.  And my smart ass tweet was that it wasn't worth the effort to bend over at the motel room door and pick it up.  I'm not sure it's worth two dollars.  But anyway, just a joke.  It's just a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So friend of mine is the publisher of it.  So I'm just joking, Larry.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Just joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so thin I can I can I can shave myself with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, man.  All right. I'll move on now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're getting in trouble.  So here's another explain it to me Lucy story.  Cyanogen Mod, whom Gina often mentions and Leo talks about it.  And I just let him talk about it.  I've never done it. I don't know how to do it.  It's a root. What's root?  You pull it out of the ground. It's a potato.  I don't know what it is.  It now is a company with considerable venture capital backing.  So what does this mean, guys?  What is this? What does this enable now?  The cyanogen mod has money.  And one of the things I saw in the story is they are going to make it easy enough for idiots like me.  So what does this bring to the to the Android world and to say engine mod itself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is really interesting, like a team of Android rock star developers, including Steve Condick and Coach Duda are now they got seven million dollars in VC backing, which is a nice amount of money.  They've got a small team.  I think they're based in Seattle and they're going to be making cyanogen mod, which was a weekend project by hackers and enthusiasts for power users who are willing to root mod their phones.  They're making this into a consumer product.  This is really, really interesting.  I'm interested to hear what you think.  I mean, for me, it's hard to say.  I haven't I haven't I haven't used cyanogen mod in a while.  I've been kind of committed to running the vanilla Google version of Android because I'm interested in Google's direction for Android because Google has been such a clear leader on the development of Android.  But what's interesting to me is that we see now flavors of Android getting developed based off the open source project, which are kind of separate separate from Google.  So we're seeing, you know, we saw that sort of sort of with Amazon and the Kindle, right?  That was very Kindle specific.  But now it's a hand to mod, you know, creating this other mobile operating system that's based on Android.  You have Hugo Barra at Xiaomi that the Chinese manufacturer, which also has has its own flavor of Android.  Now we're starting to see operating systems based on open source Android and customized in different ways.  This isn't just like Google Android, you know, the Google version of Android with like an extra skin on top.  This is like a different build of Android.  And is that a problem of fragmentation, as they always say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does this mean that the world could get too confusing?  You know, that's that's a crisis and things.  Yeah, I mean, that's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it could it could it could mean that it could mean just just more choice in the way that Android and Android works.  It means that I think it means that that Google's competitive advantage actually is in Google Play Services and not in the you know, the bottom layer OS code.  Right. Google Play Services and the Google suite of services that live on top of Android is really where Google's competitive edge is.  So you open up a situation where other companies are going to start their own app stores like Xiaomi has and like Amazon has and you know, maybe Cyanogen mod.  Actually, there is there is a sandwich and have its own.  Sanjit does have its own app store, doesn't it?  Or its own way to get apps.  So I mean, so again, you know, you have the black and white, right?  Right. Right. There's more choice.  And yet there's sort of the the the downsides of fragmentation.  Oh, Aaron, what do you think about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so personally, I think it's about time.  Right. Like I've always wondered why these guys aren't working for Google.  I think they've they've kind of talked about that in the past.  And they're actually doing or they did an AMA on on Reddit this morning.  The chat room got that link up there.  Maybe we can get it up for after the show.  But, you know, it's I think they've just reached critical mass.  Right. It's like, look what we can do. Right.  So when Koosh did that, I always say his name wrong.  Am I saying it wrong? It's Koosh.  Koosh. Thank you. I always do that.  It's just the way it looks.  So when Koosh wrote that app for Chromecast, Chromecast, that was like in less than a day or something.  I mean, he had something up and working.  And it's like that. I mean, that's gold. Right.  If you've got that kind of talent and you can do those kinds of things,  then you need to be looking at ways to bring in more funding and market it.  I mean, I really like the community aspect of CNN.  And there's lots of other if you go to XDA developers,  there's lots of other people in communities working on this kind of stuff.  They're not the only name in the game,  but they are probably the biggest name in the game and they've got a lot to offer.  And I think people would be willing to pay for some of the services that they could offer.  You know, you could you could put their specific OS.  They can make it really easy to put their specific OS on your device and offer support for that.  So, hey, I can't make something work.  I'm willing to pay five dollars a month to be able to call somebody and get it to work or, you know,  particular apps that help you do something unique on your device that Google's not really doing.  And all the other manufacturers with their specific OS aren't doing.  They did say as far as monetization, I'll just read this.  It's the number one question right now on the AMA on Reddit.  They asked about monetization and they said, monetization is not an immediate concern.  And our investors agree.  Santa Jumada has the potential to become an enormous platform play.  And to do that, we need to foster and grow the ecosystem.  Right now, we just want to build something compelling and grow the user base.  Eventually, there are a number of paths to monetization.  Once we once we reach economic, sorry, economics of scale, licensing our software services to OEMs,  building hardware, creating secure enterprise solutions, et cetera,  creating disruption in a multibillion dollar market is enough to make any investor raise their eyebrow.  So and I agree with them.  I think that's where they're at.  It's just like, hey, we've got this really cool thing.  Let's pick it up and run with it.  And the fact that they were able to get seven million dollars,  what seems like fairly quickly, I think, is evidence that investors would agree with them.  Wow. Good explanation, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? I just decided when I finally do get my Nexus 7 on to Verizon,  I'm going to root it and put on the worst bad new OS I can.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My first bit of advice for Cyanogen, change the name.  Yeah, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pick a better name.  Sounds like a poisonous fertilizer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and and just position it has to be positioned as it's still I still can't explain what Cyanogen is in simple terms.  I mean, is this going to be like Android for advanced users?  It sounds it sounds like it right.  It sounds like this is going to be kind of the build for advanced users,  but it needs a better name and it needs it needs a better explanation than modified firmware.  I just not a lot of people know what that is.  I think that they could do really well targeting the power user market.  But if they want to extend their reach even more than they already have,  and I think what eight million eight million people are running Cyanogen, which is great.  I mean, I mean, that's incredible for something that these guys have done from what I understand, kind of in their spare time.  And they are that there are lots of people doing this, but they are they have so many years of experience  and they spent so much time doing this.  They're they're the premier kind of developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Use me again as a proxy for the idiots of the world and and give me the three or four tweets to explain why someone would want to use a Cyanogen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so the first thing is so the reason you want to use Cyanogen is to do things that well, OK, number one,  you don't want to be locked into what a particular vendor says you can do.  So you say, well, I don't like sense. I don't like whatever Samsung's is. I don't like this. I don't like that.  I want something that looks like Google that works and that I can that I can do things with.  And I'm not locked into what the vendor says or the manufacturer says I can or can't do.  So that's reason number one. And that's usually where people end up is like, I really want to do this on my phone.  And it says there's a way, but I can't run it because I don't have root.  And so then they unlock their phone and they and they root their phone and they can do what they want to do.  That's where that's where most people come to it.  I think secondly, it used to be not so much with if you're running a stock Google device,  but if you're running one of the other carriers operating systems that they put on their phones, you want new features right away.  So if Google comes out with a new feature or somebody comes out with a new feature,  you don't want to wait for Samsung or HTC or LG or whoever it is to implement it.  You want to run it right away.  And theoretically, you can do that quicker on Cyanogen Mod or with a stock Google phone now than you could otherwise.  Now that picture is somewhat turning around because now some like Samsung especially is developing their own software.  That's really cool that people might you might not be able to get that on Cyanogen Mod.  So we'll see where that goes. What else, Gina? What other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think I think that you hit it.  Well, getting getting new releases, a new Android releases sooner, but also just I mean, from what I understand,  Cyanogen Mod just has gets more new features more quickly.  Right. Like like power kind of power user features.  Like I would just want a quick short cut to do this, that the other thing.  So not only just getting a whole new build, but like in general,  it sounds like the Cyanogen team listens to power users particularly more closely and is quicker to implement stuff that would suit a more advanced user than than Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, even simple things like being able to reboot your phone, like a lot of phones, even my phone.  I'm running a variant of stock Google on here.  When I hold down the power button, I get airport or whatever it is, airplane mode and shut down.  There's no reboot option. And sometimes what I want to do is I just want to reboot.  And so things like that Cyanogen Mod puts in by default, just nice power user.  I wouldn't even say it's a power user. It's really just a it should be in every phone.  Right. Just hit the reboot button.  Is there a disadvantage?  Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, there's things like that.  And I think that just with their expertise, this is going to be really interesting to see where they go.  But again, they're going to run into some troubles, I think, with the carriers because the carriers are, I would assume, as they do now, they say, look, this isn't this isn't supported.  Some devices, very few devices support unlocking.  I'm sure they'll say, you know, look, if you run this, it voids your warranty.  So there's going to be some roadblocks ahead for Cyanogen Mod.  We'll see where it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, someone in the chat room says old hardware was the reason to run the mod.  I mean, it sounds like this is a way to sort of get around limitations.  This is why this is sort of a thing that you did kind of an extra.  It's just interesting to watch.  It'll be interesting to watch them turn this into a legitimate consumer product and how they're going to negotiate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And all those things strike me as small.  Whereas, whereas if it really becomes the parallel to Android development that will build things that Google doesn't feel like building company.  And so if you come along, you know, the next time Amazon can just hire them to write the OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe maybe because they do mention OEMs in here in their response on monetization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that may be that might be an angle that wants to have corporate devices that work a certain way.  You know, they can they can customize across a whole bunch of devices.  Right. Right. Yep. Yep.  Hmm. Hmm. All right.  A few other quick things on Google before we move on.  This story struck me as it smelled of the sweet smell of BS.  Google or panic, I should say.  Google knows many of the world's Wi-Fi passwords thanks to backup defaults on Android devices.  Well, yeah.  So obviously, when I when I store passwords for Wi-Fi on my device, whether that's a laptop or whether that's a device, a phone, then there they are.  And I guess there's some controversy that Google backs those things up to the cloud.  Well, that's a good thing for me because when I change devices, it's still there.  No big is this just a kind of am I missing something here?  It just strikes me as your random.  Hey, let's panic the world for this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I had the same reaction when I read this story.  It's like, really? Like you didn't realize this already.  And and maybe that's who this is targeted to is the people that wouldn't wouldn't normally realize this.  But it's not like they're not protecting the data.  It's not like they're collecting.  Google's collecting the Wi-Fi passwords and putting them up on some website somewhere for everyone to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Google also knows how many times I use the F word in email.  I mean, I know they have that, too. Yeah, exactly.  I'm with you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't really understand why this was such a big deal and why why why the article made such a big deal out of it without explaining that, you know, all this information is still still protected.  And, you know, it's really for the convenience of our users and people can turn off the backup function really easily with one click and settings.  I mean, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I kind of didn't get either.  It smelled like the oh, my God, Chrome saves my passwords.  And if I click on the show me what the password is, it'll show it to me story, which also seemed like seemed really, really strange.  I assume that these backups are encrypted in some way so that they don't travel over the wire unencrypted.  Google can decrypted on their end, I assume.  I don't know. It's just didn't seem like that big a deal to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But good. I'm glad we erased that one.  Not for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what?  One more thing in here that I don't appreciate is they seem to be playing on people's fears.  And specifically, there's a there's like a bunch of stuff at the end of the article.  There's like 10 facts or 12 facts or something.  And they say here, does NSA know your Wi Fi password?  Android backups may give it to them.  And it's like, come on, really?  I mean, to me, this this really strikes of of someone just trying to dredge something up and make it a bigger deal than it is because we've got to call them on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this kind of techno panic stuff, we have to call them on it.  Yeah, it's going to end up on the here's your tech minute on the morning network news.  Exactly. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't want fear mongering going on here.  No, but it does happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Google has the keys to everything everywhere.  And fine. Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I welcome my new master.  If only the master would tell me more more often.  So I went through this is my I'm getting my my day over.  I went through weeks of complaining to you and boring you waiting for my Nexus seven LTE.  Of course, you've now heard the latest chapter at the beginning of the show today.  What's the next thing I'm waiting for?  The Nexus five and the Nexus four.  As everyone knows, the price has reduced drastically.  100 bucks.  And now they have sold out and they're not going to be back.  So now we have the Nexus five rumors going hot and heavy.  Any new insight from Android land, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tons of rumors.  We got like 3D rendering that fans have put together based on that, you know, that that snapshot from that video that Google put up and the FCC documents.  Everyone's decided that this LG Nexus five is going to happen.  There's a rumor date October 14th, which is less than a month away from now.  Yeah, I got to tell you, it sounds like Nexus five.  I believe it. We're talking about last night on all the Android.  There's so many rumors and so much speculation and so many sort of morsels being released and it's going to run Kit Kat.  You know, that's going to have a few different upgrades is going to look like that.  That that shot in the video, it seems like given that this week is the iPhone release week that these are very well timed rumors and speculation.  It would be a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just hold off folks on that plastic phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Look what's coming.  Look what's coming.  It makes a ton of sense.  The Moto X was not the latest Nexus, right?  They're going to the fact that they reduced the prices Nexus for the Nexus four is now sold out and they're not they're not going to restock.  According to sources close to Google, I've heard.  Of course, they're going to they're going to launch a new Nexus.  And it wouldn't surprise me if it was exactly on the date that that is rumored, which is October, October 14th.  And there you can see Chad is up on the screen.  This is a 3D rendering.  This is this is based only on rumors and speculation.  This was made by a fan.  It was posted on Reddit.  But yeah, I mean, there it is, folks.  I mean, it looks just like the one in the picture that we saw in the Kit Kat video, which I think was one of the sources and pretty believable, huh?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't wait.  And I'm not going to use it on Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just going to ask that.  I'm going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not going to happen.  All right.  Here's a weird story before we leave Google land.  Google surprises, you know, the moonshot world that it is.  Two things happen today.  One is that Google announced an investment in Calico, a health and well-being company.  At the same time, there's a Time magazine cover just out in which they ask the question, can Google solve death?  I think the only next next time made the perfect time magazine cover is is Google God?  But, Chad, if you if you if you point that up, you'll see the the the cover on that one, right?  Can Google solve death?  And so there's a lot about about Sergey and the health concerns and of the company.  And it's not it would be, you know, remember they got rid of Google Health, what, about a year ago when Larry took over or about that, I think.  And it was never a well-formed concept.  It was going to be able to share data.  And that's pretty much it.  Store your data and then share it with your doctors.  But, you know, where could Google go with health?  That becomes a really interesting piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it makes sense to me.  I mean, if you think about I'm a big proponent of clinical studies when people say, oh, such and such is related to something else, you know, because we looked at this.  And, you know, if you buy a pig, you are more likely to smoke cigarettes.  It's like, what?  So I'm a big proponent of clinical studies.  But before you get there, right, and you can actually run tests on people, you have to form a hypothesis.  And I think Google is uniquely positioned to provide and to mine some of this data that they're collecting from all of us to give to health care professionals or to the health care industry to say, hey, look, we're noticing these trends between, you know, people that wear Google Glass and, you know, people that have improved vision or something.  You know, I don't think that would happen.  It would probably be the opposite.  But, you know, something like that.  I think they're just uniquely positioned in the industry to be able to serve up some of this data.  I don't think they're going to solve death.  That's a that's a good headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a terrible headline.  I mean, it catches it catches your eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I mean, that's I don't know, I think that's a little far.  Time magazine becomes a parody of itself.  Yeah, exactly.  But, you know, but I mean, I think that I think the subtitle to that is good, which is the search giant is launching a venture to extend the human lifespan.  How do you do that?  You make people healthier.  That's really what it's all about.  So it's about using data to identify trends, to do research, to allow people to understand what's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I've talked about this before, where if we knew all the instances of breast cancer and could thus perhaps find correlations in an open way and explore that with privacy protected, but with generosity feeding it, then, you know, who knows what information we could get?  And interestingly, I think it was University of Pennsylvania faculty are in a revolt.  I saw a story last week because the university is went into a new system for health care, trying to reduce their costs.  One of the things they're doing is they're they're putting out what really do seem like pretty invasive questionnaires to people like, you know, are you having fights with your spouse?  And are you in high debt and this kind of stuff?  Would you say, why should you know this?  But the company they hired without kind of looking at the questionnaire in detail is trying to find the correlations and express the correlations for things like high stress and thus health problems and thus the money that goes behind it.  And if we can get past some of this nervousness about about the privacy and actually get to the value of that data, which is something that Google engineers will understand, there really could be life saving value there.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really like the focus on long term thinking like I think the media kind of struggles with the tension between Google's kind of spring cleaning short term focus or rather Larry pages and then the Google X kind of long term moonshot kind of thinking.  There's a great quote in this in this article, which I might I might misquote.  But but basically, Larry said, you know, we talk about curing cancer as this like huge, you know, incredible goal.  But and cancer is this tragic thing.  And everyone had no someone who, you know, we've lost a cancer.  But if we cure cancer that basically extends the average lifespan.  I think it's by three years, which honestly seemed low to me.  But OK, let's say it's three years.  He's like, we can do so much better than that.  Like we we can we can make we can, you know, add add 10, 20 years to people's lives if we think if we think bigger.  And there's another part of the of the of the of the piece where he says, you know, driverless cars, if we had taken the time to put the money and the vision into driverless cars 10 years ago, they'd be ready right now.  But we didn't.  And so we're doing it now, but we're behind, you know, so it's this constant sort of focus on long term thinking and putting resources and money into things that matter.  I guess on short term on short term monetary gain.  And I think that this is Google setting a really good example for for the rest of our our industry.  Of course, Google has more money in their bank than pretty much any other company in our industry.  So that's so there are very, you know, aren't very many companies that can make this kind of long term commitment.  But but I think I think it's a I think it's a great example.  And if we see we start to reap the rewards of this kind of long term thinking long term, you know, R&D, then I think that investors will be more likely to take a bet on it on smaller companies as well in the future.  So I think this is a good thing for our industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a really, really important and good point and kind of the essence of the show and the essence of what we talk about is why do we admire Google and what makes them different.  And I think Aaron's point, too, is the value of data.  Somebody in the chat room just pointed out that I didn't mention the thing at Penn was that people who didn't answer the question would pay, I think, one hundred dollars more a month in premiums as a result.  But there's there's an economic value to this data and to acting on it.  And we've got to grapple with that as a society.  We've got to grapple with ways to to not only increase lifespan, but then deal with the costs that are going to come along with that in health care, which are which are crippling.  So I talked to the report to Harry McCracken, who did the story for a half an hour.  And this is the great thing about a time, Inc.  Content machine. We went through all kinds of stuff all by the moonshots and this and that.  And all that ends up in the article is is what I came because of some rewrite guy who does this.  When it came to Larry killing off stuff, he was ruthless, end quote, said Jeff Jarvis this whole long thing.  He didn't even mean to say it. He could just call ruthless himself.  But that's not what I'm saying about Larry.  But fine. That's time. That's what it is.  There was a new editor of Time this week and she was asked whether time would ever not appear in print.  She said, no, it will always be in print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was a there was a I just want to point out there was a if you listen to the Ted, I think it's called the Ted Radio Hour or something like that.  NPR has been doing this series on Ted Talks and then they they bring in the person that did the Ted Talk into an interview.  So they did an interview with Sebastian Thrun on this topic.  He's the one that kind of done a lot of work with autonomous vehicles and of course works at Google and now is doing Udacity and all this stuff.  But there's a great article if you or interview if you want to listen to it, he talks about this exact point like, you know, 10 years from now, it could be that we you know, I forget how many like how many people die on highway accidents, but it's like 80 million or something crazy.  And he said that, you know, 10 years from now, we could maybe not wipe that out, but certainly reduce it down to a lot less than it is now.  If we have autonomous vehicles making these decisions for us and avoid a lot of the distractions that we have when we're on the road and also avoid problems that other people are making.  So it's not you could be a great driver. Somebody else causes a problem and you get killed.  Right. So anyway, if you want to hear that, I would highly recommend it.  It was very interesting and it was exactly on this topic about about Google solving death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's there's another great part in that timepiece where they were talking about Google Glass and you know, they were talking about how one of one of the complaints about Google Glass is that there's this fear that people around you are being recorded and it doesn't really look good on your face.  And I think it was page. It said something like, you know, we're not going to not develop a product because of social norms.  That's not a good enough reason. Right. Like if we have a good a good reason to make a product like we have to think beyond, you know, the initial sort of discomfort around social norms, the fact that social norms don't exist around this thing and see where it goes.  He's like, I'm not proposing that Google creates or dictates new social norms.  I'm just saying that that's not a good enough reason not to try something.  And I was like, yeah, that makes sense.  I don't know if you remember him saying that, you know, he wishes there was there was a safe space like a like a burning man type situation where you could try things that were would be completely socially unacceptable or maybe even illegal in sort of real society.  But that that there should be a testing ground for that kind of thing.  I would you know, it sounded really wacky at the time, but it was like, yeah, I mean, it makes sense.  Right.  I visit that place.  Would you I would certainly visit that place.  I would visit I would visit in my in my self-driving car in your self-driving car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you just program your car to take you there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take me laws or just take me to Google Island.  Take me to Larry's safe place and then I'll and then I'll lay back and take a nap till I get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was there was a story that I didn't put the rundown today of a of a Google Street View car different, of course, in some place like Indonesia.  I forget where that hit three cars in one day.  It was a sad case of the guy hit one car and they took the person to the to the garage and he was afraid it was going to cost too much.  So he left. He was too upset.  So then he hit another car and they got more upset than he had another car.  And I'm waiting for somebody to say, ah, this is what Google will do to us.  But it's just some poor schmuck.  All right. Onward to Twitter, Twitter.  We didn't discuss this last week.  I don't think Twitter.  Oh, I'm sorry. There was one more Google thing.  I forgot this. We didn't mention this last week.  Google Plus Hangouts.  Now that because Leo's away this week.  I'm using Google Plus.  Don't tell him. Don't tell him.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Don't say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but Hangouts have now added new features so you can do things like run auditoriums on them and have questions posed and all kinds of neat new stuff.  So I forgot to mention that before.  Anyway, Twitter, also in the meantime, since last week, filed for its confidential IPO under the New Jobs Act or under part of this.  You can file for an IPO secretly without revealing all the data yet.  If you have revenue under a billion dollars.  And so everybody is guessing that they've done that.  Also speculation about the value of the IPO to the various VCs like Union Square Ventures and Fred Wilson and also to have Williams, Biz Stone and Jack Dorsey.  I saw one estimate that have at the end of this and bloggers sale and everything else would be worth eight billion dollars.  Wow. Yeah.  Wow. Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For a guy, you know, if I hope so, because, you know, Ev ran blogger literally in his kitchen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody was gone.  He was down to his last dime trying to keep it going, believing there was something there.  And if he gets a payoff like that, he's going to get a payoff like that.  And I think he's changed the world twice.  And I'm all delighted for it.  I agree.  Would you buy Twitter stock?  I don't I don't buy I don't buy stock in the companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, if you're a rich uncle, Uncle Louie comes to you and says, Jane, you know all about this technology stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think that Twitter has a big growth potential in the future?  Or have we already seen it?  You know, is this is this a stock worth betting on in any case?  For the long, long term, yes, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But not I mean, not not in the next five years.  Aaron, you shouldn't take investing advice from me.  Nor from me.  Nor from me.  I mean, I think this is this is one of those risky purchases, right?  For a stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, if you're into the if you if you have some money and you want to invest in a stock, you know, you're going to have to invest in a stock.  I mean, if you're into the if you if you have some money and you want to take a risk, then then this might be something I would do.  But I think it is a risk if you look at what's happened to things like MySpace and other companies that group I think Groupon and some of the other ones.  I just don't I don't know.  I think I think it's a risky bet.  But I know there are people out there that like to take risks.  And I think that, you know, this is a this signifies a huge change for Twitter right now.  You're going to have to tell shareholders what they're doing and prove their value to shareholders and attract investors.  So, I mean, it's just it's just a big company shift, right?  First, you're you're doing all these things and that are really cool, technically cool.  And when you're making these decisions for a private company and now all of a sudden, oh, we've got other constituents we got to worry about.  We got to worry about shareholders.  We got to worry about, you know, trying to get people to buy stock.  And I think that it could be a diversion for them much in the way face.  It was a diversion for Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's a question for both of you.  So I I'm an avid addicted help me please Twitter user.  Right.  And I go through all this stuff.  I use a cost.  I use Twitter on Android.  I use TweetDeck on my Chromebook.  I don't know that I've ever, ever, ever see Twitter ads.  Do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't see like promoted tweets or suggested people to follow.  But I don't go to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I look at my list.  I look at my.  I look at my.  You look at your home time line.  I somewhat but more I look at the list.  I certainly look at my ego feed of what people are saying about me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me me me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've actually seen quite a few ads for like the Chromebook.  I've seen Google promoted tweets about when the Chromebook launched or when the Nexus the Nexus 7 launched.  But but mostly on the web.  It's funny because sometimes I'll see tweets that are you know that say promoted by such and such.  But I just kind of scroll by them.  And they're not that distracting.  But I definitely do see them.  You don't see them at all.  Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't.  And in any case it's hard to imagine how they're even getting a billion dollars revenue.  I mean they are.  That obviously is the right time and the right time for a an IPO.  That means the business is growing and it's doing well.  There's a lot more growth potential.  I just it's funny.  You know when you saw Google's ad strategy you really sensed what it was.  You saw it all the time.  You understood the wisdom of it and the ways it was new and it was smart.  Facebook has struggled a couple of times to figure one out.  But you certainly saw visibly what their ad strategy was as it went.  YouTube same question.  How are they going to put on pre-rolls?  How are they going to put ads around it?  There was very very visible.  Twitter for whatever.  And Twitter is just a is always a mysterious company to me.  You know I think they're always good guys.  And maybe they purposely make advertising as subtle as they can.  Maybe they don't have as much as I think.  I don't know.  But it's just not right in front of me when I use Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I see promoted tweets.  I don't use Twitter very often to be honest.  I publish everything to Twitter but I don't go there as my as a source of information very often.  I saw a promoted tweet by this guy complaining about British Airways recently.  Did you guys cover that last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah we did.  We did cover that.  The guy that complained about his the way his bag was handled.  It's interesting.  I mean I've seen a promoted tweet by a friend of mine who was promoting his e-book.  He clearly purchased a way to promote his tweet.  I mean I think I get I get I get emails from Twitter saying hey promote your your brand on Twitter.  Like I have my blog has a has a Twitter feed and I and you know it's like I keep purchasing advertising here at Twitter.  I mean it could be that Twitter is trying to be the way to advertise for maybe not the companies before individuals.  I agree with Jeff.  It's not as not nearly as overt as the very clear sort of you know blue sponsored links in Google search results.  And it doesn't happen very often.  In fact I mean I'm not signing to Twitter at the moment and I just did a search for the next seven of the Chromebook because I recall seeing some of those promoted and I'm not seeing promoted tweets in those.  I have definitely seen Starbucks promoted tweets and I'm not seeing them now.  But but right.  So Jeff you're saying that because it's not because their business model is still really questionable or at least just not visible.  That makes you hesitant about an investment because their revenue model is revenue doesn't seem obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's more than I just can't figure it out sometimes.  I used to joke about it not having a business model.  I used to joke Fred Wilson about this and clearly it does have one now and it is advertising.  They are figuring out new advertising models.  No it's more than I'm puzzled that it's it's either so subtle I don't see it or there's less of it that I don't see it.  Right.  And neither is necessarily bad at all.  Maybe it's good that it's not constantly in my face.  Maybe they're making money and I don't even know it except that I don't think I've discovered any products through Twitter ads.  I don't think I've discovered any you know that anybody's advertised to me successfully through Twitter.  Yeah.  I just find that interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's confusing to me too and I think they're going to really have to make this case obviously.  This is going to be something that they get much they've been a little bit private about this in the past and I think obviously now it's going to have to be a lot more public especially with investors.  But yeah I mean maybe you can maybe you can help them out Jeff with the promoted tweets by taking your your case against Verizon and purchasing a promoted tweet against Verizon LTE.  Or asking them to support the Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to get a Kickstarter for a march on Verizon.  There you go.  Part of it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you if you contribute ten dollars Jeff will buy a promoted tweet to a million people talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure Verizon's US headquarters are about three miles from my house by the way.  Oh get out the eggs get out the eggs.  And knock on the guard shack.  You need a case of toilet paper.  Yeah.  Virtual toilet paper.  Well you're right.  You raise another important point is what's going to happen with this IPO is that there's going to be more probing into Twitter and there's going to be data that's going to come out to very interesting.  One story said that there is a rumor we don't know that's true.  Twitter's internal 2013 growth target was 400 million users and says this these sources unnamed that it's now at 240 million.  People are saying oh who knows.  The other thing I saw yesterday was the number of fake counts will be a question mark.  And I've long said that when I tweet stuff you know you think that one hundred twenty two thousand people see every tweet.  Of course the proportion of actually seen tweets even just seen is small because all kinds of stuff goes by my feet.  I don't see.  So but it's kind of counted.  Oh I've got this many followers.  I've got this much stuff.  It kind of goes back to the days of hits on the web and there's real stats to come out.  Now none of that takes away from the power of Twitter nor that it's still pretty niche as a product.  It's changed the world.  It's a big deal.  It's on every network TV show.  It's all over.  It's clearly a success.  It's clearly part of the culture.  But there's going to be some really interesting studies I think be able to come out now about the numbers behind Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah agreed.  And in fact they just made a recent change for verified Twitter users.  I'm verified.  Jeff I think you're verified as well.  So we get to see this in your mentions tab.  I actually found this I have mixed feelings about this in your mentions tab.  You can say just show me interactions or replies or mentions that I've gotten from other verified users.  So only verified users can can filter their mentions by by discussions with other verified users which I really don't.  I don't like it because it feels like you're creating this elite layer of you know special people on Twitter.  Studio 54.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  There's a velvet rope thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the reason why I don't like it is mostly because Twitter has been extremely opaque about why or who gets to be verified right for a while there.  It was this is for people who have a big enough profile that they have that to deal with fake accounts being created for them.  I've never had a problem with a fake account.  I don't know why or how I got verified.  There are there are people who are certainly much more well known than me and more deserving and have more followers who I know who are not verified that verification blue checkmark has become some signifier of something or other.  I know people who desperately want it even though it really doesn't give you anything special.  But that this changes that right.  So now you know I've got access to something that other people don't.  And the fact that I'd want to filter my mentions I mean the whole point of Twitter is that you can address someone and assume that they're going to see it in their mentions right.  But this idea that you can filter just by me of course people use different clients and not everyone is reading every single thing.  But it's this idea that like you know only the people on the list can access me.  I didn't don't love that.  I don't love that.  So I wonder if this if this sort of you know turning verified users into this elite club of people who you know I don't know Twitter the Twitter gods decided to touch with the blue checkbox checkmark.  You know this is going to be their answer to the question about fake accounts or fake follows.  Yeah. Yes.  Yeah.  I mean this goes back to their whole celebrity you know I mean Twitter's always catered to celebrity it's part of the reason why they've been so they've been so popular and why hashtags are on TV.  I mean celebrities use it and that the verified checkmark I think started for them but now is kind of filtered down to kind of random you know other random people that for whatever reason get it.  So I looked at my verified filtered mentions and there were very few there.  I mean I'm friends with a lot of verified people but I'd much rather look at my regular Connect mentions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there anything else on Twitter here.  No back to have Williams for a minute just to mention mission before and change in the world is that have is not a secretive guy but he's a quiet guy ironic considering what he's done in life is to create all these ways that people can can scream to the world.  But he did talk in a fascinating interview I thought about his plans for medium and the future of media and his his big notion was that we are too addicted to news and we need to be more addicted to ideas.  And that that's what he thinks medium does whether it succeeds or not you know we'll have to see over time but but it's an interesting and I'm not sure I fully understand how the various elements of medium act up to that or add up to that.  I'd love to hear his rationale about that but but I think it's an important idea that we get so tied up and it's funny Twitter caused a lot of this Twitter clearly made it worse.  Where we're constantly get on what's new what's new what's the latest what's latest can be all the latest and it doesn't really inform us it doesn't really get us anywhere.  And instead we'd be better off if we spend a little time with an idea and scratched our heads about that then that's what he's trying to do with medium so maybe he's trying to make up for Twitter in a way but it's a it's an interesting interesting view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah it's it's interesting medium is really this sort of it's like it's the opposite of Twitter and then it's long form writing you know it's it's it's more fully baked ideas maybe this is this is as way you know it's it's kind of really the opposite of Twitter.  I think that medium is very much a product in progress I think that it's there's a lot of iterating going on there.  I think that we were involved in a Twitter conversation that I've kind of responded to and we were talking about.  There have been a few essays published on medium which has turned out to be kind of kind of Silicon Valley focused although you write for medium but you know there's some people get paid to write a medium some people don't there's some editors of collections to get paid and some people who don't.  Yeah that one guy who is a total tool who wrote this essay that was just sort of I don't know it was sort of sort of sexist and just kind of dumb and there was this kind of firestorm about it.  There's this weird sort of like Silicon Valley bro thing going on medium and then and we were it was me and Anil we were saying to Ed like why don't you disclose why doesn't medium disclose who gets paid and who doesn't and he said well why is that you know why is that important and it's like well medium is this weird thing where it's like it's not clear that it's user-to-user.  It's not clear that it's user generated content it seems like there's an overarching editorial voice and that there are collections but you know it would be useful to know you know who's speaking and he said you know I don't like you know I think you made the point Jeff but it's surprising right that people are surprised they don't they don't know really know what to expect and I think he said well I like to surprise people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was exactly what I said which I love that what's fascinating about medium to me and this is this is really wonkish in the media world but but it's the first attempt I've really seen to to I've always said I say to my students you're either B2B or B2C you're either a platform or you're a product.  If you're a platform you enable products if you're a product you use platforms and medium is trying to be both.  Medium is trying to be a platform where lots of people can come in and can use it in various ways and Ev is quick to say there's crap on medium just like there's crap on Twitter and there's crap on TV I'm not cleaning up all the crap but I'm trying to encourage good stuff there so that he's trying to create a brand around I guess ideas and so at the same time he's a product.  He's a product he doesn't fully control he encourages in some way and that's that's I think that part of the you know if you're looking for that Ev little little light bulb in there and try to see where the inside is that may not be it but I'm I'm starting to think that maybe that's it that he's trying to try to bridge that gap between platform and product.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I mean that's interesting it's a tough it's a tough line at toe you know part of me is like well be what you'll be one of the other because those are the two models that we've had but I'm also a big believer particularly around community management that that anyone can contribute but you have you have leaders or you see the community with with good actors right to to to set the tone and to set an example right so if if medium is paying certain writers or was commissioning certain writers or is asking certain writers like you Jeff to contribute and they're creating a brand that's going to be a product.  Yeah, I mean they're going to contribute and they're creating a platform which is clearly it's beautiful and it's easy to use and it's really it is kind of a I mean even though you can write for it for free I mean it's a nice sort of you know byline to have their kind of their setting they're setting a tone of like this is the kind of content that we want this is the kind of thing that we're looking for and even just the whole look and feel it's very clean the apography is beautiful and layout so yeah I mean that's it's interesting what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that I like that setting that tone you know setting an example and seeing what happens and trying to build something there Hagrid Aaron says in chat room that perhaps Reddit is trying to something similar I think it's a good point.  I think it's a good point.  Well because it wants to be a platform and some reddit people can use it however they want including some pretty yucky awful ways, but yeah it also has a brand and Reddit stands for some things.  And it's caused them problems that's caused them some grief because of people putting up scuzzy pictures of young girls and that kind of stuff on Reddit right how can you allow this if you have a brand what's there will know we're a platform well are you a breath bitter or a candy mitt damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no it's true when the whole creep shots thing happened I think that it was it was really difficult for people to understand you know why wasn't Reddit moderating this oh well right it's just like kind of like the internet and he could do anything on it.  Well, but not really right because it's already and you know they do moderate something they do take down spam you know that there's there was uncertainty around it and I gotta tell you I really after that whole creep shots thing in particular, I was like they gave this guy a trophy for what he was doing in this community  like this is not this is not activity that we should encourage and enable you know the police and censorship and blah blah blah but that was definitely the problem there you know what is what is Reddit is it a platform or is it a product and it kind of is both and I think mediums kind of facing the same thing with this guy that wrote this you know annoying essay that was just kind of crap.  So it's a tough tough line of tow but I like that I like that especially like that as is is playing around with it because I agree I think he's kind of one of the good guys he's done he's had to two big hips I think I think that he really believes I think that he really cares about the web and so I'm actually not annoyed that he's going to be a billionaire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not at all I'm delighted I'm not safe if you're watching which I don't think you are but if you were I'm not saying that just to suck up.  You deserve it I saw you when you were starving I saw you when you cared about your company you've done great things for the world so and I also think they'll spend it well that's the other thing there was somebody said I think was a guardian coming as free pieces the Forbes richest person list came out I think and somebody said oh it's just a nothing but a list of greed and exploitation which may well be the case.  But but it was interesting to look at the end that way who on that list is there because a they did something to improve the world and be that they'll use that wealth to in turn improve the world versus people who do just exploit us like oh I don't know Verizon.  Verizon.  Different topic box, I have not dug into box yet box is a new competitor to Google Docs. Have you got and also Microsoft. Have you guys played with it at all yet give me an idea what it is yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't this is different than box.net.  Right, right. Or is it box.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was the same as box.net but maybe it's not it's box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is box.com. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah. Yeah. So it's okay so my.  I thought this was sort of like Dropbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it also evidently has content creation tools and more added. So there's an interesting, you know, fight going on there that the, you know, I'm now I'm because I live lovey to Google and because I'm on Chrome.  I now live in Google Docs.  I'm not really using Dropbox as much as I used to because I have that. But I love to Dropbox.  Because it changed my mind about the cloud.  So I don't you know there must be more opportunities in the cloud and better cloud services and more specific cloud services.  You know that's the other thing about about what's good about medium medium, you know just on the blogging tool but it adds value there's another one called you mentioned last week I think Gina draft in draft in draft in.com draft.  Yeah, which is why they were delighted they came on Twitter and were delighted that you had plugged them by the way. So yeah, yeah.  Giving us positive feedback loop works.  Trying to add better elegance to the tools that exist kind of moving past the Microsoft age I mean Microsoft and Google that says are that different Google simpler but Google's pretty ugly.  Microsoft has always been ugly and adding elegance into creation tools would be a nice thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well they must there must be a business case behind this right. Otherwise they wouldn't be doing it.  I know that I can testify as someone who just joined a new company and is stuck in a Microsoft world like I'm sure there's ways to do this. I apologize to those I'm not a SharePoint person but I can't stand SharePoint after using Google Docs because I want to be in a document with like we're doing right now in the show notes right editing things together at the same time.  And maybe maybe my company's just not up to the latest edition of SharePoint or whatever they're supposed to be using but it's very frustrating to have someone. Oh someone else has this document out and it's locked for editing and you can't update it.  And I'm pulling my hair out going why can't we use Google Docs around here. So I think there is a lot of space I think you hit on it.  Jeff when you said that there is a lot of space for innovation here in the cloud the cloud document space obviously Microsoft has gone there with its 365 platform Office 365 Google's been there for a while and I think that you know it's one of those areas where it's ripe for innovation and this is an example of companies trying to jump on the bandwagon and make something work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's look at the list to see what else we want to throw in here. So Hugo Barra talked about his life and one of the thing that I found most fascinating about the story is that he pronounced the company. He said it's like show me but it's shower me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was an R sound in there. Did you guys talk about that last night on Android Gina? We did we did. So Hugo Barra former VP at Android Google now Chinese handset manufacturer Xiaomi.  Yeah very ambitious plans. He wants to you want show me to be as big a company as Apple and Google in the next you know the next 10 or 20 years. If I do my job right you'll be talking about Xiaomi in the same way.  And this is this is pretty interesting especially because I think Xiaomi has its own kind of Android build going on with with me UI which is it which is a new UI on top of Android. So it's like it's almost as if Barra is you know building on top of Android but also sort of competing with Google on it at the same time.  And I don't know if they're going to focus their growth on on emerging markets or he's in charge of international right. Right. Right. Right. Right. So he is I believe he is going to live in Asia and I think that he's going to focus on emerging markets.  So this is going to be this is going to be interesting to see what he brings what he brings to the table. I went to this company will compete with Google actually. Well exactly. I went to Amazon to and I looked you know you could buy the phones now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're they're they're Amazon for their Android 4.1 most of them quite are quite a price range from very inexpensive to I think about 400 bucks. I'm sure that Verizon will take none of them.  But it but interesting to see what could happen there and and also Hugo says I didn't leave because the whole personal issue and all that that he's been talking about for quite some time.  He also saw addressed that he addressed it. Yes he did. He did. Which you know fine. And and I think that you know I read between the lines and I think that that Ruben leaving and Sundar coming coming in I think was just kind of the time he accomplished a great deal.  And he saw a new opportunity and you know he wasn't going to be Sundar in the short term at least. And so he went off to something else people he has a lot of respect people really like you go.  He's done a lot of good work so I'm I'm rooting for him to surprise us and do some amazing things there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It isn't shower me it's shall me just shall me. There's no there's no we are in there. Oh it's shall I see so it's the shower without the ER. Yeah exactly. Yes. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. X X A I O in opinion is shall shall me.  So so I think it's interesting that he addressed this controversy. I don't want to go into I don't want to be wrong. But but I'm sure that you know when you've got when you when you're at a point where it's like OK I'm ready for a change and then you know something like that happens as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of like you know icing on the cake. It's like OK this is done. I'm very happy making this change in my life right now. Right. So yeah I mean you know of course this is a Chinese company concerned you know the first the first the lead of the article is him explaining how to pronounce the name speaking of names.  Anyway but we have we have a time shouldn't I seem strange to us.  That's true. Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know but I think an X might be a little more frightful too many vowels and an X you know could add up too much for us. Yeah. Yeah.  It's it's the show me phone.  Anything else to run down before we get to our stuff and money.  All right. Well I just got word from Chad that Leo is crawling off a gondola right now. He's he's gone through a lot of wine. He's got a pizza in his hand. He's got a funny shirt on and he's going to lead us into a message from our sponsors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I Jeff. Yes I'm back. No I'm not really. I recorded this before I left. But I first of all I want to thank you for doing the show for me. I really appreciate it.  And they asked me to mention legal zoom since I have used it. In fact I used legal zoom to set up twit way back when that's how we got our LLC. You know it's interesting. I didn't need a lawyer. I just needed legal zoom. Didn't cost me much. Ninety nine bucks plus filing fees.  And we're still today we're still using. I have a lawyer now a lot of them and a lot of money out of the door. We're still using that LLC that legal zoom set up way back in 2005.  You know I'm not I'm not alone over the last 12 years a million business owners have trusted legal zoom to help start their business whether it's a LLC a chapter S or C incorporation if it's a trademark a patent they do it all DBAs.  You can even form a nonprofit starting in 99 bucks at legal zoom dot com. You don't need a lawyer for this stuff. They're not a law firm.  Although they have this new legal plan. I really like this where they'll hook you up with a lawyer at a pre negotiated very affordable flat rate.  I love that you can check out the lawyers in your state read the reviews the profiles unedited reviews though so you know exactly what customers are saying about those lawyers you get the right lawyer for you.  You know everything from he was no nonsense he got right to the point to he took the time to explain you know what do you need he took the time to explain it.  I love legal zoom dot com and I think you will to save time and money and don't forget make a will if you haven't done that yet make a trust.  Durable power of attorney health care all of that legal zoom dot com all I ask if you use legal zoom and I think you'll want to use the offer code TW IG in the checkout box.  To get 10 bucks off and let them know you heard about it on twig legal zoom dot com please use twig as the offer code. Thanks back to you Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I love that in the pre record commercial Leo is wearing his little moto X magnet thing.  On a shirt I'm betting it's lost by now somewhere in the Venetian Canal.  It is.  That's why we love him that Leo.  That is all right so let's get to our end or to our things here and you want to lead off this time with with your thing.  Yeah sure I can absolutely so I think you guys have talked about this a little bit before but I wanted to give everyone kind of a preview of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google device manager so if you haven't seen this or you haven't used it before.  Or I started Android device manager.  This is something that can help you track your phone or phones in my case I have a bunch of my phones for my family all registered under my name and so I can actually track like if I want to know.  Hey my son said he was going over somebody else's house is he really there.  I don't do that but but I could do that if I wanted to with Android device manager and so I thought I'd do a little demo of this in case you haven't seen it in case you don't know what that is.  So if you look at my if you take my screen here you can see.  Oops where am I here we go.  So the way that you get to this there's a couple things you need to do to make this work number one you go to.  Google dot com slash Android slash device manager and then on your device you need to actually approve this in your in your device settings.  So if you go into your security screen.  Let me back up so you can see here's your security screen.  And if you go into security and then down below there'll be a section for device administrators and you'll see Android device manager is listed there.  And so you just click on the button to enable that and you'll see what it gives you.  Now this is something that this is something new that you may or may not be able to read my screen there but something new is change the screen.  unlock password this just came out recently.  In fact Gina pointed this out today that you can actually now Google is making it possible for you to change the screen screen unlock password remotely.  And if you're unless your device is powered off as long as it's on somewhere you can turn it on remotely.  And if it's not you can turn it on remotely.  And if you're not you can turn it on remotely.  And if you're unless your device is powered off as long as it's on somewhere you can turn it on remotely.  And if it's not if it's not powered on you can go into the web browser and actually don't have this.  Let me see if I can do this on the fly.  How's that can you get that Chad.  So this is the this is the UI on the website you just go to like I said the URL is Google dot com slash angel slash device manager.  It'll pull up a list of all of your all of your phones that are registered to your account and you can actually go in you can ring the phone you can erase the phone remotely.  And so in the case that your device is powered off if you hit a race as soon as the device powers back up and connects to the network it'll actually go ahead and erase the device which is pretty awesome.  And if you hit ring in fact I'll do this with my phone now since this is my S4 you can see on my screen the map you can see that I'm actually at the brick house.  So you know there's no trickery going on here I'm actually here I can hit ring and it'll say do you want to ring your device.  Yes I do. And it should come on there we go. It should go out and it says device was wrong and there goes my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With a really irritating ringtone I might have really loud irritating ringtone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is and so you have to hit the power button in order to turn that off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's really helpful because I don't know about you guys but for example like my wife is always losing her phone all the time and then she goes back to wherever she was and she's like I don't know what I did with it.  It was here when I left. It's around here somewhere and so I can actually go in and remotely ring her phone and she can go over and find it.  It's stuck in the couch cushions or something like that.  So it's a really really cool feature and I used to use Prey. I don't know if you guys know about Prey.  It's an application that does similar things to this and I'm thinking about getting rid of Prey because this is so fully functioned and works so well.  I don't think I need Prey anymore I think this will work just fine.  Have you guys played with device manager at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No I just pulled it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I enabled this kind of right away as soon as I heard that it was available.  I feel like this is one of those things.  It shouldn't be on by default because of course you're giving Google the ability to erase your device and tracking your device and all that.  But this is really really useful because if your phone gets stolen or like you said if you just misplaced it or it's somewhere in the house and you can't find it.  That happens to me all the time especially now that I got a baby and all her stuff.  It's just so convenient and it just gives me peace of mind.  Like oh if I did drop the phone or leave the phone or if I think the phone's been stolen I don't have to start to think.  I don't have to rush to a computer and change my Google password.  I can just say just wipe it. Remote wipe it.  It's a better good feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina.  My tip this week is a little Android tip.  We talked about last night all about Android but I found it so useful.  I'll talk about it again in Google Maps on Android.  There's a quicker way to get to navigation for driving navigation which is usually what I use it for the most.  So in Google Maps on Android if you search for a location.  So I've gone into Google Maps and I've searched for for Twitter up in Petaluma.  Then you'll see that you'll see the name of the place at the bottom of the screen and there's a route button.  So normally we'd have to do is you tap the route button and then it would give you this other screen.  My location best buy.  Cycling bus walking car.  You can just long press long press on the route button and it will drop you directly into navigation.  Which by the way it would take me eight hours and 44 minutes to drive up to Petaluma right now.  But just just just quick tip long press on the route button and you'll go straight into navigation and you can skip a step.  Which is especially handy when you're when you're in the car or you're you know of course you shouldn't be doing this while you're driving.  But if you're parked in your car and you're ready to go and you just want to want to get get direct right to direction.  So long press on that route button when you're in Google Maps and you'll go directly into navigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the things I love about Android is when it is an address in my calendar and email and I click on it.  I then get the choice of whether to go into Maps or Waze or something else.  And each time it's a little bit different.  Last Sunday I was trying to find someplace obscure in New Jersey and I thought Google Maps had the better route.  So I used that but then then turns out they didn't know about a dead end and Waze did.  Waze got me around being able to go back and forth between the two.  I'm such a fan of Waze and soon I don't know if the two will merge but it's great.  All right I have a very quick number which is GigaOM reports from a conference going on right now in the UK and somewhere in Europe.  I don't know where Felix Baumgartner's jump causing my you know if I don't like bridges you can imagine how much I love that that jump.  Watching that but I did because you could not watch it.  Well it turns out that it consumed a quarter of the world's bandwidth.  With people watching that off YouTube. That's just mind blowing.  A that that many people came to one thing and B that Google could handle it.  That it could handle a quarter of the world's bandwidth in one way or another.  I just find that amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is crazy. I had no idea.

Transcript:  Yeah. Amazing.  So I think we have come to the end of our week.  We miss we miss Leo. We miss Lisa.  We hope they're having a wonderful wonderful time in Italy.  They're probably just finishing a lovely pizza right now and a nice red wine I hope for them.  And so that's it. So Aaron Newcomb thank you very much.  As Gina said at the top it was so great to have not only a human being but this human being you.  It's just great.  Anything you want to plug from your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So definitely people should follow me on Google plus if you haven't heard that already.  Add me to your circles on Google plus.  Post some some rather humorous things or at least I think they're funny.  So if you share my sense of humor you'll laugh hysterically.  And talk about Google and Android and open source and all that kind of stuff.  Which goes along with a lot of the shows.  I'm also on Twitter and Facebook by the way.  So everything gets reposted there.  So you can follow me there if you want to.  And then I'm also involved in Floss Weekly.  I did Floss Weekly this morning talking about Open WRT.  Which is open source firmware for a lot of routers and other embedded devices that you can use instead of the manufacturer's firmware.  Very cool stuff.  And occasionally on All About Android with Gina and Jason and Ron.  So I want to mention them too.  Also as long as you gave me the opportunity to plug I would say.  If you're going to be in San Francisco for Oracle Open World next week.  Huge show 45 days a week.  If you're going to be there and you want to meet me come down to the NetApp booth in Moscone South.  I'll be there.  I'll be wearing a NFL referee uniform.  Why I'm wearing that.  But I should be easy to pick out of the crowd.  Just come to the NetApp booth in Moscone South.  Introduce yourself.  Say hey I'm a fan.  I like watching what you do on the Twitter network or otherwise.  And I'd love to meet people and say hi and shake hands and stuff like that.  So definitely come look me up next week at Oracle Open World.

Transcript:  Yay Gina.  Alright.  One thing we must plug this week.  Happy birthday, Etta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh thank you.  I will pass on all of Twig Watchers birthday wishes.  Yeah I can't believe it's been a year.  It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was thinking about this.  I was going to have us all start singing.  I think you could hum it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm very excited to give her hand her a cake and see what she does with it.  That's the best.  That's the best for one year old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're like.  First my kids were tentative at first and then they're like oh I can do this.  No one's going to stop me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm a little worried about what she's going to do when she puts the icing in her mouth.  Because I think it'll be the sweetest, richest, sugary thing that she's eaten in her entire life.  So she might be in complete and utter sugar shock.  That's awesome.  So we'll see.  I'll get a good mom award for that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But thank you Jeff.  I'm also saying to my own who freak out.  What is all this happening here?  It's not my normal life.  What are you doing?  I know you'll handle it better than I did.  So happy birthday Etta.  Happy birthday by connection mom.  And that's it.  That's as they used to say on Twitter.  That's a wrap.  Thank you very much.  Thank you for being here.  Glad you're watching this.  You can watch us online anytime.  You can come on live and see the fun beforehand.  But I haven't the faintest idea what that is.  I can't deal with West Coast versus East Coast.  So all I'll say is goodbye.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's it for Twig this week.  Thank you.
