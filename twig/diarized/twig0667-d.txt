Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so everybody lost Stacey this week child is still positive after day five. She tweets this variant ain't messing around y'all  But she's still blogging. She's still writing about stuff. She wrote about Apple's  Homekit  announcements and matter  She was very excited about that. I was really looking forward to having her on to talk about that  Next week if we can get her back for daughter and her daughter's fine, right?  She just you know, you can't travel if you've tested positive. I  Like Puerto Rico, I wouldn't mind a week in Puerto Rico. I should have volunteered  also  thanks to  Is this was this did Anthony do this Anthony Nielsen? This is the thumbnail from last week's show

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This thumbnail I well know I want to complain  Things just keep it got on easy. You got a hat and straw the rest. Oh hysterical. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's the thumbnail so I can't I can't show it but  Yeah, wow. Yeah, you didn't get googly eyes or anything yet. You just got a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cowboy to have googly eyes apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Jeff when you just you look like a crazy. I was I was having it up for it  I was see I was getting into an ant. I was for the good of the show  I was sacrificing every bit of dignity I ever had

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You are correct because I was just sitting back judging all three

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Six six, that'll give you a night evil show. Holy cow  All right, let's see  We talked about actually Cheryl Samberg quitting came in during the show didn't it last week  Yes, it is. We have talked about that right at the top. We don't have any more information about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the Wall Street Journal just speculated. There was nothing of note in their story about it  Why Cheryl Samberg quit Facebook's meta?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That dovetailed with a well, wait a minute a company investigation into her activities is this about her?  And her relationship with Bobby Kotick who is the CEO of Activision she lobbied  UK tabloid not to print an article about Kotick  So they this was a clip job they were trying to pull out everything they could do I read the whole thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was nothing there. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I think it's completely reasonable that Cheryl is stepping down to spend more time with her money  She's getting married next month. She's got a family  And I do think she has political ambitions in 2024. I really do. I think you're right. This is the beginning of that. Yeah  Yeah, that's fine. She's earned this now. Here's the pile on  latest news from Elon  I  Don't want it I don't want it he's trying to get out of it Twitter says no  They Elon's big demand is tell me about the bots  Elon's big demand is tell me about the bots like you didn't know ahead of time  He when he signed the deal said I'm not doing any due diligence. I'm just brilliant  I remember this reminds me of a former boss of mine Halsey Miner. Do you know the name Halsey?  Oh god, yeah, I do Halsey Miner  He founded CNET and I worked for him briefly in the early days of CNET  He finally let me go and said go to CNET DD or something. Don't don't bug us here  I  Was but I had no rancor  He was a smart guy. He was a hedge fund guy started CNET did very well made a lot of money, but but but Halsey  Famously, he's I think he's bankrupt now. He's in tax trouble for sure, but famously bought a racehorse  By looking in its eyes and saying I can tell it's a winner  That's right race horse is not a winner but  That's neither here nor there he came from good Virginia stock and he could look at a horse and say that is a winner  Apparently not anyway, I feel like Elon Musk said I've looked into the eyes of Twitter. I could tell it's worth 44 billion dollars  Now he says wait a minute. There's an awful lot of bots  Twitter said no no, no weren't you know a  You already said no due diligence B. We say there's 5% and that's that now they say we are gonna comply

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but comply what they're doing is calling his bluff  They're saying okay. Okay, one. Here's the fire hose. Oh that's a lot of the way. Yeah, have fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  500 million tweets half a billion tweets daily  The fire hose is famously something ever, you know people wanted but very few could get I think the Library of Congress still has  Access to it very few very few have the analytical power to deal with it, right?  Well, Elon, it's it's it's the equivalent of when you're doing a discovery  In a legal case delivering a truckload of boxes saying. Oh you wanted that data. Here you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in  It I don't have a problem with him saying you know what I want this product  But you got to fix it up a little bit  We do the same thing when it comes to just buying regular day-to-day stuff where there'd be cars or houses and whatnot  I don't have a problem with that. The problem I have is him just sort of  being  Don't know how to say it, but he knows there's bots out there  He's got a gazillion followers and he knows everything that responds to him. It's pretty much a bunch of bots houses  He probably runs a few bots himself. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Asserted it's a little different hand. It says if you went to a car dealership  You sign on the down line. You said I'll take it and then you you know  Decided oh wait a minute maybe let I better look under the hood first he agreed not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He agreed no not it was done right he didn't I'm not saying that like he's already bought the car  I'm saying when you go to look for a home no no but Twitter's into do some sort of yeah, you do diligence

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He waived that Twitter's point. Yes, and that's a good example and if you buy a home with no conditions you bought it  You don't have an out saying all the home inspection. Nope. You didn't you didn't specify that  Oh, only if I get financing nope you didn't specify as  Is yeah by the house right or or the only out here is a billion bucks right and it may not even be out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He may not even be able to pay the breakup fee and get out of it Twitter could hold his feet to the fire  I know you agreed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Contractually you're bound and I hope that he doesn't end up buying it  But I hope also hope they take him well in the meantime so the whole penalty could be just just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing he could still end up having to pay the full bill and yeah, the penalty is that the full bill

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alright, okay, so it's possible and probably likely that he's just trying to get a lower price, but again  It's just like the house analogy is much better than the car analogy. Thank you Jeff. Yeah house. Yeah, he bought the house  He said yeah, I'll pay you the money. No, I'm gonna buy it as is wave inspections  You don't then get to change it and Twitter has a contractual  You know  He has a contractual obligation Twitter could enforce that they could say no  However Musk says I'm not until I get this information about bots. I'm not gonna do the deal  So they said well here now by the way, this is not had not been announced  This is according to a person familiar with the company's thinking  The board is gonna give him the fire hose, which means he could then  Pipe that half billion tweets into some  Computer and he'll come up with some absolute BS analysis

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I found 40 billion bots, but but and he'll probably get the headlines out of that because tech press is really stupid  but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Legally, it ain't gonna give him an out the Washington Post says  When Musk signed the initial deal to buy the company in April  He waived a right to look deeply at Twitter's finances and inner workings  The purchase agreement requires that must go through with the deal unless  He could show the company misled him or a major event has changed its value

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the company didn't make any claims that I know of about bots

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's hard to use those maces

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's say this is October  2022 because isn't that about the time all of this should be finalized roughly around that time like that  so  He says you know what nah, I don't want it they go to court  They so Twitter has the legal right to take them to court. Yep, and the court  sides with Twitter  What happens is it jail time? Is it no no he owes it's a car and his wages  Wages

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Comes over and says give me your money they toll  Oh  Because I don't understand I think actually and you you're making an excellent point  I think that's the other thing Elon like other famous hucksters of the 21st century  Knows that he's above the law and probably doesn't have to worry about just that just that. Mm-hmm  He's too big to fail  The lawyers from scad and ARP slate meager and flamb

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a great as a great firm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Elan's lawyers  scadden ARP slate meager and flam say musk have must have musk must have a  complete and accurate understanding of the very core of  Twits business model its active user base  Twitter's latest offer to simply provide additional details regarding the company's own testing methodologies whether through written materials or verbal explanations  Is tantamount to refusing mr. Musk's data requests?  I just see what just it's I the only thing I blame Elon for at this point  It's just making a mess and a muddle of all this people are leaving Twitter Twitter employees are very anxious over everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's important people have been fired and it's a trolling. It's pure troll. It's destructive  Troll and and a lot of shareholders I  Think we'll end up suing him not just for his late disclosure, but for all the gameplays  So he's already being so really affected the price. He is being so that yeah, but that alone  But I think that was the you violated the rules suit  I think there's another suit here to say that you manipulated the stock in the end  And you and you are you harmed to the company. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So annoying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He is but all the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The the the the the stands the stands we call them the Twitter the Musk stands they're tiring

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's anything he does is just brilliant and you don't give him credit and what's your problem, man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well to pile on now the Texas Attorney General who has problems of his own  Has launched an investigation against Twitter for allegedly misreporting fake bot accounts  Attorney General Paxton says Twitter has until June 27th to respond  Ken Paxton  This is what it's just a publicity stunt

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it coincidental since he's no one's Texan? It's not coincidental  No, no not in the living some some revenues some tax revenues to that state this subtext of all of this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter banned President Trump  Elon has said multiple times now. They should not have done it was stupid and he would  Restore President Trump by the way, we should point out what Twitter they didn't ban Trump for a long time  There were a lot of people saying they should have banned him sooner. They'd only banned him for in  Encouraging sedition against the United States to overturn election results  They that you know, that's treasonous behavior. They banned him appropriately and they banned him permanently  This however offends his fellow seditionists including AG Paxton

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're all just piling on and then the New York Times I didn't put this in the rundown  But I got pissed off put it on Twitter  Which is what I do with everything that pisses me off these days  Well Paxton Paxton kind of has some political benefit here  I mean that angling of he did a cynical act and we're gonna give him the credit for that and then say hey  He could get credit for doing this with the right wing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  His job is to represent the people of the great state of Texas nuts and their interests  Period not to gain political  Points. Yep  Media points we got a mess. We got a mess on our hands folks. We have a mess  Twitter is reassuring its staff. They say the shareholders revolt by it will vote by August  The  Staff  You know  Understandably a little anxious  The lawyer told them today that the deal to sell the company is still progressing that the shareholder vote  Will occur late next month or early August  The company's waiting for the SEC to approve the proxy after which it will be sent to shareholders  This is coming from Pagia Gotti Twitter's head of legal and policy. This is that in all hands  Twitter has and will continue to cooperatively share information with mr  Musta consummate the transaction in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement  I say I say we believe this agreement is it  Walkhorn leghorn is in the best interest of all shareholders  The company said where I say we intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement and forget that one ant  Enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Enforces a the operative word there again that word and what does it mean to someone who doesn't care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That feels there above the law. Well, he maybe he should call a court could say you owe in  Billions of dollars. Yeah, and when the court says it  You got to pay however given our courts these days, you're right aunt

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This guy like I said, it's not like they're gonna garnish his wages  No, but they could take his Tesla stock. I mean there are things they could do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay  Employees were very concerned about work from home Twitter has as you as you may remember said you can work from home forever  All right. Yeah, Elon  You know memo to his missus to his Tesla employees said you better get the hell back in here  And we want at least 40 hours a week from you  And it better be in the place where your major business is done. Not some remote office. You got it. You got to come in  Gatti did say remote told the employees remote work is not protected by the merger agreement. So there's no guarantee  Elon gets to decide so that cost again

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now if you're a Twitter employee made decisions for their lives they move because the company told them you're not you don't ever have to come back

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can do what you want to do. So now I mean Elon is reducing the value of this company nibbling away at the value of this  Company bit by bit whether he buys it or not  Which is too bad. I mean, I'm not a  You know, I don't think the word would world would be worse off if there were no Twitter  But I what I don't see is a hobbled Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is that well, no, I'm gonna disagree once again  And I was just at a conference great conference at University of Virginia our friend Siva Varinathan put on and  There was a lot of discussion there. See if I hates Facebook. What's his opinion on Twitter?  He hates social media. He hates the idea of connecting all mankind. Okay, this is where he I love him  I respect him. Oh  Really? Yeah, he's great on that  Yeah, he's brilliant on that. Yeah  but a lot of the discussion was around the creation of  counterpublics as it's called  Online, you know is possible because of the Twitter what's a counter and to dismiss it a smaller public  That's not represented like like black Twitter like LGBTQ Twitter  like any  Affinity group doesn't have the chance one more than affinity any group that doesn't have the power  Under the the view of what is normally considered the public it gives a voice to out non mainstream  Yes, exactly. Exactly. It's John. John Warner is the academic who came up with counterpublics. That's a good way to put it  Okay, I like that. Yeah, and so and so, you know, you say oh we're better off without Twitter  Well, no a lot has been built there that you and I don't see no, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that is critical and you can say the same thing for Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can in a long ways. Yeah, yeah any online community, right? Yeah, and that's not to say they're perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not to say there aren't a lot of flaws  Could be done far better or that it won't be done far better but as of today people built something there and  To get that just thrown away is  Is a problem. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Were you being facetious with him not really caring about the connection for people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no  It's not that he doesn't care. He says I don't want to misquote him here and we should have models  Trying we really have but he wrote his latest book about Facebook  Which I have somewhere over there  Basically says that to connect all of mankind  without the guardrails in was irresponsible and and  Ill-fated from the start

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so I'll agree that it was guardrail of a  28 cent stamp was was fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's not that's a one-to-one. I think you're right to me and you're right  The what fascinates me is that is that the Postal Service was the original internet?  but except except  Your your mail ended up on the bulletin board in the town square for all the sea, which is the difference  Right, or if you wanted to put a 28 if you wanted to reach a hundred people you had to get by  128 cent stamps

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  His position is it undermines democracy. The book is an anti-social  Media how Facebook disconnects us and undermines democracy  He's been on the show before I love see you. He's a smart guy  He's just very very busy guys traveling a lot. He's doing a lot of conferences, but we will get him on  It's this is a tough one, you know, there are both arguments are valid. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely, that's that's why there's a discussion that that's what Siva brought together with about 25 academics  Yeah, it's good for him  Because it was a discussion about deliberation. Yeah, and it was fascinating  Because some of the academics said deliberate, you know this idea that we want to have deliberation as a as an ideal  one of them said brilliantly we  One view is that you can't deliberate at this scale  Another view is well you can deliberated a smaller scale. Is that what we want?  Well as somebody said there well your your your town council or your faculty meeting are a deliberative scale that works  But they're hell right we hate them but but liberation is hard. They get the job done. Yes painful, but it's yeah, it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's it makes a difference. You got to do it  Yeah, I yeah, I mean you're right it's a flippant thing for me to say we'd be better off without Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's and that's not certainly what I want. So here's here's a quote that I put in my book manuscript from Siva  Facebook is just too big to govern. He said we are all victims of his success  it's a story of the hubris of good intentions a  Missionary spirit and ideology that sees computer code is a universal solvent for all human problems. I  Don't disagree with him about that. I think that no and that's why he's hubris about it. I love

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their their project. What is it green?  Twitter Twitter green. What is the thing?  The blue sky the blue sky that Jack Dorsey funded  I love mastodon and then we run a mastodon instance at twit.social and I I really think that a  decentralized federated  Twitter like place would be a much better  Place except I agree. I absolutely then you really could create your  You're out, you know, you could have a black mastodon. You could have a whole place

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, and you could also say there's bad speech out there. Yep, leave it. It's there always is. Yeah, let me ask you this Leo  Yeah, I agree with you. But but the but the yes, but that I grapple with is  that if we agree that  We should we should  Moderate out of the world obviously child porn and harassment. Let's say  If it's distributed  You you kind of can't it's well you can and you can't in places

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So tell me about that right now child porn is gonna happen  It happens and it's gonna happen and you can't there's always gonna be place people are gonna go and they're gonna exchange stuff  With a mastodon like solution you might have somebody set up a mastodon. That's full of child porn now. They have legal  Restrictions, you know, they're they're running up against the foul of the law, but let's let's pretend that's not the case  Here's the beauty any other mastodon instance could choose to ignore it  Could choose to block it if they want or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's an emergent norm of the entirety of mastodon communities together

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By their individual decisions decide what what makes you're not gonna put the clubhouse out of business just as you can't stop  Currently in the real world you can't stop them from gathering at somebody's house  You can't you know, that's up to the law to stop you can stop it that way  But you can isolate them you can you can keep them out of the mainstream by just not following them  I do that with gab on my on my mastodon since that's the only other  Mastodon I don't follow I don't allow federation with but I do allow federation with others  Which means anybody can on my who's a member of twit dot social can follow anybody else  In fact, I think recently I took gab off that list presuming if somebody wants to follow gab, that's fine  It doesn't solve the problem of somebody from gab adding me and then I you know, I might see that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Imagine you're a regulator  And another life I could imagine you would have been and  You get a law passed saying that vaccine  Disinformation is illegal. Yeah, forget. Let's say you're in it. You're in UK. We don't have a First Amendment  right in the architecture of  discord

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not discord. I'm talking about mastodon but that's not sorry. That's not yeah in the architecture of mass discord has as a regulator

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, could you do anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not no because nobody runs mass. There's no centralized mastodon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You would have to go after every single mastodon server and say if you just like a blog just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Forums it's much more like a form like forums forums that interoperate think of it that interoperability is new

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not the old forums you had it's more like use net. I guess it's kind of like using it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's a much better more elegant system, but it's that it's that idea. So you have  Discrete spaces which would be forums but but you can follow anybody on any other forum  You can follow anybody the other mastodon and that becomes part of your mastodon feed not everybody else's by the way  Just yours, right? Right. So give you kind of the best of both worlds. I think yeah exactly. So with use net

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just trying to play this out. This is really helpful for me  Was that the same case then that you couldn't have erased something across all of us net because it was distributed  That's right from there was no central

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no central authority and I presume in Twitter green or whatever it is. What is it green blue sky blue sky  Blue blue sky I assume that has a similar you honestly I think blue sky by the way has the creator of mastodon is on their advisory board

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm also planning to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, what are you doing?  Do not mess with your settings  From very very bright to very very dark

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I  Actually plan to interview somebody high up at blue sky good. Well, I can learn more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd be curious how much like mastodon mastodon has  Stayed the test of time. I mean there have been other attempts like a dentica and status net  Gnu social this is really lasted and I think works quite well  the only thing that hurts mastodon is it's not as fast and exciting and sexy as Twitter is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because here's a big blob of everything right and I think that's that's the that's the interesting issue to me  Is that the the beauty of Twitter is that you can do something and anybody who's on Twitter can see it on  mastodon or  Discord well, there's a discovery issue. Everybody can't see it, but there is a discovery issue  Exactly. And so breaking out and breaking through if we think of them  So let me show you this community basis this works this is a mass media basis is a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Social which has I've set up kind of to look a little bit like tweet tech. So in this  Second cut the first column is just you know, I can get rid of that. Whoops. I don't want to log out  That's the wrong button first column is just for tweeting and stuff like that. This second column is my home. That's who I follow  That's your Twitter feed. It's it's not algorithmic. There is no algorithm  It's it's completely chronological and I control that by just following somebody  I can follow somebody locally and I on my Twitter social or and most of these are not on Twitter social  This person is it?  Rage dot love that's a completely different mastodon instance  So you follow them and then you'll see it just like in your Twitter feed  There's a central column here, which is notifications. That's just so I know somebody mentions me  I don't have to do that and then here in this third column you can have a federated timeline, which is just everything  That's the fire hose  Every other mastodon instance I'm federated with yes everybody. Okay, that's for that's a useful thing for discovery  There's a local timeline, which is even people I don't follow. Hey Galia saying she's saying boo  That's everybody on Twitter social whether I'm following them or not  Right, so you can see what's going on in that particular server. There is some discovery stuff too. There's explore  It's not you know, there's hashed, you know, this is trending there's it's as you can see it's not very active  But there's some stuff going on and that could be more depending on how people how people use it. So  I think this is I think that you know, this has been going on for a while and I think creator was named  Oigan, Rochko. Yeah. Well, he's yeah you  Eugene or you gene? Okay, yeah you gene  Yeah, what if we're German of E organ he's German so it's probably what it is then I think you're German. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What where did he come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you know? Uh, you know, I don't know much about him. Actually, that's a really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so he's chief executive officer of he of mastodon so there is an entity of mastodon

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's just the code. That's the code base. And by the way, it's open source. So it's been forked multiple times  Truth social Trump's is a fork. Yeah of mastodon

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, did they get out of trouble with them was it a GPL  Trump social

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know because they violated his GPL for sure but whether he's gonna pursue it I don't know  So he's German born. Let me see if I can find out more about him. I bet he has by now he has a  Wikipedia  entry chief executive officer, but that just means he's responsible for the you know, he does not have a Wikipedia  That's that's that's kind of too well, will you mention it by tomorrow somebody might he's a great  My all my experience interacting with him has been great  He really cares. He does this, you know out of the I don't he doesn't make a lot of money  All right, I don't pay him anything for mastodon you don't have to it's open source  It's I think this is exactly so let's say Twitter poofed, you know, Elon Elon killed it  It's interesting when Elon first put in the bid for Twitter  We had hundreds of people flock to tweet that social I added five or six hundred new members, but nothing happened  It's never got it's still a backwater kind of  You know, they used it for a while and I went back to Twitter, but if Twitter went away  We bought a paywall or something I think that mastodon is a very credible  Alternative that solves a lot of these problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll be interesting if Twitter today said  We're gonna allow someone to export all the identities out of Twitter  So that you could reimport them somewhere else

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that might be an interesting poison pill, I don't think at this point I don't think the board they can't  Do it right now, but yeah  Yeah, but they hit they did a poison pill for about four seconds and then took it back because they wanted the 54 20 a share  But I think that would be really interesting  They may not be able to do it at this point you probably if you're in a sale of contract you can't say  Oh, here's all the stuff. I'm gonna give it away  So I bet you can't but that would be really interesting  You know what Elon if you really want to do a good thing with Twitter  That would be a good thing to do make X make it possible to export everything  Make the firehose available to anybody who wanted it  You know there are things you could do with Twitter that would be great to make it more of a public entity  And a public value open source the code  There's lots of things you could do. I think blue sky was a very good idea  By the way, and I've mentioned this before blue sky is funded and there's nothing you like to do about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I got a question for you in since you are doctor social there at that. Oh, I am not I promise you I'm not  Well, no, but you're you're you're bringing people in your you're carrying community manager community. Yeah, right. So I'm curious what you've  What you've learned in that experience as community manager at twit and let me just  Say I'd be curious at various answers what you learned about  Functionality what you've learned about people what you've learned about what people like I mean, yes  It's just twit and it's a friendly place. But what have you found in your experience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think with it being twit is is a lot easier for me because it's such a big  Community and I put that in quotes. Everybody just just loves on everybody here  So there's really not much to worry about just making sure everyone's happy and have somewhere to converse  Whether they want to talk about code and Linux or whether they want to talk about sports  and it just  It's just been really really easy now trying to manage something  Like a photographer's community, which I did a long time ago  That was a pain in the butt because people just had egos

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, there's one thing that makes the discourse  Really easy to moderate and really successful which is you have to pay seven bucks a month to be in the club and  Having a bar of any kind. Yeah. Yeah, we have no  There's zero trolling because nobody's the troll is not gonna spend seven bucks just to get kicked out  So no refunds so that eliminates, you know, there are there are  Problems occasionally but they're minor because there's skin in the guys a lot of skin in the game. So that's number one and by the way  Even though in order to pay seven bucks a month, I guess we have to have your credit card and a lot of people in the discord use  Handles, we don't know who they are. That's fine. There's and I don't have any problem with that same thing in our chat  I also run a free  Community  Twit community that community and I love that and that one is free and it has more problems  There's there was there is trolling occasionally and stuff, but it is also a very good place for conversation. So  Yeah, part of that is there's this kind of  Self-selecting nature of it, right? Yeah, and there's  Seven bucks there's more issues. Absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I really saw a  Smartphone photographers community I battled every dad gum week with with just  egos because everybody  They wanted to be judged on their photography yet. They didn't want to be judged on a photography, you know  They say hey critique my photograph and you tell them hey  Well, I think this could be better or this should could look like this and yada yada yada  Defensive and then they start throwing stones and then it tell you no  Canon is better than Nikon and Nikon is better than Sony and so it was just a bunch of that  Just ego stuff and it was never any real community of people trying to help other photographers out  With the craft and help them get better instead of just you know, yeah, we have that you're nicer than artists

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, okay, I'm gonna show you a thread that's going on right now in the twit community in the in the discourse  Not discord discourse forums. Yeah, the open for that community. We have a really nice guy P holder who is  Just taking on himself to become a moderator. So thank you. He does a great job  So a guy came in  this last right after twit saying the assumption seems to be that all the listeners share the politics and views of the people in the  Show and then P holder says the assumption seems to be your views are not so fragile  They can survive your exposure to someone else's point of view to which our Jay replies  It seems to me a show wants to maximize its audience would seek to acknowledge and not everyone  Listening shares their exact point of view and black and forth back and forth stop whining blah blah blah  and then and then sorry to interrupt, you know, I have a question I  Have to say it self corrects a little bit occasionally will boot people  You know holder has had to  boot some people so have I  So something completely opens always gonna have a little bit of that  This is life  One thing I will tell you I know for a fact  Like a garden if you don't tend to yes, you've got to moderate. You've got to have a presence  Ideally in all the twit stuff all the hosts would be active and present because our presence  Lifts the conversation. Yes, sir. I'm sorry. I'll do it more often. Well, you don't have to I'm not saying that to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Particularly, but this is why aunt had his farmers hat last all night

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I mean it's at least my responsibility the other the other thing is if there is a bad apple you have to get rid  Of them quickly you have to aggressively moderate. This is something Twitter does not do because of free speech  But I believe in any public forum you have to moderate quickly because what will happen like in a garden the weeds will push out  The good people and it's a vicious circle and pretty soon nobody everything's it's 4chan  So nobody because nobody wants to be in a place where they're kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stuff is going on. No, we learned that I mean I learned that in 1994  1995 we started our first forums on NJ comm  The first the first sign of trouble  We started the forums people, you know, we have one for all the sports and my boss  Said we really wanted us to emphasize high school wrestling  And he was right because high school wrestling doesn't get the attention that football basketball and baseball get right so oh please for us  This is great, right and huge traffic was wonderful. And then someday and but we didn't we didn't know about moderation  This is 95 someday somebody comes in and starts a thread about coach nut grabber  We better watch this  And and so we hired moderators we didn't use all the stuff we learned and originally we thought that the moderator would be the  Host and also the person who killed stuff  Then we got on somebody who had experience with this at early Bolton boards and he said no  No, no, no, the mayor is not the cop who also kisses the baby. Yeah, that's right  By the way, since we're talking about Twitter and interactivity Tony Hale just tweeted they've added a new feature to Twitter blue. Oh  Which is top articles, which I think we all like  You can now get the top articles from the people you follow and also from the people they follow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's a way to expand out to the next oh, and this is what they bought when they bought nuzzle  Nuzzle had the friends they had and then it was friends of friends. So there's they're adding a nuzzle feature. So here it is  I just opened up my Twitter and I'm a Twitter blue as we all are the three of us  Twitter blue subscriber get more news people they follow expands your results showing the most shared articles from the people you follow  Plus the people they follow and you have to turn turn that on so I'll turn that I will  Yeah, oh, this is just like nuzzle now. That's hysterical  So nuzzle will have one more if they're gonna head all the nuzzle features. There'll be one more column  That's basically stuff that nobody else mentioned that is worth. Yeah a little editorial, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, do you think this is one of the stories in my feed how San Francisco became a failed city?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think it's a failed city? Well, this is a result to the election. We had yesterday the California primary  Their attorney general who was very progressive  Chase a Bowdoin got thrown out by a landslide which which is the polls did not predict by the way  They thought it was gonna be a very close race. It was not  I  Don't have enough to know about it. I do understand why the residents of San Francisco  Threw him out because he got the blame rightly or wrongly  For a very big rise in minor crimes smashing grabs  Smashing grabs  You know burglaries and of course the rise in homelessness downtown  Fentanyl abuse fentanyl deaths and he got blamed for all of that  So whether that that what I don't know is if that's accurate or not. He was very progressive his parents. He's a  Deputy public defender defender and his parents were radicals  So he came for fact there were some concern because his parents Kathy Booting and Dave Gilbert were weathered  underground members  And and when he was 14 months old they were arrested and convicted of murder in a Brinks robbery  She got 20 years to life. He got 75 years to life. He was raised by adoptive parents. Guess who Bernadine Dorn  So he was very radical  Very radical in his upbringing Bernadine Dorn another one well-known weather underground  member  So his is so he he came in saying we're gonna you know, we're gonna deal with this in a different way and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Weather but most of the complaints are smashing grab and public urination. Yeah about San Francisco, you know, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I tell you what it's bad  Lisa and I went to a  Michelin two or three-star restaurant downtown  Very excited beautiful restaurant lovely  But in order to get there we had to walk through a homeless encampment one block away from the front door  There was a guy defecating on the street, which really kind of put us off our dinner  5 p.m. And this is endemic downtown San Francisco and  It's a problem. I don't know if I don't I know it's not Booting's fault  Although prosecutions under him went down by about 50% so he said he wasn't gonna seek  charges for a lot of things like  You know minor drug offenses  Gang memberships he was he was you know trying to change things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And well, but it's it's the problem is if you go too far  I know this is way off the topic of the show, but overcorrect blue  But you end up in Rudy Giuliani territory with the broken glass  Yeah, so that yeah the squeegees guys on the street corner were a lifestyle problem for us  privileged people who had jobs and cars  But you go too far you arrest a lot of people they end up in jail for a long time for water

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Minor offenses although I got to point out  You know that broken glass theory was Malcolm Gladwell popularized popularized that and of course Rudy Giuliani  Giuliani  Ran on that if we if we fix the little things you know stop graffiti stop broken windows stop the squeegee men  everything  Gets better Northeastern did a study on it, and they said we've debunked it. It's not true. Yes. It's not true  so I don't know maybe there's debate in social science circles about it, it's

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cory Doctorow calls those just so stories  Where they're so neat and Pat and it makes so much sense and you read you know Malcolm Gladwell, and you go oh that makes so much sense  That's obviously true  But life is much more complicated. It's like filter bubbles. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now we're seeing that that no  Filter bubbles don't really exist another another favorite now people are going nuts with is that  the admission that  Studies that said that the time spent on screens  Was a cause of teen depression and stuff and now the data is saying it's a result of it perhaps  Well and or it may be more about what you're actually doing right and and so this is early days  We need the research we need the data  We need interpretation, but it's early days to think I found it  I know the cause and the root of all problems that's that leads to get ready and moral panic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have problems in this society and they may be bigger than anything that  District attorney can do or even a mayor can solve I mean London Breed or a mayor San Francisco is very good  But the homeless problem in San Francisco is virtually intractable, but it's always been Leo when I lived there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  San Francisco was the place dreamers came  at the end of the rainbow and  You always had more of that there than any other city  I've lived in New York has plenty of problems Chicago had plenty of problems  But San Francisco which is a true a huge population of people who  Ended up on the streets succeeding in society. Otherwise, right?  Yeah, and so it required put it an obligation of social infrastructure on the city

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is never Ronald Reagan when he was governor closed the mental institutions probably rightly  So his idea of creating many small halfway houses was probably the right thing to do but they never created the halfway

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but it also led to police dealing with mental health problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, and there is some evidence I think that the problem in San Francisco also comes from the fact that the police hate booting and  Have decided just not to do anything  Like they're just turning and by the way, this what happened in Uvalde is a crisis across the country apparently  Yeah, please turning their eye, you know their head away from crime  Because they don't like the administration or they don't like this or they don't like that  Or they don't like people calling to defund the police or for whatever. Yeah, but Dean said, you know one of his last  prosecutions he shut down a big ring of  People reselling stolen goods  He he uncovered it that DA's office uncovered it they couldn't get the police  To help them in the arrest they had to rent you halls  To go in and arrest Jesus. Yeah, the police said yeah  no, we're not gonna help you here because this you're just trying to score political capital before this recall and  So he had a rent you halls to do it. So there's a you know what life is complicated  It's it these just so stories are very appealing. It's wonderful to think. Oh, I know what's wrong. We can fix it  But it's it's it's a chaotic system  And it's not easy to know what the causes of things are. I mean income inequality is getting pretty bad in this country  Look at look at that. Oh, you know, you know, look at that  All right, boy we got philosophical fast on this Stacy wasn't here to stop us  Let's take a little break we've got lots more to talk about I might even do a change log I'm feeling frisky  Our  Show today brought to you by hacker rank  Between deadlines and frustrating interview tools that aren't doing the job for technical interviews  Conducting a technical interview might be the last thing you have time for but you know, it's the most important thing you do  But what was it like the last time especially now that you know, you're doing them over zoom  You spend the first ten minutes of your interviews just you know  Get the environment right to share code from a bunch of different documents  Wasting your time maybe even your candidates time hacker ranks got a solution hacker ranks a place people go to get jobs and to hire  The in technology it's a great place  I hang out there because they have these puzzles designed to help you do better with the interview process as a as an applicant  But I love doing these programming puzzles. There's so much fun. You can just do them for fun  They have developed something for the higher  The employer an IDE an integrated development environment for the tech interview process  So cool  With a set of easy to use interview tools. You'll quickly find the best developers for your technical projects  You get a pre-made question library with more than 2,500 questions. So you don't have to spend hours trying to think up  coding questions  You all the questions the best practices questions are in there a code playback feature  You know sometimes what you'll get the candidate to do some coding you want to watch what they're doing with the code playback  You can review their coding approach score their skill levels. You've got a built-in whiteboard  You both can see so if you want to try some collaboration stuff see how problems are solved in real time. It's all there for you  This is just one more reason you should check out hacker rank time to  Reboot your technical interview process with hacker rank click  interview done  Start using hacker rank for free today  Seeing how much better a technical interview can be reboot those technical interviews with hacker ranks easy to use tools  With a pre-made question library code playback built-in whiteboard  You'll be conducting better technical interviews and instantly identifying the right talent go to hacker rank  Dot-com slash twig to start a better tech interview for free today hacker rank H a C K E R R  Ank hacker rank dot-com slash twig  Thank you hacker rank for supporting twig and for those great problems  I love him and now back to scatting ARP slate meager and flam  Usually you just say scatting ARPs. I see that all the time scatting ARPs, but I love the full name  I just have to give them the full name New York State has passed the first ever right to repair law for electronics  There are other right to repair laws when I you know, I remember hearing there's dozens of these states that have been planning to do  this  the first  Well, yeah in a way the first for consumer electronics  Colorado passed and a much-needed right to repair law for  Electric wheelchairs  This was a big issue  For people in chairs, they couldn't fix their own chair  Sometimes you'd wait weeks or months for repairs from an off from into the official repairs  So Colorado fixed that New York State has just passed their fair repair act  Now it is a little limited it requires all manufacturers who sell digital  Electronic products in the state to make tools parts and instructions for repair available to consumers and independent shops  This is the kind of thing Apple hated lobbied against like crazy  It's a waiting signature by the governor. It'll take effect one year after it's signed. I  Fix it called it a giant leap for repair kind  but  It's interesting because it does have exceptions for home appliances  Medical devices you can actually almost see the money moving from lobbyists  Hands into the pockets of the State Assembly  home appliances  Medical devices medical devices like wheelchairs and all the premium tech and  Agricultural equipment, of course part of the right to repairs business fight with John Deere. Yeah  Yep  So Apple I guess just lost the lobbying paddle  They didn't pay enough to get the get exempted out of this Massachusetts has a law on automobile data  Colorado the bill on wheelchairs and now New York State for consumer electronic devices, that's a big deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a Leo. I should know this because I do try to watch various twitch shows, but there's so many of them  I miss it. Have you had have you tried to repair an iPhone? We did the whole so Micah so this was I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Used the term malicious compliance  That's like when you pay, you know, you have to pay a hundred thousand dollar tax bill and you give them a million pennies  a  Malicious compliance so Apple's got a you know self-repair thing. First of all, it's limited only to the very newest stuff  So it's an iPhone 12 or 13 with a brand new iPhone SE. That's it  But Micah happen to have an iPhone 12. I try I try to give him an SE said no, it's too old  I can't so he doesn't need a new battery in his iPhone 12. It's only a year old but he said alright  I'm gonna order a battery  you  You give you know the charge you more than a thousand dollars for  Two big cases worth 76 pounds of equipment. Yeah, it's gigantic. It's like crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Micah got it all now you're like you're a roadie  Taking a truck worth of sound equipment with young gear and stuff. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well and this is the same stuff that Apple uses in the stores. It's not necessarily stuff you need  I fix it doesn't they they've got kind of low-end ways of getting all of this done  But if you went to the Apple store, let me see if I can find this  Micah video because you wait till you see it. Was it under a tech break? Probably was right? Yes, sir. Yeah take break

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have somebody else's video on YouTube, but you won't like it. Yeah what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pocket operator for pixel we do a lot of tech breaks  Here we go god I didn't realize we had that many holy cow here we go  So here's the here's the equipment that Micah there's the cases  Okay, the big cases are as big as he are he is now you have seven days  You've got to return or otherwise they're gonna charge you more than a thousand bucks for this gear  So you know if you'd never use otherwise, oh, yeah, I mean you do you don't need this. This is a big press  One of them is a heater and one of them's a press  To put the phone back together again. That's the press looks like an espresso machine with a big lever  Because the phones glue together the heater loosens the glue so it's a little oven to loosen the glue  But here's the problem that and the battery were set sent separately the battery didn't arrive  The battery didn't arrive  One day goes by two three four five six seven on the seventh day  Micah calls Apple Apple says no no this is handled by spot a chemical spot  He calls spot spot says he says the battery hasn't come yet. They said well, that's not our problem  You have seven days if you don't return over to charge you  So it's the buck so we have all this stuff  But we don't have the one thing the two ounce part  That you need to fix it. I think Apple doesn't really care  I mean I think you can make a lot of excuses like well the battery's lithium-ion  So it has to be shipped separately blah blah blah. Yeah, here it is two hours left  But too late Mike is in the car because he doesn't want to have to pay a thousand forty nine dollars for this stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, do they charge did  Even forgetting the deposit for not returning it is there a fee for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's 40 not only go for this whole thing forty nine dollar rental and forty nine for the back it ends up  So he had it together. It's almost exactly what you would pay if you gave it to Apple to fix

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Coincidence I think you have a right to repair you wanted to repair it yourself

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just Apple's you know middle finger compliance yeah sure is  so  You know obviously our advice is don't you know get Apple to do it?  I guess if you were a third-party repair shop you would buy those tools  You probably already have them, but I think you have to have a separate set for each model by the way because it's all just exactly  So  No, you don't have to see this part of it  It's the only Apple had these tools for longest time until now you break high fix has means  It has the means to heat it up and pull it and if you go to iFix it to replace an iPhone 12 battery  They will sell you a battery and they will but you know it may not be from Apple right and they will sell you a little  Thing you put in the microwave oven a little bolster that you put on it to heat up the phone to loosen the glue they have  Little spudgers little picks that you pry the thing apart with and all that  So yeah, you can you can get the same stuff and it's cheaper. Let me see here's the iPhone 12  Let's see battery replacement  Difficulty moderate I think that's generous  You need a pentalobe screwdriver an eye opener a set of opening picks a suction handle a tri-point screwdriver a spudger  tweezers tweezers  But they you know to their credit. There's the eye opener that you put in the microwave to heat it up  Here's the suction cups to open it up  Would you want to do this yourself? Oh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what all of that Apple stuff done. I don't want to put a screen protector on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll have bubbles that screw it up, but you know you can do it yourself. There's some screws and  Yeah, you know let Apple do it, but that's the whole point isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd ask mr.. Burke to do it. I trust him. Yeah, let Burke do it. That's my motto

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I put I put up a video from from Mac rumors  Under that story on the rundown and so they got the battery and they're doing it and looks like hell looks like utter hell

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean Micah could have done it. He was a small. Yeah. He's got little fingers  So this is by the way. I'm at step 32  And I haven't even removed the battery

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So  You know yeah  Look at I love I fix it. God bless him that they've been making this available forever and  You know Apple now makes an official way to do it which seems to me to be kind of dragging your feet compliance  Yeah, the I think the verge did it everybody's done it now  This is this is otherworld computing. Yeah, yeah  I  Don't know this is Mac rumors. I was there advertiser. That's what I put up. Yeah, so yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you have it so you have a law now that says you have a right to repair, but it's it ain't gonna matter

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I wonder you know I mean with companies acting like this  Well, let's just compliance you know  Here's a law. I think should be passed globally Ontario Canada the province in Canada has passed a law to  Force companies to allow you to disconnect when you're off work  As of June 2nd employers in Ontario with 25 or more employees  Must have a written policy with regard to disconnecting  Disconnecting from work means not engaging in work related communications  Emails telephone calls video calls the sending or reviewing of other messages so as to be free from the performance of work  Yeah, just told those kudos

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are a lot of businesses we don't we don't expect you know  But there are businesses where if the boss sends an email out in the middle of the night you're expected to respond  Within an hour the IT guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or they should have to respond that's different. Yeah, it's different for those folks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know God bless him seen Jammer B came in the middle of the night  Sunday morning because our power went out and he had a reboot everything  right, so  Go ahead star star though. He's different. Yeah, I  Didn't make him do it. He just did it although. He just did it. It's a good thing he did  Yeah  It's his job he says  And here's another one Apple and not gonna be happy about but the EU is now mandating  USB-c for all phones show sold in the EU by autumn of next year  No, which USB-c well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you know no, there's all these different USB-c. Yeah, but they have a standardized that no I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mean there's Thunderbolt 3. There's Thunderbolt 4. There's us, but that's all about data  They've mandate that the hole and you have to have a charging  It has to be chargeable through that has to be able to charge  They're not saying it has to be Thunderbolt 4 USB 3 or anything like that  It's but you got to at least be able to charge it by USB 3. See  So that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's good, but I like how ray gun has in the IRC  So USB-c is already five years old seven years old once this goes into effect  Are we expecting another standard better not be a couple years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well never say never in technology, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right RS 232 C. I miss it I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Want a 29 pin port I?  Think it's safe to say USB-c will be around for a few more years  The thing is as we all have USB-c chargers and cables now right this laptop mm-hmm  Dell laptop doesn't come laptops for years had proprietary chargers even Dell now it just it's USB-g  I can run it on any USB-c charger. Yep my mouse yep  That's how it should be you're right. There'll be another standard

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but now they're gonna have to go but now it's hard enough to go through a standards process now  You're gonna have to go and get legislation written to permit a different plug when there's some functionality that you want I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This makes sense  Everybody has a USB-c or will from now on have USB-c chargers and cables

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should be in our industry the industry should have done this without legislation  They bought their own trouble by Apple particularly did this oh yeah if the industry had said  You know and they've got plenty of trade history did which for the most part remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was micro USB and they've that really was crappy almost everybody, but Apple's been USB-c for years  It's this is aimed at Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and so now if something better comes along there's a degree of difficulty of getting to it is now higher  This is one of those cases where it shouldn't have been legislation legislation should have threatened that Apple should have been

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Conceited that's a good point because it is let's say there is this new super port the good thing about USB-c is it has  transitioned  The other ant what's inside has changed considerably as you point out it used to be confusion. Yeah  Yeah, but not not overcharging the charging has been consistent, so I mean there's PD  So it has changed a little bit this quick charging and so forth  But the fundamental ability to charge that's been the same as long as that ports been around  So the data changes and this doesn't preclude that so if you want Thunderbolt 5 on USB-c  Presuming you can do it, but but USB-c is gone from I mean the type-c is gone from USB  2.1 to USB 3.1  3.2 Thunderbolt 3 Thunderbolt 4 which is USB 4 so it's handled  For major data's transitions without a problem. I think that's likely that'll be for a while  I see your point though  If somebody said well, I think the next big thing is is firewire  They couldn't they couldn't put it on a phone. I think a parallel port  Everything should be a scuse

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I had my Osborne one and I had a neck  Impact printer I was rewiring cables, and I'm not you are you soldering them. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you get the pinouts yeah, and you hope that you have different color wires for each one  Right you have a lot. I'm sure it's a bit of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mmm. I stayed away from never made cable. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm-hmm, but you did get up in the middle of the night when when duty called I  Did yeah, I know you know I know you do unfortunately. Yeah, yeah, unfortunately is right. Yeah  Let's see  Speaking of new rules  The SEC is investigating. This is a good article from a New York Times deal book  New rules a year after the meme stock frenzy now. They're not  going to  Say you can't buy GameStop  Stock they're not gonna say what you can buy or not, but what they are concerned about is what happened with Robin Hood a  number of retail brokers including Robin Hood during the  Rally when when GameStop is going up halted trading right or limited how many shares you could buy?  And  At some point I think some of them said you can't sell your shares and as the shares started to crash  That pissed some people off a number of hedge funds also lost a lot of money  So but they're not gonna outlaw meme stocks you can't right that's that's insane, but what they can push for is a  Change to the rules on something called payment for order flow  We talked about this is a complicated story I'm explaining to be forgive me for launching this I wish Stacy were here could blame her  Stacy what's payment for order flow cuz she's so good at that  She so I will pull a Stacy and try to explain we've talked about this before with Robin Hood  Why is Robin Hood free you might ask?  Right, how can you have a stock I mean in you know, traditionally when you buy stocks you'd pay a commission you'd pay  Commission, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All of a sudden along comes Robin Hood on the process. Yeah, it's not like instant either

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Along comes Robin Hood which people have celebrated because it democratizes stocks. It's free  I just like I want to assure that stock you pay for the stock, but you don't have to bear commission  Which makes it it's one of the reasons is volatility because it doesn't cost if there's if it doesn't cost you to do a transaction  You might buy and sell buy and sell buy and sell buy and sell  So how does Robin Hood make money and we talked about this a while ago on the show  They make money because they don't execute the orders  They sell the right to execute those trades to bigger firms to wholesalers like Citadel securities  they sell  So they charge a commission in effect not to you but to Citadel. Well, why would Citadel pay?  because  Now Citadel gets this happens all instantly right gets fast signals about stock movement and  can buy or sell on trade on their own accounts and  Make money because they have advanced warning that a lot of people are buying AMC  Hmm. So Citadel is in effect  You know  So the you met you have an advantage in the stock market if there's an information gap  If you know more than the other guy  You can make money  That's what they're paying for and that's what Robin Hood is using to fund their business  it is problematic because the information inequality is not between Citadel and  You know Merrill Lynch, it's between Citadel and you  right  so you're and in fact even Robin Hood users might be paying more for a  Share of that stock then they should be  because of this process  Citadel might in fact end up saying well the price for that stock is a buck thirty when it's really a buck twenty five if  You went some other way. So there's all sorts of  Problems it does disadvantage less well-informed  players

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How is this supposed to remedy that it makes it illegal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, but it would also probably put Robin Hood out of business  Or they would have to start charging for commissions for transactions  Brokers would need to develop new business models  Some major wholesalers told the Times that the SEC had refused their input  But the big trading firms argue the reported fix would only hurt the little guys  former SEC chief economist  SP Kotari told Dealbook the view is that payment for order flows somehow  Compromises market integrity, but the evidence shows retail investors are getting a good deal  Sure about that sure about that question yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Going way back you needed a  Street next to the wall where people traded stuff and you had to have somebody there to do it  Hence hence the name Wall Street as Wall Street, but there's no reason you need a broker

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Technologically today well yeah, what does a broker do you do because you have to have somebody who is licensed to buy and sell

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying  Technologically oh no, but there's no reason that's how it works a marketplace well. Oh, I see yeah. Yeah, you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just like you buy anything when you don't need a middle man. What do you say?  You don't need a middle man. You don't need a middle man right now  You do legally you have to you you pay a lot of money to have a seat on the New York Stock Exchange  So you can buy and sell stocks, but that's just an artificial construct

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  everything and it'd be like if you if you  Needed an agent to sell your thing on eBay. No you just go to eBay and you sell it directly okay? It's a marketplace, okay? Yeah  Me and if God help me NFTs

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so there is a good point which I guess Kotari is making which is  People who couldn't or wouldn't buy stocks in the past because of commissions  And commissions used to be a lot higher than they are this all of this has pushed the you know the  Commission is down anyway, and a lot of big brokers like Schwab now offer Commission free trading as a result just to compete

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was just gonna mention. I don't know if commissions wars the actual problem  I think it's easier now because you get to buy portions of shares. Well. That's yeah. That's another that's that's something

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That yeah, they do that's an interesting one too right especially if it shares thousand dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you have a thousand dollar yeah piece of I don't know say yeah  Nike or whatever right ever and you  Average average Joe probably can't afford it  But they want a piece of that pie and say you know let me send $20 here and $20 there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm honestly not I mean this is very elitist  But I'm not a big fan of people buying individual stocks and and it really comes down to that information  Disparity you just agree with you as an individual  I know and we don't have the information that institutional investors have and that's who you competing with and  I agree, and so I think you're regular folks should look more into one

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not gonna say cuz that would sound like I'm giving advice never mind. You can give advice just say

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm an idiot, so don't pay attention or something. That's what I say

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think is more along the lines of looking at different funds people look at index funds absolutely diversity yeah, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know I for in for investing in your retirement. I love the target date funds  Those those those do a pretty good job they rebalance your portfolios you get older to lower risk and all of that  But in any event you know that's always information is the whole thing  Remember what a great book  By Michael Lewis flash was a flash boys boys boys boys  It's just so brilliant yeah, and he talks about the the the the rush the race  to create a fiber optic line from the Chicago exchange the New York exchange, but  But fiber optics and speed of light right, but yeah  They were trying to create a path with it completely straight line  because a turn makes a little bit longer and  Millisecond a millionth of a second difference with  Computerized training can be the difference between winning and losing so if you could get a come of a completely straight  Shortest point but sure is distance between two points from the Chicago Board of Exchange to the New York Stock Exchange  Or actually it's not the New York Stock Exchange anymore as Michael Lewis pointed out some some place in some windowless building in New Jersey  But if you can get a straight  Shot you might have a millionth of a second advantage over somebody else  Which is enough for you to win to make money so the character the characters at the beginning of the book are just great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're literally going to people who own property to say can I dig a hole here?  Yeah, it's worth yeah to get the straightest line yeah  Which is to say that the Bloomberg and Reuters and those companies do not sell content they sell speed  Yes, and once once since the former head of Reuters used to say that after the first three  Milliseconds all of Reuters content is an aftermarket

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this also points out with something what I always have this debate that it isn't really about the quarterly report  Or you know R&D or any of the any of the numbers that we are always talking about  The value of the stock really is what somebody will pay for it  so having knowledge about what people what price people are paying a  Little early it's like knowing who's going to win the race a little bit early  You can lay a bet on that horse a millisecond before it crosses the line  No, no no no because it already crossed the line a millisecond before anybody else knows across the line  That was the whole that was the whole premise of that Paul Newman Robert Redford  movie  What was it was a great con it was wire wire right right right?  Yeah, is that they knew ahead of time who was going to win the race?  So they lay a bet and then the waste results would come in a second later, and I won  This is it was the same scam so you you win in the stock market now not staying the sting  You win in the stock market now not because you've been reading the financials very carefully  I mean you can I mean obviously that's what the Wizard of Omaha does but  You know Warren Buffett  But most but really what's really happening is these hyper fast stock trading and it's it's come done very very quickly and it's done on  Information and the information the only information that really matters is what people are gonna pay for this stock a second from now  Yeah, it's a bit speculative yeah, it's fascinating  But it's also why I think individuals I tell I mean I don't know I'm not giving you advice either. I'm an idiot but  But it's what I tell my kids because they have to listen to me is you can't win that one  Because you're you're not an institutional investor. You don't have a fiber optic line to the Chicago Board of Trade  That's right somebody doesn't like me it doesn't like this stop spreading false info says web 43 38  I don't know what which particular false false. Yeah, tell me what's false, and I'll tell everybody what you say  All transactions including computer trades have to go through a dealer  Didn't I say that I think I said that yeah, he did I was asking why that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right theoretically what that used to be the case what value do they actually have yeah  But they extract value the part of the point of this story is the middleman the deal of the middleman are as always are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Extracting value more than they're adding it he says you are misinformed. It's explicit in series 9 and 63 broker exams  In 1963 broker exams, okay, I think you're making it up now  Now I think you're making it up  Anyway the SEC takes it seriously they're about to  SEC's Gary Gensler is expected to preview new market rules  About a year after shares of GameStop and others shot up in the meme stock training frenzy is not to make those illegal  it's to and I knew when I  Launched this that is going to take a lot of explaining, but it's to stop  This payment on for order flow  And and it is controversial because it does allow  More people to get in the stock market  Which I would submit is is something on  That maybe should be phrased as allow more suckers to get in the stock market  It's something only only the guys the institutional guys want yeah, yeah, we want more suckers

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More people and it pushes their wallets bigger. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's even bigger deal. This is so exciting. Everything you're about to hear is gonna change your life  Google Fi is expanding coverage on the pixel with the Wi-Fi W plus network remember Google Fi  And I'm a Fi customer so actually this is meaningful to me Fi always as promised was with the right hardware  Your phone can use T-mobile  Sprint of course that's now merged Wi-Fi US cellular  Well now there is something this comes from Google's internal area 120 incubator called Orion Wi-Fi  If you are a venue with Wi-Fi, you know a coffee shop a concert venue hotel  You can sell your Wi-Fi capacity to sell your networks  Google's calling this a W plus network  And it is one more way that you can get  Bandwidths on your Google Fi phone  Google goes to businesses operating public areas  Telling them you can get a new revenue stream for your existing network  There's no you know capture portal or anything you just turn on Orion Wi-Fi monetization  they apparently you don't even need a new router or new software and  then  Google your Google Fi phone will automatically connect to Orion as a Wi-Fi thing  So I could walk into a coffee shop not even get a pop-up that says would you like to use our coffee shop?  The password or anything but the phone will know about it because they've signed up with Orion and  Your five phone will use it. I think that's a good idea  Kind of competes with Xfinity's, you know  Wi-Fi access points all over town thing Cox does that a few other cable price do right? Yeah, all right, right?  Beta number three for Android 13. I'm not touching it not going anywhere near it  Very happy with my pixel six plus on 12  Platform stability that is a important  Landmark in the development of Android 13, which probably will come out this fall  You can hear all about it on all about it. It's good to hear that. They said that keyword just just stable it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stabilization is just gonna be great and solid  I have to give me all of these bells and whistles. Just make it work. So platform stability it means

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

It's done  Yep, and so now you can start writing your apps with confidence. You don't have to make any big changes  But it does it's also a big step forward for 13 tablet users  Can now join the public beta as well. You have to have us one of these selected  manufacturers

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have we talked about the tablet market before?  Well on the Android side of things because it seems like iPad is just  Everywhere when when when you hear tablet is that they never say an Android tablet is always iPad  Like is this something that I will just let this go yeah, because I mean yes and songs are nice but  When people say tablet is it tablet is almost like the way  Tablet is almost like the way Xerox was synonymous with making photocopies. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I don't think yes you should not  Well, I'm prejudiced. I think I've had I think iPad is a tablet that is  Heads and shoulders above anything. I guess if you get the Samsung that says that's a pretty good tablet  The problem isn't the Samsung the hardware is great. The problem is the software and Android is just not good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying should Google just let that go well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They you know what that's what they announced at IO that they're oh we're gonna we're not gonna make a tablet  No, don't don't go crazy here, but we really think tablets are great on Android  And so Android 13 does have some things task bars for tablets  Has some things that will make apps that are designed for a smaller screen scale better on a larger screen  That was one of the problems with tablets a lot of Android apps would just be like a phone sized

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a little pot like a little tiny window. Yeah. Yeah, so I think Google's in two years

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're making noises that they really want to make this work. So I  Don't know put 13 on your tablet and see

Transcript:  Twitter survey you had us do where it was tell you this world leaders, you know  He's a world leader, but he's saying stuff. That's not true. Should you ban him?  All right, remember that right my gut feeling about it was  Twitter said oh we want to get your advice on what how to deal with this so we can change our policy  For world leaders, but my gut was it was more Twitter saying see this is so hard. You can't really blame us  Yeah, I think well it turns out they got  49,000 people  Taking that survey they had said, you know  We're gonna take this feedback under advisement  More than a year since they announced the survey they have done nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well right now let's give them a little a little bit because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Consideration they said consideration. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah Twitter spokesperson Trenton Kennedy would not comment whether Elon Musk's pending acquisition has had an effect on efforts to revamp  The world leaders policy, but he said the company is comment, right? Yeah. Well, they're working on it  He says they're still distilling the results of the survey  He ain't getting tequila buddy. I no matter how much you distill it and considering next steps  During this process. We've also engaged experts including NGOs governments academics and civil society  To ensure we're hearing as many diverse and thoughtful perspectives as possible. Where do you go to get civil society? They have a phone number

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does he say lots of people will claim to be representing in civil society  Really tons of organizations tons of oh, yeah tons of organizations. Well, how do they get off? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you got it you got a whole bunch of NGOs like if you want to find out what's going on that I understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pretty much. Yeah, okay more more civil society entrepreneurs. Yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Incorporated  Anyway  That's a they're not gonna do anything but  They did make us do the survey. So and we did it and it was fun and it was difficult and it was educational  It showed you how hard it is, right?  Nothing's first phone will come out July 12th  I'm sure Jason and company talked about this yesterday and all about Android. So a car  Carl pay who was the  founder of  OnePlus and kind of famous Mike marketing  Nutball, but made some pretty darn good phones in his time. He left one plus and he started  One plus went and merged with its parent company Oppo and he started a new company called nothing  Okay  Branding sure we weren't really sure what nothing was up to but it turns out  Nothing is gonna release a phone the nothing phone  It's our first smart phone and our most important product nothing said in its announcement the real start of nothing's journey to me  To make tech fun again and an invitation to unlearn everything the industry has taught us. Have we learned nothing?  the phone  the phone  It was actually we're showing it off at Mobile World Congress  So we kind of had a thought they might be doing this phone will be powered by Qualcomm a Snapdragon  it will run nothing OS very lightweight a  Modified version of Android the company says captures the best features of the OS and distills it to just the essentials  Essential wasn't that another phone company? That was another phone. Yeah, they went out of business Andy Rubin's essential  Oh, yeah, the platform this sounds a lot like that by the way, Andy Rubin leaves Google  He's the guy invented Android kind of start a company. This is gonna be so exciting. I bought an essential phone  Yep, that's it  The platform's in parachute though. Yeah. Oh he did. All right. Yeah, the platform's interface will feature  bespoke fonts colors design elements and sounds as well sounds like they got Johnny I've under the hood there  live event in London live stream the website, you know what I  Jury's still out could be great  It just worries me it reminds me a lot of the essential phone which I did buy  Didn't I give it to you and who did I give that to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, somebody not me sir. Yeah

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should mention paskey real quickly. This is something Apple talked about Monday on its WWDC event making it a complete  Hat trick because Microsoft's been talking about and Google's been talking about it  This will kill the password  Hallelujah  Come with iOS 16 and Mac OS Ventura. The idea is  That you will log in to your phone  Proving you are you and then from then on whenever you go to a website  It'll just say oh hi Leo and let you write in no more passwords. It's more secure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fishing proof because your phone is is linked to your computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well because also your phone  Has fingerprint or face ID and so it really is using biometrics to a certain ascertain that you are you and if somebody steals your  Phone they can't unlock it  Right. That's the theories. Well, they can't even unlock it  It's a new digital key tied to your biometrics  To create a pass key use touch ID or face ID to authenticate on a website and you're done and from then on  You when you log in the site again pass keys allow you to prove who you are by using your biometrics face ID  Fingerprint you don't have to type in a pass phrase  This is this is basically huge. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  guess if  If you try to use your your fingerprint on the phone so many times and it fails to read it  It usually forces you to put in your pass phrase. Yeah, right  So then you would so if you have to do that, I guess there's some signal that says okay  This phone was a lot but it wasn't unlocked with biometrics. No, I don't know no no no if you can unlock it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure that that counts  It's okay. I was curious but what happens you go to that site. It then says let's let's see you. Oh, yeah good. That's you  So you're still gonna still gonna do the biometrics each time. It sounds like I gotta do it  Steve Gibson raised the issue. Oh  That's all well and good but what will happen if you decide I don't want to use an iPhone  I want to use an Android phone. Can you export that or you have to start over?  Apple's I am told by one of our listeners that Apple did address this at WWDC  Later yesterday and said there will be a way to export your pass keys from your iCloud stored in iCloud  So if you can export it and import it somewhere else and it is an industry wide standards the Fido Alliance  So that may be the most important thing Apple announced on Monday  I mean they was just in passing but that's huge right was there anything to stop  Google Android from doing the same thing. No Google's already said they're gonna do it  And Microsoft has said they're gonna do it. So you got the big three. Oh  That's why it's a big deal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  Let's see good article in tech dirt today about the new mayor your new mayor well, it's not your mayor is he

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he kind of is you work. Yes. He is because I'm gonna city employees

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, Eric Adams mayor of New York City has paused  the city's affordable broadband plan  They had planned the city had done a lot of research they'd planned to spend  2.1 billion dollars to make sure everybody in New York had access inexpensive access to high-speed internet  Saving on average a customer of $40 a month  Would expand internet access to 1.2 million households in New York City  Carl Bodie writing in tech dirt makes the probable  accurate assumption that it was the  Phone companies like Verizon who got to the city and said oh, you know, you don't want to compete with us  Do you that's why that's the argument against all municipal Wi-Fi. Yeah, Philadelphia whether that year. Yeah, you don't want to compete with us. Do you?  Verizon of course has not you know been a very good  Incumbent in New York City. There's a story supposedly the last payphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was hauled out of yeah, we did that last last week. Yeah, but then it turns out there's more payphones still around

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, they're just not owned by the city  Yeah, it's kind of a shame this was a I think a historic plan but  The phone companies don't like it when you compete with them  So  Never mind. Never mind. You like those scooters Bird is laying off almost a quarter of its staff  Meanwhile electric scooters are getting a second chance in some cities as the New York Times and the New York Times is on it  I remember when the first bird scooters showed up in San Francisco  They littered on their own  Strew everywhere they were strewn everywhere you would trip over them. I saw I went to a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook f8 and San Jose and they were just there. They got run over three times. They were thick there. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, you know, that's why I think companies are struggling a little bit  but apparently the New York Times says  We rented scooters in us in LA in Santa Monica  And they had a no-go zone  So you go you can ride your scooter up to the the beach area the boardwalk and it just stopped

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't go Wow. Yeah, they've geofenced the geo fence it off Wow. They literally fenced it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chicago among the places that have required people to lock scooters to bike racks or other fixed objects instead of just  Lying them on the ground New York has pledged dedicated lanes and parking zones for scooters. I  Don't know. I think there are people who love scooters people who you know, we shouldn't have to have a car to get around a city  We do have mass transit, but a lot of cities don't have great mass transit including LA nope

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So but I like LA this is a city. Yeah, LA distances don't work with a scooter. That's true  You can't yeah, we go from Pasadena to Santa Monica. No, I'm working on a work. Well, you know, that's different

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll use it in downtown  or San Francisco Adobe Max

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Oh, you know, I've written scooters around the city. Yeah, I mean I feel dopey riding a scooter at my age

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not a good I would totally do it now considering this almost seven dollars a gallon here, that's true. That's true  I've almost told the hardheads the old dad might be on that scooter, but they're lucky  I'm a little too heavy for him just a little can I do a number Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure, I think I know which one of these you're gonna do you probably do know this I have this you have others

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want to steal, you know, it's a valuable  number for you a  Google employee named Emma Haruka  has calculated  Pi to the 100 trillions digit farther than any human for  100 trillions and by the way, it's a little disappointing she got here the computer ran for months  Finally got to the 100 trillions digit and you know what it was zero  Please well that doesn't count right? No, it counts because there's something after it if there were nothing after it. Maybe not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it possible that you is it possible that you could get to the end of 200 triumphs? We actually saw pie  No, how do we know that you can't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an irrational number  How do we know? Okay, that's a good question  How do we know?  That Pi is irrational. That's an infinitely repeating number. I think we do I think somebody proved it, but I don't know  I'm not a mathematician. I'm not either  They did sort of expect someone in the chat will tell somebody the chance that did they check her work?  Yes, they sort of did they spot checked it by checking some of the digits prior to the obviously you can't check the final digit  She had in 2019 calculated 31 trillion  Digits, which was a record at the time Pi has been 20 percent time. Yeah, my personal passion  Proof that Pi is irrational. There it is. Thank you. It was proven in the  1700s says jammer be  Okay, Wikipedia says it was proven in the 1700s 1700s of Pi is irrational  This is interesting Google will not say how much it cost it is a demo obviously  Of Google's compute engine. That's what she used listen to how much computation though. It took 157 days  128 thousand no, I'm sorry 128 virtual processors  864 gigabytes of memory and here's my number of the week  82,000 terabytes of data  Which is the same amount of storage as two thousand five hundred ninety eight years worth of HD movies. Oh  Jesus  Who does HD anymore? Let's get an up-to-date number Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now if you put every number on top of each other in 12-point type, how far would it reach?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Far would it reach?  Wow, did the calculation using a freely available program called why cruncher?  Worked with its creator Alexander Yee to verify the result is correct  Also used an algorithm that makes it possible to generate specific digits of Pi without knowing the previous ones letting your verify  That some of the final digits are correct  So she did check her work  Wow, and Google said go ahead and do it. It's a great ad for Google Cloud compute  She's a developer advocate  She loves Pi  What do you think about this I don't know enough about it Jeff to have an opinion there's a youtuber  Jordan shanks, he's a comedian in Australia who's been posting videos  critical of the former deputy premier of New South Wales John Barry law or Laura borrow Laura bar  John Barry Laro  Who sued and  Didn't sue the comedian. He sued Google sued deep-pocketed Google because the comic has no money  Saying you should have taken this down  He won federal court justice Stephen Rears in Australia ruled that Barry Laro had been left  Traumatized by a campaign of relentless cyberbullying by Jordan shanks. He uses the on on screen name of friendly Jordy's  Google had failed to adhere to its own policies by doing nothing to prevent mr.  Hanks mr. Shanks hate speech cyber bullying and harassment ordered Google to pay  $715,000 a figure which could rise if a costs order is made against the tech company  So that's that's just punitive damages. I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so it  worries me  In the US right now. We'd be protected against that to an extent we would believe with  Sullivan case which says you have if you're a public figure you have to show actual malice and so on so forth  But look at the Johnny Depp Amber Heard  case  Where they determined actual malice to the to the tune of 12 million dollars or I guess the punitive is 10 million  Whatever it was it was a lot of money and  Now there's a guardian story saying that Google may not have to pay because US law would be  Ruling in some cases here. I don't understand how that works  I don't get that but the fear is you have you have in the US you have  Justice Thomas has been shooting  Scuds across the bow of Sullivan again and again and again because the right wing wants to punish big media  And make that what's right wing doing now whether it's abortion or anything else  They want to let loose the dogs of lawyers on people as a way to chill  Criticism and so I fear  That this will be a preview of losing Sullivan in the US and if politicians can sue  And even they don't win right slap stuff even if they just take you to court and the lawyers cost you a fortune  If their cases are not thrown out  Because they sue critics. Oh man. We're we're we're even more doomed than we already are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a good case for us because it's Australian  We don't know what the politics of it are with the Barry Laro's politics are what friendly Jordy's was up to he accused  Barry Laro of lying to  Anti-corruption committee conducting extramarital affair  Barry Laro did sue the comedian who settled in November last year. Sorry. Thank you  Provided an apology and edited the videos. So he went after Google after he went after the comedian  In a scathing judgment  The judge said shanks had run a relentless cyber bullying campaign against Barry Laro which caused him to leave public office  Prematurely now, I don't know. Maybe the guy was a horrific troll  Maybe I don't know. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but when you protect speech you protect the worst of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's our but it does sound malicious. I mean it sounds like it could have been malicious

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Might have been yeah, and then and then and then he might well have lost in the US courts  I don't know. Yeah, but I'm still I'm just I'm being more generic in my worry

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, interesting case. Yeah, maybe some of our Australian listeners will explain maybe there's some there's probably  More when they get up there's a lot more to this that we don't know about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want to look at  The greatest

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The trippiest tech glitch ever. Yes, we can wrap this up with the trippiest. Oh wrap up already. Yeah already  Like I said, yes time time for God. Joy baby. It's got you a baby time  So this is a what was this a conference? Yeah, and there's something to try caster  Yeah, I can make this happen right now right here  There's really only four people on stage  but there's something went wrong with the screen and  I hope you're not an epileptic cuz that's seizure material.

They're not fancy  They don't they don't make you go through eight pages of other things you could buy from them  For instance when you buy a domain name at hover you get who is privacy built in you don't have to pay extra for that  Because when you register domain name your your name address and phone number public information  So you want to have who is privacy they know that so they just provide it if you're if you are this is a campaign  I've been on lately  In the radio show if you live on email females important to you  I get so many calls on the radio show for people say I can't get on my email account  I had one woman who who something went wrong with her gmail account  She went down to the gmail office in Irvine and banged on the door and I said do that help  She said no nobody's gonna fix it because it's free  I get people saying my aol accounts not working anymore my yahoo account if  Email is important to you. You should pay for it  Now the good news is with hover you don't have to pay a lot plus your email is not some you know  Gmail at gmail.com or at yahoo.com. It's your domain name. It could be your family name your business name  Your nickname your handle whatever you want it to be so it's really personal if you're a pizza parlor you can get you know  Geno's pizza  Geno's dot pizza and have email Gino at Gina's dot geno's dot pizza. I mean that wouldn't that be great  Wouldn't that be great?  Hover can tie your domain name to your email so that when it were renews your your domain renews your mailbox renews  It's a no-brainer solution for business owners  You really need to have your business name in your email address easy to set up  You can add as many mailboxes to your domain as you need  And it's you know it works with web if you want to use your web or any email app  It's imap a real imap email and they have a web interface  I think hover email is a great solution for people who are struggling with their email  But there's so much more you could do with your own domain name. You got a blog well  You got to have your own  Hosting name right you got a portfolio or an artist a photographer definitely I have leo.camera  For my pictures building an online store. Yes, I got it hover of course I did  Maybe you just want to make a more memorable redirect to your linkedin page looking for work. You know  Hire me.com something like that the prices are great too very affordable you get pro level tools  If you are an expert in DNS, I do all my own DNS at hover.com  But they also have hover connect which works with many services you just a couple of clicks and you're connected  So your website goes to your new domain. It's private. It's secure. It's fast. It's easy and at hover  You are a customer not a source of data  So take back control of your data with reliable  Tracker free email from hover and a domain name from hover. I own dozens of domain names  Look at all the TLDs now finance financial fish Leo dot fish  fishing  Fun I do have lottle fun. Hello TL dot FUN. I do have that I love that  So just go on and on and on I when I was gonna do a podcast called Leo on the line  Lotl I immediately you know anytime. I have an idea I register the domain name and hover. It's affordable. It's easy  Auto-renew makes it simple and it's completely secure and private plus you get email  And hover you're not a source of data.

It started by  The whole team is all black dudes  The CEO is a black dude and they put this thing together and I thought it was I thought it was an interesting idea  but yes  But the first thing that popped in my head is an experience that I had  several years ago at CES I was in a Lyft and  the Lyft driver was  Being idiotic on the streets and we got pulled over  Okay  so  when we got pulled over my first instinct is I need to have my phone open and record him because this was this could have  Been really really bad because he was swerving and just being idiotic on the streets  so I had my phone out and had it recorded just to protect myself and  Just just human nature  the police  Officers they came up and they were quite belligerent about my phone and I told him look  I'm just trying to make sure I I don't get into any type of mess that that I can't prove  You know and they were I'm thinking with well like this  Right, so I'm thinking if I had an app like this  Does this make the police officers more belligerent? Oh, I guarantee you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Having a lawyer on the line on the other hand  If they're intelligent right they might have to moderate their belligerence a little bit because you got your lawyer on the line  Yeah, so I guess it depends what your experience has been up to now, you know, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought it was a good idea  But at the same time that was the first thing that popped in my head when it was shared with me was how those cops were  Yelling at me for having my phone out. That's how I need to see your hands. It's what they kept saying  I need to see your hands sir and both of them came over to my window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Minnesota where you're allowed to practice law is an issue too. Yeah, that's probably why they probably need lawyers in various states to make  It work. What a good idea working on the rule. It is a great turn signal without an a turn signal without an a there's a guy on  tik-tok who a white guy  He's a black guy would not get away with this he constantly appears to be the whole count  I forget the account name, but he goes and he's recording cops and  They always get pissed or though they always do but every time he shows it they're getting pissed off and asking for his identification  He said and he just quotes a lot of them and says unless you have cause for me saying that I've broken the law

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, and he hangs for my minute fifth amendment. You won't carry. Yeah, but it is scary. I was very proud of Henry  I've told this story before he when he was in college  There was a protest going on and he went out to take pictures of it  I think for the campus newspaper and the police sat him down and said give me the camera  I want to erase that and he said no, I have the right to take these pictures  This is this is protected a protected activity  I'm newsgathering and the police made him sit there and cool his heels for quite a while  But they did not take his camera and he ended up going home with those pictures  They will intimidate the hell out of you and you know what if I were black  I'd be very nervous that they might do more to be honest.
