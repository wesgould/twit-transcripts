Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You may remember Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So thank you for that bit of technology help

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's glad you did that because I don't have anything to talk about today really  See I got one  All right, so start with Stacy and then we'll rotate through and you guys could pick the stories we have a list of stories  It's just none of them are inspiring

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not true that I'm just gonna disagree with you so fast company did a story I think it's on here  about  Google's a tap and Dan Kaufman who is the yeah, that's their advanced technology  Group right project something something group  But inside that and this was a epic story like two or three thousand words even this is our friend Harry McCracken who wrote this  Yes  Which he buried the lead damn it  There's they're looking for or they're building us  A house mouse that's what it's called  Control that you can use to point at things to turn them on or in a kind of super fun things that uses Google lens  to understand like the picture on a CD which granted no one has those but  You hold it down. It's like oh  This CD and then you point it to your speaker the Q cat. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's good you and then it plays you say throw it over there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and you can use this so it's it's basically a way to add a little bit more  Context to what you're trying to control without you having to be like like in my house right now because I haven't optimized things yet  It's still like hey gee turn on the blue  Shade chrome lamp and you know, that's that's just stupid  But I could just point at it and click or just say turn on lamp  And this is where I think Apple's going actually with some of the stuff they're doing with  Ultra wideband and find to stuff in their phone and what Google's also trying to do with projects only  So I just thought this was really neat one cuz smart home, but two who doesn't like reading about a tap

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now with something like this you're carrying around an extra dongle or you just carrying around your phone  It's I didn't quite you would have no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a dedicated device that would the ideas they wanted to create like how the mouse opened up the user interface for  computers for so many people thanks to the mice the mouse and gooey's  they're hoping to do this with like assistance and  Control of all the other computers around us

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Honestly with solely you wouldn't need a device if you had a solely sensor or a series of sensors watching  Your movements. Why is this guy isn't solely using like IR?  Solely is in the front of it's the face recognition in the front of the pixel  But it's also the thing that does the gestures remember those gestures

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's right LIDAR okay, no, it's I think it's radar radar

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well similar technologies bouncing something off of something to see where it is in space  So that's they've got the solely chipped down pretty small which means it's also probably fairly cheap to make  So I would bet they wouldn't I mean who needs one more thing to lose  My I mean my remote control  Table is pretty full right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Remember when I got back from Harry Potter world and I wanted to use my Harry Potter one which by the way is behind me  Yeah, but you can't do anything with it  So I know so I I wanted to have like the ability to point to that things and say  You know when guardian lady

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's so cool at the amusement park because they have special areas so you can go  You know you know Axia or whatever and then window shade will go up and stuff like that  So it's kind of fun in the park, but you get home, and then it doesn't do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Stacy's home is like a park it is like an amusement park. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a great actually. Thank you for mentioning this because I wanted to give Harry credit  Harry's been on our shows many times  And he's he's a really great writer and obviously got an invitation to write about a tap  So and it's a great story all sorts of interesting technologies is that mouse for your house. That's the one you're most excited about Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean I you know it's it's right in my wheelhouse

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah, the way that that device would use Google lens as well to do the recognition  So it's a lot of technologies Google has kind of rolled into one  It's interesting  Mrs.. Stacy they got to do something with it. Yeah, well now. That's the sad thing remember. That's the story of Xerox park  They invented the future and then didn't know what to do with it  That's sometimes the case with these R&D things so go ahead and you had a question for Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was gonna ask it would she be against using an existing device using your phone or using your mini tablet in this scenario

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I never have my phone on me  So  Like ideally I would have the only thing I have on me as a Fitbit or a wearable like you know  So if they could put things in the wearable sure but otherwise just having something  That's why my smart house actually has buttons everywhere right like there's little day. We know how to use buttons  Well, it's just it makes it more accessible like some people don't have a phone right or if people come into your house  And they want to control things, but they that's why it should be your phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Coming in my house controlling my things it should know who I am but it has a point  You know the new iPhone has the UWB ultra wideband  Chip in it the u1 chip in it and I imagine all phones will some point have chips that are directional  That do exactly that kind of thing but yeah  Right. Yeah, it's like yeah, okay. I was saying it's a separate device the phone could also yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, but this is also an a tap project so right integrate it into a phone one day

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean this is not like they're thinking all different things  I hope I would hope you know we kind of talked about this on Sunday you were there this we can attack  I would hope I asked the question and actually we got a great kind of synthesis from Phil Libbon about it  I asked the question are companies coming up with AR glasses because this is what consumers want or because they're desperate to find the next  Thing and they're just throwing spaghetti at the wall, and I wonder is a tap. What do you vote?  about that question  I  Think it's because they're throwing spaghetti at the wall. Yeah, I vote spaghetti too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I vote spaghetti, but think about where we are with all of these smart devices right now think about  When Amazon came out with that smart speaker and people were like why would I yell at my speaker, you know just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know I'm gonna revise my opinion of echo and the other smart speakers at first. I thought this is the next interface  This is the next big thing that voice interface will be very important and huge  I really thought it would be I don't see that happening at this point. No, I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you see where are you spaghetti or no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  First I think it's spaghetti but so I think it's spaghetti, but I think it's spaghetti in the sense like  In the right doing it in the right way, which is hey, we have all this technology available to us  Let's play let's make something fun. And then let's see if it works, which I don't think is feels like a tap is a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  more like that  Yeah, but I think Apple and all these companies drive towards Google Glass is an example towards AR  Glasses isn't really driven by consumers saying you know what we really would like  It's a smartphone we wear around our eyes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but Henry Ford, you know if I had asked people what if they wanted they would have said faster horses  Right, so yeah, I would say there's room for spaghetti

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to innovate and if you're big enough company with enough resources, you can try a lot of things  I just there are a lot of cautionary tales like Xerox Park where you know where they came up with they invented the mouse  That's where I saw I actually Doug Engelbart invented the message sri same idea though  Which was these these R&D think tanks often came up with great ideas that they never capitalized on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have the idea factory at a bookshelf behind great, which is all about Bell Labs. Yeah, it's a good book

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep, great great book. Yeah, and we wouldn't have unix without Bell Labs  We wouldn't have a lot of the modern, you know  a lot of server technology we have a lot of a lot of the modern technology rely on came out as  Bell Labs, so isn't really they didn't come up with good stuff. It's just that  Like park invented the GUI. Yeah, but they never did anything with it took Apple coming along saying hey, yeah, that's pretty cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's do that Bill Gross an idea lab did a study of  startup companies and looked at various factors of what made them successful or not and  I'll cut to the chase. It was timing. Of course. It's the guy who is the guy who created pets.com  Yeah, and it was too soon. Yes and lost out on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chewy right and now that concept is actually back

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's back right to see litter through the mail  Meanwhile bills the one who basically invented the the Google lab model

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it's timing. Yeah, it's more than timing but I think it is it is but as a major fact  It is an idea whose time has come right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are lots of actors or everything is in place that it can work before used to what they're ready for it's but I  Interrupted you you were you start on a are I asked about spaghetti you were headed towards something else

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think I got where I was going and if I did okay, good, then it's too late now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the old people show now. We're like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Antoinette what time is it? Did I tell you about that time? I got cake. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google is now  Reportedly facing antitrust probes in every state but one this is from gizmodo  Ongoing investigations by the federal government and almost every state California's launched its own antitrust probe into Google  Politico citing three people with knowledge of the new inquiry  Reported late last Thursday that the italic the California Attorney General had opened the antitrust probe  This is the problem. I think a lot of these are kind of in secret until they decide to do something with it, Alabama  Is the only state?  Not known to be investigating Google's practices and they're probably considering it  Is that wild? That's a tough situation for a company where you have one country, but 50 individual jurisdictions  That are equally important. It must be different must get complicated

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's when they stop like  Forcing or stop going against what is the word I'm looking for?  Stonewalling on things like privacy. It's when individual states start making their lives true. They're like, ah crap  Now we got to really do something. Yeah GDPR was a good start

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the it ended up being the California Privacy Act seems to really well in Texas and Illinois both had biometric security laws

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that were kind of they didn't really affect them, but  So, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Google has paid the EU a five billion dollar fine for antitrust  That was a couple of years ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and they did actually this last week said one of it they were going to not use your Fitbit data for  advertising right in an update for the  acquisition of Fitbit which  It feels like most people in the media feel like the deal is done because I'm constantly reading about Google's acquisition of Fitbit

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It hasn't happened. It hasn't still it still hasn't happened. Oh, that's interesting  But yeah, but the viewers that was to get through you. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Totally and I don't think Google wanted it for that data. Anyway, they don't want to use your fitness data for advertising  They want to use fitness data to like become your health  records repository and  Yeah, like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, is it my imagination geolocation? Yeah, that's a lot. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But everything on your phone is that valuable  You know every app on your phone that has those permissions is that valuable not not if you don't carry your phone with you everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My mind I can't go I can't go anywhere without my glasses or my phone. Yeah. No, I feel the same way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is so this is why voice is so great to me and like y'all y'all are talking about how you're over voice  I am so not over voice because that means I can do things without actually having my phone in my hand and  Since you know still women's clothes do not all have pockets  Why where am I gonna carry my phone? What is it the their point to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do the sign of the crosses wallet?  spectacles I  Can't keep I can't gonna say it  I go through a version of that every time I leave the house I pat my  My pants for the wallet pat my jacket phone keys are in this oh, this is why I've never heard it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't know this one it come it comes from  The sign of the cross, you know the Catholics do and it's so it was a mnemonic for young Catholic schoolboys to remember the order  It's a little dated because I don't think people carry pocket watches anymore everything else they still have

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I think yeah, we're getting more and more  You know I all the things you have to pat to make sure you leave the house  And then if I I mean if I left the house without my phone, I would turn back  There's some things I wouldn't turn I typically do yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I have to have the phone and quite frankly the only reason I do turn back for my phone  Is because I'm listening to podcasts while I'm commuting to wherever I'm going  If it wasn't for that I would I would leave it behind and wouldn't really I'm worried about missing an important text message or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I miss important text messages all the time nobody  Yeah, I've trained everyone in my life to just be like they call they call Andrew if they need me there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they call they call Lisa if they need me. Yeah  Like for instance just got a message Lisa's ordering Italian for dinner  What would I like see if I if I hadn't checked I would have missed that if I didn't have my phone

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you should get all of those notifications anyway on your watch right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, why didn't I oh you know why cuz I silenced my watch cuz otherwise it goes bing dong bing  vibrate buzzes  It doesn't want some point of wearing it though. That's the point well. Are you saying if I silenced this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He is a podcast professional so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Into the studio I tell everything shut up

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got a story. I like a story. I like yes, please I beg of you a  huge  Amazing into my mind upgrade to Google Ngram  This takes a few minutes to go through  But if you go and look at all the things you can now do what is Google L Graham  Google Ngram takes the history of books from from I don't know when like the turn of the century and  has  1800 and has all of their words in it the senses in it and then you can look at instances of this over time  It's actually right so good. It used to be fascinating just for  We've played with it a lot on this show entities right so they've added all kinds of things which also indicates to me  How smart Google is about the language so one thing that's fascinating to me is that you can ask?  about words as verbs or

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nouns give me an exit. Give me a set. Give me a host do host

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Underscore all caps verb host underscore all caps noun I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think so I'm saying so I'm saying that I want to use the word host as a verb versus the word  Host as a noun and it versus or both of those it'll give me two two two

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You see when people started ruining the language about 1960 there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you can do as a noun and partner as a verb because that is like the worst oh good  That's a good one partner. Okay, so when I host a show

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really a bastard ization of what should have been a noun. I am the host I am what am I doing a host?  I'm playing host that's what do Google is a noun or a verb  You want to do the case okay, it's case Google  vibe  So Google as a thing as an as a pretty much the same time

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  Yeah, this isn't a problem, but it was the issue of the excerpts that they were  publishing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you could see how presidents have been written about this is what starts the sentence or ends the sentence  So it's a start and end tag

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is really  So do researchers now I know you teach data at the  Qt, right? I mean that's data journal. Yeah, it's a big thing. This was the kind of this is one of the kinds of tools  They might use

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now is there a tool?  Like this that's pulling from the fire hose of Twitter. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Terminer let's or data miner. Should we talk about data miner? Oh  There's a story. There's a story is right from the ripped from the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Useful this particular time of year, you know  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so the fire hose very few people get the fire hose because it's a lot if you could get all the Twitter stuff and for a  long time  People wanted it  This is the big story  Having to do with a fire hose one of its partners partly owned by Twitter is called data miner  And as Phil Libbon said on Sunday, the name should tell you something about what they're up to they have  The fire hose intercept had this story  that police  used data miner which helped which will sell its insights to law enforcement and others to  Monitor the protests that were sweeping the country after the murder of George Floyd  so that they could find hot spots and  Then Twitter said well, no, they were just doing news alerts  but  it's kind of  Distinction without a difference  it also  an important  Issue because Twitter has in the past is in 2016 for instance  told  Congress that they would not do this  They said in a letter to the ACLU saying the use of Twitter data for surveillance is strictly prohibited and that this is in  2016 data miners product does not provide any government customers with any form of surveillance  VP of Twitter Chris Moody wrote in a company blog post in 2016 using Twitter's public APIs or data products to track or profile  protesters and activists is absolutely unacceptable and prohibited and yet  There seems to be some evidence. That's exactly what  Data miner was doing and selling that information to police  or monitoring protests

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So with that said what's the next step then if this is proven to be the case, what is the next step?  Good question. They either

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stop or they pull the feed, but I don't know if they would do that. What's wrong though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with police looking at Twitter and  Saying well, we just want to see where the next protests are so we can make sure  We have law enforcement there to keep the protesters safe. It doesn't mean keep people safe  We're not going there to arrest them. What's wrong?  Why shouldn't law enforcement be able to use the Twitter firehose and any data mine from it to help keep people safe?  Isn't that okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This because we talked about it on Sunday

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Better please Phil Phil Libbon had an excellent distinction

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He said actually that was that that was actually  Well, and you follow that and Phil yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you follow you and Louise followed it up with this this court decision about the use of FLIR technology  Going back to I think was your 2000

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so Libbons Libbons  comments were basically that  When you have all of the computing power of it Twitter or AWS or whatever at your disposal  You're no longer using  human surveillance capabilities and our laws and  Are only designed for protecting or sorry  When you go to that level it is unreasonable. So people pre human not capability  Yeah  It gives you a superhuman ability that is unfair and police should not have the ability to do that  And then we were saying that's a good point  But currently our laws don't really recognize that and then we started talking about some of the legal frameworks that exist which are all about  Fourth Amendment search and seizure issues

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is actually a really good discussion case went back to 2001. They were surveilling what they thought was a marijuana grow operation  Using infrared cameras thermal technology the theory being if you're doing if you're growing pot  You'll have hot lights and you know growing, you know the grow lights  And in fact, they were able to observe a hot spot on this fella's roof using that FLIR technology  they didn't have a warrant and  the  The arrestee  Appealed it all the way to the Supreme Court  Where they ruled that authorities scanning a home with an infrared camera without a warrant is  Unreasonable search as barred by the Fourth Amendment  They said  There's an expectation of privacy and  Because the imaging provided by the camera revealed details that would not previously been knowable without physical

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Intrusion so this is a big deal this is that's a different that but I don't see how that's a precedent here because this  Is not about privacy. It's things that have been said in public, but it's to Stacy's points is superhuman  It's that case that's the test for surveillance isn't a drug sniffing dog

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's interesting bounce. Yeah, right. Well, and that's that's what our argument  This is an interesting case, but it doesn't it's not really applicable here  We need new cases and we will see them you see them already like with cases going for the I  Don't know why I can't like words but the infinite  Searches for like geolocation data on people near a crime. So like police officers petitioned at Google for that  Expeditions. Yeah. Well, what is it? It's not fruit of the poison tree fishing. Yes fishing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  fishing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fruit of the fishing pole. See Stacy hangs out with us. She just gets old and forgetful. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cake Stacy, did you I didn't I I asked I put in a request for coffee though, cuz I am definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When's your birthday you'll get some for your birthday

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  April 12th, it's so far away  coffee sooner

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now Fika Friday is you know on Friday? Oh, yeah Fika Friday

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's an interesting case because I honestly if you're posting stuff in public to organize a protest on Twitter  the police could certainly as individuals kind of be watching for that or all they got to do is look for hashtags, right, but  What this data miner does is it takes every post on Twitter?  Big firehose and does descendant analysis on it. So it could be actually do more than saying  Oh, here's a Black Lives Matter protest hashtag in this part of town  They could do sentiment analysis. They could even go so far as to say we think it's gonna be violent  Based on what we're seeing in the in the in the tweets and I think that's a really interesting question. I think that  If if you were to assume that the police were benign and that their job was to protect the protesters recognizing the first man  All right amendment, right to peaceably assemble to protest  That they were just gonna use that information to go protect them. Would you be against it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't seem but isn't the test instead now  Okay, because because police and policing are an institution that are troubled to say the least  Maybe the test is not an ideal of police. The test is would you trust this happening in Iran?  or in China  Hmm, and then if if you say no, then you say okay  Well, maybe some of our police are good, maybe some of our police are bad  But which was which was your point the two of you  And was  For his good benefit left out of this discussion. He was there this week

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sort of on the fence with it though because again it could go both ways  It's public I like the idea of having the rights protected and in the law enforcement being there to help  Protect the citizens that are wanting to peacefully protest  But then at the same time I've seen similar stories not necessarily related to the protest  But where law enforcement has access to so much data and power and it can be abused  Especially when they don't really know how to use that that data

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the test if you were a peaceful protest and you wanted police protection  You would call up the police department say he just by the way  We're gonna be marching down this street at this time. You might even get a permit which is not required  Some some jurisdictions try to require it but it isn't  Your constitutionally protected to any peaceful protest but people don't do that why don't they do that because that's not  That as we well know that's really not the police's function in many cases in some cases it is it is I've seen  the police preserve the peace, you know surround a protest to protect the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Protesters I already had jill lepore today did a kind of history of policing in the New Yorker  That that brings policing back to in America to tracking slaves, yeah, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they were the slave hunting squads that went out to track escape slaves in the north  Apple just tweeted we're giving back to our community  We support Bitcoin and we believe you should too all Bitcoin sent to our address below will be sent back to you doubled  only going on for the next 30 minutes  Would you believe it hacked? Yeah, they got hats  I'm giving back to my fans all Bitcoin sent to my address below be sent back doubled  I'm only doing it to a maximum of ten million dollars  Elon Musk feeling grateful doubling all payments sent to my Bitcoin address. You send a thousand I send two thousand also  Elon Musk doesn't have to FA. Yeah, apparently none of these guys do it's the same Bitcoin address for all of them and even  Bill Gates  Everyone is asking me to give back and now's the time I'm doubling all payments sent to my Bitcoin address for the next  30 minutes  Apparently Jeff Bezos was also hacked

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow all the journalists who follow these accounts and oh my gosh for the first time in some cases they're getting tweets  They're like whoa, and then they're like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the real issue is it sounds like this may be a bigger problem with Twitter security because  Some of those people have to be using two-factor Cameron Winklevoss  Says that all major crypto Twitter accounts have also been compromised  And he says two factor and a strong password was used for the at Gemini account  We're investigating so maybe all I'm seeing is a massive  Twitter security flaw that was discovered  Obviously spammers do not send Bitcoin to that wallet  Send it to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So don't send it to me, I don't know how to get in my wallet  It'll just sit there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, I don't know. I don't see and this is a verge story from just a few minutes ago. I don't see the  Jeff Bezos, but somebody in the chat room said it's Bezos as well  So I really wonder what's going on there I think you're right I think at least some of those people must I mean Bill Gates is using  two-factor and a strong password he must  That's and that's just crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We would like to assume that Twitter is up on its on its game far as having these things secured and not necessarily  using the whole plain text feels and stuff like that, but  It's happened it's a D's level it did happen to base of tech minded people, you know, I mean Elon Musk  Here's Jeff Bezos. I've decided to give back to my community. I like how they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Know it's pinned. I like how they customized these two Wow, they really  They really they took some care. This wasn't a you know, big massive spam  This is Brian Krebs was a big spam  This wasn't a you know big massive spam, this is Brian Krebs watching about it Krebs, of course is a really great

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also, well, he says they're coinbase Beyonce Beyonce, whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, they missed a bet they should have been Beyonce

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry, I was yeah, I was breathing fast, you know, we old people we just kind of skip over things

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this has to be has to be something wrong at Twitter  There's it seems highly unlikely  That these guys would have been not at least some of these I can see Kanye  We know Kanye's password from when it was revealed in his visit to the oval office. So I  Yeah, yeah, I'm feeling Kanye maybe isn't using two-factor, but these are the Elon Musk. It's down now  Yeah, well, I'm sure a lot of them are down no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was hired into Twitter  remember  the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mike Bloomberg's Mike Bloomberg also, but his is down now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, Stacey the it was a trump. It was a trump thing, right? Somebody didn't somebody get into Trump's account

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but we don't know what the president's security apparently the Biden account was hacked somebody's saying but I don't see the  tweets  Uber. Yeah, there's something wrong at Twitter check your thinking as an inside job. Mrs. Stacey your accounts

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean Twitter has had inside jobs in the past. They had the people  Spying for Saudi Arabia and those those were employees that were compromised  I'm just throwing that out. There is a way like if you I  Don't know if it's really a Bitcoin thing or maybe it's like a nation-state or who knows anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did Alice will him get get it to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  really add Alex  Checking now. I did not I'm happy to say but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't challenge anyone Leo. Oh, wait a minute. He says starting to get embarrassed that I didn't get hacked

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't either. Oh, damn it. Oh man

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alex and I didn't oh man. I love that guy. Well, that's a big that's a big story  I'm sure I think that has to be a security flaw Twitter or

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kevin Ruse says if whomever apparently has read write access to every verified Twitter account also has access to those accounts DMs  This could make the Sony hack look tiny  Signal with your sources bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's yeah, you should not be using Twitter DMs for secret anything, but that's really interesting like reach out to people  But yeah, that's a really interesting  Point

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you were going after that though, you wouldn't be putting up the stupid Bitcoin thing  You'd be pulling all that stuff down unless it's already pulled down. It may well be  Maybe it's just then it maybe it's some stupid teenage boy. So here's here's a new I have a new rule in life  On Twitter when I find myself in a in a facepalm discussion with somebody who starts getting all wacky I  Nevely they'll look at their their profile crypto  Every time really crypto people. Yep every time it does there is definitely a crypto fringe  Yeah, yeah, there's a there's a magnet there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We well that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it sounds like my does crazy apparently Barack Obama  Apparently I think they might in fact have I think Kevin Roos might not be far off  They might have access to all verified accounts  Oh, no, that's me horrific

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or if you're gonna tweet something like that you probably would start with verified accounts for sure, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you would probably do something both verified and above a million  Followers or pick a pretty good ratio, right? Not a rich show. Sorry. Wow. That's a really interesting story. That just broke

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah  About one o'clock Pacific. So that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's kind of cool does Twitter have a circuit breaker that puts everything up pause like the NYSE because now would be a good time  It would be that time

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that's now would be a good time Jack  Maybe Jack's meditating Jack. Wake up more busy with his other companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Come back from square for a minute  They're doing fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is already in a paste bin of all of the sites  This was a this was a  Brian Krebs tweet risk IQs list of domains  Tied to this scam

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Already how they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They must I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They search Twitter for the for that address maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These are websites, so I'm not sure what this is. I'm looking at you could do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Couldn't you send like test?  I  Trace it's like trace routes, but to those would you see those addresses? No, you would see that never mind. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't know. I'm not sure exactly  Cryptocurrency scam domains. So wow, apparently there are cryptocurrency scammers out there. Hmm  Everyone's a scam. What do you think is gonna so  Facebook remember when we I loved your hypothetical Jeff if you are at dinner with Jeff with  Jeff was there but it was Mark Zuckerberg was the center of attention if you were there and you could say to Mark one  Thing that he would do  guaranteed no matter what I said ban political ads and  Jeff you raised the interesting point that there are a lot of candidates who that's the only way affordable way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can afford to campaign especially especially now that you can't go door-to-door

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, but now from Kurt Wagner your I think your former colleague, right Stacy  Facebook no, he wasn't it on giggle Facebook malls political ad blackout ahead of US election. This is a Bloomberg story  Malls is same as plans or think that's merely mulling

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lumination right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff like probably about a week ago thinking about this and I don't remember why I thought about it, but  Let us it was in the idea of  political ads  Oh, I know it was because I was reading about the effect of marketing and like the goals of marketing right and typically  advertising is to get you to buy something and  That serves the interest of capitalism right you're you're buying a  Politician as a  As a good that you think you can recognize and understand  I would argue that banning political ads would actually be great because we no longer  Would think about them as a consumable kind of product. They're not part of a capitalistic structure  instead if you think about it  From a democratic perspective like as in a democracy  You would have the politicians sharing their views on Facebook, right and then not just those being  Shared naturally so I would I would actually say I've been thinking about this Jeff and I come down on the idea  That a politician should not be allowed to buy ads on Facebook. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so Stacy  Here's here's the thing if we're if you're the UK or you're you're in France or Germany and you cut out all political  Advertising across all media I would agree with you  however, if all you cut off is Facebook then what you're doing is driving those dollars to the expensive media, which is media and  It's highly inefficient highly expensive and that means the big money power only becomes bigger  Because because we don't do that that's exactly what Alex Stamos Facebook's former security chief said

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Eliminating online political ads only benefits those with money  Incumbency or the ability to get media coverage. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interrupt one second. Let me interrupt one second. I'm doing a purposeful interruption here, Stacy  I'm sorry, but it's on the big story if you go to Alex's Twitter feed  He just put up the you can watch the money going into the Bitcoin account. Oh  Wow side. Sorry, Stacy, but I want to know his little breaking news

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Putting money oh, oh dear you can watch the money 296 transactions  Oh, here's the Joe Biden one to 97. Oh my gosh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is that was too good to give up clearly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean if Biden isn't using you know security keys, you know Titan security style security  I'd be shocked by the way Brianna Wu  Tweeted an interesting story  She has a long strong good password on her political email  Yes, and it was gassed or hacked or discovered as she says thank goodness for Google's Titan keys  Because they weren't able to get in because of the physical key you have to think every politician  With maybe one notable exception every politician has to be using  This kind of dongle based security you can use it on Twitter I am using it on Twitter I  Really if Biden this is an inside job or a Twitter hack  It's 297 transactions a total of 12 Bitcoin received  So how much is that now 299 now? Yeah  12 isn't a lot 12 Bitcoin is about  $120,000 but it's clear 110 110  That's a lot of money. It's a lot for no effort for the scammer definitely is happy  Yeah  And by the way, there is a for most of these transactions a considerable lag  So you won't see the big the bulk of the  scammed  Contributions right away. It could take oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't pull it back right? There's no once you've done it you've done it. Oh, yeah, you've done it  All right, so Stacy I did I did it up to you I get accused over this time  I actually did it. I thought that was a good a good quick angle. So you were saying sorry, it's so rude

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was back to media. Oh, I wonder how and I wish there was some good research on this  Demographically how it breaks down to people who see political ads  Because so many people don't watch network TV anymore  People who are watching Fox News obviously are going to be seeing ads but they're  Also watching Fox News, I don't know. So I I'm very curious because I don't know how many people actually see big media  in today's day and age

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nonetheless it was so look at the options you have as a candidate, right?  Best is is  Canvassing gone events gone  Phone calls you do it, but everybody nobody's answering their phone anymore  No, you can do online events on Facebook. You just don't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got you got to find people that way they got they already got to be in the tribe

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're not gonna you know  You're not gonna be walking by downtown and say look at this fair going over that nice candidate, right?  That's what your existing network not necessarily growing the network. Exactly. Exactly. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what you're left with

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So then your point is what you're left with is you're going to be watching the news  Right, Stacy does anybody see no newspaper ads?  Right, but Mike Mike congressman Tom Malinowski here who's great and I support him and he's wonderful  You know, he's not gonna advertise on the New York TV stations because it's wildly expensive  He could afford one ad in the whole campaign. Who knows if I'm watching that right?  local cable  Disjointed in the mess a direct mail. Well, that's probably your best bet  But it's expensive as hell a lot more expensive than Facebook and you can only afford to do so much so you're kind of  Especially now. I mean the pandemic makes it even worse  It's already this case but it's even worse now if you take away Facebook advertising from people that's highly targeted to  Geo and demo and probably interest you I'm not gonna waste my if I if I'm a certain candidate  I'm not gonna waste my money on NRA fans, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what I should I you so you could do is do partnerships with issues that matter  So let's say you're an anti-gun activist or just you want stronger handgun  Legislation if you did a partnership with like every town for access to their mailing list in your area  That is a creative way  Across and you would have to actually have substantive discussions with those groups to get access that you were trying to change things  So I I agree with you that it would be more difficult. I don't believe that  That will stymie people for too long because it is easier to get access to people and to pull in  People

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so  If we had an all-out reform of political ad spending I would be delighted  But short of that to take away the most efficient  Mechanism there is today good and bad, but it is the most effective means of  advertising I  Think hampers both candidates and campaigns  Obama to I don't think that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Page is the Twitter it's not so maybe the campaign or something Ryan Stelter has a screenshot of it. Okay, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think this these are the questions that Facebook is asking the self far as this whole mulling it over thing because I  Speak to my mom, you know a couple times a week regarding, you know  What's going on day to day and she does sale?  she does ad sales and she's been pretty particular about this time of year because it's sort of a  damn if you do damn if you don't for the people that are wanting to buy ads for the network because there are no they know that  This is a pandemic. They know their their revenues have really been cut back  So they don't have the money and they want to get the biggest bang for the buck because TV is awesome  It's usually worth it from an ROI perspective, but probably could save a little money and get a bigger reach if they use Facebook ads  Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so Stacy in principle, I don't disagree with you  Except that when you then dig into it, you know, if you're if you're if you're a good candidate now  Or if you're if you're tomorrow's AOC the AOC who hasn't been discovered yet, you're not incumbent  You're you're so limited. It just it just favors the incumbents so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unless I agree with you though Jeff if we just ban all political advertising on all platforms  then it's an well even then incumbents, you know as  Come to the Rose Garden I'm giving an important state

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Always have an advantage right so the key is figuring out how to be more nimble and how to do crazy things and  Political history is littered with this. I mean, that's how we got like crazy  What is it whistle stop tours? And I mean you see it throughout history and I'm not a student of political science, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Get your point Jeff, but we don't live in a world where we can just turn something off

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At a  Turning off you're turning Facebook off of the drop of a hat but that yeah, I'm turning one element of an entire  But then you're then you have unintended consequences around across the whole and I'm gonna say yes, we will have unintended consequences

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We will probably lose  some segment of  I mean anytime you change thing you're gonna you're gonna lose some segment of people who were  Unequipped or unable to adapt to that change that's not necessarily a bad thing. It can be it's  terrible for the people who get you know  Who may have otherwise won but we'll see what those are after the first election cycle and then we'll move to address it  Or those people will adapt and I mean  What you're saying is we don't want anything to change because this advantage is non-incumbent  Right now which is good. No, I'm not saying that no, I'm not saying that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm saying that's one of many factors  and I'm saying that  Another factor is you're gonna drive more money to big media money  You're gonna entice more big media into the campaigns. You're gonna there's a lot that happens then  Facebook has become  This is not just political advertising. It's all advertising, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Advertising yeah, we've done super efficient advertising on Facebook that is I think a good service to people who found like the newsletter  Who are like, oh, I didn't know this existed. It's great a beat

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But so I want the next day. Oh see to be able to do that  You  Pick your candidate you like I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, my last elections were all in Texas. So all the candidates I liked they didn't they didn't win anyway, and I didn't read about them on Facebook  That's the other thing the candidates I've found were usually I mean and honestly  In a lot of ways they were just indivisibles like here is someone who is not a crazy Republican  Because you know, I think Texas that's all you this is a tough one

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you make a good point Jeff and I just I feel like the worst way you could get political information is via advertising  by anybody any candidate  Because it's just not it's it lends itself to you know  Twitter length in sight  But maybe that's the only thing we've got I think we've got a problem is what we've got  Let's take a little break. We're gonna come back  I will give you and we'll get it come back and give you an update on the the Twitter story  That is a breaking story. That is something pretty wild. It's Twitter going on right now. It's broken  Yeah, clearly our show today brought to you by cash fly now. We use a CDN when you download our files  Whether you do it from the website or when you do it from your podcast application  You're getting it not from our servers  Not from you know our website, but from cash fly  It's a content delivery network and I got to tell you that makes a huge difference  You may not notice it  But believe me you would notice it if we weren't files come in as fast as they can because you're getting them from a server near  you  Availability is almost perfect because cash fly is distributed all over the world  No, you know nothing can get in between you and our show that's why we've been using cash fly for years  We're big fans. There is always one hitch though  If you're using a content delivery network, and that's when you get a cash miss when  The file you want isn't on that server that you're checking  That means then the server goes out typically and goes to the origin for that data in our case  It would be I think Amazon Web Services. They'd go to an s3 bucket and get the file  Now when that happens you're paying right if it happens a lot you're paying a lot  That's why cash like came up with something. I think is fantastic  100% cash shield with this new feature you're gonna benefit from a drastic reduction in  Data transfer fees from things like Amazon's s3 and other cloud  Storage origins by increasing the cash hit ratio to 100% no more cash  misses  When a cash item is evicted for a large one-off request  Not only does it cost you money. It means your customers are gonna have to wait a bit  4k content will buffer the download will pause  And you're gonna just spend a lot of money and data out transfer fees  So what's the solution you buy space on cash fly with their 100% cash shield and you now have guaranteed availability?  no extra cost because  Your your digital files your your cash is being loaded directly from  Cashfly you could purchase as much space as you want your data is fetched from 100% cash shield rather than from your origin  It keeps your data and content closer to your customers without relying on other companies  Backbones or traffic is you're gonna see an incredible improvement your bills will be lower and your speeds will be faster  Just one of the many ways cash fly is your perfect  CDN  Cashfly's global throughput performance dominance ensures any cash misses are delivered five times faster than from the origin  It's almost instantaneous. Look if you want to know more about cash fly if you deliver content whether it's an app a game  Video or podcasts go to twits.cashfly.com right now  They're giving away a complimentary detailed analysis of your current CDN bill and usage trends  You can see if you're overpaying you can probably save you as much as 20% on your bill  They sure did for us and there's no pressure no sales  It's just the information you need to make the right decision. We love cash fly. We're very grateful to them  twit.cashfly.com  If you want to get that information  What's the latest I'm watching Twitter it's blowing up. It's going crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter said that they are now aware. So like oh good four minutes ago. They said hey  We are aware this is happening and we're looking into it hashtag hacked. It's trending

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and you're seeing on this hashtag hacked a lot of a lot of people not President Trump he was not hacked so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's cuz no one believes President Trump would double your money for anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is one of the problems isn't it with Bitcoin that anybody would even believe this  let's check in real quickly with the  the  Site to see the problem is hackers often will mess around  With their Bitcoin wallets to make people think it's going crazy  So you can't really look at the activity in a Bitcoin wallet and assume that it's all from people are falling for this  Mike Bloomberg  falling for it  They're not following this has to be everyone's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Coming to the realization that this has to be inside Twitter or someone has it's got root access  Yeah, or there is a much more concerning. There might be a security flaw

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's allowed somebody into Twitter. It may not be an employee  It's you know clearly coming from the inside but far worse if it's an employee  But far worse if it's an advanced persistent threat if somebody's hanging out inside of the Twitter servers and able to do stuff  It will then your DMS might be  Vulnerable things like that as well. So this is a big story. Well as Twitter said anything yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just that there's support just said that they're aware. This is happening and that was like two minutes ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I keep seeing something that an admin account was compromised. This is what keeps popping up on my feed

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know though, I think Twitter's got precautions even if an admin account was compromised  Do you think that they could allow people to do? Yeah, boy, that would be  pretty serious

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Swift on security has some useful things if you follow. Yeah, she's she he we don't know who it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not Taylor Swift. I think we're pretty sure of that  But I'm gonna call her she she is always very good and you could always just say they  They split the difference and even be they yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So some useful threads there  Who fought and stock trading down  Was 5% almost

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think it's really now because of this? Yeah, why wouldn't yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, why wouldn't you say hey Twitter you don't know how to make money and all your top users are getting hacked

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it possible that all of these users are using a third party? Maybe the third party got hacked  I don't think so. I think that's highly unlikely  There's two just two diverse a group

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that is one thing I'm trying to think how will to FA help this scenario well, this isn't a two-f a situation

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is what's coming out like this inside. That's why that's why I'm presuming

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's either somebody with admin access a Twitter  Insider or somebody who is hacked into the Twitter servers. Yeah, cuz you couldn't you couldn't do this  Presumably at least some of these accounts have two factor which means there wouldn't be vulnerable from the outside. Oh now interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that was 59 minutes ago. I'm not gonna repeat this because it does not look real. It's old

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Loaded old news gets old so fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so, you know clearly we don't know exactly what's happening clearly it's taken Twitter a long time in the internet time to  respond and  It looks like it's an inside something just shut it down man. They responded

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's about eight minutes ago. So clearly they're all sitting listening to this show and  Once we alerted them to the situation they acted

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're welcome Twitter  The oh says throw the big switch pull the plug

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's you do wonder what is that that what did you call before the the the stock market the  The kill switch or the pause training?  Yeah, what's what's the what's the circuit breaker? That's what it was. Oh, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no that would make

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sense I mean, how would you like a shopping cart that instead of having it hacked?  Yeah, probably could instead of having one of those Amazon grab-and-go stores near you  What if every store had an Amazon grab-and-go shopping cart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hmm. I'd use it. I'd be so excited. Yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's called a dash cart and  The idea is it's got touchscreen. It's got hardware components probably cameras  You don't have to scan things you just throw them in  When you are done shopping you take the cart through a special lane  The express lane it's just like fast track for your shopping and you're done  And of course Amazon loves it because it all goes through Amazon the first grocery store in Woodland Hills in  the Los Angeles area

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To be fair Amazon for because retailers were so leery of giving up their data to Amazon for the Amazon go  Package because Amazon is selling that to companies. They said that they would not share they would not have access to the data  So it's possible that this cart would not share access. It's pretty good. It's got a cup holder

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's got what is that square thing something for hold your keys maybe or your phone or your phone?  Yeah, and then it's got a tablet that shows you as you throw things in the cart what it thinks it is and what the price  Is and your total and I think that's pretty darn cool. Where's your baby?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stop still a little seat right there. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But would it charge you for the baby by accident, yeah, probably would baby every baby has a UPC soon now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's interesting the Amazon hit priceless the Amazon  Perhaps coming soon to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, this is actually good because it's a cheaper way to bring that service  Yes to places that don't want to outfit their grocery

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I bet they'd be too high demand for those carts  No checkers and the whizzing out the door. No check. I mean like oh, but you got a bag at yourself. I hate that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I used to be a bad in covid time

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Touch that screen I hate touching touch screens even for for covid that's a good restaurants when they hand you a tablet. Oh, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why you gotta have a clean key

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you been to a restaurant

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm just saying even even before coven when people handed me tablet. I'm like I do not want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is one good thing by the way, we're gonna have much better hygiene when we're done with this, right  So we're all gonna expect it. I hope  I think we can get the change log going here. Do you have the the orchestra?  Is it ready are they tell them put down the cigarettes and play the day the drums?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like when I was when I would be covering events and I wouldn't be on Wi-Fi  I'd be like, oh, I need you to send this right away. So how do you force it? How do you force it from from Android?  Okay, hold on  I don't know. I've done it before. So let me take a picture and see what happens. I  Don't know I've done it before so let me take a picture and see what happens I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Am on my way. It is an issue  I know you're on an Android phone because it is an issue on the iPhone if the  App if the Google Photos app is running in the background  Eventually Apple kills it and so you have to have it open to buy and I'm excellent photos, but Android it should be instantaneous

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Feels like it's usually well if yeah mine was only if I wasn't on my Wi-Fi network  But I just took a picture and I was on the way you can turn off

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't say you know if I'm not that was the only restriction I had on mine at one time  But now I don't have any restrictions and it's quick

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I just got the new version. So if you hit the little hamburger menu up there just say  Add to album and back up now and it will do it  The hamburger so when you take a picture it resolves right and then there's a little hamburger menu on the  Leftmost side  The three dots  You hit that menu you can click back up now or add to album  It also this is useful it'll show you the metadata associated with the picture  So like mine puts my picture on a map. I think Carson's got the right idea here's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  After you hit 60 they they do slow it down for you because seniors are used to having it wait a day for the  24-hour photo to give you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I give you that but I like the feel of it and I like the additional features that they've added at the top  To give you like different size and options and other little tools built in it  And it's faster than what it used to be because I used to hate G board, but it's a lot better. It's come a long way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So did you guys see that you can buy a hardware thing of zoom I love that I just I was just looking at that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not expensive. It's about five hundred dollars the zoom tablet. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  $5.99 that's expensive. Wait, what well for a dedicated zoom tablet? Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's 27 inches that's I mean I don't think that's outrageous and it has software for doing things like whiteboarding and stuff  Yeah, it's a it's a built-in touch screen device. It has three cameras and eight noise  reducing microphones  So you're gonna get a better picture  Especially that on a Mac laptop the creek did Apple create this no, no, no, no  it's well zoom did it in partnership with a number of companies the first one is  Zoom for home and  It's called D 10 me. I guess that's the company D D 10 is the thing  Yeah, San Jose based company that makes video conferencing appliances. Why why does what does three cameras do in zoom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's up there for you in zoom? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. Well, then it's for us. We have to buy it Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh-huh. And then I was also thinking at first I thought well, wait a minute if you're working from home  You're on a computer. Why would you need a separate device?  But actually as I thought about it there if you have the room for it on your desk  Having a separate device is nice because you can still use your computer as you would normally and the call is a separate thing  This is effectively a video phone. And by the way other companies are doing something similar  This is zoom. This is just the first one from zoom 27 inches though. That's pretty big  It takes as you can see it takes up a lot of space on the desk there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's but it's mobile though  So if you could pick it up and take it down to the kit maybe to the kitchen

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  27 inches is pretty big for a kitchen. I think your wife would kill you bringing a 27 inch phone to the kitchen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'd be great  My wife would kill me no question about it. You could never get Disney Plus off of it  So it also makes it easier to it also makes it easier to present  It's got meetings whiteboards contacts if you have a calendar the calendar will be on the screen  I can't I don't have that.

Transcript:  Oh actually look at the actual product. What a thought  See this it shows the calendar so if you got a zoom call you just press the start button it you're in  Yeah, the three cameras it looks like it's one's pointed left one's pointed right one's pointed center  So maybe you walk around maybe you can walk around yeah, or maybe the idea is you could have multiple people in your meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  basically that you could actually  stay in touch with people all day long and  It's kind of similar to the idea like  Having video conference hours where you would just have your video conferencing on for a time period just to  Office when you are in the office. Yeah now remember that and I really wanted one of these but it's a lot more expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

I think it was pretty sweet  I like the story time will follow you around now, too. Will they oh good  The camera on them. Yes. Yes. That's right. I've noticed that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But i'm just trying to think aloud here  It has the three cameras on there and as mr. Jarvis suggested you had a couple people in the room on the same call  The mics are going to be sensitive enough to pick up three different inputs. It's got eight mics because they are eight mics

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, i'll bet it i'll bet it's tied to some smarts around where the faces

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just like remember cisco's fancy video camera technology. Oh, that's right. Yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  I think that's what they want you to think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bit romney has a somewhat I didn't know that oh there's a lot apparently a lot of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everyone has a charlie rose used to have one. Yeah. Well try try not to hold there's no pictures from that one.

So you've been to some of these  I mean you've been to davos. Anyway, is that kind of like what it's like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, this is this is this is much more exclusive much more much more fancy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Yes  So, uh, of course the reason that they do these  You know, they say it's to make the world a better place  What it really is is to make the political connections that you need to make a google a richer company

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're all just golfing together

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you know I actually i've been to the bohemian grove which  Often got dinged for being. Oh, yeah the room where it happens in a private space where all the big  Looks get together and plan world domination  It's just a bunch of drunk guys peeing on trees. It's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, sure. That's what he has to say  That's that's kind of the join the trilateral commission there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but that is true they make it's not overt in fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's I think the key to all these is not overt like all right. Let's make a deal here  We're you take the east coast. I'll take the west coast. It's it's all subtle  But you the friendships that you make are very very valuable  That's why I was in skull and bones at yale because those people  Are now on the server. No, of course not. I think they let me in  In

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh this kid looks like your free card future supreme court justice let him in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, no, we had our own secret society like skull and bones. It was called bong and spoon

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We had t-shirts anyway, you should call it you should have called it caked and baked caked and baked

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cake  And baked or bacon cake kind of that's more usual order maybe  Shake and bake but honestly, I think these really are social events as much as anything  But everybody knows that the friendships and connections you make that's well and deals get made there  Do you think I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they get made after the fact because of the meetups. I think about  Some events that i've been invited to years and years ago that I had no idea  I would ever be invited to those things and it led to relationships outside of those events just because we hung out and swung  The golf clubs and peed on trees and stupid stuff like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but but you're saying that sometimes people say hey, let's go have a cigar and let's work this thing out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know just the two of us. Yeah, or they just they get together talking and they're like, oh, you know  You're bemoaning a problem and someone's like, oh actually I know a guy who can solve that or I have something that can solve that  Let's get together and they sit down and they  believe me  This is how deals happen  Yeah, and it's frustrating like as you know, i'll say as a woman, you know  Like when I was in texas reporting that all the tech execs in austin would go on this hunting trip down to argentina  you know and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where their deals got done and you're like, yeah, and there were never any women on those trips  Yes, women do not go on those trips the ones that the events that i've been in there were hardly ever any women  Not that I think about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because women can't pee. Well, we can pee on trees, but it's a little less graceful. It's just not as gracefully

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Truthfully if you pee on a tree, sometimes the tree will pee on you and that's where it really becomes a problem  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're just gonna stop this whole line of conversation. This can go nowhere. Let's just hit the brakes. Let's just stop

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wendy's is trying to make a  Bitcoin joke on their twitter account. Oh dear  What is it? I think too soon too soon makes no sense. It makes no sense. I'll let you pull up wendy's twitter account

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Honestly, this is is it just wendy's?  It's what yeah wendy's  Honestly, this is the problem in a way I have with all of this. Do you think?  that  Steakums or Wendy's besides getting some press  Really gets any real benefit from their presence on twitter real people don't care. So steak comes here. I interviewed

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nathan alabach right the steak of the sky  And you can find that on buzz machine if you want to watch it. He's a very nice guy  um  In their case, it's like taco bell you take an old brand and you're trying to infuse the brand  With something new right taco bell was not cool taco bell is now cool  Who would think right? I mean i'm getting i'm getting yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they they did things other things to make them cool  Like when they said hey space station hit our target and everybody in the world gets a free taco and stuff like that  They've had that's good gorilla marketing and that has a I don't I just don't think twitter  Has much reach to be honest, but then it gets talked about

Transcript:  Twitter is twitter is a spark and the fire goes on in media

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's one way to solve the problem  Let me let me try to tweet. That's interesting  Oh, that's certainly I have power. That's certainly one way to do it is well, we won't let any verified people tweet  um, no  Something went wrong. I am verified

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  Something went wrong, but don't fret. Let's give it another shot  This request looks like it might be automated  You don't seem real leo, so that's interesting. So if you got the blue check no tweets for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  tweets so  Oh the pot the mass has taken over twitter that tells us though that the privileged are now a sideline

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They may be incorrect, but the twitter believes  It's related to the blue checks because if somebody had full access to twitter they can they they would you know?  They could tweet non-blue checks, too  But it sounds like they believe that there's something related  To the verification system. That's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And are you not verified?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am not verified. I tried and see if I can see if I can reply to a tweet of yours if that works

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  Yeah, that was come up to that. Can I can I guess this is also stopped for the verified accounts that have um  Can retweet I could retweet have scheduled tweets  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So somebody's uh, andrew barron asked an interesting question in twitter. He said what do you think will apple abandon twitter?  It's certainly not worth the reputational  This is this is my point  We're on twitter, but how valuable is twitter at what point is twitter not valuable enough to for the reputational damage?  Or the risk that you know, somebody might believe apple tried, you know was going to double everybody's bitcoin

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think section 230 protect those people are too dumb to be apple customers  Apple customers are much smarter than that much smarter than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um apple did speaking of apple did win its irish  Tax battle you may remember that big deal marta vista year  Uh was really going against the tech companies because of the sweetheart deals they had made with various  countries in the european union apple had a deal with ireland that it essentially would pay no income tax  and uh  So the european union said no you owe apple you owe  Uh 14.8 billion dollars to ireland which it'll then pass on to us  Apple took it to court and the second highest court in the eu says no, that's not true  That's bogus  It said uh in a nulled the decision because the commission failed to meet the legal standards and showing that apple was illegally given special  Treatment, it's often the case cities do it too where you get special tax breaks  For the economic development you're bringing to a country apple was using this as mess google was and others  Uh to hide their income from the united states tax  They would transfer intellectual property rights and other things to  favorable nations apple actually transferred a lot of the  Property rights for its products to ireland to a small division in ireland  All the income went into this irish  Subsidiary and there was no income tax. The problem is of course, it's  Offshore income apple eventually did onshore all that income when president trump gave them a tax break  But it was you had to bring this up on tax day, didn't you? Yeah. Oh it is tax day, isn't it?  Wow, so apple will save uh 14 billion dollars in taxes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't have to pay. Meanwhile people like me are still paying way more than apple and way more than the percentage was so annoying. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep, it is. So the twitter wags are out like crazy  um  Rebecca bansan my fellow note checks our time is now with  hamilton  Uh parker higgins cancel culture has gone too far  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Looks like macworld was able to tweet from their verified account

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hell of a way to shut down trump's account  Oh matt cordini cordoni the verifies were the virus twitter is healing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow  That's interesting. What is there a hashtag for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, there should be you know  If it were in the hands of us privileged people we would have thought of that leo and had the hashtags  That's kind of why we're privileged but these the mere masses here just don't know how to do twitter  Clearly you people are twitter inept

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Start burning you in effigy right now by the way notice what the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff notice what the middle column in my tweet deck is is your jeff jarvis's covid list  Thank you, which I keep open all the time because that's a very good source for real information

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, oh and then somebody's saying nobody will hack you because you're not relevant in this century  So ben collins and nbc who's there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ben is their um security, you know online guy. Yeah, so he's tweeting a different account

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, don't you have a backup account in case of uh, in case of virus break glass?  Surely you do that would be my secret identity

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do. I mean it wasn't it's just I have I have two other twitter accounts that I can use  But um, I don't have anything I need to say that badly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so apparently  Verified accounts are looking for single word tweets that they can retweet and stitch together to say things

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's really I can't believe mike maznik is not verified

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't it? It's it's well, you know  Just shows you right. It's just the just shows you just shows you people verified  Yeah, it doesn't mean nothing to have that blue check  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Roman roads is a subway map. I found this just just amusing and enjoyable. That's really great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just say zoom just say doom first and then i'll go ahead tune you boom doom zoom boom boom boom  ds9 did not tune you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought ben thompson had an excellent strataquiri piece on the tick tock  war  Yesterday  In which he said  Yeah, it's good. I can summarize it  He's  I mean, it's pretty wide-ranging as often his thought is and often he's always very insightful  Uh, he I mean he gets quibi in here and a bunch of other stuff  but uh tick tock  Is  very successful because  Humans prefer video to photos to text  tick tock makes it easy to create videos and this is the key ensuring a virtually infinite supply of content  Even if most of its low  Tick tock relies on the algorithm to surface the good stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but also the the the interactivity of it the the collaboration I create a sound or I create a video

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That makes it fun and that's the fun that's the fun part and that's where you get a lot of content  But then the algorithm is able to surface the best. He says that's exactly opposite  Hollywood's model which is that video is scarce because it's expensive to produce  So you got to pick the hits ahead of time and that's where quibi went wrong. That's what quibi's big disadvantage is  It was big old hollywood think  As carsten says oh ubi oh ubi s me see booby  Wow, where oh where has my little dog gone I believe is the translation  So he also talks about  He says I cannot emphasize this point enough one of the gravest errors made by far too many people in the u.s  And remember ben lives in taipei. He lives in taiwan is taking an exceptionally self-centered view of u.s  china relations  Where everything's about what the u.s says and does  While china is treated like an npc a non-player character  It's insulting to china a great nation with a history far longer than the united states  So he's giving a lot of credit to china's strategy  And he describes what china's strategy is. It's not military conquest  Uh, in fact, we've talked about that many times on all of our shows  He quotes, uh president shi jin ping the president for life of china  Since the end of the cold war countries affected by western values have been torn apart by war  Or afflicted with chaos if we tailor our practices to western values the conflicts of consequences will be devastating  we need  to  spread our  way of life  Uh because the competition in the ideological domain is fierce  The very real threat of western anti-china forces in their attempt at carrying out westernization within china  Is an intense ideological struggle for survival  he  By and by mentioning this he says  so  You have to understand tiktok is a chinese company  Uh, and of course, uh  tiktok is vacuuming up as much data as it can from your usage to your ip address to your contacts and location  similar to what facebook does  He says  But the difference is emerge facebook's a us company tiktok is  Claims that it's independent from bite dance and stores data in the us and singapore  But its privacy policy is clear one line that's all that matters. We may share your information with a parent  Subsidiary or other affiliate of our corporate group data it can and probably is being sent to china  All chinese internet companies are compelled by the country's national intelligence law to turn over any and all data the government demands  No warrants needed power is not limited by china's border  So he's he says look  Tik toks great  but  You probably shouldn't be using it  It's time to take china seriously and literally the communist party is not only ideologically opposed to  Liberalism that's the lowercase l the western liberalism it believes that only one of liberalism or marxism can prevail  To then and it's been taking action for over 20 years to control information within its borders and  Over the last several years to control information outside its borders  It's time for the u.s to respond both on the government level and corporate level  And uh, so so he is I think it's it's a fairly nuanced article. It's well worth

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Reading but he comes up but I don't quite understand. What should the response be he says

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, this is without a so he says  Apple and google can not only remove tik tok from the app store  They could if ordered make already installed apps unusable and he says they should do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He says I was on I was on well, they they could not be ordered to I was on  Well, he says he would prefer congress to order them to I was on with ben widdus and cape clonic who are two great  legal minds, I know  for their podcast  the other night  And they said no government cannot take down tik tok first amendment. Well, there's a couple of routes. There's cefius

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the committee on foreign investment in the united states  They can review bite dances acquisition of musically which was an american company  Uh, there's also the international emergency economic powers act which would require require declaring a national emergency  Congress could I don't know first. Yeah, it's gonna happen. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're not taking that was it was it was a paper tiger

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Paper lion paper tiger that like mike pompeo the secretary of state said we're thinking about it. We're we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mulling it over is because because we have to say because that was the whole point  The whole political thing right now is to distract us and think that the big issue in the world now is china

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If china now and again, you know, but this is ben's point of view. I don't know if it's uh,  Correct or not, but I think it's well reasoned if china is on the offense  Offensive against liberalism not only within its borders  But within ours it's in liberalism's interest to cut off a vector  That has taken root precisely because it is so brilliantly engineered to give humans exactly what they want  But you're right there may not be the legal precedent the ability to do this, but he says if we can  We should order apple and google to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Put take we're gonna look at this though as something akin to like banning sugary sodas when when new york tried to test that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're gonna be like our individual right to give no, I think americans. This would be a case though americans  Let's face it. We're we can be a little chauvinistic  I think americans it wouldn't be hard to get a consensus in america  If you said look, this is a chinese app. It's spying on us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but what it but what we haven't been before is on the surface tiktok is a fun  enjoyable  social network  But what if it really is all about gathering in for as much information as possible  About the american populace to what end? I don't know. I mean, well, that's the thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You see so then you know, you do it could be bad the what if

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, i'll give you one example  That ben raises is china is most certainly looking  surveilling  Chinese nationals in the united states with which they're doing already. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So chinese nationals believe me no i've had them in classes  And they know even in a private class what not to say. Yeah stacy. I think you're muted

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We we're doing trainings  For for media like african-american media latino media and so on for the the threats that exist  Against voting and stuff right and chinese media said no, we don't need you  We've been dealing with this for a long time. So what okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so let's say that it would be inappropriate for the federal government to order apple and google to uh to kick them out of the store  Something by the way, the chinese government has done for ages to things like yeah, but that's the difference between us  We have a first amendment. So what's that?  Could we would it be reasonable to have a campaign a public campaign that says stop using this is dangerous  Would you support that  No, because you don't really know what's dangerous

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no  Substantial evidence that says hey, this is dangerous and you got to be able to get the normal people to buy into that campaign  And I don't think there's any way to get that to happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, certainly we have evidence that like vaccines work, but we still have a bunch of people who  Won't use them. So all you need is enough people to cry conspiracy theory  Right. No tiktok is a terrible and china would totally exploit that and then poof

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there are a lot of companies that are saying wales fargo for instance says don't put that tiktok on our company phone  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many how many companies are there in the world?  Um, what are what is the trend towards personal devices versus corporate issued devices now?  I'm curious what the breakdown is like in today's day and age

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was of course one of the big trends of the last 10 years was b.y.o.d  b.y.o.d  People bringing their own app because the iphone they didn't want the that really started when the company phone was a blackberry or a windows  ce device  Yeah, and everyone wanted iPhones. I'm not using that. Maybe yeah  I love that windows mobile phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now I did what I had so at fortune for timing I had to have if I was going to use my phone  As my primary device, which I wanted to  they required me to put software on it that was actually kind of dodgy, so  I'll be honest. I took  Yeah, I took I took the hillary route and used a my personal device and email part of it was that fortune took  Three weeks to get me an actual email address, which was  A long time as a reporter not to have email

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah speedy onboard process

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The point being I think there's lots of people using their personal devices  I think these sort of things send a message that might influence people but probably not the youths

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo you're gonna be left for a point. We will have nothing left to quit. Then what do you what are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wouldn't I mean I like tick tock, but honestly, I don't think I think the real risk to me for tick tock is it's a brain softener  So I try to stay away from it, but it's just fun  It's just fun  It's it's the kind of thing you just scroll and you an hour later you look up and go what happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I lost I never got anything out of it. I see all of the trendy videos and  But I never really got anything out of it. And then for me the audience that I know I have  Most of them don't tend to care about tick tock either. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course amazon  Famously sent out a letter saying you can't use tick tock the security team sent that  And then amazon realized that we do a lot of business with china never mind never mind  We didn't say that  Amazon prime videos actually advertises on tick tock  So it's probably it's probably a very good advertising platform, right?

Transcript:  Profit matters, baby

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I you know, I am not a fan of  jingoism of of anti chinese  Racism by any means, you know, i'm the chinese government sucks. You're right there. Oh, I don't trust  Yeah, the chinese government. No, I don't either  And but I think their goals are not militaristic with us  They might be in taiwan and hong kong, but they are certainly economic with us

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah  But here's here's the problem with that way of thinking right is that is that a lot of people in the world don't trust america

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right now. Well, we're in the same boat  In fact, yep, we just found out that oh the cia has been hacking those other guys just as much  That's uh, of course, it's a two-way street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, why don't we start with you stacey for your pick of the week  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is brought about by the google engram discussion  You may have read this. It's not a new article, but I read it a couple  I think I stumbled upon it a couple days ago, maybe  And I was fascinated by it. Did I put it in there?  Where where's our picks of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey's thing is blank. I'm getting i'm going you guys here. I am. Okay. I'm so not awesome  Okay, I see there it is. This is nine words formed by mistakes  And this is a merriam-webster article about how we got these words and most of them  Actually come from the same thing. Wait a minute apron is a mistake  Yeah, so and it finally explained to me  Why orange is such a different word because you can't rhyme anything with orange. Yeah, well in french and in spanish  it is  Naranja in spanish and I can't remember what the heck it is in french. Oh no in french. It's larange  But the spanish I was always like why is it naranja and then reading this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It tells you if the arabic word is naranja  Passed in french through old oxetan  Which spelled the word or anja?  I love this stuff which originally ultimately they became orange in modern french the n vanished  Because the indefinite articles in french une and all and with an n sound and the word was respelled accordingly dropping the initial n  So  That's why there's an n in naranja  But not in orange

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly and a lot of these became the the indefinite article kind of got in the way  Most that that's the if I were to sum up this article with this this article  Um, it would be your le or un or whatever  became  Truncated so I I just thought this was kind of neat for people who like words in middle english the word eek

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Meant also or in addition  Uh, so a secondary or unofficial name in the late middle ages was an eek name  also name  It eventually became a neek name  A nick name  Uh notch comes from the french word oche  An incision made to keep a record, but when the word migrated  The article and got in the mix and an oche became a notch  See I love it. I love it. So thank you marion webster  So the word for uh  Apron is another one of those french to english  Things the word for a cloth covering in middle french was nape aran which came from nape meaning tablecloth  Uh nape aran came into english in the 14th century, but referring it to it in english as  An apron led to some people spelling it as an apron instead  So it really is an apparent  But you can call it an apron. That is so cool. Yeah, I love it. I love the language
