This Week in Google, the show where we cover the latest from the Google verse.  And boy, this is going to be the week that was.  Joining us, of course, Jeff Jarvis, welcome.  Were you here last week?  Yes, I was.  You weren't, but I was.  Yeah, you and Stacey were here.  We had a good discussion.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thanks to Jason Howell for filling in.  And I missed you before that because I was traveling.  So we're back!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're back together, Hogs!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're supposed to do this, Jeff.  Hard.  He's the Leonard Tapp Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School  of Journalism at the City University of New York.  BuzzMachine.com is his blog.  His books are available everywhere, including public parts.  What would Google do?  And Gutenberg the geek.  Very nice to see you.  Nice to see you.  Now Stacey is gone again.  Where'd she go this time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She had, she is out with a migraine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, poor Stacey.  So she was, I thought she was planned for today.  She was planning on being here.  We can go to the moon and we can't cure a migraine.  Isn't that ridiculous?  Yeah.  But the good offices of Matthew Ingram are always welcome on the show.  Chief Digital Writer at CJR.org and a guy who had gelato with Craig Newmark in Perugia.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was bragging about that just moments ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He wasn't.  We were talking about Craig Newmark.  No, no, it was a brag.  It was a brag.  It was a humble brag.  Maybe a little bit.  It was a humble brag.  How was Perugia this year?  You don't go to Perugia, Jeff?  No, I don't.  It was great.  It was good, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  The weather wasn't that great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a journalism conference in one of the most beautiful towns in Italy, a beautiful  medieval town.  Great food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a wonderful conference and great discussions.  I had a debate about European regulation.  I had a session about the death of the story.  Oh, interesting.  I had a session about things that journalists should know about the business of journalism.  What about you, Matthew?  What were yours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did a one-on-one with Alan Rusbridger, the former Guardian Editor.  This new book you should plug?  Breaking the News.  Then I did a one-on-one with Martin Moore, who also has a book about the impact of technology  on politics and society.  I had a couple of panels as well.  I think the highlight for me was seeing Maria Ressa from Rappler, the Philippine news site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't even know Rappler.  She's the founder of Rappler.  She's from the Philippines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the bravest journalist I know by far, she's been arrested now by Duterte eight times  or nine times.  Oh my goodness.  Yeah, she was arrested again just before she came to Perugia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And yet, she's a soldier's on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and she's just relentlessly positive as well, which is amazing for someone who's  been through as much as she has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to respect people of the press who continue to soldier on.  And then there's Julian Assange.  Were you in Perugia when he got arrested?  Because I would have loved her.  Just after.  Oh man, the conversation there.  So Assange, who of course is the founder of WikiLeaks, and was lionized, especially by  the left early on, especially after collateral murder, that was the material leaked to WikiLeaks  by Chelsea Manning, which showed footage of American drones killing journalists and other  innocents and was a big revelation back in the Obama era.  Of course, Chelsea Manning went to jail.  Obama later commuted her sentence.  They finally threw Julian out of the Ecuadorian embassy, where he'd been hunkered down for  what is it, seven years?  Seven years.  Yeah.  Initially, he was fleeing a rape charge from Sweden.  That charge eventually dropped.  But he still dared not leave the Ecuadorian embassy in London.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it hasn't actually technically been dropped.  Oh, he still did.  They just gave up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They put it on hiatus.  And I have no comments about those charges.  Assange himself said as soon as he started leaking stuff on WikiLeaks, it's just a matter  of time before they come for me.  He stayed in the Ecuadorian embassy, eventually wearing out his welcome.  The Ecuadorians accused him of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  New government in Ecuador too had an impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And remember, the Ecuadorian government has been a strong arm by the US government over  aid for doing things the US didn't like.  And I have to think there might have been some pressure on that along those lines as  well because...  I would imagine.  As soon as he was thrust out of the embassy with his cat, the Metropolitan Police in London  picked him up at the request of US authorities, and they are now attempting to extradite him  to the US.  But the US is not charging him with the Espionage Act.  Famously, the Obama administration decided that that would be frankly too risky.  They were afraid of using that big gun against Julian Assange and decided not to prosecute  or attempt to prosecute him on grounds of espionage because they were afraid that that  could then be used down the road against other journalists.  But the Trump administration, the Department of Justice is going after him for hacking  because there's an email that Assange sent to Chelsea Manning saying...  Right?  It was Chelsea Manning saying...  It was a chat log.  Chat log, not email.  They're chatting about it.  Saying, I'll get my guys on this to help you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  She's trying to match a hash for a password because she was trying to get into the files  using the FTP account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rather than using her own account, which she thought had been overused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To cover her tracks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I give you all, and you guys know this obviously better than I, but I give everybody  this background information so we can now have this conversation because the US still  is not prosecuting him for espionage.  Which would raise a First Amendment issue because of course Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked  the Pentagon Papers, the Nixon administration very much wanted to prosecute him for espionage.  They did break into a psychiatrist's office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think they're going to.  You think they will?  Yeah.  I think this is just the thin edge of the wedge.  That's my fear anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, the extradition agreement apparently he has with the Brits is he can be extradited  only on this specific charge of hacking.  Not on any political charges.  Well, they can't get him and then add charges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure that's what it says.  So it says he can only be extradited for that specific charge, but officials have already  told CNN they're planning more charges.  Interesting.  I mean as soon as they get him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the interesting thing.  Obviously they didn't charge him with interfering in the US election with the Russians.  And obviously the current president has over the time loved WikiLeaks for what it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact said that the Russians didn't hack the election so there'd be no way the  DOJ is going to go after him for that.  Although he claimed to know nothing about it.  His last quote.  I wonder at some point.  Oh yeah, and Trump says I know nothing about WikiLeaks even though he invoked them many  dozens of times during the campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if it's a pro forma prosecution and then Trump pardons him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why would they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well why would they even prosecute him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they work for he.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, he has the individual pardon power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean I think I think the hacking charge or the cracking of password charges a fig  leaf or whatever you want to call it.  I think it's a it's a Trojan horse or I actually think that they are going to try to make a  case if you read the affidavit which goes into a lot more detail than the indictment.  They're talking like 80 percent of what they describe in there are things that journalists  do with sources all the time.  They're talking about them using a secure drop.  They're talking about them using Jabber.  None of which is illegal.  Right, none of which is illegal.  But the affidavit says that all of this is part of a conspiracy on the part of the two  of them to get access to classified documents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  According to the latest, according to Motherboard, the government admitted it doesn't even know  if the password was cracked.  An FBI agent admitted in a newly unsealed court document that DOJ does not know whether  Assange's offer to help Manning came to fruition.  So it sounds like a fairly weak case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some experts have said they don't think based on what is said in these logs that it would  even be possible.  And there's certainly no evidence that Assange even tried.  I mean, he lied to Chelsea Manning routinely.  He could have just said, oh, sure, I'll help you crack that password.  No problem.  I'll get my guys on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, you know, this is the issue.  And certainly, while Assange was the darling of the left after collateral murder, he became  less so when he was seen as a Russian operative, effectively working for the Russian government  during the 2016 election.  Nevertheless, it does raise the specter of, you know, restraint of free speech.  James Ball writing in The Atlantic says you don't have to like Julian Assange to defend  him.  The effort to extradite and prosecute the WikiLeaks founder threatens the free media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, if you look at other people who we've been forced to defend, Larry Flint was no  hero, that's for sure.  You know, you can't choose the people that you build these cases around.  It doesn't mean it's not a threat.  That's the old saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Free speech means nothing if you're defending the speech you agree with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  If it's always people you like.  Right.  Assange, Bell writes...  Russ Bridger wrote one as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you go first, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry.  Bell writes Assange might be an a-hole.  Scratch that.  Assange is an a-hole.  But we're going to have to stand up for him anyway.  What did Russ Bridger write?  James actually worked with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think scratch, by the way, is an unfortunate verb in that choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe not so accidental, but unfortunate.  James probably not knowing James.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  James, by the way, has a book coming out about the internet.  Let's plug that.  James is a wonderful journalist who worked for Assange at WikiLeaks before working for  The Guardian.  Oh, he worked for Assange, so he knows Assange.  Oh yeah, he knows him.  He knows him.  He volunteered to take Assange as a cat.  Well, the Equadorians wish they...  So, Russ Bridger says partnering with Assange was unpleasant, but his work is crucial.  Many conservatives despise him for supposedly imperiling national security.  Liberals would never forgive him for what he did to Hillary Clinton.  He's an information anarchist, dumping vast oceans of material into cyberspace with barely  a thought for the consequences.  He's often portrayed as a useful idiot to Putin.  He jumped bail in Britain, costing his two trusting supporters a small fortune.  He is rude, aggressive, pompous, self-regarding, unreasonable, and even, as multiple sources  say, smelly.  Smelly.  There is, in short, not much not to love about Julian Assange.  But, he goes on, of course, and says that it depends.  The laws protecting free speech should not depend on likeability, mental health, or personal  hygiene of those in the firing line.  And Assange is now very much a target being threatened with extradition to the US to face  charges.  I wonder, is there any chance, Matthew, have you heard, is there any chance the extradition  would not be granted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, I think there is a chance.  I mean, the UK, in particular, if the US didn't take the death penalty off the table, if they  didn't promise that there's no way that the death penalty would become an option.  I don't think the UK would extradite if the death penalty was an option.  So, they might resist on that basis, or they might decide that it doesn't justify the  extradition.  I mean, it's a pretty weak case, if you look at the indictment.  It doesn't, there's no actual proof that Assange did anything, except say something in a chat

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, it's funny, because the Obama administration did not want to prosecute, ultimately.  They wanted to, but they didn't, ultimately, because of the, because of exactly this issue.  Is he a journalist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The fear is that this government, the Trump administration, has been attacking the press  verbally and otherwise, and that this is going to be part of their arsenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The irony of it is that the Trump administration likes Assange and WikiLeaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They liked it when they were doing something they wanted.  But they could use this information to go after...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The last thing that President Trump wants to do is carry President Obama's water.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if they want to go after...  Well, Hillary Clinton also thinks that Assange should pay for what he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if they want to go after leakers, which I think they do, then they're going to try  to criminalize journalist-source relationships, and this allows them to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's the fundamental risk of this, right?  Is that if you start, and this has been attacked, in fact, during the Obama administration,  it was attacked again and again.  They threw people in jail for not revealing sources.  The fundamental risk in this is if journalists can't use sources safely,  sources will dry up and we won't know what's going on.  And end result of this is the public will lose because there will be no way  to see through the veil of government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of veils, though, and trying to go through a number of them in this story,  what do we imagine that WikiLeaks has on Donald Trump?  Well, they might have the dossier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we all have the dossier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We might have the tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If there's a tape.  No, we have the dossier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the tape.  They might have the tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, if the president believed that was the case, that would explain why,  even though Assange could have been a Russian cutout acting on his behalf  during the election, he damn well doesn't want the guy out of the  Ecuadorian embassy.  He wants him somewhere where he...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder whether there's not a scenario where,  oddly, he gets jailed and oddly, he gets prosecuted.  But talking about Trump's been willing to offer...  He just did it.  He just offered his own employees pardons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, which, by the way, I believe is illegal.  It's pretty illegal, yeah.  Because you're supporting a witness if you say,  hey, just don't say anything and I will pardon you when the time comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even the fact that that happened and no one really said anything  and we all just show it's mind-boggling to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The state of affairs is incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I just see a scenario in which Assange is prosecuted on the lease charge  and there's already a quiet deal in place that goes through this  and then you'll double jeopardy all that.  I'll pardon you for everything you've done and we're done.  But why? Why bother?  Because he might have things on Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't, yeah.  I mean, if anybody in the administration knows Assange at all,  I'm sure that guy would turn on you in a second right after...  Yeah, but we're not talking about...  I know they're not geniuses over there,  but someone will have thought of that, presumably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't want to get in bed with Assange, kitty-cat-poop-assange.  Yeah, the guy's a notorious...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Again, though, we've got to defend him because...  Right, that's the problem.  I mean, he's hard to defend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're forced to defend him even though you don't want to defend him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what about this question?  What if he had been...  If a Democrat were in the White House  and he were charged with interfering with the American election as a dupe of Putin?  That's different.  Doing things that is different, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but then you're not charging him with doing journalism,  you're charging him with...  Acting as a foreign agent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  However he would argue, I just released emails, man.  I just got information out there.  That's journalism, he would argue.  I agree with you, Leo, but that's the argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So one of the things we talked about on Twitter on this issue  was the stark contrast between what Edward Snowden did  and what WikiLeaks does.  So Edward Snowden also had a vast trove of information from the NSA  that was illegally exfiltrated.  He knew that he was in jeopardy,  he attempted to do a whistleblowing thing  and was rejected by the agency.  So he said, here's what I'm going to do,  I'm going to take this information,  I'm going to send it to a number of newspapers,  I'm going to flee the country  because I know regardless of what happens  I will be prosecuted for this,  and release it with impunity  and that has a dual effect.  One, that the newspapers...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But with redaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Release it with forethought  and that has a second...  So there's two things,  one, the newspapers aren't going to go to jail  in fact WikiLeaks has been accused  with the diplomatic cables that it released  of putting people in jeopardy,  putting foreign agents in jeopardy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, although there's no evidence,  that any of those cables put anybody in jeopardy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, but nevertheless, Snowden avoided any,  even whiff of impropriety,  the theory being that the Washington Post,  the New York Times, the Guardian,  these people are going to go through it  and clean it up, redact it as you say,  and put out the stuff that the people need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's what fascinates me about this,  about WikiLeaks,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's no editing, no redaction,  it's a dump, literally a dump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's what fascinated me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  about WikiLeaks in the beginning  before Assange sort of lost his mind  and it...  So Ed Snowden went through the sort of traditional  media route,  leaked to the papers and then they published,  WikiLeaks was like this thing outside of all norms of conduct  that was just publishing things  and releasing them on the internet.  And what that did was force people to confront  sort of new media, if you will,  where everyone can be a journalist,  everyone can be a publisher,  everyone can distribute content.  It's the digital Daniel Ellsberg,  it's the digital Pentagon Papers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that changes everything.  No gatekeepers, no...  No...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No gatekeepers,  no...  Just release whatever information you have  and obviously there's problems with that.  But I was fascinated by this sort of non-traditional  journalistic entity  because some of the things it was doing  were clearly journalistic, not all of them.  And I don't know, to be honest,  people keep saying, is Assange a journalist?  Was he a journalist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. What's a journalist?  Here's a fundamental question then.  We accept the First Amendment should protect free speech  and that that free speech should be extended  to journalists, newspapers,  particularly so that truth can be spoken to power.  Does the fact that it's a dump versus a redacted...  Does that change that?  It's irrelevant, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in fact, the First Amendment  doesn't protect journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It protects everybody,  but it's against government restrictions on speech.  The upshot of it is that newspapers  can just with impunity publish what they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the great thing about it.  Well, and the fact that the founding fathers  after writing the First Amendment  immediately broke it  by restricting what newspapers could write about.  It just shows that even the founders  didn't really believe in it.  So it's been under assault ever since.  Nevertheless, I think at least  and we are, by the way,  one of the few, if not only,  countries that has such a First Amendment, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amen, amen.  And it's getting worse and worse and worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with regulation of the net.  So it's a challenge in the digital age  because I think you can make a reasonable case.  Remember that the First Amendment is limited  a little bit.  Was it Felix Frankfurter who said,  but you can't shout fire in a crowded theater  if there isn't a fire.  That's not protected.  So if it endangers people, it's not protected.  But if you used to say,  well, these WikiLeaks data dumps endangered people  Don't try that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, the First Amendment rules  and all the jurisprudence,  you have to prove that there's a tangible  and specific imminent threat.  Tangible and specific imminent threat  to specific individuals.  You can't just say,  this is threatening language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, it was Oliver Wender Holmes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  who was a great actor.  And he actually changed his mind.  The fire in a crowded theater case  is fascinating if you look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a great article in the Atlantic.  Yeah, that's a great article right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says, it's time to stop using that quote,  Trevor and Tim.  It's hugely problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in fact, Holmes changed his mind later  and said it was a dumb decision.  So then you don't think that endangering somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is reason to curtail free speech.  So that's the question.  I know there's been,  I've had discussions with people  about the use of radio in Rwanda, for example.  Radio programs, preachers and so on,  calling for violence,  helped fuel massacres.  We've got lots of examples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  WhatsApp groups in India that create rape squads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  But is WhatsApp to blame for that?  I mean, those people could have just been  talking to each other around a campfire.  There's nothing about the app itself  except that it distributes it much farther and faster  than whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the power of the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think if you're committed to sort of the idea  that free speech and freedom of information  has social benefits that outweigh the disadvantages,  then you pretty much have to support  something like WikiLeaks  even though Julian Assange is an asshole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting because this original fire  in a crowded theater,  which goes back to World War I,  was decided, it was against the Secretary  of the Socialist Party of America.  He wrote a pamphlet  opposing the draft during World War I.  It didn't call for violence,  didn't call for civil disobedience.  The Supreme Court put him in jail  because they ruled it was a clear and present danger  to a nation at war.  So I mean this is far less.  Really, what WikiLeaks has done is far less.  But meanwhile now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we were talking about this last week a lot in the UK,  online harms,  content that is not just illegal and harmful  but legal and harmful is going to be outlawed  and the obligation to do something about that  will be on the platforms, not on government.  And I think that's the biggest challenge  to do something about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  will be on the platforms, not on government.  And it's hugely,  huge chunks of it are so vague  that it's going to be impossible to define  bullying.  You're not allowed to have bullying language,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but what is that?  There's threats to speech all over  and the US too I fear there's talk about saying  well do we have too much speech?  The New York Times Sunday said  the only cure is less Internet.  It's getting to be really true and frightening  not just for the Internet  but for speech as a whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Warren and others are talking about scaling back  Section 230 which gives the platforms  effective immunity for what's on their platforms.  For our speech, for our conversation.  That could change things tremendously if they change it.  We should point out that that's a white paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is not law yet in the UK.  Oh, but it's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, given what's going on in the UK,  it's hard to tell what is going to happen.  It's chaos over there.  I mean, it's a train wreck.  Actually, it's like a train  where each car is a dumpster fire  and it's crashing into a ravine  while the bridge is out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is a mess.  This is a fine mess you've gotten us into, Julian.  It actually seems like the lesser of all these problems  not just this UK online harms white paper  but the approval now of the EU of the new Copyright Act.  That's been gone through its final stages  and this week was finally approved.  Now each country will have to implement it in law  and there may be some variations there, but that is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and think about, I know this is in the lineup,  I think what Starz Entertainment did with my tweets.  Oh yeah, we'll get to that one.  I mean, that's an example of what could happen.  If platforms are incentivized to take things down  before they get into trouble  or block things from being uploaded completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Last week we talked about, and I won't go through it again,  but we talked about a post I wrote  about a proposal for internet courts,  which might sound frightening,  but actually what it says is that matters of legality on the internet  should be settled in courts, not in companies,  with due process in public where we negotiate our legal norms.  And the companies, I think, would love this  because they're being put in position now,  whereas Matthew just said,  if you don't take it down within 24 hours,  you're under a huge fine,  ergo you are going to play it safe  and take down everything you can take down  and cut off the public conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because they got one of those notices from the French copyright...  Said it was filled with terrorism.  They asked them to take down things like grateful dead pages  because it was terrorist  and they have 24 hours to do so or be blocked.  Massive fines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I mean, I like the idea of a court too,  you know, it sounds like a Justice League kind of thing,  but I mean, who is going to be on this court?  Like who's going to decide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was a jurist who proposed this  and the court is a government body.  You have judges,  who are specially trained in the internet  and appointed  as you would judges in any way.  Yeah, who's government? France?  Which government?  No, no, no, no, per nation, per nation.  So you can't have an international.  You have an internet court in every country  dealing with it because you have to  You could, in the EU, theoretically,  you could probably have one across the EU  like you have a human rights court across the EU  and other courts,  but no, otherwise it would have to be per nation

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  of that nation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really  a Sophie's choice here because  or a Hobbesian choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you wind up with a Balkanized internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, Matthew, we're already there.  The platforms say we will enforce the laws  of the nations we're in.  The problem is they're being forced  to make legal judgments with no legal authority  with huge liability.  So what this does is  because that's government saying,  oh, we don't know how to do this,  we're dealing with vague laws  and you're going to constantly be afraid  that you're going to get some stuff wrong,  we're going to find your asses.  Yeah, no risk because they'll filter everything.  Exactly.  Even after Netsdaeke A in Germany,  the German government said,  oh, they're taking down too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, why?  Because they are under a huge liability.  It really is actually almost literally  a Hobbesian dilemma.  Yeah.  that living in a state of nature,  a life which is solitary, poor, nasty,  brutish and short,  or suffering under an arbitrary  and absolute government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds about right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's literally a Hobbesian dilemma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought you meant Calvin and Hobbes.  Well, them too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But honestly, I don't think,  this is basically there is no choice  because both alternatives are terrible.  We've seen regulation at work.  We've seen governments at work.  That's not working.  And yet we've seen an unregulated internet  and that's not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's a real risk that countries  like China and even Russia  are effectively building their own internet.  Well, we've talked about splinter nets as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Won't even be part of it.  The only question is how splintered it will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a piece arguing  that we have four or five internet already.  There's the bourgeois internet of Europe  where they want us to behave.  And there's the misinformation internet  of Russia and North Korea.  Well, and I should point out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that with each of the 50 states now  enforcing their own privacy  and net neutrality laws,  there may be an internet for every state in the union.  Yep.  So that, and clearly that's not...  So we're going to have to have passports

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to go from one website to another.  Yeah, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's, that's the problem.  Yeah, you know what?  That's actually technically achievable.  Of course, that'll really improve the VPN market.  Mm-hmm.  But we can enforce location.  Sure.  Blocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I rescale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can only watch this show  if you live in California, Texas and Florida.  What does the internet resistance look like then?  Yeah.  Well, and this is funny  because this is a conversation that goes way back  and I participated to some degree in this.  I really encourage people to get hacking skills  because I always felt a corporate internet  was going to eventually take over  and that the only way to save the internet  would be have a secret net,  a dark net that was inhabited  by people with the technical skills  to create it and live in it.  And I bet you that's exactly what will happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's what the IndieWeb  and people like that are trying to do  is give people the tools to connect themselves  instead of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, certainly they don't want siloed corporate,  Twitter, social networks and so forth,  but they still want to live in public and in the open.  But I think ultimately that's not even going to be possible  because of government regulation and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to people sort of looking for private places  to gather, private Facebook groups,  WhatsApp groups.  By the way, that's an oxymoron,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a private Facebook group.  We know that now and we're going to talk about that in a second.  There is a lot to talk about, I realize, today.  Yep.  All right, let's take a break.  Matthew Ingram is here.  He is a digital writer, the chief digital writer  at the Columbia Journalism Review, CJR.org  and always a welcome guest.  You were at Globe and Mail, right?  Or were you at the Star?  I was at the Globe, yeah, many years ago.  Many years ago.  You probably saw him on GigaOM and Fortune,  now CJR.  Jeff Jarvis, as I've already mentioned.  Actually, I should read your other title.  Sir Jeff Jarvis, Defender of the Faith, Order of the British Empire.  No, no, that's the wrong one.  There he is.  Professor of Journalism at CUNY.  How about the short version?  By the way, you guys at CUNY,  and I saw Sarah's tweet.  It was great.  Your dean's tweet.  Did I, Carson, did I bookmark that somewhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel inadequate.  My description is nowhere near as long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, you should work on it.  There's Sarah Bartlett, the dean of CUNY,  the new Mark Sparrow.  Scroll down a little bit though, Carson,  because the most important part of that tweet  is her pocket protector, which is in fact a truth protector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was our tribute to our benefactor  and namesake Craig Newmark.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is he a truth protector?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He also wore pocket protectors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, did he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does he still wear pocket protectors?  No, he doesn't now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had a Tech Guy pocket protector I used to give out for years,  and before that we had a ZD net pocket protector.  But I like to live dangerously.  I have a fountain pen in an unprotected pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's expensive pen too.  The pen is worth more than the shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're walking on the wild side there.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One thing that pocket protector and the pen cannot do,  the pen may be mightier than the sword,  but the pen is not mightier than Grammarly.  And I have to say, while I like writing with a pen,  my writing is more coherent and certainly more grammatical  when I do it on a computer because of Grammarly.  Grammarly is a communication tool  that helps people improve their writing  to be mistake-free, clear,  and effective.  The thing I find fascinating is  Paul Therot wouldn't write a word without Grammarly  not because he doesn't know grammar or spelling.  He's very good at that.  But Grammarly does more than just,  it's more than a nanny correcting you.  It's a writing assistant  that helps you improve your communication,  whether it's at school, at work,  on your website, almost anywhere.  Show your best self through writing.  And by the way, Grammarly is available everywhere you write,  including online.  There's an online browser extension,  there's a desktop editor,  Grammarly comes on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge,  on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac.  They do have a free product,  which you should certainly try.  It reviews critical spelling and grammar.  But Grammarly Premium is so much more  and that's what I really want you to look at.  It watches spelling and grammar,  This is the key stuff, style within context.  So it understands whether you're writing a business proposal  or an academic essay or a casual blog post.  It not only understands the context,  it suggests the appropriate style.  It blows me away.  Lisa, who is a good business person, runs our company,  tends to be, she's fast, she has a lot to do,  so she tends to write short emails.  And every once in a while Grammarly said,  maybe you could be a little nicer, in effect.  I think it says, try softening this phrase with this.  You know, you could be a little nicer.  And if I said that, she'd bite my head off.  But if Grammarly says it, she says,  oh, that's a good point, and we'll use it.  It helps you be more concise.  It'll actually grade readability,  so you can say, you know, I'm writing this  for a mass audience,  I want to make this more intelligible.  I'm writing this for a college essay.  I can use those big words.  It actually does make vocabulary suggestions as well.  No more email typos on the phone.  Imagine that.  Close more deals with work  because your emails are more concise, precise.  They say what you want them to say.  Polish your resume, get that new job.  And I love the weekly Grammarly email I get,  which always makes me feel pretty good saying,  you know, I used more big words  than 90% of their other customers  and things like that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's just fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love Grammarly Premium.  So here's the deal, 20% off right now  on the Grammarly Premium account  if you go to Grammarly.com slash twig.  Do I have to spell Grammarly for you?  Probably.  G-R-A-M-M-A-R-L-Y.  There's no E in grammar.  Grammarly.com slash twig.  For 20% off your Premium account.  And by the way, we thank Grammarly  for their support of this week in Google.  We thank you for supporting us  by using that URL.  Grammarly.com slash twig.  I want a truth protector.  I love that.  But I'm not a German student.  We'll get you one.  I still have my CUNY hoodie.  My town high school hoodie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love that thing.  But we have to replace that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because now we have to have a new mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it should say new mark on it.  Yes, it does.  We do have those now.  Craig is a sweet guy.  He's a wonderful unicorn in Silicon Valley.  They made a billion dollars last year  with 80% profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody knows what they make,  but the guesses are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  50 employees.  And he is very humble.  He is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hear that you had gelato with him in Perugia.  I did, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where did you hear that from, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I paid for my own gelato.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just to be clear.  No, I would make him pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Craig has done more for journalism  probably in the last year or two  than anyone in the previous 50 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, this is where the disclaimer should come in  that Facebook,  you work with Facebook, Jeff, on a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I raised money for my school from Facebook,  from Craig Newmark and from others,  but I'm independent of all of them  and received no money personally from Facebook  or Google or Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm very curious what you both think  about this story that came out from NBC.  Now, this is a cache of documents  that actually has been around for a while.  The UK government had it for a while.  We've talked about its provenance before.  It was discovery material in a separate trial  that the UK government kind of got  from the guy.  Facebook was pissed off about it,  but apparently NBC has now seen it  combed through the 4,000 pages  largely from 2011 to 2015  and at least according to their characterization.  I want to emphasize that  because they're not quoting this verbatim.  They're characterizing what they read.  So it is conceivable that they're mischaracterizing it.  So I want to give Facebook the benefit of that.  However, if their characterization is accurate,  this is the smoking gun  that is the final nail in the coffin,  the end of Facebook as we know it.  Not to oversell it.  Not to oversell it, but when I read this,  I went OMG, I'm sure glad I don't use Facebook.  The documents, let me just read their  NBC's characterization  and I want to be fair to Facebook.  So any quibbles or caveats.  The documents which include emails, web chats,  presentations, spreadsheets and meeting summaries  show how Zuckerberg along with his board  and management team found ways  to tap Facebook's trove of users  and user data, your data, my data, our data  including information about friends, relationships,  even photos as leverage over companies it partnered with.  In some cases, Facebook would reward favorite companies  by giving them access to the data.  In other cases, it would deny data access  to rival companies or apps.  For instance, Amazon got extended use of that data  because it was spending money on Facebook advertising  and partnering with them on the launch of the Fire Phone.  On the other hand, Facebook discussed cutting off access  to user data for a messaging app  that had grown too popular and was viewed as a competitor.  This is all they say, but not quoting,  they say in the documents.  And even worse, all the while,  Facebook was formulating a strategy  to publicly frame these moves  as a way of protecting user privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a win-win.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  LAUGHS  I know, I shouldn't be shocked,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but at this point, this is a criminal breach of our trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, but, but, OK, I don't know.  The problem here is,  it's because they're not quoting what data.  There were rules in place for every app builder.  Let's go back to the time when Facebook thought of itself  as a platform for apps.  And at that time, when you wrote apps,  if you followed certain rules, you got access to data.  So now data has become the grand scare word.  Oh my God, data!  Well, data is just information, and it depends on what data.  It depends on what your expectation was.  It depends upon all of that.  So it becomes...  ...meanless, without that kind of specificity,  as to what it was.  Did they do bad things?  Maybe they did.  I don't know.  But this whole notion of that we're going to trade access to data  for certain behavior is the way that Facebook  is operating from the beginning.  And by the way, every media company operates.  You buy ads, you get access to data about the users there.  That's the way it's operated for a very long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think the one thing that, that you could say  about some of what NBC is talking about is that  there's a clear potential antitrust aspect  that Facebook is using its users' data  and giving it to certain partners and not to other partners,  especially if those other partners have a messenger app  that is a threat to Facebook.  I mean, that's a very clear...  Well, in the years when this was supposedly happening,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  they weren't as big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they were still pretty big.  2011 to 2014, they were pretty big.  They were pretty big.  Facebook's response is...  I thought it was 2005.  Let me... I'm sorry, I may be misquoting.  Let me go back.  I thought I could be wrong.  2011 to 2015.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were pretty big.  And I think that's a very obvious antitrust  or potential antitrust problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook's response is that the documents were cherry picked.  They were cherry picked during the...  The reason these documents exist,  there was a lawsuit by 643,  the creators of the Pikinis app.  Facebook says they cherry picked those documents  from years ago as part of a lawsuit  to force Facebook to share information  on friends of the app's users.  The set of documents by design  because it's being used in a lawsuit  tells only one side of the story  and emits important context.  We still stand by the information...  The platform changes we made in 2014-15  with developers like the creators of Pikinis.  The documents were selectively leaked  and part of what the court found  was evidence of a crime or fraud  at Facebook at the time of our platform changes.  But the facts are clear, Facebook says,  and this is actually Facebook's  Vice President and Deputy General Counsel Paul Gruel,  the facts are clear, we've never sold people's data.  That's a non-denial denial  They did talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They talked about it.  But it shouldn't surprise us.  Media companies, I know,  they've been smart enough to get any damn data,  talked about whether there was...  I've sat in media companies  Indeed, when I worked at Time Inc,  we sold data.  We sold your name and your address  and what you subscribed to.  We sold lists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what we did as part of our business.  Sure, exactly.  If you've got a mailing list, that's valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can sell it.  But it shouldn't be aggregated around that  by companies like Axion.  So this has been part of the media business  for a very long time.  Again, I'm not trying to defend Facebook here,  but I am trying to say  that we don't know enough  to come to grand conclusions  that this is, oh my God, it's a smoking gun.  It's the worst thing that could happen.  We just don't know enough.  Given the...  One more thing, Matthew.  My chair is a really lonely one  trying to defend the internet,  but I fear if you look at what's happening  with regulation in Europe,  this kind of talk without evidence  could lead to things like this from the UK  and could hurt the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to defend the internet,  but Facebook is not the internet  and in fact, Facebook damages the internet  more than any conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because as you said earlier,  you might have to defend...  To go to your view,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you might have to defend Julian Assange  to defend speech.  Well, but for Facebook to say  we keep your data private,  and in fact, the implicit,  the very implicit promise of Facebook  is you put your private stuff on there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and friends can see it, nobody else.  That is that you control  who can see your data now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I put everything on there as public  and I was very clearly public.  I don't want to share something  on Facebook to your family.  Do you expect them to sell it  to somebody else?  Not selling it.  Or give it to a favorite partner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what happens, Leo,  don't be naive.  That's what happens when an advertiser  targets an ad,  they're getting access to the data.  They're making use of that data

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to target that ad.  That's one of the reasons  I want to understand this better.  But they could be characterizing  that kind of behavior  as giving data up  or actually giving people the data.  Because Facebook might say,  well, yes, you can buy  an ad against a demographic,  but that doesn't mean we're giving you  information about Leo.  And so that's the real question is.  And absolutely,  NBC sells ads against the demographic  all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody does.  I sat in a meeting with Google  where the publishers were all  saying to Google, give us data,  give us data, give us data.  And Google said no.  And they said if you want access  to the value of that data,  you use our ad server and you get  access, but we don't give you the data.  That's the way this operates.  So yes, there's access to the data  to that extent.  And yes, you can target things  and you can do things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where the data is residing,  this talk becomes very naive at that point.  But it's not like the oceans more data  than any media entity that's ever existed.  And I was like,  companies are too damn stupid

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to have done this on their own.  But are you saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, once they should have done this  and didn't.  But are you saying users are stupid

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for trusting that Facebook wouldn't do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they dumb for not realizing,  well, everybody does it.  What's the what that they're doing  that you're accusing them of doing?  Well, that's the question.  And if you don't punch your phone  because of this fact, this fact,  and this fact, that's the nature  of media advertising today.  Absolutely.  So we don't,  you're indicting,  and there may be reason to indict Facebook.  They're doing lots of stupid things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not denying that.  But let's not have the trial without the evidence.  And to be fair to Facebook,  we should point out that the Pikinis app  that was in this lawsuit  that this data came from,  is to peek at people in bikinis.  And the way you got that information  is getting photos, not just from you,  but from your friends  and Facebook cut them off.  Saying, you know, you can't get photos  not just of the people  who are using the Pikinis app,  but their friends and friends of friends.  That's when Facebook very famously  turned off that friends of friends feature.  Yeah.  And that's a pretty reprehensible use

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of that data.  That is because all these things start  with good intentions and good use  and then bad people come along  and figure out how to exploit it to the ill.  And the tech companies never saw enough  what could have happened  and then they got caught in arrears.  That's the reality we've got to deal with now.  So now you have to assume the worst  more often than we did in the early days  of the internet.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We didn't do that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  I think that we have to hold off  until there's more than just  a characterization of the evidence.  But it's kind of like the bar report.  We got the four page letter.  This is the four page letter.  So he's going to have a press conference  tomorrow at 9.30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Onion said he's going to do  a representative dance of it.  There is, of course,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in this internet,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  the idea of the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is that there is, of course,  in these there are email,  there are reactions,  there are discussions.  But again, a lot of internal company  discussions might propose  that they do something that they never do  for very good reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and that's not a smoking gun.  I have read some really stupid memos  in my day and written a few.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We could do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's some.  There are a few quotes in here.  I've seen a long email to Facebook's  senior leadership team saying  Facebook shouldn't charge developers  for access to basic data feeds.  He said that access to Facebook data  should be contingent on the developers  sharing all of the social content  generated by their apps  back to Facebook,  something Zuckerberg called full reciprocity.  The existing arrangement  where developers weren't required  to share their data back  with Facebook might be  good for the world,  but it's not for the world.  It's not for the world.  It's for the world.  And I think that's the kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  cynicism that worries me.  It's the kind of bluntness  that happens inside companies.  I've been inside company meetings  where executives kind of cackle  about how can we  get as much money out of subscribers  and fool them into...  I was around in my industry  when the credit card  subscription came in  and I was trying to convince people  who were dead and stopped reading  the magazine to still charge them for it  because they didn't know how to cancel it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Companies do bad stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And may even talk about bad stuff  in their emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they talk about bad stuff  and they cackle about bad stuff  and doesn't make them bad or good yet.  Yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say,  disheartened day before yesterday,  I'm at home, it's a day off,  Lisa texts me,  Notre Dame is burning  and it's a terrorist attack.  And of course it isn't.  It wasn't.  It looks like it was arson,  not arson, but accidental,  whether it was arson intentional  or accidental fire,  they're not sure still.  But nobody is asserting it was a terrorist attack  except YouTube  and they had a fact checking article  from Wikipedia about 9-11.  They initially, apparently they're automated  and this is all automated stuff, I'm sure,  because no sane human would have done this.  Their automated stuff  flagged it as potentially fake news  and they wanted to  and they put their fact checking  information up under it.  But this really does kind of underscore  why algorithms have a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what, Leo?  I had, before that happened  and before that came out,  I saw many people on Twitter say,  oh my God, this reminds me of 9-11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it sure did when you saw the steeple fall.  It looked so much like 9-11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so,  I get the criticism of YouTube in this case  and it doesn't help them,  but I also,  they're mimicking human behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, great.  I would actually hope for better.  That's part of the problem.  Both Lisa and I were very saddened  on purpose as it turned out.  Of course, it wasn't the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it was...  My favorite story in all of this,  which was a, I think, Atlantic story,  the guy who died not long ago  who was an architecture expert  and he took a detailed laser map  of the entire structure.  I saw that, wasn't that cool?  Which could well help with the reconstruction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a lovely story.  They built detailed models  when they were doing Assassin's Creed as well.  Oh, wow.  Inside and outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A YouTube spokesperson said,  those informational panels are triggered algorithmically.  Our systems sometimes make the wrong call.  We're disabling these panels for live streams  related to the fire.  YouTube correctly,  this is the Verge writing,  and quickly identified the Notre Dame fire  as a breaking news event,  surfaced trusted news outlets  near the top of the search results.  And the algorithm, in fact, worked as intended.  It really just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're getting better at this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not an indictment of YouTube,  but it is an indictment of algorithmic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's why every time Mark Zuckerberg says,  you know, AI is going to solve this problem,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that just...  It's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to Google I.O., right, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  So I'm thinking,  Tuesday is the keynote.  Keynote.  So I'll take some medication to get me over the bridge  to come up Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got a bottle of whiskey I'll have for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff is not driving, so it's okay.  No, I'll be driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the problem.  Oh, you're going to drive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, how else do I get up there?  Well, I think we could...  Jeff would gladly pay for an Uber.  No, we'll gladly pay for a car for you.  Well, that's all right.  It's worth it.  Jason Howell will be going.  I think Florence Ion, both from All About Android,  and Jeff, we will be covering the...  It's going to be a tough week, a big week,  because Build, the Microsoft Developers Conference,  is at the same time again this year.  So Monday...  Google, Microsoft, Google, Microsoft.  Well, we're going to do both of them,  because I'm fair.  So Monday we'll be doing the Microsoft keynote  with full knowledge that last year it was so long  they had to have a stretch break in the middle,  three and a half hours.  What did they announce that was so...  Nothing.  In fact, to be honest,  I seriously considered not covering it.  Then I thought, we're going to do Google's  developer event the next day,  Apple's the next month.  We really have to.  You don't cover F8.  No, I refuse.  We had a couple of times we ran the F8 stuff  and it was so horrible  that we decided never to do it again.  And we have not missed anything newsworthy since,  I might add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to go to F8,  I just decided I got too much work at home,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so I'm going to go this year.  But we will do the Google keynote,  first, I'm sorry, the Microsoft keynote at Build,  all however many hours.  Then it will be a special edition of Windows Weekly  following that.  And then the next day,  we'll do the Google I.O. event  followed by, I guess,  depending on how long,  Google at least is a little disciplined  with their keynotes.  They used to do two days,  that was a tough one for us,  but they've got it down to  I think just a couple hours now.  No, I don't think so.  That's too hard.  We'll let you guys enjoy,  go look at stuff,  and get a phone if such a thing.  Well, look at this,  Google teases new Pixel announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They give us the cheap one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, why not?  The 3A and 3A XL are set for an announcement that day,  May 7th,  we've seen a lot of details.  The Google stores page says,  help is on the way,  which is by the way,  the tagline also for the Avengers end game,  the apparently hotly awaited movie about comic book heroes.  This is the Google store image,  help is on the way on May 7th,  something big is coming to the Pixel universe.  So, I don't know, maybe the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they're fooling us that it's not the 3A,  that it's something else in the Pixel world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely, for instance,  they already have Avengers  in the augmented reality thing in the camera,  it could just be some special end game content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It could be a new watch,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it could be a new Pixelbook.  There have been rumors of both new watches  and the return of the Google Pixelbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could be.  Which I'm dying for,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  mine's getting a little on the tooth here.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway-  Kevin Trouful's happy with his, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he loves it.  So, we will be covering that event  and then the next day,  I'm going to be up across the bridge,  I have scattered cupcakes to lure attractive men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, mine will be stale by then, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want some cute boys to come pick up cupcakes.  So, again, it'll be a special in-studio version  of this week in Google,  that'll be May 8th, few weeks from now.  By the way, speaking of YouTube,  I don't know what to make of this Bloomberg article  because I don't even understand what the metric would be,  but according to Mark Bergen and Lucas Shaw writing in Bloomberg,  to answer critics, YouTube tries a new metric, responsibility.  Yeah, I don't even know what that means.  And Bloomberg does not make it clear in any way.  So, of course, the traditional reward is views and subscriptions, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they also use quality watch time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is new.  So, the Google division introduced two new internal metrics  in the past two years for gauging how well videos are performing,  according to people familiar with the company's plans.  One tracks the total time people spend on YouTube.  That includes not only watching video,  but posting comments and reading comments.  The other is called,  quality watch time.  A squishier statistic, writes Bloomberg,  with a noble goal to spot content that achieves  something more constructive  than just keeping users glued to their phones.  Well, I don't know what that would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's not clear how they're coming up with it.  Are they just surveying users?  Did you think this was a quality experience?  Are they testing it with human beings?  Do you think this was a quality suggestion?  It's unclear how they even come up with it.  I mean, it sounds great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  YouTube declined to comment on the new metrics,  but a spokeswoman said,  there are many metrics we use to measure success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what they say.  Both platforms do a lot of that,  of asking people after something.  So I think that's a likely...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's such a vague criteria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's hard to...  This is a discussion I had in Perugia,  but I didn't have any gelato when I was there.  I did have a rancher.  I should have.  I had no gelato in Perugia.  But...  So I had this conversation  with one of the platform executives  a few weeks ago  where I said,  we keep on going to you guys and saying,  clean up the Gundit world,  but we won't clean it up ourselves.  There's a big standards effort in journalism  and who's in the room?  RT, European Broadcasters Union.  Who's on stage?  RT.  Digital content next.  Who's a member?  Fox News.  They're all very good at things.  So does the New York Times.  So does every organization.  We don't criticize our own field.  We don't hold ourselves to account  in our own field in any way  and we're expecting the platforms to know best.  They don't know what quality is.  They don't know what journalism is.  They have no idea,  but we won't do it ourselves.  And I'm starting to think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's time for the anti-pilotser.  By the way, congratulations  to the Pilotser Pulitzers.  Some really good work done  and the Pulitzers were rewarded yesterday.  I did not get one.  You did not?  South Florida Sun Sentinel  got one for their coverage of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas  high school shooting.  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.  We know what happened in Pittsburgh.  It's a shame that  it seems like the best way to get a Pulitzer  is to cover a mass shooting.  Yeah.  University of Southern California  gynecologist George Tindall  who sexually abused hundreds of students  at the campus clinic,  the coverage in the LA Times of that.  That definitely deserved an award.  I really liked the  New York Times investigation of Trump's finances.  That was a really great piece.  I worked with Suzanne Craig.  Did you?  At the Globe and Mail, yeah.  Nice. David Barstow, Suzanne Craig  and Russ Buettner.  18 months.  This is why journalism is expensive  and hard to do well.  I don't think the Pulitzer pays you back,  but I'm sure the Times is glad to celebrate.  18 months they worked on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just for fun I looked into  how you're supposed to pronounce it.  Pulitzer.  Lots of people say Puelitzer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not Pue.  Is it ProPublica

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good question.  I say ProPublica.  Yeah, Pueblica.  Who says Pueblica?  How about Pueblica?  Definitely wrong.  We should edit that out.  Definitely wrong.  Edit that out.  It's the Pulitzers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pulitzer.  It sounds like putz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's more like pull I think.  Pulitzer.  Pulitzer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That may be a matter of accident.  Yeah, from Boston.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I ever get one I'll know how to pronounce it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you'll learn.  It's pronounced the Nobel Prize.  Actually I was looking at the YouTube metrics.  They do have a lot of signals.  Of course they have the like buttons  and they have the,  but they do do surveys as well.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They do ask people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was talking about Facebook.  We've got to mention this piece in Wired.  Scandals, backstabbing, resignations, reboots, record profits and time bombs.  I didn't get through it all yet.  No, it's very long.  It's really as long as the 15 months of fresh hell inside Facebook.  It is a good piece.  Nicholas Thompson and Fred Vogelstein writing in the business section of Wired.  I was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Nick reported in Davos last year.  Oh yeah.  I was at an event where he cornered Cheryl for quite a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting.  It is kind of interesting how,  think about how Wired was covering Facebook and Google  not that long ago.  You know, a few years ago maybe.  It's been quite a turnaround.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but Nick has been reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm not talking about Nick.  He's been inspired as a whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, I mean he's been a certain boost to equality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say though,  I'm going to reiterate something I started to kind of say earlier,  which is if you'd want to defend the internet,  you need to also not only defend it against moral panic and bad governments,  but you need to also defend it against bad actors on the internet.  They do more damage than anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I would argue that Mark Zuckerberg's primary motivating goal is to become the internet.  And in some countries like Myanmar and Cambodia and the Philippines,  Facebook is the internet.  And that's not good, I would argue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in countries like China, the government is the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, also not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a hogsie choice, you might say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, literally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's why I want to be part of the internet resistance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't even scroll through the whole article, let alone read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to be part of the planetary internet.  Wherever John Perry Barlow is, that's where I want to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's good music, that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was some interesting stuff in that piece though, the Wired one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't a rehash of everything we already know?  Well, there was some, but there was more detail about different things.  So there was a lot more detail about why the guys at Instagram left.  And we've read a little bit of it, but I think it's a good thing.  There was more detail about how things worked out.  Basically, from the sounds of it, Mark decided that Instagram was effectively competing with Facebook.  And so he removed a lot of the growth drivers and connections that were helping Instagram.  And then he introduced things that the Instagram guys had always resisted, like Facebook.  And so he removed a lot of the growth drivers and connections that were helping Instagram.  And then he introduced things that the Instagram guys had always resisted, like hamburger menus and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did they imply that he put in hamburger menus to reduce the growth?  Because that would be an interesting use of hamburger menus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they did imply though, they suggested that Kevin Systrom thought some of these changes were made deliberately to try and get him to leave.  Just to get him mad so that he would quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can't fault Mark for looking at the overall health of the company instead of just one division.  That's kind of his job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's very similar to what happened with the WhatsApp guys.  Almost identical.  Yeah, Facebook said, look, we're going to do a bunch of stuff.  And I know we said we weren't going to do that, but now we are.  So long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mark Zuckerberg's card, very famously for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does it still say, I'm CEO bitch?  No, he got rid of those.  Somebody suggested in the chat room his card should read, I'm the internet now bitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those cards are in a locker along with his flip flops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and his hoodies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should I play the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  The movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey everyone, we are live from my backyard.  The song I'm going to play is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This song is from the live stream Mark did from his backyard one Saturday afternoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  While he was smoking meat.  Smoking meat, it takes a long time sitting around...  Totally realistic looking backyard, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the fence is going to go on fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Totally a set.  Someone's going to push the fence over.  The boom mic will come in.  I think they're the song I'm going to play.  Zuckerberg.  Oh no, it seems I was daydreaming again.  A human being enjoys...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is actually a good part. Show this part.  This is pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems I was daydreaming again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why I made clear that you have had subpoenas.  Is that correct?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mr. Zuckerberg, what is Facebook doing to prevent foreign actors from interfering in US elections?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We are smoking meat.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Meat like a brisket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm making meat now.  I'm sorry, there's no reason to play this.  It's going to be delicious.  I'm talking to you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I do enjoy it.  I do enjoy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He always seems like a poorly programmed android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm fritzing out a little bit.  The reason I thought of that is because in the song he says,  I'm wearing my weekend purple t-shirt.  At work I wear my grey t-shirt.  That's what made me think of it.  I think that's old anyway.  Sorry I even brought it up.  It has no news benefit whatsoever.  You're not sorry.  I'm not sorry.  Sorry, not sorry.  What else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are we still talking about the wired thing?  Yeah, if you want.  The other thing that I thought was interesting, at least I don't know if anybody else would be interested,  was the drama involving Chris Cox,  who was at one time Mark's right hand man.  Fair hand boy.  And most of Facebook.  And it sounded like there was a pretty significant falling out in part  because of what Mark wanted to do with news.  There's a bunch of stuff in there.  And obviously a lot of it is hearsay, but it's interesting.  Because that was a pretty big departure.  Yeah, it was a shock when he left.  A lot of people thought he would take over at some point.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually Cox is one of the people who helped Mark get rid of Instagram's system  and slow Instagrams going down.  The Wired article implies that it was a shift in power.  Some of the company's most senior executives, notably Chris Cox,  thought Facebook needed to give serious publishers a leg up.  Others pushed back, including Joel Kaplan,  a former deputy chief of staff to George W. Bush.  That's the other interesting thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Kaplan's argument apparently was if we introduce quality rankings,  everyone will assume we're against conservatives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Supporting high quality outlets would inevitably make it look like the platform  is supporting liberals, which could lead to trouble in Washington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kaplan, remember, was the guy who sat behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right behind Kavanaugh, yeah.  It mentions that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And threw a party for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But apparently at the end of the climactic meeting on July 9th,  Zuckerberg sided with Kaplan  and he tabled the decision about boosting publishers,  effectively killing the plan.  To one person involved in the meeting,  it seemed like a sign of shifting power.  Cox had lost, Kaplan had won.  And of course the upshot was that news organizations lost big time.  Yeah, but the other thing they mentioned,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and I had forgotten about this part,  was that Chris Cox apparently was not a fan of the new move towards  private encrypted ephemeral messaging.  So he was, I guess, resisting that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the story we had seen  because it came right after Zuckerberg's manifesto about going crime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Chris was in charge of the Facebook product  and all that it represented.  What does that leave?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, I was all excited about that.  Remember I even reactivated my Facebook account  and since absolutely nothing has happened in that direction,  I now see it as a ruse effectively  and I have deactivated, in fact, deleted my Facebook account.  But I did something the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember when they said they were going to implement a switch  where you could clear your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, I'm leaving Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fool me seven times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fool me every single freaking day.  So maybe I've been fooled again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they said it was going to take a long time to do this.  Don't leave, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is going to take a long time.  We're working on it.  I'll create a new account when that happens.  when they said we want to make people feel more safe on Twitter  saying that they are going to be more proactive.  In fact, taking action without reports,  people who don't feel safe on Twitter  shouldn't be burdened to report abuse to us.  Previously we only reviewed potentially abusive tweets  if they were reported to us.  We know that's not acceptable.  Wow, that's a big change.  So we are making it a priority.  in addition to relying on people's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But is that actually going to change that much?  when they flag a tweet,  the response is almost always  that doesn't breach our terms and conditions.  Yeah, I saw a shocking one yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, some of them are horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Twitter said, well, that doesn't violate our...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Death threats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, that's the problem,  not their ability to kind of do it in advance  or wait for you to flag.  It's the criteria they're using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say this time last year  I think that's too low enough.  I don't know if that's the right number.  Today, by using technology,  38% of abusive content that's enforced  is surfaced proactively for humans.  Technology.  We're using technology.  To keep people safe.  So I reactivate my Twitter account  because if that's true, if they...  Well, I thought, you know, here's one way to find out.  All right.  I'm going to put my big fat butt on Twitter  and see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because you actually...  I'm shocked that you retweeted the Dean's tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought, well,  let's see if they're serious about reducing abuse.  Mm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because, you know...  Somewhere there's an algorithm that says  it's like the old dead or Canadian.  Is Leo here or is Leo not?  Is Leo here or is Leo not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, even my wife was shocked to see me tweeting.  Jack Dorsey suggests big change for Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.  Oh, and this pisses people off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you could follow topics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He suggests a fundamental change to the social network  in which users would follow topics instead of individuals.  They are an interest-based network  so you'll see content from anyone sharing the same interest  as opposed to...  And by the way, this is just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is just the discover tab, right?  Basically.  Which I never use.  Which no one ever uses, yeah.  No.  You know what amazes me is whenever Jack talks,  like forget about the wardrobe and all that,  forget about the weird diet.  The Myanmar, yeah, right.  I mean, the thing that always strikes me is  it's like a guy who has never used his own product is talking.  Well, look at him!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's mind-boggling.  I have a lot of respect for Jack Dorsey.  He's created some very amazing things, including Square.  Maybe he doesn't use Twitter.  I don't know.  Maybe he shouldn't.  His experience of Twitter is inevitably different  from any other person's experience.  His experience of everything is different.  Yes.  And his diet isn't that weird.  It's normal to fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's you saying that.  You are not the judge of weird diets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm only all a cupcake diet.  By the way, I have been handed a pocket protector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently, I offended my staff that I might get my pen on my shirt.  Nice.  ZDTV.  Or ZD as we call it.  ZDTV.  Canadians call it what?  Anything else?  What else should we talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Secret Service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was a strange story.  We talked a couple of weeks ago about the woman who was arrested at Mar-a-Lago  carrying a number of things.  Numerous cell phones and passports.  And I think fairly significant.  Given that the president was in residence at Mar-a-Lago,  a malware-infested USB stick.  The fact that she got so far is already amazing.  She also had a laptop.  $8,000 in cash.  And a camera detector.  By the way, how does that work?  I guess it's based on the radio signals from the radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Don't you watch MacGyver?  They make them in China.  They're $1.98 on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you can get them on Amazon.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She had nine USB drives, five SIM cards, and a partridge in a pear tree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  However, the thing that got my attention from the Miami Herald office  was that she had a USB drive.  And she had a USB drive.  And she had a USB drive.  And she had a USB drive.  However, the thing that got my attention from the Miami Herald article  about all of this is what the Secret Service did.  Yeah, he plugged it into his computer.  They caught her!  Secret Service agent Samuel Ivanovich, who interviewed Jang on the day of arrest,  testified at her hearing.  He stated, when another agent put Jang's thumb drive into his computer,  red light, bells, and flags going up now,  it immediately began to install files.  Oh, you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a very out of the ordinary event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A very what?  That's not that out of the ordinary.  Come on, you work at the Secret Service?  A very out of the ordinary event that he had never seen happen before.  During this kind of analysis, we stick thumb drives in all the time.  This never happens.  The agent had to immediately stop the analysis to halt any further corruption of his computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love how he says another agent put it into his computer.  Yeah, not me.  It wasn't me.  It was someone from Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a Canadian agent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just found a camera protector, camera detector.  It would only work if it was wireless.  You could disable them too.  No, not according to this.  that allows users to detect, identify, and locate hidden cameras of any kind.  transmitting or in standby mode.  If the lens is pointing outward in surveillance mode,  like the whole internet,  the hidden camera detector will be able to identify it.  That's going to be useless. It's going to go off all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, let's order one, just to see if it notices that I'm on camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Through the spy finder lens, a hidden camera lens appears as a bright flickering spot of light,  making it easy for the user to identify and locate if necessary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, interesting. Handy.  I might buy that.  What? $248?  Look at that, your computer for analysis.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  She had that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's also a deluxe professional camera detector that's $599.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Comes with a backpack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do remember buying X-ray specs from the back of a comic book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure you would have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A great disappointment, I might add.  And Sea Monkeys.  Sea Monkeys work.  They were Brian Shrimp.  Okay, but Sea Monkey by any other name would swim as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the little male Sea Monkey did not have a briefcase and a top hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that was misrepresentation, absolutely.  So I'll see, I'll report back on my experiences using it.  You can go to Mar-a-Lago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Never before has the Secret Service had to deal with this type of scenario.  Never saw this. This never happened.  Never before.  It's like computers were just invented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So just in case you don't know,  I'm sure every single person watching this show knows that you do not pick up a USB stick off the ground  and stick it into your computer ever.  And if you do, make sure it is not a Windows computer and auto run is not turned on.  Unbelievable.  I guess try it on a Linux computer,  although there are firmware hacks called Bad USB  that you can put on a USB stick that will infect anything.  So essentially if you're going to analyze a USB stick,  you really shouldn't do it by sticking it into your computer.  This would be a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And don't go to China and do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, right.  I think the Chinese secret police would know enough not to do that.  Probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this was the secret agent they sent down there to drive the golf cart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Obviously, yeah.  It's the golf cart guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maxwell Smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There has to be different levels, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's got to be like not a great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This guy is not on the tech team.  He's not on the tech team.  And I'm sure as soon as this came out,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  the guys in the tech team are going, you did what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because now, I mean, if that computer was on the Wi-Fi at Mar-a-Lago, you're screwed.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure it's fine.  I'm sure nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll just wait until President Xi comes out again and he can sweep it.  Illinois Bill, which I thought was a good idea, but maybe Mr. Techno Panic, you don't.  There was an Illinois Bill banning eavesdropping by IoT devices.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I knew you were going to like the name of the bill even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Eavesdropping.  The Keep Internet Devices Safe Act was, what is it?  Kitsa was passed April 10th.  Did you see the image they used?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's from the Alexa Silver edition.  Yeah, it's from Saturday Night Live's wonderful skit for seniors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many old satchel pages you got last night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alexandria!  Oh, Dessa!  Oh, Dessa!  By the way, we gave one to Lisa's dad who persisted calling it Alexa.  Nice.  And he says, what's wrong with that?  She responds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does she?  Interesting.  I actually think they should make one.  They should just take whatever they had in that.  It answers to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Give me a cupcake.  The bill, as passed by the Senate, says no private entity may turn on or enable a digital  device's microphone unless the registered account holder and another user that is setting  up or configuring the device first agrees to the following information in a consumer  agreement or privacy notice notifying the registered account holder, one, that the  microphone in the digital device will be turned on or enabled, that, two, what command or  action will turn on or enable the microphone.  It's not Alexandria.  It's not Odessa.  Three, the categories of sounds the microphone will be listening for, recording or disclosing  and, four, the categories of third parties to which the sounds may be disclosed.  The bill also requires any recordings or other personal information captured by devices  to protect against unauthorized access, acquisition, destruction, use, modification  and disclosure of the data.  Now, here's the thing.  As soon as the lobbyists heard about it, they went in there.  They actually didn't rewrite the law.  They just took out one little line, the line that says it's punishable.  So now there's no...  The Internet Association...  There's no enforcement.  They're getting smart.  Yeah, the original bill would have made this an unlawful practice under the Consumer Fraud  and Deceptive Business Practices Act, which would result in fines of up to $50,000 per  case.  The Internet Association managed to get them to take that line out.  Because it would create significant legal liability for companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know if you've had this problem, but my device often just randomly  responds to things that aren't even commands.  Like the TV says something or...  All the time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I still can't figure out why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, because it hears things.  I know, but it doesn't...  Nothing even close to the name.  You think.  And then it just starts responding.  That's what you say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It might have heard its name.  I guess.  I'll come into the kitchen.  We have a Siri HomePod in the kitchen and it's usually turned out pretty low.  And I'll hear Siri mumbling to herself in the kitchen like a crazy person, just talking  on and on and on.  How come Leo never talks to me anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like...  And then I told him I'm not going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway.  Well, my favorite was the one not that long ago where it recorded a conversation and then  sent it to someone because it misheard the command to record.  That happened to you?  No, to someone...  I'm trying to remember the story now.  Oh, this is a big deal.  It actually emailed a copy to someone on the contact list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sent a fight between a husband and wife to a former client of that husband who was  still on his contact list.  It sent them...  And the guy went, what is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You look at the process of mistaken things it had to go through.  Amazon's like, well, first it mistakenly heard a command to record, then it mistakenly heard  And it mistakenly heard someone say yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  None of that's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except once in a while.  Anyway, I had the same reaction as you when I first read it, Jeff.  I said, oh, great.  I mean, the moral panic is going to mean we can't have nice things anymore.  They're going to get rid of all Echo and Google Assistant and all that stuff.  So I did kind of feel the same way as you did, Jeff, which is...  I mean, generally, they should be transparent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They should have these rules.  That's all fine.  But the basis of this is, let's also recognize state legislators trying to get stories about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, this is the best of both worlds where they passed a law, but it has no effect.  It's just exactly what they were hoping for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was another state legislature that was trying to pass a law that would create a journalistic license effectively.  I'm trying to remember which state that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A license to commit journalism?  Yeah, and you'd have to be registered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a licensed journalist.  The guy who proposed it, apparently, is not a fan of the people who cover the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  ...capital.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.  They have licenses in Italy, actually, which is interesting.  Really?  You have to get a license, yeah.  It's like an ACRA card.  So once you get your license, then you can get paid sort of market rates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unlicensed journalist.  The Google changelog.  Changelog.  The Google Pixel camera, and this will get people going, is now looking to see if you're kissing.  Snoggovision.  If you have a Google Pixel, there is AI.  Google actually revealed this in a blog post that it will help you take selfies by looking for you to smile.  Actually, Mike Elgin was using a really cool feature, a photo booth, where when it sees people smile, it takes a picture.  So he set up his Pixel last time he was here on a tripod and just said, you know, don't worry about it.  So he gets all these great pictures.  But now we will know if you're kissing.  They've added kiss detection to photo booths.  By the way, isn't that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can see the story now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By my way, I'll take a picture if you smile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want this... I like this photo booth feature, and I have a Pixel, but I've really lately been using the Samsung S10, which I just adore.  You like it better than the Pixel?  Yeah. Well, the Pixel camera is bested by none, especially Nightshot.  But it's a little janky in other respects.  It's not a great screen, and I've had problems with it.  It's not a good screen, but it's a good screen.  I think there's a quality control issue.  But the Samsung is fantastic.  And the camera is great in good light.  The only thing that's not as good as the Nightshot, which Google somehow is doing black magic there.  Google Pay can now automatically import loyalty cards, tickets, and offers all you have to do is give it access to your Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh-oh. Google Pay spied on you.  It knows what you buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tripit did that, where you give Tripit your Gmail.  I finally decided... I turned that all off, and now I just say...  You used to love that.  Well, I forward it. If you forward it to plans at Tripit, it'll still do it.  But I don't want Tripit going through...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love that Google puts things automatically in my calendar, flights and stuff.  Yeah, me too, actually. I like that, too.  I miss Google Inbox for many reasons, one of which is that it would put my travel stuff together in one clump.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I stopped using Gmail mostly because I was getting a lot of French spam.  What do you use now?  Fastmail, which is a third-party paid service, a good IMAP service.  But yeah, those Google services, those are nice, and I do miss those.  They are nice.  The other reason I used Gmail for years is because nobody did a better job at spam.  What's your experience on this?  Except John C. Dvorak.  I get tons of spam on my Google account now.  Really?  Yeah, is it not working?  I don't get any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's an unbelieveable filter. It's almost never wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh man, I get almost nothing but spam.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I stopped using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh.  Arr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe you're doing it wrong.  I'm sure I am.  I'm notorious for that.  Why, the other day, just the other day, I stuck a USB drive into a computer.  That I found on the street.  That I found on the street.  I didn't understand this story, but I'm going to repeat it.  The Google Play Store is testing simultaneous downloads, internal app sharing, and more.  I thought it always did simultaneous downloads.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that new?  Well, no, it was serial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One app at a time?  Okay, well now we'll do multiple.  Okay, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wouldn't it logically take the same amount of time anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, theoretically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it uses all your bandwidth, yes.  Yeah, okay.  It looks better.  It looks like it's doing more.  Apple is serial.  Internal app sharing, which is good for businesses.  It means that if you're a developer in a large company, you can share your app internally  without having to go through the Play Store.  It's a switch.  You can turn on internal app sharing so you can download and install test versions of apps that are shared with you.  I guess anybody could use this, not just internally at a company.  And there is a new interface on Google Play Protect.  The main Protect UI still has the recently scanned apps with the settings to scan the device  and improve harmful app detection if it moved to another screen.  Maybe it confused people.  So settings are now after the gear instead of all on one page.  Maybe they're going to add more settings so they needed to make some room for it.  The Google Home Hub.  We thought there was going to be a new one, but I guess they're just rebranding it to the Nest Hub.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, that's exciting.  Yeah, it's not really a feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  I'm not excited.  Yeah, no, I think that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Waymo launches a robo taxi app on Google Pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm excited about that.  You could call Waymo and come up here, Jeff.  Yeah, that'd be fine.  Yeah, it won't freak on the bridge.  Like every human should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The commercial robo taxi service is called Waymo One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right now it's in Phoenix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I imagine it will roll out to a larger area at some point.  Next time in Phoenix, I'll try it.  Yeah.  You'll be added to a wait list to get the app.  No, not for the ride.  Once accepted, you'll be able to request rides in the app.  There's an early rider program.  This is coming.  I wonder when we're going to get this in...  I would have tried that when I was in Phoenix.  Yeah, next time you're in Phoenix, give it a shot.  And I'm excited about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm excited about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Next time you're in Phoenix, give it a shot.  And I think that's enough.  I think that's quite enough.  Of the Google change log.  That's quite enough.  I was all excited about the Galaxy Fold from Samsung.  Yeah, they're falling apart.  Yes, initial reviews were quite positive.  That's exactly what I thought was going to happen.  They were quite positive.  And then it started breaking.  Steve Kovac at CNBC,  Mark Gurman at Bloomberg,  Dieter Bohn of The Verge,  all reported major failures of their Fold display.  Now these are review units provided to these reporters.  In all three cases, just a couple of days after getting them,  Marcus Brownlee having similar problems,  Bohn and Kovac claim their displays failed without removing the panel's protective film.  Samsung says don't take it off.  Both Gurman and Marcus did remove it.  As you can see, it doesn't look good.  Bohn's phone got crimped.  They're not sure how.  Maybe some debris got in the hinge.  So this just saved me $1,980.  The phone is available at T-Mobile on the 25th,  and I was going to run over and get one to review and show  because I don't get review units.  This, by the way, is one of the reasons I don't like to get review units  because who knows, this might be a pre-production issue  that isn't going to show up in the retail version.  So it's very hard when you're reviewing something  that isn't a production version to say anything  is because it's pre-production or because it's a real problem.  So nevertheless, I think I'm going to take it seriously enough  not to spend $2,000 this coming Friday,  but to wait a little bit just to see.  Everybody version 1.0 of anything?  Well, I kind of have to, and I'm very glad for us  to get the S10+.  I love this phone more than I've loved any phone in years.  It's really, really good.  And the funny thing is all of these guys initially said,  oh, I get it.  I see now why you want a folding phone.  This thing is incredible until a day later it broke.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yikes.  Incidentally, I think a lot of people bought it  because I wasn't able, they had it for pre-order  on the Samsung page very quickly after the pre-orders opened.  They put up a thing saying,  we've got too many orders, can't pre-order it anymore.  Let's talk about the takedown of the takedown.  And my favorite part of the takedown is the explanation.  So Stars issued a takedown on Twitter  about Bittorrent Freak, which is a really good site  that publishes lots of information about sharing,  Bittorrents and so forth.  They published an article about how a number of Stars TV episodes  had been leaked, and in the article they had a thumbnail  of one of the episodes, not one of the leaked episodes,  but a thumbnail from one of the shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that is one of the leaked ones.  Oh, it is because it says for screeners only

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and that's why they put the, well, that's in the article.  That's what the thumbnail on Twitter looked like,  but that's in the article.  probably came from screeners, right?  Which is newsworthy.  Stars yanked it off Twitter claiming DMCA violation.  Then the EFF wrote about it, and Stars pulled the EFF's tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think I actually tweeted about it before the EFF,  not to brag, but I saw this tweet from Torrent Freak  saying that a link to their story had disappeared,  that this tweet had disappeared.  So I posted something saying this is disturbing,  that a link to a news story gets taken down because of the DMCA.  There's no links to any of the Torrents,  there's no links to how to get them,  it's literally just a news story.  And then I got a notification from Twitter,  this is Sunday afternoon, your tweet's been removed.  Oh my God, you got removed too?  Yeah.  So then, just because I'm that type of person,  I posted a screenshot of that,  of the removed or withheld tweet,  and I said, gee, it'd be too bad if a bunch of people  also shared the link to this news story.  And then that tweet was taken down.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  and the Electronic Frontier Foundation tweets  also taken down, tweets about the tweet,  which in itself wasn't really a copyright violation.  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because you're talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  YouTube's been really on a rampage  taking stuff down of ours.  But I think they have a new content ID stuff  that's just a little aggressive or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Star's explanation was that they had outsourced this  to a third party who went overboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They say we were hacked.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the old, we were hacked.  We were hacked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they said because we were hacked, we hired,  this makes no sense, by the way,  it recently incurred a security breach  which prompted the company to hire a third party  for copyright enforcement.  Okay.  And this, okay.  And the third party apparently felt like  the DMCA takedowns were within its scope.  Is your tweet back up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so Twitter notified me I think this morning maybe  or that the tweets have been restored.  And it also said that my account would not be penalized.  Oh, congratulations.  So it wasn't a strike in terms of the three or four strikes  or whatever we had.  Shoo, says Matthew.  I just thought it was outrageous.  Not just the link, the torrent-free link to their story,  but anyone who mentioned that link,  other people had their Anne-Marie Brydie  and the IP expert and law professor  had a tweet of hers taken down.  Jesus.  It was just like they were going bananas.  Yeah.  And of course, Twitter's,  The problem is, as Anne-Marie pointed out,  there is all kinds of penalties if you don't take stuff down.  There is zero penalty if you do take stuff down incorrectly.  So the incentive.  There is no discussion about regulation in Europe.  Exactly.  just in case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, clearly that's what's going on on YouTube.  It's all going on Twitter.  It's going on everywhere.  And welcome to the new world of takedowns.  And everybody's going to see this all the time.  And unfortunately, it's going to hit people like us hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it was worse because it was a news story.  I mean, this reminded me of what they call super injunctions  in the UK where if there's a case,  a super injunction means not only can you not mention the case,  you can't even mention that there's an injunction.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's a chilling effect.  It discourages people from doing what they're legally allowed to do.  And this is just a little behind the scenes.  When I was playing that Songify this,  somebody came running in saying,  don't play that.  We don't want to be taken down.  Right.  And that's the chilling effect.  But that's clear fair use.  You know that?  I know that.  And they know that.  It's not a question of whether it's just...  And that's what bothers me about a lot of these.  It's a chilling effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't want to be taken down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  But we need internet courts so that these things are decided  where they should be decided in courts.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because right now they're being decided without due process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Do we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In a way, I mean, honestly,  that would be superior to what is happening, which is...  That's what this guy was saying.  The right to be forgotten.  Who is the judge in the right to be forgotten?  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's no transparency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no transparency.  There's no due process.  The person who proposed this from a legal world said that  in society we negotiate our legal norms in public.  And this is happening in private companies where you have no  basis.  It's not the company's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like it.  Yeah.  in a different era that it is increasingly becoming less...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Be careful, my friend, because that's what people are starting  to say, saying maybe the First Amendment is not so great  and we should have less speech.  I hate that talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wouldn't Internet courts...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Internet court would enforce the law as it exists.  I guess it could be constitutional.  It's just a regular...  Like the Brits take down, in the blue white paper they did,  take down, as Matthew said earlier, trolling, insult,  disinformation.  I mean, there's no question that outsourcing the regulation of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  speech to massive tech platforms is not a great strategy.  No, that's a bad idea.  I'm regulating speech of any sort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  And it's our last break, so you guys get your bits and pieces.  All ready for you.  I'll get my bits together.  And I will talk about the best place to exercise your right  to free speech, your personal website.  Everybody, every company ought to have a website,  a place they can call their own,  a place where your best stuff lives,  a place where when people Google you, they find your site.  I tell every teenager, get you to WordPress.com,  create a website, get your domain name,  preferably your own name, put stuff up there so that when  people search for you, they find your best stuff.  It's so important.  And if you're a business, it goes double.  A business that's not online practically doesn't exist.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Now, you may say, well, I have a Facebook page,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a Twitter account.  You need your own spot.  but you've got to have the website.  WordPress.com.  And I know what I, where I speak.  I started blogging almost 20 years ago,  and in those days there weren't a lot of choices.  I used Blogger and some weird programs like Gray Matter,  Movable Type, but then Matt Modell and Wigg came along  with WordPress and man, I fell in love.  WordPress was amazing.  LeoLaporte.com lives on WordPress.com  because they do all the heavy lifting.  They are hosting it.  They keep it secure.  They keep the name for you.  So you can focus on the reason you're on the web  to show your best site, to build a fan base,  start a blog, open a store, design a portfolio.  They've got powerful site building tools that are easy to use.  You don't have to be a geek.  Thousands of themes and the best support 24 hours a day,  even on weekends from not, you know,  page turning notebook jockeys,  but real WordPress experts, people who use it  and love it themselves.  They're going to have answers for you.  They're going to have suggestions.  They're going to have ideas.  I even asked them what template should I use  and they had some great suggestions.  WordPress.com.  It lets anyone pursue whatever it is they love  by launching a site that's free to start  but can grow with you as you grow  all the way up to an online store.  No two-week trials, no hidden fees  and WordPress users own their own content forever.  Upload anything, text, pictures, video, music,  whatever you want.  You're stuck.  It's not a silo.  It's the World Wide Web, baby.  And you know what?  It's so good that WordPress now powers 33% of the internet.  One-third of all the internet is on WordPress  and some of the best websites,  some of the biggest publications are on WordPress.com.  Millions of people use WordPress.com every day  to turn their dreams into reality.  Why don't you go to WordPress.com slash twig.  Check it out.  You'll get 15% off any new plan purchase  with the code you'll find there.  That's WordPress.com slash twig.  15% off your new website at WordPress.com slash twig.  Do use that URL so they know you heard it here.  We thank you for your support.  We thank WordPress.com for their support.  And personally, I thank Matt Mullenweg  for making some great software  for 12 years at WordPress.com.  Amen to that.  Matt's an amazing guy.  He is a great guy.  He's a whole new model.  He's a little bit like Craig Newmark  where he's one of these guys who's a founder  who just kind of quietly does his stuff  and does such a great job.  It's really cool.

Transcript:  I guess I think I suggested this earlier,  but I sort of like the idea that  when it comes to rebuilding Notre Dame,  they may wind up using Assassin's Creed  because the designer,  one of the designers for the game  said she spent almost two years  modeling the inside of Notre Dame for the game.  Every brick, every piece of wood, every...  So there's this incredible 3D model  of what is now gone.  I just find that fascinating.  Thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank goodness.  As soon as I was...  Here's, by the way, a picture from Assassin's Creed  of the assassin sitting on the roof  looking across...  What is this? 18th century Paris?  It looks like it.  I think so, yeah.  Wow. I love Assassin's Creed.  I hadn't played Unity, so I'll have to...  Actually, I think I own it.  I'll have to download it.  It's during the French Revolution.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course, as I'm sure many people did,  went back when I saw the fire,  went back to my own pictures of Notre Dame  from many, many visits over the years  and such memories.  As I looked inside and I saw all those wooden sculptures  and, of course, the beautiful rose windows,  and I thought, oh my God, I hope this isn't lost.  I think this big rose window here on the south face is safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like the rose windows are relatively safe.  All of them? Oh, hallelujah.  All three of them are safe.  What they don't know is what impact the fire had on the masonry.  So the wood is gone for sure.  But they don't know...  I mean, it's 800-year-old plaster.  It's unclear what he would do to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. This model is very complete.  Look at this.  It's amazing.  I hope they don't put the cannons back, but...  The rest of it.  The rest of it. That's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't realize that the gargoyles, most of them,  are relatively modern.  So I thought they dated back to the 13th century.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a big remodel in the 19th century, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I also read that...  So you know the rooster that was on top of the steel part of the spire?  No.  So there was a rooster right at the very, very top  of the metal pole on the spire.  And when they put that there in 1935,  they put bits of various saints into the rooster.  Oh, how funny.  Yeah. And so the idea was it was going to be like a spiritual lightning rod  so they would protect the church.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the rooster survived.  Yeah.  The rooster survived and the crown of thorns was...  Can you imagine being the priest who went in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Had to go get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was the head of the fire brigade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was the same guy who ran into the Bataclan nightclub  after the mass shooting there.  But can you imagine being that guy and he's carrying in his hands,  he probably does,  the crown of thorns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember going to...  When I was in Italy, we went into the catacombs,  I think it was at Assisi,  and so, you know, Saint Francis is there  and there are all these relics,  bits and pieces of fingers and toes and whatnot  that were passed around for centuries  and the guy who was doing the tour said,  every church like this has bits and pieces of what they say are the true cross.  He said, if you put all those bits together,  you could build like a shopping mall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  There was a very brisk business in relics and reliquaries in the Middle Ages.  It's kind of hard to know what the provenance of any of that stuff is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a church in Pisa,  it's where the leaning thing is,  but it's actually got a beautiful church as well.  And in the church, there is Saint...  I can't remember his name now, but he's the patron saint.  And so they have him in a sarcophagus on top of the altar  and it describes how they basically...  One guy had to go around and pick up bits of him  from all over the country and then try and put them back together.  That'd be a fun job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is from the grand front door at Notre Dame  and you can see how much detail in the carvings.  It would be so sad if that had been lost.  I'm so glad that it's preserved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also didn't know one of the towers is a little taller than the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if that was intentional.  Sometimes you see that with perspective.  What was it? Was it the Parthenon?  I think it's the Parthenon.  It's actually built a skew  when you look up at it.  These Greeks.  Jeff Jarvis, you've got four different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got two I'm going to do.  My favorite onion headline in quite a while.  Pete Buttigieg stuns campaign crowd  by speaking to manufacturing robots in fluent binary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The South Bend mayor...  I'd almost believe it.  His French was excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His Norwegian was excellent too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  010111001000 said the 37-year-old South Bend Indiana mayor  to the awestruck machines  delivering the message by admitting a series of high-pitched tones  and beeps with a perfect accent.  Nice.  I'll bet if you somehow decoded the binary  it actually says something I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At press time, US manufacturing robots had donated $10 million  to Buttigieg's campaign  and helped him surge to the top of the polls.  We'll be there soon.  That is great.  Are you training in your Kamala hat for Buttigieg?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm still Kamala.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Harris Buttigieg,  as weird as a bumper sticker as that would be,  would be a killer team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kamala Pete.  But the other thing, Leo,  since you are so eager to constantly protest social media,  I finally have the way that you can do it in public.  I'm joining this.  There's only one condition.  You have to do it naked.  Oh, what?  Spencer Tunick,  who does all these famous naked people.  Yes, I've seen his pictures.  He's going to do one in New York  to protest censorship on social media  and it's called, oh what the hell was it?  I missed it now.  I missed it already.  Hashtag we the nipple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We the nipple.

Speaker: UNKNOWN

Transcript:  This is like a full time job.  It was a very Canadian moment there from Matthew.  Okay.

Transcript:  Okay.  I just love that his name is Spencer Tunick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am not coming out for that.  I'm just going to tell you right now.  Ain't nobody want to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you've been doing the keto thing.  You're probably in, you're ripped probably now.  If only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've noticed I'm sitting in front of all these cupcakes.  Cupcakes.  Say your staff is torturing you.  I feel no, I feel nothing.  Yeah, sure.
