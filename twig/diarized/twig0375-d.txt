Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's great to be back and have you back. IOTpodcast.com. Giga Stacey on the Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, you know, a couple of weeks ago you mentioned your pick of the week was this book, Will It Waffle?  They must have heard it because I got Waffle, the Will It Waffle Cookbook by Daniel Schumsky,  creator of Waffleizer.com. He waffles everything in here from filet mignon to red velvet ice cream sandwiches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have not made the ice cream sandwiches. These are called stuffles, stuffing waffles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, that's the best thing to do after Thanksgiving. Have a stuffing waffle. Isn't that awesome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So thank you. Now, I still haven't received my fizzy water from Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, maybe it's because I declined mine. Maybe they just decided not to give me yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you and your journalistic ethics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Topo Chico, please send Leo something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't feel like I cover fizzy water that really would influence me one way or the other on the fizzy water question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, I feel like I'm a popular tweeter when it comes to bar drinks and stuff. So people really trust my opinion on fizzy water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you don't want to take any Topo Chico for free.  It would be terrible.  We can't get it up here. So anyway, that's fine. I don't care. I don't drink.  Actually, whenever they ask, you know, still or fizzy, I always get still. So I like still water.  Here's Kevin Marks. He's coming to us all the way from the South Bay where he is ensconced at KevinMarks.com in his beautiful garden.  Hi, Kevin. Good to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't see much of the garden because I have to sit nearer the house now. The Wi-Fi is not as good on his laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's OK. It's working. That's all I care about.  While we were in the middle of Windows Weekly, you know, the specular way we all knew Apple had to do an event or had planned to do an event this month.  But we the speculation was they would do it October 27th because their earnings was scheduled for the 27th.  They moved it back. Yes, indeed. Apple just sent out the invite. I did not get one case you're interested.  Hello again, it says. Join us for a special invitation only event at the Apple campus at one infinite loop in Cupertino on Thursday, October 27th.  So if you had October 27th on your pick six, congratulations.  And we all assume that Apple will announce new MacBooks, not probably new iPads.  It's be very interesting, though, to see if they do new Mac pros, which hasn't the Mac pros haven't been updated in three years.  The MacBook pros are only a year old. Lots of rumors about what that might include.  I know this is twig, but that's a big story for for our everyone. Everyone. Yeah.  It's funny because we were talking about with Paul and Mary Jo on Windows Weekly about Microsoft's announcement the day before.  And Paul said, yeah, well, what he believes Microsoft was doing was trying to figure out when Apple's announcement could be because the worst thing possible for Microsoft to have a hardware event same day.  Right. No one wants to have an event the same day as Apple. So, you know, Google waited till after the Apple event.  Microsoft kind of threw a dart at the map and set at the calendar and said, well, we're pretty we think we can get October 26th.  And they did. They did. Because unlike Apple, Microsoft likes to mail its invitations out more than one week at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unbelievable. Apple can do that, though. They can't. Apple knows people jump on a plane and come and see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they'll pay twice as much for their ticket because it's last minute booking. But you know what?  That's what happens anyway. So there's there's a story.  And actually, there's a big Google story breaking right now from the Wall Street Journal.  Looks like Google is going to do what Apple wanted to do. A Web TV service.  And according to the Journal, it'll be a relatively low cost, $30 to $40 service.  The Journal says they've signed up at least CBS for this planned Web TV service.  It'll be on the YouTube platform, likely to debut early next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is this like a Hulu type thing on YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm thinking it's more like PlayStation Vue. OK. Are you familiar? You're familiar with that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin Toffle talks about it all the time. He loves that.  Until him, though, I had no idea that you could actually get TV over PlayStation Vue.  So I was like, oh, that's a relatively new offering from Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it has the advantage of getting live locals in some but not all markets.  And that's really the cord cutters dilemma is, you know, you can get most of what you want in terms of HBO,  Showtime, even CNN and ESPN without a cable television or an antenna.  But you can't get ESPN. Yeah, you can on Slingbox. Oh, OK. Slingbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Slingbox TV. I'm pretty sure. Is the is. No, that makes sense.  I was thinking without having to buy like new equipment. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, this is the issue, of course.  And the only reason Sling TV has is because ESPN is so powerful.  They're one of the few channels where they can thumb their nose at the cable companies.  Most channels, like if you're HGTV or, you know, the Oprah channel,  you don't dare do deals over the top deals like this because you don't want cable companies to get mad at you.  But if you're ESPN, which is the most demanded and the most expensive,  it's like five dollars a subscriber. Yeah, they have they can say because what you know,  is your cable company going to say, oh, well, we've decided not to carry ESPN anymore.  Yeah, good luck. So Sling TV has AMC, CNN, ESPN, HGTV actually has a fairly good selection.  That's that's Sling Orange for twenty dollars a month.  Forty dollars orange plus blue gives you even more, including, by the way, the playoffs.  Baseball. Oh, I was thinking Bravo.  Bravo. I know. Well, and I'm all about the A&E, the high class channels.  Actually, AMC would be a big one for me because that's Walking Dead, Mad Men, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bravo is the Real Housewives franchise. It only sounds classy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know they all were, you know, they used to be classy.  And they said there's no money in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, well, they were supposed to be like finance when they originally were.  Yes, they were.  A&E. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe the Real Housewives will go to, you know, the opera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the real the Real Housewives of the Sydney Opera House.  So the new TV service, according to Wall Street Journal, is also near agreement with 21st Century Fox.  Walt Disney, which is interesting because Disney is very tight with Apple, obviously.  Steve Jobs was the number one shareholder in Disney.  And now, of course, his widow, Laureen, is the individual shareholder in Disney.  It would be interesting.  The new service, which the journal says is called Unplugged, aims to be a low cost option targeting consumers  who have either resisted to traditional pay TV or cut the cord due to rising subscriptions cost $25 to $40 a month for a skinny bundle.  So it's very much like PlayStation Vue. It looks almost identical, too.  But CBS is a big deal.  PlayStation. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say, I don't think CBS. Is CBS on Hulu or is it ABC?  It's ABC, Fox, Comedy Central. But I don't think CBS is part of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The real key is not so much like getting How I Met Your Mother, but getting live local, getting the Academy Awards and the Super Bowl and the local news and stuff like that.  The local news.  Local news. I don't care about local news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cord cutters don't watch the local news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe that's it. Well, they can't. That's the whole point.  PlayStation Vue, though, that's one of the things that's interesting about Vue, does give you local news in San Francisco and a few other markets.  So that's I mean, that's that's their claim to fame.  We're really what it's it's interesting.  I mean, this is moving along.  This is moving along. This is cord cutters are not quite so in the out in the cold as they used to be.  And it's interesting that Google. Apple's been trying to do this with their Apple TV for the longest time.  The funny thing is Google doesn't really have its own hardware platform.  But when you're talking about this yesterday, YouTube's everywhere, including Apple TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it would be interesting is how Apple responds to something like that.  But I mean, it won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is YouTube on fire? Does Amazon actually deploy YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you have. I think YouTube's like ESPN.  You kind of have to.  Yeah, this has been Google's stealth entry into all this because, for instance, if you buy music, buy movies on the Google Play movies,  you can watch those movies on YouTube on the YouTube app.  So, oh, you can now.  Yeah, I didn't know.  I didn't know that till yesterday.  Renee was telling us or maybe it was Andy.  Yeah. So that's kind of this little wedge that that Google's able to remember that YouTube was not on Apple TV for the long time for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't. I've never I've never bought into the Apple ecosystem.  So Apple TV was never something that I was like, oh, let's do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. YouTube is on Amazon Fire devices, says Sailor Lion in our chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, I thought it was.  But I suddenly wondered because Amazon seems to be very anti-Google in that respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're an anti-Apple. Remember, Amazon won't put its app on.  Well, they say Apple keeps our app off of. It's so bad for consumers.  You know, these companies, I guess they have to look out for profits, blah, blah, blah.  But it's because of things like this. You can't get Apple's stuff on anybody else.  You can't get Amazon stuff on Apple. So people end up buying two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you can't. But there's nothing to be Amazon putting on Android and Chromecast as far as I know.  But they just haven't bothered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And well, and so that's so the one of the questions in Apple and Amazon differ on this.  One of the questions was, is it Apple that's keeping Amazon off of the Apple TV or is it Amazon refusing to make one for Apple TV?  Both sides say it's the other side.  But the fact that but I think that you that's an interesting data point is that Amazon does not make something for Chromecast or doesn't put Chromecast in its app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that doesn't sell the Chrome.  That's right. It won't sell anybody else's won't sell Apple TV's either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I went to that either now. Oh, well, I think they're very limited on what they'll sell.  I didn't realize that. Let me see. Maybe they I might be wrong.  If I search for Apple TV, I get an ad for new Firestick TV with Alexa remote.  I get an Apple TV mount.  Yeah, no, I don't I don't see any Apple TV's.  They'll sell Apple products, but it looks like it looks like if you go to Amazon, they really want to sell you a fire TV, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do. Yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it does sort of half make sense.  Yes, it's a double sword, isn't it?  Yeah, Amazon has content to sell. If I've got a prime subscription, I should be able to watch prime on my Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, that's that's it's on Roku.  That's where I watch it. It's on Xbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's on my Web TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's yeah, it's on my Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and Amazon has an app on the iPad or it initially.  I mean, it was pretty. Oh, no, it took time to put it.  And yes, the the video app on the iPad and you still can't buy anything because it doesn't want to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll never let you buy anything.  They don't want to get 30 percent to Apple.  They do the same thing with Kindle and Audible.  You have to go to the web to buy things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's that.  But you don't have to do that on Android.  Kindle on Android, you can buy things straight in the app because Google doesn't impose that.  So, you know, it's not that it's not bad.  It is it is just pure. Oh, we want you to buy our thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's so it's our supposition, our proposal that the best way to right now for the moment  to buy movies or TV shows or rent movies or TV shows, do it through Google.  That'll give you the widest array of devices you can play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it give you the ability to download?  No. Onto a tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't I don't believe so.  Who does let you do that?  Google. Oh, really? The Google.  OK, so if I like a cash like a cash, you don't get you don't get to like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because on an iPad, I can download to my Amazon video library.  I can actually download my Amazon content onto the iPad and watch it like on an airplane or in the car if it's my kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so the movies will have a little like download button next to them in the Google Play app.  OK, OK. So you can catch them for a flight or whatever. Yeah. OK, good. OK. That's good. That's key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google has announced speaking of new Google features, a fact check feature on Google News.  You know, it's too late. It might be too late.  This is the most fact challenged election in history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But also, it wasn't clear how they were deciding who's a fact check and who isn't.  Well, they're looking for special fact check markup in your page.  But then at some point, they're deciding whether your fact checks are fact here enough or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they crowdsourcing like the facts? They're using claim review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're using they're using some special markup that you put in your page.  They this is a claim review type of markup.  And so you can presume that you can say you can say this is a fact check. Right.  But they have I haven't read I haven't actually looked in detail, but they haven't said how they decide that your that your fact checking is fact enough for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is interesting. I didn't even know this existed.  This is a markup for claim reviews or fact checks.  So it has a property for the item that's being reviewed, the body or the review.  It has all of the you know, this is really interesting.  The intended audience and embedded audio object.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a classic schema thing of having a million properties in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Million. What an award won by or for this item.  Fictional person connected with the creative work.  Example of work file format funders genre has part some part of this as oh my god this is crazy.  This is why we say yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is what this problem with schemers that inherits everything.  So OK. So so claim review has just as one property claim reviewed but then it's inherited all kind of things from creative work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got it. So the claim review specific stuff is just claim reviewed item reviewed review body and review rating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Well, you know, the other just reviews.  That's a classic review markup that you would do.  The claim review is a piece of text as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I see. So this is the only unique thing is this piece of text.  That's interesting.  We're excited to see the growth of the fact check community, says Google,  and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction.  There is apparently an international fact checking network and more than 100 active sites, according to Duke University.  Wow. So you'll be able to one of those.  I'm sure PolitiFact is in there. Yeah. PolitiFact. Yeah, I'm sure that makes more sense.  Yeah. They're the best known right. That's a Florida.  What is that the Tallahassee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, are they in there?  I wish Jeff were here. Affunded or affiliated with AP.  He knows the whole thing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For more information. OK, so that's good. That's nice.  Yeah, it's a little late. We could have used some fact checking a little earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really wanted someone to create an echo skill that it would listen to the debate.  So like you could turn it on for the debate and then when someone says something wrong, it would just go.  Well, yeah, there we go. Say something appropriate.  How awesome would that be? That'd be great skill.  You could also turn it on at dinner parties. That would be totally.  Liar. Liar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if you can do that with Echo. Can you just can you say to Echo, OK, now listen to everything from now on and then respond?  No, Alexa will tell you who won the debate according to Venture Beat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and you know what? If you ask, we actually did this this morning.  If you ask who is winning the election, she will tell you the polling, the latest polling data, which is kind of useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which poll, though, who does she use? Oh, I don't remember.  Yeah, it's really there's quite a huge difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is there was a great story about how one African-American guy in like Ohio who's a Republican was skewing the L.A.  Times, I think data. I was like, wow, that's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I know this from radio ratings for years and even back to tech TV.  Tech TV had such a small audience that our ratings were very volatile.  And I was finally explained to me, well, that's because there's really only one family with a people meter that watches tech TV.  And if they don't watch that night, your ratings are going to go way down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like a sample sample.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is awesome.  It's like they had all the power. Did you send them flowers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, we don't know who it is.  In fact, one of the things you sign when you get a people meter or an arbitrary diary is an agreement not to tell a soul,  especially not the TV or radio station that you have one of those because of course you'd be offered cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those cookbooks and Topo Chico samples you're getting are nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing. They'd be they'd be coming at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that was that was a thing with the record business in the UK.  They used to have they used to survey some of the shops to see what the sales were and that would define the charts.  Right.  And and they and of course the which shops it was leaked.  And so they would employ people to go and buy things just from those shops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Same thing happened in the US.  And of course, we know that the New York Times bestseller list is I think routinely, routinely manipulated that way.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Especially by political books. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I have I have friends who are bestselling authors and there's a whole strategy there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  And do you think that's how they became bestselling authors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think their books are high quality and I but I think getting there fast is the key.  So that first week you do it and then it kind of builds on itself.  It's kind of like if you're a podcaster and you want to have an audience that downloads it before you go on iTunes.  I would never do such a thing.  So you can be a new and notable.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really don't do that.  Never did that.  That's terrible.  There.  Remember the just Mayo story?  This is this is like a mini Theranos.  Yeah.  Just Mayo, which is a Silicon Valley startup that makes an eggless mayonnaise.  It's not just as in only it's just as in justice.  But the problem I haven't tasted I don't know if it's good or not.  But it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They really wanted to get it into Whole Foods.  And so what they did is they had employees go out and buy tons of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  I remember this.  Yes.  So I thought you were going to tell me they actually had eggs in there and then I was going to that was that was that when you said mini Theranos, that's where my brain went.  No, no, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not actually probably that would have been a mini Theranos.  Yeah, it's not really a mini Theranos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like a mini Wells Fargo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But in this here's why it's a yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Here's why it's an issue is because, of course, they have venture capital and they're showing in the in the pitch sheets, they're showing these incredible sales and a number of the investors.  Well, some investors actually did the due diligence and turned them down and a number of them feel like they were maybe manipulated a little bit.  That's actually an ongoing story.  I don't know the full details of that.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  It's a longstanding tradition.  Go out and buy your books.  Let's see.  That was fact check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I said, didn't someone say that like half the votes in the debate were Twitter bots?  There was some story about that this week as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Half the debates.  What do you mean the bots, the tweets, debate tweets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, there were some like debate tweets.  Who got the most tweets?  And then then someone did analysis and said, oh, wait a minute.  Like, there's a giant army of Twitter bots that are tweeting with the hashtag to try and.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't get me started on Twitter again.  It just drives Stacy crazy.  But it's terrible.  Here's the biggest problem with Twitter is that people give tweets any credence at all.  Even if they're bots or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, you mean my polls that I do on Twitter aren't scientific?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shocker.  But even so one, you know, I mean, every it's I think this is changing.  I think it's rapidly changing.  And I think, you know, the other story that broke this week about the Twitter sale is that  Salesforce apparently considered the massive trolling on Twitter to be one of the reasons not to buy at Disney, too.  Jim Kramer, I don't know how reliable source he is.  He says, I was told by Salesforce that it was the trolls on Twitter that really scared them off.  Which kind of makes sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think I saw on Twitter, Quentin Hardy over at the New York Times dispute that a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's plenty of other reasons not to buy Twitter.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was more of the stuff the shareholders were saying.  Why are you buying that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, yeah.  But the real problem is not troll.  I've come to the realization.  The real problem isn't that there's trolling on Twitter.  The real problem is that the media gives a single tweet huge weight.  Companies give tweets huge weight.  That's why companies for so long, customer service, if you wanted to get anything from customer service, don't call them.  Tweet them as if that's some magically wonderful, powerful.  Oh, it is.  It's not powerful.  It's so powerful.  It's powerful because we give it power and the media gives it power.  But honestly, any dim bulb can go say something on Twitter.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's the point is that, yeah, and they do all the time.  And they do.  Some of them take on some of them don't.  Right.  So it's not just that somebody says something on Twitter.  It says something says something on Twitter and then that gets shared and spread because it's striking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but it all comes down to people paying attention to this noise box that is Twitter.  No, no, no, no.  Yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're mistaking the content for the form there.  They're paying attention to something that somebody has said.  It just happens to be on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I'm saying, if you said if the same thing happened on 4chan and does often, people are smart enough to go, well, that's 4chan.  Even Reddit, they're going, well, that's Reddit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the point is that things a lot of memes start on 4chan and they're now mainstream is just that they're not attributed.  Because they go to Twitter.  Or they go everywhere else.  But that's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There aren't that many places a 4chan meme can live.  Reddit and Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they get picked up by Buzzfeed or Mashable or one of those guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the whole a lot of the ideas of just the idea of images with big type over them is a 4chan thing that spread out to the rest of the web.  Yeah, but but you know, yeah, we've done this.  I'm not going to talk about three shows now.  I don't want to talk about Twitter ever again.  The Pixel phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I was going to tell you something I'm mad about.  So I want to know.  I'm asking you, the chairman, everybody else.  So they said October 20th, right?  Best as I could tell, anybody ordered from Google is not getting it October 20th, even if you ordered right away.  Now, I don't know, because I was in an airplane.  I wasn't able to order later that day.  And mine's coming November 8th.  Jason Howell said, though, he ordered it right away and his is coming next week.  The people who are getting their Pixel phones tomorrow got it through Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, Verizon did tell me because I was in a Verizon store this weekend and they said I could come back in Thursday to see it.  Shame on you, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shame on you.  I thought I was getting shamed for a minute there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shame.  Not you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shame on Google.  So, yeah, Frederick.  So I went over to Jason.  When's your Pixel coming next week?  Mine's coming November 8th.  But Frederick, our office manager, who's a Verizon customer, is getting hers tomorrow.  She already got this ship.  So Google, which is famous for with its Nexus phones for not kowtowing to Carriers BS, is apparently kowtowed to Verizon's BS and has given them a one week exclusive.  That's what it looks like to me.  Now, to confirm that, I need to ask you, Chatroom and anybody watching, who is anybody getting a Pixel phone not from Verizon tomorrow?  Crickets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like, I don't know.  We can't hear the chatroom.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, there is an article on Android Police, which the chatroom has just given me, saying Pixel orders are starting to ship from the Google store.  So some of the staff.  Oh, good.  All right.  So I take it back.  This is what I was looking for.  32 gigabyte.  Who wants that?  Why would you order that?  So the credit cards got started getting charged last night.  Oh, well, wait a minute.  This is their evidence.  Credit cards got charged last night.  They haven't necessarily seen the shipping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  But that usually means they're putting it in a box, doesn't it?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're charged when it goes there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it should mean.  Yeah.  A lot.  We'll see.  You get a Pixel, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I wasn't really keen.  I don't see a reason to upgrade my phone yet, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you an iPhone user or an Android user?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm an Android user.  So I've got the Nexus small, the 5X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's time.  Kevin, are you tempted or are you an?  I can't remember.  You're an iPhone guy, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm an Android guy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin, an iPhone guy?  That's a Nexus 6 he's got there.  Nexus 6.  That's the big old baby.  I like it.  Well, I like the thing.  You know what, here's the, okay, here, all right.  Finally, I have a good shame on you.  That's it, boom.  Hello, that's kind of.  Two-year-old phone.  it.  One would hope for more than two years.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  That phone's perfectly good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's got Android.  It's got Android.  It's got Android.  It's got Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you won't get.  Well, there's an update, 7.1," that these pixels are coming with, that has Google Assistant

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  stuff, but right?  Yeah, but nobody gets that.  Nobody gets that.  Nobody gets that.  Well, every, it's an update 7.1�2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  But you got sandy frameworks.  Yes.  Some of us, yeah, I'm,團.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you'reigration and information based on.  Well, we have, obviously, the Baltic.  It's exclusive to the Pixel for now.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if they've said that, but is that just the making a virtue out of necessity  because that, because it's so hard to deploy updates to Android or is this actually strategy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that we debated this actually, Jason, and I actually looked at the, because we were  trying to figure out if there was like a hardware differentiator on the Pixel.  There is not.  We know there's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there is not.  There's a two line hack that you can do to any Nexus phone and get set and get the Assistant  on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, it's just.  So they're basically just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's new and cool.  Yeah.  They're basically just saying we're deploying this to our ones first and we'll wait for  the people to clamor for it.  And maybe they're trying to put some pressure on the other people to update more regularly.  Maybe that's the other half of it.  But presumably they could put it in Play Services.  That's the bit I don't understand.  I don't think it requires an OS update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So September 2017, the 5X and the 6P go out of support.  Wait, when was that?  Next year.  Next September.  Oh, OK.  You got till next September.  This month, the Nexus 9, the Nexus 5, and the Nexus 6.  Actually the Nexus 5 went out last year.  The Nexus 6 goes out this month.  So these are the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we need a new Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does that?  Yeah, that's sad, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does that include the security updates for no support or is it just no OS updates?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I think security updates are provided for three years from release or 18 months from  when they leave the Google Store, whichever is longer.  So security updates.  I think the Nexus.  I don't know.  That's a good question.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.  Don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because that would be a reason to obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, you want those security updates.  After stage fright, we all are much more conscious of that.  Very solid reviews, though, for the Pixel.  A number of journalists, of course, had their embargoes lifted yesterday.  And we're seeing Walt Mossberg in the Wall Street Journal.  I think said it's the best Android phone or the Android phone you've been waiting for  is what the Wall Street Journal said.  That was probably Joanna Stern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say, I think that's Joanna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mossberg is now at Verge slash Recode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But he went review as well.  He loved it, too.  Nice about it.  There have been some.  It's a very nice phone.  I agree.  It's just it's pretty expensive.  Pretty.  And I don't feel quite ready to drop a thousand dollars on a phone at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, who like normal people?  Are normal people even clamoring for an update?  I feel like two years is about the accepted life of a phone.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I mean, that's the thing.  This one is two years old and still feels good because it was a top range.  And I did spend a thousand dollars or nearly not quite, but I said something two years  ago and it's been a good phone.  So that's if I bought the one of the older slower ones two years ago and I was due of  an update from the from Verizon or something, then I'd probably go and look at it because  then you don't see the price in the same way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there a technical reason for that, Kevin?  I mean, you know, Apple does the same thing with its iPad and its iPhone and so forth.  Is it that the newer versions of Android wouldn't run well on a Nexus six or there's some hardware  missing from a Nexus six that it needs?  Or is it just planned obsolescence?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's probably just more the number of configurations they want to spend time on testing.  But you know, a lot of it is just like we've decided to draw a line, you know, so like  they decide to stop updating Chrome on versions of Mac OS before 10.7 or whatever it is.  There's some 10.8 now.  So they've just arbitrarily said, OK, we don't bother updating things more than X versions  old.  And I think it's that same kind of policy to try and limit the number of cases they  have to deal with.  It just kind of hurts my sensibilities.  I don't think it's totally wise.  Yeah, I think I mean, that's the point.  I mean, the weird thing is, you know, the new one is nice.  I'm sure it's lovely and I'm sure it's a bit better than this one.  But this one has a 4K screen.  It's got a great camera.  It doesn't seem to start when I'm browsing the web or doing things with it.  OK, I don't do much gaming with it, but it seems to cope.  So it doesn't feel like this one is people have moved beyond its capacity.  The thing I was expecting to sort of be that I must buy this was the was the VR AR stuff.  But they haven't made it while they've shipped that they haven't made as much of a big deal  about it.  And it doesn't seem like there's a I must have this app thing there that makes you want  to buy the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As far as I can see, Daydream looks just like a Google cardboard in a nicer container.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I mean, with a nicer frame rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they have improved the technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it does work better.  The latency is lower.  The gyroscope stuff is lower latency so that the head turning feels better.  So they have improved a bunch of stuff.  But you still need a reason to be using VR stuff in the first place rather than just  There's no killer app yet.  I can't think of one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't either.  For VR?  Yeah, I'm kind of I'm kind of starting to turn into a VR skeptic to be honest with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you.  Join the club.  Really?  You feel that way too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's warm and cozy.  That's just because you're in Austin.  Really?  You feel that way too?  OK, because I get people argue violent with me saying, oh, you know, you're just missing  the point.  But I just feel like I have all of the you know, I have the vibe and the rift and all  that stuff.  And I just I don't see a lot of I don't get have an internal drive to go use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I've and maybe it's because I'm not a gamer and because I don't want to walk around  with some thing on my face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like gaming, but I think gaming is just as compelling on a nice screen that's fairly  close.  That's just as just as immersive and a lot less nausea inducing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I do think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.  I think I think that it is it does make the gaming more immersive and enable some different  slightly different kinds of games, though I'm not sure we've fully seen those yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I recognize that it may just be that that maybe we just haven't gotten  to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it but it's also the the game people are getting grumpy because they've got to develop  a four different platforms as well.  That's the other part of it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was really enamored of it when I first got it.  I spent a lot of time in there, but I kind of got over it.  I am a gamer.  I love gaming, but I just kind of got over it.  And maybe it's just a lack of the killer app.  I mean, we just we'll see that sometime at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I will say someone in the chat room said it, but I totally agree with them.  A.R. like augmented reality is much more compelling.  Yes.  Just not because of Pokemon Go, although.  Yay.  You still playing that?  OK, my daughter is 10 and she loves it.  And we're we do it together.  And you walk, you take walks and stuff.  Exactly. It's cute.  No, I think so.  Yeah, I'm pro A.R. for like especially industrial.  And I think as the world gets more complex, it becomes really interesting to see, like  how you can combine things.  But again, that's not really consumer.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that was that was the thing I was surprised about with with the Pixel phone,  because I was expecting it to be more A.R.  ready than it is.  And have I've been saying this for a year, but have two cameras on the back so that you  can do stereoscopic straight through and then overlay on it.  And that and that that would give you quite a lot of power with it.  You can you can you can do that.  But all the Google headsets they've shipped have cover up the camera.  So you can't do that. The only one that does it is the device or the Oculus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the I think. Oh, hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you bathe your hands in tuna fish before doing this?  I like attack your I love your hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's on the keyboard next to something about your hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really get messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's it called the?  The Viewmaster one, the Viewmaster cardboard thing does have  is transparent on the back and does do overlays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, OK. Well, see, I feel like Google.  Yeah, because Google does a lot with overlays and a lot with pushing information  through your phone, like a ask kind of things anyway.  So I always thought that you're right.  They would be a natural kind of contender to offer something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Viewmaster is totally a it is not, in fact, VR.  And it's very cool. I really like it.  I mean, well, OK, Carson, you get it for your kids.  It's VR. You got VR for your kids.  See, I think the Viewmaster is kind of very interesting.  You know, you think it's it's it's more VR than they are.  They're billing it as VR and visiting the places you've always dreamed of.  So there is this, which is the kind of a Google cardboard kind of VR.  Yeah. But then there's also it is both. OK.  But then there's also this really, I think, cool thing where you can  you put a disk down and then you see things floating above it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Carson, you have it right.  Yes. Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.  I haven't used the disk in a long, long time.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's not.  And it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's the point. I mean, I'm not saying that.  It's cool at first.  I'm not sure what they built with it was necessarily the right answer.  But the point was they actually thought about  I can pull video through and overlay stuff on top of it. Right.  And I think we would be getting more of that from from Google  because they have bought Magic Leap and there's a bunch of stuff  we know that's sort of they're thinking about there.  It's just too early. It's just too early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They bought Magic Leap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they have a big investment in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, OK. I was like, holy, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, just a big big chunks of Magic Leap.  Yes. OK.  They effectively I mean, I don't know what their stock,  what their percentage is, but they're they have such a large percentage.  It's effectively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they have control, but they have.  But that's the thing.  I was expecting more in terms of hardware readiness in this cycle.  And I guess that isn't happening this side because we're going to wait  for the next cycle soon. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're it's too early. It's too early yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But a lot of it, you know, we're applet.  This is the magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the Magic Leap demo.  When every time I see this,  they say shot directly through Magic Leap.  But and they didn't do any special effects.  But so when I see this, I get very excited about this.  I mean, this is very cool.  Here's a for some reason,  it's a woman working at a computer and she's got a galaxy  or a solar system floating above her for no apparent reason.  Maybe she's doing research on the motion of the sun.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you would think she would then look at it.  Well, she's not.  She's not wearing a headset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yes. Well, that's true.  Although didn't they say Magic Leap won't require a headset?  I thought that was part of it.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm saying.  I mean, the thing is, if you've got the camera on the back of the screen,  you can do it. You can just do it straight through.  And you can do that with the phones now.  That's what Pokemon does.  But you could.  What you can do is also, you know,  if the point of having two cameras is a gives you a stereoscopic view as a human,  so you can go straight in your eye,  but also it can means you can reconstruct depth from it.  So because you've got two cameras that you know, the spacing between them,  it can reconstruct the depth of where you are and decide what things are in front  of what things are behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is this is a wired story about Magic Leap that  they got a demo nobody else had had a scene.  But it's pretty cool.  Pretty cool.  So, you know, I'm willing to stipulate that we are just in such early days of VR  and AR, it would be foolish.  It'd be like somebody saying in the days of the Atari 2600,  oh, video games, nobody's ever going to play those.  It's just too early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's you know, I've been watching the demo since like 1988.  So that's the problem. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We haven't made a lot of progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the same scenarios are there in people's heads,  but but maybe we just started to see them realized.  Well, a lot of it is Neil Stevenson, isn't it?  We can blame him for right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually I loved, you know, President Obama did an interview  with Joey Ito of the Media Lab.  It was published in Wired magazine.  And the very first thing out of his mouth, I was so impressed.  And obviously, I mean, it's his science advisors even said my science advisors  tell me.  But he said, you know, the problem we have is that we have this vision  of VR and artificial intelligence that comes from science fiction  of this generalized intelligence like how 9000 or Star Trek.  He says that's a long way off, but specialized AIs around us all the time now.  And that's where that's where, you know, things are happening right now.  We shouldn't we shouldn't  base our judgment on what's going to happen with AI.  And I think this extends to VR and AR as well, based on our  our science fiction based expectations.  The holodeck is a way off.  It doesn't mean we're not going to have some sort of useful AR sooner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it was well, we have useful.  We have useful AR today, actually, in industrial uses.  People are like doing it all the time. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let's take a break.  Stacey Higginbotham is here from Stacey on IoT, the IoT podcast.  And this week in Google,  we were reunited and it feels so good.

Quick and loans dot com slash twig.  Yesterday was supposed to be an earnings call from Yahoo,  but they said zip it.  They did not want to talk no doubt about the really horrific news about Yahoo  lately, even Verizon says this could affect our deal.  They've asked for a billion dollars off the four point eight billion dollar deal.  Yahoo, of course, as we all know, was hacked.  Four years ago, I think, no two in 2014,  and that at least half a billion of its email accounts were released.  The company says it was state sponsored hacker, although I've never heard of state  sponsored hacker trying to sell this stuff on the dark net.  And that's what happened.  And then the question is, well, when did they learn about it?  And the evidence is they might have known about it as early as June or July  and neglected to mention anything, hoping not to scotch the sale.  Oh, oh, oh.  Then we found out that Verizon, although they had fought court orders  in the past, had a secret court order  asking it to sift through Yahoo Mail, not Verizon, Yahoo, through sift  through Yahoo Mail, looking for a digital signature of a bad actor.  And even though they'd fought such orders in the past and lost, they decided,  well, let's not bother with that.  And at first, we thought that the story was where the story was that they had  slightly modified the spam filter to find this.  Turns out maybe that was a lot worse than that.  They wrote a poorly executed root  kit like malware put on their own servers.  And some say put all of their users at risk with this.  Alex Stamos, who was their chief of security back then, apparently  was shocked to find this.  We get it first. They thought they'd been hacked.  And then they were told by the company. Oh, no, no, that's our stuff.  He left shortly after and went to Facebook where he's running security.  Anyway, I'm not surprised given all of that, that Yahoo  decided not to pull a Trump and not show up for its earnings call.  What were the earnings, though?  I think they I don't know.  See, I don't know how to judge these earnings.  I don't know what this even means, but I'm not an investor. So.  I mean, they made money, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yahoo's made money. They've made money for a while, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They met their earnings goal, they by cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, that that doesn't necessarily mean they made money.  Yeah, it depends on how high the goals were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  And and how much the costs that were cut.  Analysts expected 14 cents a share.  Instead, they did 20 cents normally in a normal environment.  That would be really big news in the stock market would have gone up a lot.  But the result, according to a recode, is primarily due to cost cuts  and not business growth. Right.  The adjusted up to the bit, the bit, the  which I forgot what that stands for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Man, you're good.  I took the Chartered Financial Analyst Exam.  What? What?  Yeah, I started out going to be a CFO.  No, I wanted to be a better financial journalist.  Oh, that's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You people call me dumb, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never know. You're very smart.  So you took classes to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I studied on my own, but it's a pretty intense.  It's like stats and accounting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you know what EBITDA is and you even know what EBITDA stands for.  Their EBITDA was down  from 244 million to 229 million, which really means  that their CFO, Ken Goldman,  did some clever, creative accounting to make it look better than it really was.  Revenue in mobile video and native rows, the big moneymakers declined,  as advertisers fled and traffic declined.  Although some wag on Twitter said there must have been a big bump, actually,  in ad sales when everybody logged into Yahoo to change their password,  delete their account.  Does not show up in the numbers.  Display ad revenue down 7% search engine revenue.  Wait a minute.  Yahoo has search engine revenue.  Yes, they do. But it was down 14%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't they cut deals with like device makers?  I think it's Bing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're Bing resellers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, Firefox defaults to Yahoo search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but Yahoo search comes from Bing, right?  Yahoo doesn't run its own search engine.  Yeah. It's a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. Well, I decided to look up the termination fee  for the Yahoo Verizon deal just to see.  Oh, I'm curious myself.  So ta-da.  It's 144.8 million.  But that is if Yahoo paying Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If there's cause. Oh, Yahoo paying Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yahoo must pay Verizon in certain circumstances.  I don't have the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are these the you know, and Verizon's attorney,  general counsel said this is a material.  These are this is material.  So that's code for this might have something.  This might give us a reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And if the purchase agreement is terminated by Verizon  due to breach of agreement,  Yahoo is supposed to reimburse Verizon's expenses  in the amount of 15 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So its question is, is this a breach of the agreement?  And I think here would be the here would be the question.  What did Marissa Meyer know and when did she know it?  Yes. God, that would be material  because if she knew about the hack and didn't disclose to Verizon  before the sale, well, that's it.  But I think what Verizon is going to do, they still see value in Yahoo.  They're just going to. Oh, yeah.  They're going to say, well, OK, we're either walk and you give us  100 some million dollars or you take a billion off the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if I were Yahoo, I'd be like, yeah, whatever you want, whatever,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  whatever you want.  So Yahoo is investigating itself.  There are also shareholder lawsuits,  national security issues.  Kara Swisher says, in other words, Yahoo's sale  limps forward, which is in keeping with how it's been going on for years now.  But at least it's consistent.  Although I will miss the Meyer Goldman quarterly earnings show,  which seems to have closed without one final performance.  There Yahoo.  What's funny is Yahoo has these all these long term deals all over Silicon Valley.  So these still Yahoo billboards.  And when you go to a 49ers game,  I'm sad to say our season tickets are in the Yahoo section.  And you have to go up an escalator that periodically goes,  Yahoo, and whenever something good happens,  I can't remember what it is.  They Blair that through the stadium speakers.  It's like it's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, they sold out.  That is really impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's a long term contract.  They probably already paid for it.  So not only the 49ers stink.  But we have to put up with Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they're so terrible, you don't have to put up with Yahoo that often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've only been to one game, the one game they won this season.  So there you go.  The first day when they're opener for reasons no one understands  and then proceeded to lose every game after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The 49ers are just tell me out here, baseball, football.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're the football. They're the Yahoo of football. OK. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just checking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, man, I have to ride a purple escalator to go to the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could be an ass Jeeves escalator.  Practically as bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.  So Verizon is kind of making noise.  I think hinting that they could pull out really is more about  how low can we get this price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah. Yeah.  I mean, it's Yahoo has the ad technology that I mean, I don't know.  Verizon's been buying all sorts of crazy stuff. So this. Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, I thought we would have a nice conversation with Jeff Jarvis  and the gang on this one because he is our moral compass.  But I'll ask you to.  There's a there's a bit of a brouhaha brewing in Silicon Valley right now  because Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist who spoke at the Republican  Convention on behalf of Donald Trump  and who funded the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that put Gawker out of business.  Has pledged one and a quarter million dollars to the Trump candidacy.  Now, some might say, in fact, I might be one of them.  Well, that's his perfect right.  Trump is the nominee of a major political party in the United States,  whatever you think of him or his politics.  And but there are those.  And so Thiel, who is an adviser and not on the board, but an adviser  for a Y Combinator, they've been calling for his ouster there.  Sam Altman, the CEO of Y Combinator, wrote a stirring defense  of the First Amendment and said, no, you know, well,  while we're no fans of Donald Trump, we don't see any reason to dump  Peter Thiel leading Gizmodo to say Sam Altman should resign.  And we should mention that Ellen Bao,  Ellen Pau, who you may remember, ran Reddit for a while and now runs something,  runs a non-profit,  wrote a piece on Medium  in which she said, because of Y Combinator's support  of Peter Thiel,  we can't be a part of Y Combinator anymore.  So it's wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They said they would work with Y Combinator themselves,  but would work with companies they fund.  So they're basically saying we don't trust your management structure  because Thiel is on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So are they not going to have Facebook because Thiel is on Facebook's board?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and Mark, there is a good question.  Mark Zuckerberg also asked about all this.  In a leaked memo,  so this is in a public statement, defends keeping Peter Thiel.  Is he on the board?  He is on the board.  He is on the board.  And he owns a big chunk of it still, I think.  Yeah, right. He was the first investor, right?  I saw the social network. I know the history.  He said it's diversity.  Here's the post, which is not, again, not public,  was an internal company post, but of course, those things don't stay private.  I want to quickly address the questions and concerns  about Peter Thiel as a board member and Trump supporter.  We can't create a culture that says it cares about diversity  and then excludes almost half the country because they black a political candidate.  There are many reasons a person might support Trump that do not involve racism,  sexism, xenophobia or accepting sexual assault.  It may be because they believe strongly in smaller government.  I don't think Trump said anything about that.  A different tax policy, health care system, religious issues, gun rights  or any other issue where he disagrees with Hillary.  That's ultimately what Facebook is about, giving everyone the power  to share our experiences.  In any way, it's diversity.  So now I OK, I normally would shut up here, but I don't want I want I want  I'm going to say this ahead of time before you guys are put on the spot.  I think that's right.  I think Peter Thiel, however you feel about Trump,  should not only have the right to donate, but how would we feel  if a company kicked off a board member because he gave money to Hillary Clinton?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Mozilla did that with Brandon.  What's his name? That's right. Brandon Icke.  Yeah. OK. So I think there's a big  there's like a is it a red herring?  Is it a straw man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Straw man. Let's call it a straw man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where do we figure this out? OK. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Straw herring. Straw herring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Straw herring. There we go.  I think up until the sexual assault  kind of comments surfaced, people were, hey, this dude's kind of  maybe not my style, maybe he treats women really crapily, blah, blah, blah.  I think disagreeing with someone's politics and then  standing up against someone who is.  I'm just going to say a reprehensible human being who has attacked half the population.  It's kind of like it's it's kind of like saying, and I'm not going to go,  I'm going all Godwin here, but it's kind of like saying, did you support Hitler?  And if Trump is accused of a crime,  so he's got several lawsuits against him, their civil lawsuits, I believe,  then it becomes kind of a different story because boards and board memberships,  they do have like moral hazard clauses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he but the lawsuit is not a criminal action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a civil action. Right. Well, that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. If if if Donald Trump were

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  those comments were total moral hazard.  Oh, I agree, too. I mean, so that this is the very weird position

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we're put in, because, yes, of course.  And if you were a third party candidate.  Yeah, everybody would go, oh, but he's not.  He's the candidate of the Republican Party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There has to be like it.  Again, I am totally fine up until like a lot of that.  Like there was actual proof that this guy is kind of morally hazardous.  Right. Is is that bad?  We kind of knew it, but we didn't have proof.  That's where I feel like things start to diverge into.  Can you really support?  Someone who is kind of a really awful human being, and there's proof of it.  And I'm not even talking about his politics.  But if it were Joe McCarthy.  He I mean, he had a political stance.  I mean, I guess you could actually can't argue that.  No, I was going to say you could argue that it's like Kennedy sleeping around.  But it was, you know, if Kennedy were a rapist, then maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm really torn on this because, of course, I, you know,  what you say has a lot of merit.  And we're put in a very awkward position because the Republican Party has nominated  this this person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if he were a serial killer, I mean.  The man, you know, don't does that mean that that's which change that does that change it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you fire Peter Thiel because he has poor judgment and political candidates?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it would be different if you had given a million and a quarter to the Republican  Party, the RNC.  That would be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That'd be OK. I mean, I mean, it'd be a bit better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But the other thing is that Thiel himself has said all kinds of strange  and bizarre things, too.  He did write the Art of Fecato saying that the rot set in when women got the vote and those  kinds of things.  You know, that's he has he's on record as supporting a lot of very strange things  and explicitly discriminating against women.  But this didn't come up until he gave a million and a quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, but do you think that's the last straw on a continued?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think people question Peter Thiel for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think saying we have a commitment to diversity and and so on,  and so we're backing this guy who is an extreme sexist and has a bunch of very weird  views is a slightly odd thing to do.  I mean, it is the challenge is, yeah, where do you cross the line?  How do you how do you tolerate the intolerable?  And broadly, I think people should have the rights to their political views, but it doesn't  necessarily mean they should be free from other people deciding what to think about  them based on those political views.  I mean, if Thiel gave money to David Duke, Klansman David Duke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. OK.  Right. OK.  I think the only point I raise is the fact that this is the nominee of one of the two  major political parties. That's what complicates us, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the that's the bit.  That's the bit I'm not I'm not that's I'm not as comfortable with that side of it, sure.  But, you know, there's a lot of strangeness about Thiel and and some of the political  stuff that's talked around it in those circles.  And this is the bit that's sort of odd is that the Valley has this uneasy political  sort of consensus that does include a fairly sort of off off the off the charts libertarianism,  along with the sort of neoliberal consensus end of the the other political spectrum.  And that's that's if you look at who the value donates to and who they funds, there  is a lot of this effectively anti-government almost entirely was was was the culture of  the Valley for a very long time.  And so some of this is that that part of it moving into the into that orbit.  But also some of it is just like he may just be doing to mess with people.  It's not clear. But he is clearly sending a signal that there is a set of things that  he decides he wants to do.  And is this I think it's the association of that.  That's the thing that's damaging to to Facebook and why it's really interesting because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it really does echo the Brendan Ike story from four years ago or three years ago.  Brendan Ike donated in support of Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage and as a result  was forced out at Mozilla, even though Ike was very I mean, he wasn't just a kind of  figurehead at Mozilla.  He was very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The CTA. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually I did not agree with that.  I thought that was not a great decision personally when that happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is that this is but I think it's it's it's on it's on a spectrum, but it's the  same question, which is if we have in this country and I think we need to the First  Amendment, as has been said many times, is only defended when somebody says something  you hate. You can't defend it only when people agree with you.  And and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and the First Amendment only protects against government intervention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I understand. But we have a culture that you should be in in normal political discourse.  You shouldn't have your opinion if it is against the mainstream, be held against you,  that that's part of why we have a two party system.  We have elections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If your opinion is that other people don't deserve civil rights or should be discriminated  against, then it is problematic.  And if that's the if that's the baseline, the reason that people are upset about this  is that they're saying, well, as long as it is accepted by Y Combinator, I don't feel  that I would be judged on my merits there because I can understand why Ellen Powell

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  would say, OK, we're not going to deal with Y Combinator anymore.  That I understand. She's been, you know, she's the first of all, personally, she has  been the victim of some horrific stuff.  And as a result, I understand her sensitivity to this.  And I can't remember what an organization is, but I gathered that this was kind of the  tenor of the organization anyway was included, was, you know, diverse, diverse,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  diverse, focused organization.  Yeah, it was diverse, focused organization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So and that's within her rights.  And so I can't blame her.  But should Sam Altman, the CEO of now, I understand also why Gizmodo would write Sam  Altman should be fired at Y Combinator because Gizmodo was one of Peter Thiel's victims.  Right. Gatgag is one of Peter Thiel's victims.  So oh, man, this is a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if Sam Altman.  So my. As a woman.  I look, if Trump is if Trump is able to become president, that really says,  a lot about what's allowed in our culture.  And people can be like, no, no, I still love women.  I would never do that. Blah, blah, blah.  But if you can say those things and be accused of those things and still become  president of the United States and have people stand behind you.  Yeah, that's kind of like say, I mean, that would be like giving money to David Duke  and electing him president because you liked his economic policy.  He's not great for blacks, but, you know, and.  I feel like people are.  Maybe they don't understand the depths of that.  I really don't. It baffles me.  So I don't know. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm certainly believe me, it baffles me, too, but  and I'm somewhat arguing this  from just from a devil's advocate position, but.  But I'm a I'm a I'm a virulent liberal.  I know plenty, unfortunately, in my opinion,  know a number of people, including family members who are voting voting for Trump.  So I mean, you're in Texas.  I imagine you know a few people you see a Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. My parents are voting for Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My dad is. So which should you fire your father from the family?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not. No, because he's a person  who is not representing anything other than my dad.  I mean, why Combinator?  The reason why people are like saying do this is because they want to say  for why Combinator to make a stance against.  Trump's stance on women, I know, and I really don't.  I don't know if I think Teal should be fired.  I think I mean, I've always thought Teal was a little I mean,  once he started seasteading, you know, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think I think I agree with you and Kevin that there may be larger  reasons why Teal probably should be ostracized from Silicon Valley. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well, I think that if this gives us an opportunity to examine some of those things  and that's useful. So that's the you know, the the the struck. So  when I was at Google, we were setting up the original Google P.A.C.,  which was under the old pack rules where you employees had to donate  and you couldn't just throw company money at it before things got weird.  And one of the reasons we were doing that was because all the Google  employees did was donate to Democrats and Google as a company needed  to donate to Republicans who shared their agenda as well to make sure  that that they could do some kind of lobbying.  This was before Google's lobbying opposition grew to the size it is now.  And that was a that was that was very much a culturally,  we're very much aligned with the with the Democrats and that corner  of the neoliberal thing.  There are a set of Republicans that are aligned with us on tech policy  that we want to work with.  And you've got to compromise with them on maybe some of the other issues  because they'd be better than the other person running in that Republican  primary or whatever.  So there's there's there are things like that with that.  You end up making those kinds of compromises.  And obviously, obviously, I've got Republican friends and people  with all kinds of beliefs.  And that's that's that's not something that you don't necessarily want to fire  you know, family members and friends.  That's not what the point is.  If they demonstrably have beliefs that  discriminate against people and  measurably the place isn't as diverse as it could be, as it should be.  Then that's that's when you start asking about the default assumptions here.  Yeah, that's that's that's that's that's that's I think, you know, I  I haven't read everything that Ellen Powers remember,  but that's the point she's making the point of project include,  which is her thing is to say it's not just about  explicit discrimination, it's about the implicit stuff  that stops people from applying.  And having Peter Thiel on your board of directors is going to stop a lot of women  and minorities from applying because that's fair.  Because they would be like, I don't want to am I going to get a fair shake here?  Do I want anything to do with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just I feel like argument.  I'm sorry. Go ahead.  No, I was going to say it wasn't that Mozilla's argument with Brandon  that our audience really strongly believes.  And that's going to damage our ability to, I don't know, serve.  It was just how I wonder if there was a stop as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was it was it was a lot of employees saying this is, you know,  I was has been a good employer, employer of us.  We've had corporate support.  We're worried about this and what that implies  may be going on behind the scenes or even subconsciously.  And it makes us nervous.  And Brendan did not do a good job of apologizing,  expressing that and coming through with that.  But retreated into the I have a first met right to what I like, blah, blah, blah,  which didn't reassure them.  And I think that's what led to me being driven out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And let me reassure you, Stacey, I completely understand you're  100 percent understand your position and I'm equally appalled.  Although I find it ironic that.  You know,  Trent's been saying things like this, worse things in my opinion,  I think he could blow up the world.  I think it'd be bad for men and women, but  but I understand that he somehow crossed a very significant line.  There's proof past week. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, for some people, that's all like.  For some people, hearing that.  Yeah. Is enough.  I mean, it's.  Is it stupid? Maybe. But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if we had some historic if we had some distance, if we  because I'm thinking back, I remember Goldwater Johnson,  where Democrats thought Goldwater was, you know, as bad as Trump.  And if you look back historically, you might kind of laugh at that kind of.  And of course, Johnson made the very famous Daisy commercial  where the kid counts down and the nuclear bomb goes off.  And some say that that's why Goldwater lost.  But I, you know, I remember my uncle who was in the CIA at the time,  saying, I'm not voting for that Hasey Johnson.  So it was just as I mean,  and you can go back even farther well beyond my memory.  But into the 18th and 19th century, we had similar battles over other,  you know, similarly virulent battles.  And that's maybe part of the normal political discussion.  I mean, when 43, 44, 45 percent of the country support this guy,  this is this is actually Sam Altman's  point that he makes in his blog post.  We all we should all feel a duty to try to understand the roughly half of the country  that thinks we and by we he means the people who support Clinton  are severely misguided.  I don't understand how 43 percent of the country supports Trump,  but I'd like to find out because we have to include everyone in our path forward.  If our best ideas are to stop talking to or fire anyone who disagrees with us,  we'll be facing this whole situation again in 2020.  That kind of diversity is painful and unpopular,  but it's critical to the health of a democratic and pluralistic society.  We shouldn't start urging people for supporting the wrong political candidate.  That's not how things are done in this country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would feel better if we were having an honest debate over issues.  Well, so would we all.  Well, no, we're not.  But the 43 percent of the country that are voting for Trump in a lot of ways,  they're not voting for Trump.  They're voting against their current situation or voting against Clinton  or voting against Clinton.  And I think that's a really important distinction that,  honestly, the people in Silicon Valley are glossing over.  If 43 percent of the country thinks utterly differently from them,  some of that's probably because of the advantages or even jobs  that have been taken away, not because of Silicon Valley,  but it's certainly exacerbated by some of the things that Silicon Valley  has enabled or benefits that have accrued to places  that aren't maybe the middle of the country.  And I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's what I was trying to get at.  They're effectively voting against the neoliberal consensus.  And for some reason, Hillary is seen as more representative of that than Trump is  because Trump has positioned herself as being an outsider, despite being  a real estate developer with good relationships with banks.  Who comes from New York?  But that's, you know, that there's the choice people have got.  And Hillary is seen as representing the establishment.  And therefore, that's why the speeches to banks were an issue.  And that was there was all that stuff in the in the in the primary as well.  But some of that has stuck.  So that's a that is, I think, the divide that we're not quite seeing  because the parties have both been in the neoliberal camp for the last 20 years.  And that opposition has not been had a way to express itself.  So to some extent, Trump is riding that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then there's the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I need to move this umbrella so that I don't actually have a glowing white mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I like it. Actually, it's very timely.  It looks like you've been, you know, you've got a gag.  And then there's the opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal  by computer science, a Yale computer science professor  and quite highly respected computer science professor David Gellertner.  Trump and the emasculated voter.  He he says voting for Trump.  He's by the way, this is for Trump is like throwing a gin bottle  through the the windows of the White House and something he really wants to do.  So I it's just I don't I, you know, I think most of us are just can't wait  till this is all over.  But I thought I should raise this because this is it.  I know people say, well, it's not a tech issue.  It is a tech issue, because here we have Y Combinator, one of the premier  startup schools in the country and highly respected  in the middle of embroiled in this. And Peter Thiel, who.  Whatever you think of Peter Thiel is  one of our most successful investors.  In tech weird.  Samsung has asked and demanded that YouTube remove a video  of a Grand Theft Auto mod that involves using a Note 7 as a bomb.  This is a mod for Grand Theft Auto five that turns the Galaxy Note 7  into an in-game weapon.  And Samsung has issued a DMCA takedown.  I guess it does.  The mod does have the word Samsung.  It's clearly a Note 7. Right.  So and they succeeded.  This video no longer available due to a copyright claim by Samsung Electronics.  You can you can run Samsung, but you just can't hide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am intrigued by this idea of the airports letting you  like Samsung setting up trading stations and pop ups.  I love that. I feel so bad for Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do, too. And I love the Note 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My oh my so my mother and my mom and dad both have Note 7.  They they upgraded the first time.  And now my mom is like she's kind of in the point  where you will pry this from my cold dead hands.  She still has it. She still has it.  And my dad, she's like, your father has drunk the Kool-Aid.  He's turning it in. And I'm like, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get your mom to turn it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to turn it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my God. All right.  Let me let me explain.  We think we know now what's happening.  And we've had some very interesting conversations about this,  including yesterday with Steve Gibson  and on Sunday with Ben Thompson's Stratechary.  Ben was Ben's opinion.  And I think he's right that the reason that the even the replacement ones  are broken is it's a fundamental flaw in the way the battery was made,  not just the one made by the Samsung affiliate,  which is what they originally thought, but all of them.  They put too much battery in too small a case.  And the compression on the layers in the battery is causing plating to occur.  And the lithium ion plating around the insulator is causing short circuits.  In other words.  All Note 7s are potentially bombs and no Note 7 is safe.  And your dad and your mom should absolutely send hers back.  And I feel for I love the Note 7.  What a great phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do I tell her to get?  She's also upset because one of the games she's on,  she's at a high level and that's going to reset again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do I think a complete one for one trade and get 100 bucks from Samsung  if she gets a Galaxy S7?  OK, which has never had any problem.  It's been out for six months or seven months now.  It's a wonderful phone.  It is effectively a small Note 7 without the stylus.  Is she really attached to the stylus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's attached to the large size because I guess she's older.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A little smaller.  If she really wants a large, you know what?  Get her and get her an iPhone 7.  Say, oh, no, it's a Note 7.  They just changed the note to iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's not stupid.  OK.  She is a little weird about this, but she's not a dumb lady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She should look at the Galaxy S7 because it's it's just as good a camera.  It's the same screen.  It's just it is a little a little not a lot, a little smaller.  Right. It's a it's a very nice phone.  And it's basically the Note 7 was a slightly enlarged S7.  Otherwise, what do you think?  It's actually seven inches.  It's just a bit shy of six.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. The Note 7 was five point seven.  The S7 was five point five, I think.  It's right. Small difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a little bit. That's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't have a stylus.  It has a curved screen, though.  It looks like a little Note 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm hmm. So which is there another Android phone with a stylus  that's worth looking at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyone? There is another one.  And I'm trying to remember it's not I don't know if it's worth looking at.  I think LG makes one with a stylus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I look LG style to has the same screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Is this?  What's it called? The stylus, too.  Yeah, that looks like it.  Yeah. Five point seven inches, 13 megapixels,  3000 milliamp hour battery  just came out in June.  So since my class, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the one screen that I think, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all led. Yeah.  Well, no IPS. Sorry.  It's an LCD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it says 720 by 1290, which I but I think the Note 7 was higher than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. But this is still pretty high.  Yeah. I mean, she won't notice that difference, especially that, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's just strapping it to your face. It doesn't matter. Yeah. Right.  OK. That's one to look at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's one to look at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, I'm going to move this umbrella so that I can move your umbrella

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  while you're moving your umbrella.  I'll talk about our doorbell and we will continue on.  I have to. Oh, yeah, you could get an older note.  Actually, that's a good point. Get the note five.  I love the note five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, but how long is that going to be supported?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.  It's not. Oh, I don't know.  You know, I have a note five lying around. I could send it to you.  The note five was beautiful.  I liked the note five a lot. Stylus.  That's the one where if you put the stylus in wrong and broke it.  The one that you would get would be one with a broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I still think we need to know next to say I like that size.  I mean, I know I'm the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I thought every note is the note one.  I and I was mocked when I first got the note.  People thought I was that big thing.  What is that slab of meat you're out?  And I loved it. And I always loved it.  In fact, I love the note seven.  And I was I wept while I didn't really wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I suppose it was I have a little when I brought it.  Next to seven is the next size up.  It is seven inches. It's you know, it's two inches bigger.  It's a great thing to use, particularly if you've got, you know, poor vision.  But it's the same.  It's basically the same size of paperback book and weighs less.  So what is this?  The next to seven, the discontinued one, the one that they had.  Dead one. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish Google bring that back. I love that.  That was an actual seven inch screen, especially at that price point.  You know, that was it was two hundred thirty nine bucks or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's like, why does that why is that niche gone away?  That's that that was a lovely device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think Samsung's and others still make seven inch tablets.  I have I use my seven  all the time in my studio.  I put a it's a dedicated little Android app on it  that I use for timing my radio show on big screen.  I love it. I love it. And it's running fine.  But it will never be new guy, as you say. Right.  No new guy for you guy.  Our show today brought to you by the Ring Video Doorbell.  Hello, my ring. Here's the thing.  This is a doorbell that ties into your Wi-Fi.  Stacey is big in Internet of Things.  This is my favorite Internet.  In fact, to be honest, I have a lot of Internet of Things.  Things I don't use.  This one I use every day.  It replaced my doorbell.  So I unscrewed the doorbell, two screws, two little wires coming out of the jam.  This is actually a much nicer installation and everything you need comes  with the Ring Video Doorbell, the screwdriver, the drill bit.  If you needed one, which you won't and all the other do hickeys.  Whoops. Even a level.  This is the level. So it comes out beautiful.  And it's actually a nicer installation than my original  because it has this back plate that you trim the wires through and connect them  to the terminal.  And then this is the cool thing.  This is the Ring Video Doorbell.  By the way, this is the original 720p and it has a year long lithium ion battery.  So you can use this on an unwired doorbell as an unwired doorbell.  But if you have a wired doorbell, you might want to look at the new Ring Pro,  which is slimmer, smaller, doesn't have the battery and has a 1080p camera.  This is a very wide angle camera.  So when you tie it into your Wi-Fi, you can see who's ringing your doorbell.  You can even it's got motion detector, too.  So you can see if somebody comes up your steps, you're up your walk  and you can set the sensitivity.  So it's really nice.  You can set the range, you know, what it's looking at and how close.  It also has a speaker and a microphone.  So as somebody comes up your steps, you can say, I see you.  It'll be great for Halloween.  You will have so much fun with this.  It also scares away bad guys because they often come up to ring the doorbell  to see if you're home before they burglarize your house.  It will also allow you to tell package delivery people, hey,  just leave it on the porch there. I'll be right out. Thank you.  And keep an eye on that package.  And the beauty is you don't have to be home.  You can be anywhere in the world as long as you get online.  The app is for iOS and Android. They have a Mac app as well.  I think there's a new Windows app, too.  So you can I can even see previous videos.  So when the dogs, you know, when we were on vacation, we're in Russia.  I can see if the dog sitter actually came as she said she would to pick up Ozzy.  You know, and what time she came, I can.  It's almost like a log of everybody who came and went with video.  Now they've got a bunch of kits now on the site at ring.com slash twig r i n g dot com slash T W I G.  They call them the Ring of Security Kits,  and you can get a great big discount depending on the kit you want.  They also have besides the doorbell, they have the stick up cam,  which is a ring video doorbell minus the doorbell.  So it still has the camera microphone speaker.  And you get the little solar panel.  You don't even need to give it power. You can put it anywhere.  So now you can extend the area that you're keeping an eye on  with any Ring of Security Kit.  You also get their great little illuminated solar powered security sign,  which deters and tutors even before they walk up your path there.  They also offer the chime. I should mention that.  So if you are doing the you know, the unwired doorbell thing, the chime,  you plug it in anywhere. It's also connected to your Wi-Fi.  It rings when somebody presses the doorbell button.  So it's an additional ding dong for your doorbell.  And up to 150 bucks off, depending on which kit you select.  The Ring of Security Kits at ring.com slash twig.  Join the million.  This is really one of the most successful Internet of Things devices ever.  Join the millions of homeowners who are now protecting their home with a ring,  including me for a limited time.  You can get 150 bucks off one of those Ring of Security Kits,  ring.com slash twig, ring.com slash twig.  We thank them for their support of this week in Google.  What do you think actually, Stacey, is the most wise?  Is it the Nest, the most widely used IoT device?  What do you think?  Sonos.  That's not an IoT device, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an Internet connected speaker.  Yes, it is. Yeah. All right.  I guess you're right.  Nest, Echo, Echo, if they sold three million, nobody knows how many Nest is sold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's how many Echo's, Echo's was in the millions too, right?  Three million is the best guesstimate.  That must be the best selling then.  Yeah, that's kind of amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because well, I don't know how many Phillips like Hue bulbs have sold.  I feel like there's got to be like a million of those out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I don't think so.  That's especially who wants colored lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they have they have connected lights that aren't colored.  And then, oh, no, look at things like tile tiles, 40 million in revenue,  which means they've sold.  Millions of connected Bluetooth trackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tracker says they've sold a million and a half.  OK, well, thanks.  So, OK, yeah, I don't know.  I don't know if as Ring ever said, how many doorbells they've sold.  It's a lot more expensive than the trackers.  Thirty bucks. So it's a lot more expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think Jamie said how many they sold.  They're definitely the number one in that category.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they own the doorbell category.  Yeah, they own doorbells.  Yeah, they own the doorbell, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They own it for consumer now.  And I don't know if I get in trouble for saying this,  but there are other doorbells that are nicer or nice  that are sold, not direct to consumer.  What do you mean? Like sold to who?  My favorite of all video doorbells.  And you got to tell me if I'm getting in trouble here is the Vivint.  No, you can have whatever opinion you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  VIVENT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vivint, V-I-V-I-N-T.  But they are a security company and you pay them monthly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's a security system and then you pay a monthly fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I wish I knew who manufactured that doorbell, because it is  they have buffering.  None of the other doorbell companies offer this, but it's  when the doorbell rings or when it detects motion,  it pulls the last three seconds before the actual motion or doorbell.  Yeah. I mean, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute, though.  The ring would do that because it detected the motion.  So as soon as somebody comes up your OK, walk, they're recording.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Depending on how you have your point,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess somebody could like do a tomfool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cytle through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I get when I look at my ring, most of it is motion.  Most of its people walking by or cars pulling up and stuff like that.  And only a few of them are actual rings because you get everything  that's moving around there if you turn that on, which I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have the stick up cam that's in my backyard.  And actually, I just got an email today saying I need to recharge the battery.  And it's been up for two months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's good.  So you didn't get the solar panel for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have the solar panel, but I was curious how long the battery would last  because not everyone's going to get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're doing research. Good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not my informed opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So are you going to watch the election on Twitter?  Or are you going to watch it on TV?  Debate or debate or the election?  The election's coming up, you know, November 28th.  All you Trump voters get on out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I watch anything, it'll be on Twitter, but I probably won't watch the video of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  live. BuzzFeed's teaming up with Twitter on election night.  Election night as well. OK.  Yeah. And now that's interesting because didn't they have Bloomberg,  the Bloomberg stream?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They had the Bloomberg stream for the for the debates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. So maybe they're OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And also the tech news stream.  That was the thing we saw popping up this time last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. Oh, yeah, that's right.  So that deal is over.  So now it's going to be.  BuzzFeed. Interesting.  BuzzFeed and Twitter.  It's Twitter. So the sale is, I don't know what it's up in the air  because everybody who was interested is now dropped out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter is the Donald Trump of tech companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but and yet and yet this is when they're shining, right?  Is during these kind of political events like debates and then election night.  This is where Twitter really shines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that was so that was what we were saying last week is the value is  they give context to live events and they and they amplify me.  So there it is.  It is often better to actually just watch Twitter  than watch the TV to get interpretation of what's going on.  Because if you've if you've got a sensible number of people  you're following or if you just watch the trending stuff,  you will pick up what's a summary of what's happening along with the jokes  and things about it, too.  And that that is that is their big advantage.  That that is the thing they have that Facebook doesn't have.  And Google doesn't have.  So if anyone was going to buy Twitter, as I said before, it would be YouTube  because the correlation with live video makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is. It is a media company, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other one that somebody proposed last week was Bloomberg could actually buy it.  And that would fit both those criteria, the criteria of needs to be a Wall Street  person who would impose financial discipline that everyone was talking about,  but also is all about real time information and media.  And it could be because the Bloomberg terminals  and that's an interesting time.  So that was that was one that's like I hadn't thought of that.  And so the partnership with Bloomberg TV was was an interesting market there.  So that I'm not sure if Bloomberg's interested or wants to take that on.  But if that was that was like a they could probably afford it  or at least they could raise the money to do it.  And they would fit in with a big chunk of their core business,  which is making sense of the world in real time.  So that was that was one that sort of makes more sense than Disney say.  And I still think YouTube is another natural correlate.  But the challenge there is fitting the two companies together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter has also turned on  live streaming via Periscope and more than just streaming from your phone.  They want to get the pros involved because you could stream  from a lot of professional gear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you could do that. Plug in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could do it. We could plug our.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got a feed you can send into that, I assume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually don't know if they support our streamer, which is the elemental.  But if they didn't, they sure should, because that's a very popular one.  Or take it straight out of the TriCaster.  That's really a boy that, you know, for somebody like for a company like ours,  it's really interesting, all those different ways we could get to people.  And that, you know, yeah,  after I said all those bad things about Twitter, that would be very interesting,  wouldn't it?  There you go. Well, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The compelling thing is you're watching the video and you're commenting  and seeing the responses in real time on your phone.  In real time on your phone, at the moment, you do that by watching the TV  and using your phone, watching TV, using your computer, whatever.  But bringing it into the app makes a certain amount of sense.  It doesn't necessarily mean that we're the only way you watched it,  but it would mean you could carry on watching things when you're in those  those multiple contexts.  And so that's that that made sense for the football game stuff.  It makes sense.  The total stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the BBC World Service on Periscope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, this is a radio feed, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an audio only feed, but they're showing they're doing video  as well as audio.  They're showing this video.  Isn't that interesting?  I mean, that's kind of what we do, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I was at a conference when Bob Lord, who's in charge of security,  Yahoo was speaking and my plan was actually to periscope his talk  because they weren't live streaming it.  And then people could actually talk and comment on it.  I don't know. I.  I think Twitter has sitting so much information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not just information, I think that they if they could just figure it out.  That they're they're sitting on something very interesting,  but so is Facebook, right?  It's a race between Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is, but the piece that Twitter does have is the sort of live  contextualization and the interactivity, the built in interactivity,  the ability to have the conversation about it.  And they are better at that than anyone else.  And it was it was the thing that, you know,  it was a thing that I realized a few years ago when the Royal Wedding was on.  And I was like, the Royal Wedding is on.  Why would I watch that?  And it's like, I'll watch that live because British Twitter will be really funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Especially it was especially what do they call those hats, the attractors, the  fascinators, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it was I was sitting there watching it with the family stayed up  because it was a royal occasion.  We had a drink and had a laugh.  And they were like, why are you laughing so much?  So I'm here on my phone and reading the funniest people in Britain  mock this occasion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it is that.  What a valuable thing if you can take something that no one would watch  otherwise and by adding your secret sauce all over it, make it compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sharknado. Do you remember Sharknado?  Was it two or three? I mean, people were tweet.  Hate watching that for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And in some respects, it makes more sense.  It doesn't mesh well with network television because in the US  you've got three time zones.  So two thirds of the country is going, no spoilers, don't tweet about it.  When they when they do the voice of the American, they vote.  They're basically saying East Coast vote West Coast.  If you can vote, but that means you will be able to expose the show for yourself.  So making making it sort of a parallel naturally lighting like that  makes more sense.  But in a country that has a more unitary time zone like the UK or France or Japan,  having that everyone's watching the same thing at once makes a lot more sense.  And so there's there's a sort of natural correlation.  I follow enough British people on Twitter that I get a sense of what's on TV  in the UK by what people are mocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or when the Great British Bake Off has drama. Good Lord.  Oh, yes.  I just read an article in the New York Times that said the Great British Bake Off

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is bringing baking back to Britain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This cake isn't spongy enough.  Do you watch it?  I've watched I've watched one because everyone was so excited about it.  And I was like, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. Well, the problem I have with it was make me want to eat sweet treats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not those sweet treats. Good Lord. Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That wasn't good. I mean, you're British.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not you're not allowed to have a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do French things and other things as well.  They have a different challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're mostly like angel or spongy cakes  that aren't really cake consistency with like cream or fruit jams and weird.  I don't it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you watch it? You watch it on BBC America.  Netflix. Oh, yeah. Netflix.  I guess I'll be watching. Yeah.  Is there a lot of fondant involved?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's on PBS now as well, I think. But there are a season behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. Oh, yeah.  I don't know if they do.  I don't think they have a lot of fondant or fondant or whatever in British baking.  No, it depends.  I had was not that was not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was sponge cake sponge cakes are famous each week is themed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So each week they have to do one certain class of things.  So there'll be a bread week and there'll be a patisserie week  and there'll be a iced fondant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about pesto and sun dried tomato palmiers  or savarin with Chantilly cream?  Mm hmm. Mm hmm.  Here's chocolate and coffee fondant fancies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there you go.  And a fancy is the thing, right?  Isn't that like a descriptive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is it fancy? It looks like a it's a small cake.  It's like a like a like a petty for sweet.  Here in America, we have fairy cake, fairy cake, fairy cake.  Fairy cake is what you call a cupcake, only not quite so big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, I want a fairy cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. I don't I don't know how we got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've turned into the Pinterest of podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the show's got off the rails, off the rails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The point about Bake Off is that it does have all these people  commenting along with it and enjoying it.  And I could tell it was on to this afternoon in here,  this evening in the UK, because I can see all this stuff going across the screen.  And I'm like, oh, right.  There's a new episode outside because everyone's grumbling about  Paul Hollywood flirting with the bakers and things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  150 page report released Tuesday by the Center for Privacy  and Technology at Georgetown University Law School found  the FBI databases, facial recognition databases,  have 117 million Americans, about half of all adults.  That means half of all of you  are in this database and very few  oversights or limitations on how it's used, how it's searched, who looks through it.  Is that a problem or does it just make police better?  Police say it helps us.  We don't have to do racial profiling because a computer doesn't know.  Part of the reason we're in this is because your driver's license, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was about to say your computer is trained in a different way.  But did you see so tie that information to the Verge's story  about Baltimore police feeding their database into social media  companies like Instagram and Facebook to get actual identities?  And suddenly that can you see that?  Did you pull up the link for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram sent feeds that help police track minorities  in Ferguson and Baltimore.  Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I mean, the companies were just exposing their APIs and the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this specialist company was Geofeedia, a Chicago based company that says it analyzes.  It takes the data via API without, you know, doesn't go to Facebook, say,  Hey, can we just socially profile your it just takes the feed and then analyzes  the post to deliver real time surveillance information for 500 law enforcement  agencies so they can track and respond to crime.  I don't get it. What are you going to tweet?  Hey, I just robbed that lady down the street.  Some people do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? Yes, there are.  There are people who would put that on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm all for this because this is going to this is going to eliminate  the stupid criminal from the gene pool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but then you get then you're selecting for smarter criminals.  This is you're right.  They can get that's like only taking half the penicillin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my God. I never thought of it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's.  And that's when I saw the cops have 170 million faces.  My first thought was like, I bet my ex-wife saying, is that all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Why are why is it?  Why aren't why isn't everybody in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's a lot of young people who haven't taken driver's license photos.  How many how many states?  Don't there's only a certain percentage of states that actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have a picture on your Texas driver's license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Texas is one of the states that do feed into this.  I'm totally in this database. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if you don't do anything wrong, you have nothing to fear.  Yeah. If you don't do anything wrong and you don't tweet about it,  you have nothing to fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh huh. Well, what if I buy a burner phone with cash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or you've been watching the wired.  The wire.  Quiet. The wired is different.  How about this one? Joe Biden says we're going to get them.  Ruskies.  The CIA, according to the vice president, is preparing for a major  retaliation against Russia for hacking the DNC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why would you say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Joe, Joe, why would you say that?  So the director of national intelligence,  one of our favorite admirals, James R.  Clapper, the guy who said, no, we're not spying on any Americans.  No. Issued a statement that pointed his finger at Russia for attempting  to interfere with the 2016 election.  Leaks, he said, are consistent with the methods and motivations  of Russian directed efforts.  President Putin says that's a political, that's a political ploy.  And then then Biden, on one of the Sunday shows, meet the press, said,  yeah, we're we're going to we're going to retaliate proportionally.  Actually, they did just arrest this morning or yesterday  a guy they think might be Guccifer, too.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't we didn't hear it?  Guccifer one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think it a good for one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. Wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Guccifer, too, is the follow on for Guccifer one.  Let me see if I can find that story, but because they just arrest.  You got it. There you go.  Russian hacker wanted by FBI is arrested in Prague.  We don't know if it's Guccifer, but we think they think,  according to this story in The New York Times,  that it might be somebody involved in the hacking of the DNC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. OK.  I'm like, I don't know what to say other than, yes, we have to believe  that Russia's hacking. I believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The man did not resist arrest.  He was captured and raided a hotel in central Prague.  Actually, it's only been announced yesterday was captured a week ago  October 5th, about 12 hours after authorities heard he was in the country  where he drove around in a luxury car with his girlfriend.  He must have had their face must have been in the database.  Man was a Russian citizen suspected of hacking attacks on targets  in the United States.  The arrest was conducted in collaboration with the FBI  after Interpol issued an arrest warrant.  They think maybe this is the guy who hacked linked in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the arrest occurred two days before the Obama administration said,  we now know it was the Russian government who hacked us.  So I don't know if these are connected.  Oh, no, here it is.  Law enforcement officials in Washington speaking on condition of anonymity  said that the suspect did not appear to be related to the hacking  of the Democrats emails or to organizations like DC leaks or Wiki leaks.  Meanwhile, Julian Assange has lost his Internet access.  Oh, and yeah, oh, and the Ecuadorian embassy.  They say the Ecuadorians say we, you know,  we didn't want him to interfere with the U.S. election.  Not that Julius Julian was releasing emails from his, you know,  little apart there.  I don't know.  Maybe he was. He was pretty sure it was something, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe.  And doesn't he do like, what are those called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not webinars when Julian Assange does them.  Does little talks.  He knows like Snowden, and so they they appear at.  Oh, they appear as robots, whatever, yes.  Yeah. Yes.  I don't know if he was doing anything like that.  Telepresence robots as he move around on the stage like Snowden does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, I got to praise Larry Lessig.  We love we all everybody loves Larry.  Oh, yes. He's been on sabbatical.  He's been in a lot of the TV shows.  He's been on sabbatical. He's been in Iceland.  I think he was on his way.  He says, I'm on my way from Iceland to my parents to see my dad,  who's not doing well.  Posted this on his blog, Lessig Tumblr dot com.  Landing in JFK, I found my inbox flooded with questions  from one of the leaked Podesta emails.  This is an email exchange between John Podesta,  chairman of the Clinton campaign, and a woman named Nira Nira Tandon.  Nira writes about Lessig.  I effing hate that guy.  Like, I'd like to kick the poop out of him on Twitter,  but I know that's dumb.  That was in response to Podesta saying,  an everyday American pompous law professor,  the smugness of Larry Lessig.  Now, if I were Larry, I my feelings might be a little hurt.  Although apparently he knows Nira.  And here's his very, I thought, very lovely response.  I'm a big believer in leaks for the public interest.  That's why I support Snowden and why I believe the president  should pardon him.  But Lessig writes, I can't for the life of me  see the public good in a leak like this,  at least one that reveals no crime or violation  of any important public policy.  We all deserve privacy.  The burdens of public service are insane enough  without the perpetual threat that every thought shared  with a friend becomes Twitter fodder.  Nira has only ever served in the public  and public interest sector.  Her work has always and only been devoted  to advancing her vision of the public good.  It is not right that she should bear the burden  of this sort of breach.  Not only is he not publicly offended,  but he's publicly defending her and spanking WikiLeaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And indeed you for really out, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I guess I shouldn't.  Well, he posted it on his blog.  He's not suppressing it.  That's a good point.  But I thought that was, what a gentleman.  And of course we love Larry Lessig.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it was very clear that they locked him out  of the debates on very spurious grounds early on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, cause he was running for president  and he had a very interesting plan.  He says there's no way anything can happen  until we get rid of this crappy system  of campaign financing.  So here's what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna get a great vice president.  He'll be huge, he'll be great.  He'll be the best ever.  And then, because no one who actually is running for office  will ever get rid of the way campaigns are financed,  that's how it's self-reinforcing.  So I will win, I will eliminate,  I will institute public funding of campaigns,  eliminate private funding of campaigns,  fix this whole mess, then resign  so this other guy can be president.  Which I thought was an interesting point of view.  Right.  Because the policy ended almost before it began.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but basically they changed the rules three times  to stop him showing up in the primary debates.  Right.  And that was, his point was to do that  and then argue the others into supporting the policy,  which probably Bernie would have done  cause it's the kind of thing,  he already had something like that in his platform.  Get it on the agenda, absolutely, yeah.  So that was the point of thing.  But also to some extent,  his point was sort of undermined by the way  the primaries went, which he didn't go with the money,  which is also fascinating.  In the Republican side,  the three candidates with the most money got knocked out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Interesting, yeah.  Jeb Bush, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Has Elon Musk made his announcement?  No, that's in an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So. Is this the one where the model 3s are deleted?  No, that's on the site, nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's supposedly some big announcement.  Apparently it's model 3 part 2.  It's coming with a trailer.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that will ship in 2020.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  2020, I don't know what he's gonna say.  Send your money now.  He says it's gonna take things to another level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he's gonna build a second story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have a couple of Decker cars.  We should point out that Stacey and I both drive Teslas.  So, okay.  We like the guy.  Let's wrap up with  the fond farewell to Leo Baroneck,  of Bolt Baroneck and Newman.  He was an acoustics designer who, with BBN,  basically designed the internet  under government instruction,  passed away at the age of 102.  So, BBN was a really important Boston engineering company.  In 1969, they won a contract from DARPAnet  to build the first computer-based network.  It came to be called ARPANet.  And from DARPA, they got the,  from the Defense Department's  Advanced Research Projects Agency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I tell you that I've been watching The Americans  and the excitement in that show over the ARPANet  is just awesome.  Yes.  They're like, the ARPANet, it's gonna be big.  So, The Americans takes place in the 60s?  No, it takes place in the 80s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The 80s.  But, yeah, so it's a little,  that's a little anachronistic, but okay.  No, no, it's, no, no.  Did we call it ARPANet then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was the ARPANet, yes,  because when did it become like the actual internet?  Not the browser.  I know this is everybody's like big thing  because everyone's like,  oh, it's the 25th anniversary of the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that was last year.  That's the web.  Yeah, that's the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the web.  No, I was, oh God, late 80s?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it was called the internet  roughly that time as well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like mid-80s, it was still ARPANet  and separate Janet and all the other things  were connected together.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, and then NSF controlled and ran it all  until the early 90s when they said,  okay, do whatever you want.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  National Science Foundation.  Anyway, Leo Leroy Baroneck of Bolt Baroneck and Newman.  Wow, did he see a world that changed  from his birth in 1914 to his death this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ooh, that was the beginning of World War I, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Ooh.  What a world.  What a world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I also read a great essay  about how the Soviet invented the internet  and why it didn't work.  Um.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which was.  Why?  Why did it, because they didn't have open standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically, it didn't work because they were too busy  trying to keep it secret in fighting amongst bureaucrats.  Right.  So their one failed because they were behaving  too like proprietorily and competing with one another  and the American one succeeded  because they were behaving more socially  and sharing with one another.  But it's a great article, it's worth reading,  by Benjamin Peters, who's basically been researching,  has written a book about it and has summarized his book  into a very nice article.  But there was basically.  Secret Soviet research program  to try and build the sort of country-wide network.  Wow.  But it got squashed because the people  running the different organizations  didn't want the information to flow.  They wanted to keep control.  In Soviet Russia, internet reads you.  And to some extent, that applies to the British experiments  with packet switching as well,  because they were done under the auspices  of the extension of the war program,  which was very secretive.  And so that was not recognized in the same way  that ARPANET was, because ARPANET was done in public.  So a lot of it is about actually publishing  the protocols and the work you can use  so other people can adopt it too.  And that didn't happen with a lot with the Soviet one  and with the other ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this a book, How Not to Network a Nation?  That's the book.  Benjamin Peters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing I read was the article in Aeon,  which I just chucked in the.  Oh, Aeon.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You both are big Aeon fans.  I gotta start reading that.  That was good.  What is Aeon?  I mean, I know it's aeon.co.  Is it a, was it a magazine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a magazine, but don't they also,  or am I thinking of Quanta that does the licenses,  the articles out to other publications?  Aeon does too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a license.  There's a republish this on the side thing there too.  Because they're a nonprofit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Soviet Internet, they called it.  That is a good title.  Internet is not good.  Oh, I love it.  I'm gonna read this.  It's by the guy who wrote the book actually.  It's a very good article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very well done and nicely edited and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Aeon is very good.  Aeon.co.  Very good stuff.  And boy, watch out.  October 21st, if we can't reach an agreement,  these guys are going on strike.  Any guesses?  These are the guys who voice video games,  unless an agreement is made this week  between SAG and AFTRA and a coalition of video game companies.  By the way, I'm a SAG AFTRA member disclaimer here.  So if they go out on October 21st,  I'm gonna have to stop working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On video games or start working at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I gotta support them.  I can't cross my own picket line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to stop playing video games.  That's it.  I'll stop playing video games.  I'll be blacklegging, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, they earn more than $100 an hour plus benefits  and that's the minimum.  Many make much, much more money.  In fact,  Do they get residuals?  Some do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that what the argument's about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're a really good voiceover actor.  Depends what you can negotiate.  Did I say somewhere that Mark Zuckerberg  is looking for a voice for Jarvis?  He is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello, Mark.  What can I do for you today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, are you auditioning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would like to be your voice, Mark.  Maybe you'd prefer to have something silly.  Hello, Mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, I'll do it.  Whatever way you want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Any way you want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone put in the chat room and it's worth maybe saying.  David, is it, I don't know how to say his last name,  but the founder of PC World, Macworld, et cetera.  David Benell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a great article by our friend Harry McCracken.  I don't know when Benell passed.  He passed sometime.  He said Tuesday night.  Oh, well then that is a big deal.  David is well known by anybody who's ever read a magazine.  He was the founder of PC Magazine, PC World, and Macworld.  And a really great guy and everybody who's worked  in this business as a tech journalist.  I never met the man, but everybody who's worked  in the business certainly knew of him.  He edited and started in 1975,  Mitz Altair's newsletter about their computer,  Computer Notes, which is probably the first personal  computer magazine, started personal computing,  wonderful magazine, co-founded PC Magazine and PC World,  which were at each other's throats for many years  during the 80s and 90s.  And then Macworld.  Harry wrote a very nice tribute to David Benell  who passed at the age of 69 on Tuesday.  And of course, Harry knew him very well.  He worked at PC World for 13 years.  Yeah, kind of a legend in the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So one more thing for me to throw in was the article  I wrote, well, this was published today,  about how the web became unreadable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And how did it become unreadable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a long story, but basically there's a whole series  of choices that designers made.  You can actually see it on that page there.  The type at the top is illegible because it's so gray.  There's been this trend to make type grayer and grayer.  Yeah, why is that?  I hate that.  So my theory on that is that it started when we went  from CRTs to LCDs, suddenly, and with Microsoft ClearType,  suddenly, instead of being fuzzy around the edges,  all the pixels were actually squares.  And also with the ClearType and the sub-pixel rendering,  it went to much crisper letters.  And so the designers was like,  everything just suddenly got sharper.  I want to soften that a bit.  And at that point, they started switching to using  slightly less black and white and more gray on white  or gray on gray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is my favorite passage.  Apple's typography guidelines suggest that developers aim  for a seven to one contrast ratio,  but they state it on their website in text  that's five and a half to one.  Yep. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google too.  Google say seven to one, and then they have it 4.6 to one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see a lot of gray text.  It's low contrast, I guess, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's a collection of things.  There was that initial thing where people started using  grays a lot, and then that just became the default.  There was Apple pushing very hard for the very thin fonts,  which makes it even worse.  So when they went to Hevesco and Noire,  like as the system font,  suddenly everything went down in contrast enormously.  But I think a big part of it is that designers  and software engineers who are building these things  are sitting in well-lit offices with very big bright screens  and have a huge amount of contrast headroom.  Whereas when you're sitting outside looking at your phone,  so much more of that contrast has gone away  from the illumination and the environment you're in.  And so there is, it's a sort of failure to model  what people are seeing.  And also part of it is that anyone who's working  graphic design tends to have extremely good eyesight.  Right.  Perhaps.  Whereas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also it's true that really black, black on white, white  is so contrasty that it actually can,  to me it's a little painful almost, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that says to me is you should turn the brightness  of your screen down.  Oh, I never thought of that.  The point is that an office screen,  you are sitting there staring into a light bulb.  Those things are 100 watts.  The background illumination is very strong  and the desks, the laptops, they have ambient light sensors.  The desktop things don't.  So a lot of people are staring to two bright screens  and they sort of reflexively compensate in that way.  So part of this would be go around and A,  put sort of a fill light behind your screen  so that it's not the brightest thing in the room,  but also turn down the brightness so,  or adjust it across the day so that you're not sitting there  peering into this giant glow  because then you subconsciously start doing it wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When we redesign our website,  we got a lot of complaints from people who said,  why did you use a white background?  It's too bright, it's too bright, it's too bright.  And I think you're right.  I mean, but you can't really tell your users,  oh, just turn your monitor down, you nitwit.  Your white is too bright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's part of the problem is that  they've had to turn it up  because all these other sites are using gray on gray.  Oh, just to read the gray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you're like the equivalent of a loud commercial  in the middle of a TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So we get some tea and we dyed it all a little bit yellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, so I'm happier with like,  if you've got a brightness issue, turn down the white.  Don't bring up the black to gray.  Even if that's your issue,  making the black sort of 45% white  doesn't actually help as much as turning the white down  to a more neutral color.  So that's, people look at this and say,  I'll reduce the contrast and they do it the wrong way.  And that's just this sort of weird fashion  that we've got into.  So I'm pushing back against that.  But the other half of it is that  the contrast ratios we use to measure  are based on foreground color over background color  with a modifier.  But the point is, if you don't take into account  the weight of the font, how wide the individual strokes are,  then you're missing a lot of the actual contrast.  And the accessibility standards we use  don't think about the font weight and font width at all.  Or they talk about it in sort of,  yeah, so that's the example.  These are both notionally the same contrast  if you measure them by the ACAG thing,  because that just specifies foreground to background color.  But in practice, the one on the right is much dimmer  because the font verticals and horizontals are much thinner.  And that's part of the problem is that  we now have more control over typography,  but we're using it in silly ways.  We're using it to make things too thin and less legible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Kevin, I love that you exist.  I know, isn't it great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it.  And this time it's gonna be grumpy with me  for the rest of the week.  Follow Kevin on Medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, follow him on Medium.  And by the way, indyweb.com now, right?  .org.  Oh, .org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody got the .com a while ago.  It's an ISP that has gone out of business, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  IndyWeb is a people-focused alternative  to the corporate web.  Let's make the web the way it used to be.  The content is yours.  You're in control.  And yet we're all talking with one another.  It's a great site.  And you guys have the Homebrew Website Club meetings  on a regular basis.  Next meeting is coming up tonight, Bellingham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's some tonight.  Well, there's some, you missed the ones  in England and Germany.  But Portland, San Francisco, and Bellingham.  No, that's wrong.  We need to fix that.  It's not Portland, San Francisco,  but there are other ones going on.  Portland, San Francisco are actually next week.  We moved out, but we need to change the homepage.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, what do you got for us as a pick of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  I have two things.  Well, okay.  Are you gonna be mad at me for showing you two things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, the show is yours.  Go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, here we go.  I've gotta turn the light on.  So this is the Hue Brighter Colors lamp.  And this is always so fun to do anything under that dress.  I'm like, ah, what am I doing?  I don't even know.  Oh, I'm adding a room.  You would think I would know how to do this.  Okay, here we go.  I am excited because I used to have,  so the first initial hues came out  and they didn't do greens really well.  So it didn't allow you to do beautiful turquoise colors  like this.  And here's my,  see?  I don't know if that comes out.  This is hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The white balance fights with it.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm like, it's gonna perpetually.  So you can kind of see it against my shirt maybe.  And so now you've got that.  So this now makes the Hue light bulbs  as good as the Lifex bulbs in my opinion,  unless you like really hate hubs,  like Kevin Toffle hates hubs.  So these new, they're even richer colors  on these new Hue bulbs.  This was kind of what you look for on the box.  But this is like convinced me to go all in on Hue  because now I finally have this beautiful color that I love.  So that's one.  Two is my recipe.  So I put a video there.  This is not the best shot video.  It is not like super impressive,  especially compared to like that dude  who did the Time Warp song on his garage.  What?  I don't know.  Okay, so these are my Halloween lights.  And I just basically,  so my recipe is basically,  how do I automate my lights?  That was it.  It was short.  It was short and sweet.  The whole goal here is before Christmas,  I wanted to tell people how I'm doing this  so they could be like,  boom, these are the things I need.  So what is the command?  Turn on Halloween.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, turn on Halloween.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Turn on Halloween.  So there's a couple things here.  From what you're seeing in the front,  there are two GE Outdoor Z-Wave modules that you can buy.  You can also use iDevices if you're a HomeKit person.  iDevices makes an outdoor module,  but that's like $75.  The GE ones.  It's just waterproof, right?  That's the point.  Yeah, it's just, it's IP65 or something rated.  So in the GE ones are $35.  And I have a lot of them, so I went with GE.  If you do the GE, you're gonna need a hub  that speaks E-Wave though.  So then I use the Wink Hub for mine.  You could use SmartThings.  And you basically, what else am I thinking?  You connect those to the hub  and then the hub talks to the Echo.  So I set a schedule on Wink and then I also did the Echo.  And so I say, Echo, turn on Halloween  and turn off Halloween and it's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It obviously could be more elaborate.  You know, this is just a proof of concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's actually, okay guys,  it's my actual Halloween lighting.  Well, it's Halloween.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't gotta go crazy in Halloween.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Christmas, I have nine different connected outlets  plus some music.  Wow.  You do, really?  Yeah, cause I love Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I love Halloween too,  but I think Christmas, you should definitely go all out.  I wanna see this now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, well Christmas,  so it's like I have lights on my banisters, you know,  and then the Christmas tree gets its own stuff  and then there's the outdoor lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So some of it's indoors, some of it's outdoors.  All right, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not a professional lighting designer.  And if anyone's really,  you gotta see the guy who did the time warp thing  on his garage, cause you will feel like,  oh, Stacey, why did you even show me yours?  Your socks.  It is really fantastic.  He does stadium lighting, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see.  Oh yeah.  This guy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you get both in, Stacey?  You didn't, so I shouldn't wrap it up yet.  You did?  All right.  I did.  This would be a good time then.  Oh man.  Oh man.  To say thank you for joining us this week in Google.  We do the show every Wednesday at 1.30 PM,  Civic 4.30 Eastern.  20.30 UTC.  Thanks to Stacey Higginbotham.  You'll find her at stacey on iot.com,  gigastacey on Twitter,  where she tweets all sorts of stuff.  And thanks to Kevin Marks, indyweb.org.  We'll see y'all next time on Twig.  That's crazy.
