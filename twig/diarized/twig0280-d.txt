Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From her Brooklyn basement abode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Good to be here.  I can't believe it's our last show of 2014.  That's crazy.  I'm going to be around on New Year's Eve.  It's not my last time on Twitter in 2014.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's right.  And we should mention that.  We're going to have a new show.  And then some of you will appear on our New Year's Eve show,  which is two weeks from now.  By about this time, I'll be like, my eyes will be gone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is also here,  professor of journalism at City University of New York.  BuzzMachine.com is his blog.  And also writes a lot on Medium.  Hello, boys and girls.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even without a New Year's show, I'm tired.  I'm of that age.  It's time for a nap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the story that you could not reveal to us,  of course, last week because you embargoed,  broke immediately after the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh no, it didn't.  It was driving me nuts.  Because I knew the story during the show.  As I said to you, I had an embargo,  which you advised not doing, but I did.  For other purposes.  And I went to them,  and I saw that it had broken in a Spanish site.  So as we're on the show,  I was emailing Google saying,  release me, let me go.  And I respected the embargo,  and I said,  it's going all over the web,  people are asking about it on Twitter, come on.  No, no, no, no, no.  And then about an hour after the show,  they said, oh, we're going to release it soon.  Timing.  So the story was  that Google News was shutting down in Spain  because of the Spanish link tax.  Which may not be huge news,  as I said last week to all of you,  but to me it was huge news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and Spain did what Germany did,  only they went even a little bit farther.  A lot farther.  Because the Spanish law required  a newspaper to bill Google  if Google even featured a headline  from the Spanish news.  Forget snippets, even a headline.  Any text at all from the Spanish publication,  then the Spanish publication  was required by that law  to ask for royalties from Google.  Google's response was,  we don't make any money on Google News,  you want us to pay for Google News?  No, that's fine, no problem, we'll just shut it down.  And so they did.  They did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the res...  Finally called a European bluff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And well done,  because just as the German publishers,  Google did do this in Germany too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, Google said the difference was,  Google said in Germany,  if you don't give us permission,  we will not put up snippets.  We will put up... No, well they still put up headlines.  No pictures, no snippets,  just a headline, because that was what the law allowed.  They said, okay, we'll put up a headline.  And for  a developed and three minor  built brands, built Auto  and two others, they did that.  Two weeks later, the Germans cried  Uncle, or Onkel.  And...  Very subtle German joke there.  And...  And...  Said, we lost too much traffic,  and we go back up. Now with that lesson  having been had, the Spanish  passed their law, and full disclosure  here, I spoke on this  the week that they passed it, at a Google  event in Spain, Google paid my travel expenses,  they do not pay fees to me.  And I told them,  I said, this is dangerous, you're killing  the web, this is going to be bad,  you're not going to want this. And of course,  all of Spain didn't listen to me.  And  they passed the law, and Google said  as of Tuesday,  this law is supposed to go into effect January  1, but Google said, we can't negotiate  with you. In Germany, we can negotiate. We could say,  we'll put up headlines, no snippets, agree or not.  Here, there was no option  on the publishers of any size  to agree. And then the publishers  afterwards, supposedly  trying to go to the EU, saying  help, and kind of make Google  negotiate, but I talked to Google about this,  and  Google, to their interpretation,  the Spanish publishers were trying to say, make  them pay, and we're not paying. So  no, that's it.  Google News, Google News fame right  now is dead. As of 8.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eastern last night, they shut it down, and  already, according to Matthew Ingham  writing a gigaohm, Chartbeat is reporting  double digit declines  in  outside traffic to these Spanish news  sites. The blue line is today,  the green line is the same day last week.  Double digit declines  already, and guess what?  This, I love this. This must make Google  feel so good. Less than 12  hours later, Spanish publishers have  gone to the government asking  for help.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Be careful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what you wish for, amigos.  So this is just Google News? This isn't

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  just straight from Google Search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a really good question, Gina.  Because this is specifically,  the law is specifically written

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to aggregators, to the act of aggregating,  and Search is a different act.  So if I come across  a headline in Search  that is not, even though Google  News, we know in America, basically  provides those headlines, it's not  a headline in Search.  It's not a headline in Search.  We know in America basically provides those headlines.  But if I search for a headline, and it  comes up in Search, that's not a problem.  If you aggregate the headlines,  this was aimed strictly at Google News,  then you're out. But of course,  it's not just Google News. Anybody else who  aggregates headlines in the same boat,  what's so abhorrent about  this, is it taxes speech?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Spanish  Association of Daily Newspaper Publishers  said in a statement late last week, the closure of  Google News is not equivalent  to the closing of another service, given its  dominant position in the market.  And will undoubtedly have a negative impact on  Spanish citizens and business. They  therefore require the intervention  of Spanish and EU  authorities, and of  competition authorities to protect the rights of  citizens and business. They want the next  step, a law forcing Google to  keep Google News open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm trying to understand  the logic here. So the idea is  Google's not allowed to  create another front page to our content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because, well, okay, I'll be  a Spanish publisher for a moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please. So we work very hard with  many, many, many dollars making  a beautiful newspaper.  You're a Hasidic Spanish publisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That sounds Italian, but I'll take it. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's a newspaper. It's made of fine  Corinthian. No. The newspaper.  You  take and make a page  with the headlines and the snippets.  Nobody gonna read the newspaper,  because you have basically piggybacked

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on our content, and you're  reusing our content without  giving us any compensation for it.  It's as if Google  went out and took clips from all  the podcasts, put it on one  page, so nobody would have to listen to the podcast anymore,  because I got everything I need on the one page.  Okay. I think that's not an unreasonable  you know, I can understand why they  feel that way. What it does  and what it ignores is the amount of traffic  that Google actually does send to them.  And now they have, you know,  proof of this. That in  fact, it's a net gain for you,  because it doesn't stop people from going to  your sites. More people go to your sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Indeed, if anyone should be charging  anybody, it's Google should be charging for  the distribution and promotion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the words of iBookery,  my name is Spanish

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  newspaper. You killed my  circulation. Now prepare to  die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry. That's a very bad  play on  you know,  Princess Bride. It's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How would you feel if someone,  and I know the fans of Twitter have done this,  but say someone did a  massively viral supercut  of Twitter videos  that removed all the  sponsors and were just the best parts  and you know, it was  someone completely unaffiliated with Twitter,  and it went totally viral on YouTube,  and people loved it, and  that was the video that people were sharing.  I mean, I guess this is really a great analogy  because you don't, you know, you can't drive through...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd tell you what, I'll be honest, I'd be thrilled about it.  Our license in fact, explicitly  allows that we're Creative Commons.  You can remix our content.  The only requirements are you have to give attribution.  It would have to say this is a mashup  of Twitch shows, and  you can't do it for commercial purposes, so you could  put it on YouTube, but you couldn't monetize it on YouTube.  And that's exactly what Google's  doing, by the way. They are not monetizing.  There's no ads on Google News.  And they're remixing it.  And the reason I would welcome it is because  it would be my hope, and I'm pretty sure it would be the case  that people would watch and go, oh, I like that.  Let me find out more about Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and indeed, Gina, when  Repost on us was alive, and we  worked with them, and we're working in New Jersey with  an alternative now like copyright, but  the data for Repost showed  that when people read an embedded  article, the entire article, or the  entire blog post was embedded  on your site, from  Buzz Machine, let's say, that  the click-through rate, which you'd think would be zero  under the argument you just made, because you've just read  the entire article. You're sated. You're full. No more.  I have no hunger. Thank you very much.  Instead, the click-through rate  ran as a rule 5 to 7%.  Interesting.  Which says that, and those are  very qualified clicks, because they're all saying,  hey, I like you, and you don't like me.  And what it says is,  your content is your best ad.  What we need is new business  models to support this kind of distribution.  But that's not what,  so actually, I think that we needed  to do it somewhere. I've been trying to find  cooperative parties for years who would do a  study on this. I wrote a white paper about this a couple years  ago. What I want to do is test  the kinds and lengths  of links to see what's most effective.  And I think that there's an argument  that says that  something that's too short  isn't actually that good. Google's links  now on Google News are actually too short  because you don't know enough what you're going to get.  We'll bother clicking. And it's impossible for me  to say that the argument you made, I think,  Gina, that they're making is,  well, you're sated. You're full. You knew everything  you needed to know. Well, yeah, if what you need to know  is just simply  that you can buy Cuban cigars  again, then that's  all you need to know. But in fact, you're going to want to  know more than that. You want to go say, well, what is the deal  with this Cuban thing? And can I get cigars? And what's  the whole thing? And by the way, what's about the Cuban rights  and all kinds of things? You're going to go and look farther.  But if all you need to know is  rain tomorrow, yeah,  that information stops you. But for the  kinds of things that are in Google News, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just not the case. And they're not doing whole articles, right?  They're just doing snippets. Just doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  brief snippet. Now, then I think  that's one level, right? The other extreme  is the whole article, which I just talked about.  The question for me is, what's the most  effective in the middle? If you look  at  Business Insider,  and many, many other sites,  I don't mean to pick on Business Insider, but Business Insider,  Giga Home, lots and lots of sites,  basically  take out the soul of an article, rewrite it, make it  shorter. Now,  that's a different argument because what that says is,  well, maybe your article is too long and it's actually a  service to give me a shorter version.  And maybe I don't click through from that because I got everything I  needed. Or maybe it entice  me so much, I did want to read the whole thing.  There's no research whatsoever  on that kind of data. And I want to try to work with some  places like Sharpbeat and cooperative publishers  to do some A-B tests and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  figure that out. I have to say, the way  I use Google News is exactly  as, this is basically  just an ad for  the longer story, as far as I'm  concerned. So I go to SciTech  on Google News, and I  see top stories, much like  Techmeme, which does the same thing.  A snippet is no more than a sentence or two.  That doesn't, that doesn't,  that just tells me kind of what the story is about  and where they're going with it.  And at that point, I'm always  going to click, and I always do,  on the link and read the story and see the  ads, more importantly, on the  source site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, were you making a devil's advocate argument or  do you think

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google News does go too far?  Yeah, I'm trying to understand where  they're coming from and what they feel  that Google  is taking away from them. So I was asking  Leo  because  I just wondered  Well, you know,  I don't know, I thought it would be sort of  an analogy. You know,  I know that your attitudes about this are very  I know that you know that Twit's content  is an advertisement for Twit. Podcasts  are a little different, though, because  they don't quite, you know, there isn't, it isn't  a blue link to click on. What if, though,  somebody took this entire

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  show, edited out the ads  because they find them offensive  and put it on YouTube. They could do that, by the way.  Our license does not prohibit that.  But that's clearly... But it's  not, it's legal. I wouldn't stop them.  And I wouldn't worry about  it too much either. Now, if  we lost our audience, if our audience  went and started watching that  instead of watching the ad-supported  versions, it might put me out of business.  But what else? I'm not going to change  my license because of that.  So anyway,  I buy into this notion that this is  good publicity, that this drives  traffic, this is good. Even with snippets,  this is good for Spanish publishers.  I think they're learning that lesson.  I find it very ironic that their reaction to  that is, well, we've got to go back to the government  and get an even stronger law forcing Google  to keep doing it. Well, because that's the whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  real game here. In both Germany and in Spain,  and potentially at the EU level,  it's, we're trying to put Google,  our competitor, into a  bad position so they're forced to negotiate  with us. Well, negotiate for what?  There's almost this belief that Google  took what was rightfully  theirs by competing with them.  By saying to advertisers, here's a better  deal. Here's a bigger audience.  We take on the risk.  Here's all kinds of reasons why Google itself  is making tons of money is because Google knows how  to do online and publishers don't.  This seems peculiarly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  European, right? I mean,  I don't think anybody in the US,  no publisher, well, Rupert Murdoch maybe,  but no other publisher in the US is saying, oh,  I don't want to be on Google News. I think  it's well understood the value of being on Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  News, isn't it? Well, it's also, it's the demonization  of Google. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Euro-Tech-Nopanic. So this is almost  anti-American or anti-corporate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's part of it, I think. Anti-corporate  and anti-American both, I believe so, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean,  here, publishers put up  paywalls, right, if they don't want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but even The Wall Street Journal  allows Google to  go through the paywall. Well, Murdoch

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  took down links and he cried uncle.  Yeah, he gave up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, and I think most other publishers,  I mean, if you talk to CNET, The Verge,  PC Magazine, all the people linked here,  they're thrilled to be linked here. This is not a negative.  Just as, you know, TechMeme  is even worse in this regard.  You could make the case if TechMeme runs ads.  TechMeme runs larger than just,  I mean, they run a fairly big  chunk of content  and this is a business for them and nobody's complaining.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We all understand the value.  Because all these publishers understand how the web works.  Right, like, that's the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  Because, I mean, you could shut down TechMeme.  I mean,  this is an ad-supported service.  Right there in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And indeed, you could learn things. I do learn things  on TechMeme where I don't want to go through  G, Apple won  iPod suit.  I'm so tired of that story, that's all I needed to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're right. I didn't click through on that.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was so tired of it.  But the fallacy argument that's made  is, aha!  You would have clicked through had it not been for that summary.  No, the truth is, I never would have clicked through.  I never would have seen that story. If all it said was,  here's an Apple story that's going to change your life,  I wouldn't have clicked on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's, I mean, look,  I guess that's the point is that  probably most people listening to this understand  the value.  I understand how  on a purely theoretical  basis you could be, as a content  creator, peeved. And this is, by the way,  you know,  this is a very common argument.  I've talked to many, many photographers who say,  they're stealing my pictures.  They're stealing my pictures.  And I said, well, you either put them on the  internet and live with that  or not. There's really no  middle ground. But I think  it's worth putting your pictures on the internet because  I look at people like Trey Ratcliffe,  who gives away all his photos  and makes plenty of money as a photographer,  still selling them, selling prints,  doing all the other stuff. His generosity

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  has been the key, on Google+, has been the key  to his growth. It's made him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's made him. Yeah.  So I know that. And I think the conversation  is less common among photographers.  But for a long time, it was a very,  you know, and the record industry,  I mean, you can go on and on. Every industry,  first reaction to this is, they're stealing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  my stuff. Well, the difference,  there's a difference, Lelio, is that,  and we conflate them in  my industry the way we shouldn't. A  photo, a novel, a sitcom,  a song, are  unique performance art  objects. A news  story, the information inside a news  story, and it's the information that's valuable,  is not  copy owned.  Copyright covers only the treatment. It doesn't cover  the actual information. A society does not want  anyone to own information, or even  for that matter own ideas.  It's only treatment you can own in  that sense. And we conflate  that with entertainment industries and think we should  be treated the same as Sopranos.  We write a news story, and we should.  So I've got a question for both of you.  So Google is  indeed, and I've learned this,  trying to  figure out how to  help  cooperative news publishers,  especially in Europe.  I think they shouldn't just do it in Europe. I think they shouldn't  just do old publishers in old Europe.  That's another question.  They're also looking at ways they can help  news in general, which I think is the right thing to do. And I'm trying  to write a post now, a long post,  about what Google could do,  or to put it my way, what could  Google do for  news?  What would you guys, if Google  comes and says, all right, forget all this stupid  fighting about this stupid stuff. We actually  do care about an informed society. We do care  about news. We do want to  help. We do have power and smarts.  Let's work with the people  who are good and do that. What would you put on that list?  What could Google do for news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm kind of an outlier on this  because I don't think Google should be in the content

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  business. I'm not saying this should be the  content business. How could they help those who

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  are? Well, they do  it with search. And I guess  you could say Google News is a  special example of search.  It's kind of topic-based  search. And you're not making the search. You're saying,  what are the topics that Google's telling you? I don't  think that that's really... I don't have a problem with  that. I would hate to see Google  say, in the public interest,  we believe news should be... I don't want them  to get in that business.  I, and I know I'm an outlier,  especially with you guys, but I don't believe Google  should be in the content business at all. I don't think they should

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  own YouTube. No, I agree with that. They can't  be. It's a child's company. But they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, YouTube is clearly  content business.  So, I would like Google  to stick with search and be a great  search engine. I understand they feel like they need  to plan for the future. Search won't always be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the dominant. Google's a platform, Leo.  Like WordPress is a platform. Like, like, Blogger is  a platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think  there's a conflict of, an inherent conflict of interest  if you're a search engine  and you produce content that may be  the result of that search. But they're not producing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that content. They're the platform of people who do produce

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that content. I see. So you're saying they're not...  But now they are benefiting.  It's like saying NBC doesn't produce the shows  on NBC. Well, that's technically true, but  that's a difference  without a distinction. They're still running the ads  and making the money off of those shows  and paying them to be produced.  Google  has an even better model.  We won't even pay you. Just put your stuff  here and we'll give you a couple of bucks.  If you know... Well, versus

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  search, you don't get... Well, the publishers in Europe would say  on search or Google News, we don't get anything from being  listed. At least on YouTube,  we have the chance to make some money. Right.  Gina, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, so I think that Google's...  Google  has a vested interest in making meaning out  of information, right, in order to serve  its users. And  so...  I mean, it's... You know, the knowledge  graph and knowing the difference between  Java the coffee and Java the computer  language, and that's a dumb example,  but figuring out what things  are and what people mean and what  people want when they search for things,  all those facts, all  the intelligence that Google gathers  and figures out is based on  material that's out on the web.  So, I mean, you know, including  news stories, right? So it's in Google's best  interest. Like the better the content that's out there, the better  the product is for Google, the better, you know, the world  is in there accomplishing their mission, right?  Making the world's information accessible to  everyone. I think  that the only thing that Google can do is  continue to be a platform and build  the tools that empower humans  to put the best quality  information out there.  But it has... I mean, in a way, it really does have to  be a partnership, right? Like,  there has to be a way to make this  a viable business,  where reporters go out and, you know,  and shake down facts and do interviews  and make calls and break  the stories and write  meaningful  content that Google can then  serve its users with, right? So like, all  that Google can do is continue  to create better tools to help humans  vet and  fact check and help Google  create meaning, help us all create meaning  for one another. I think Google's suffering

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  from severe mission creep.  If they're...  If that's their goal, then they're  going way beyond that goal.  That mission has changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me make very clear here.  They're not thinking about this stuff  as a business. They're thinking about  this stuff as trying to make nice with at least people  who are willing to be nice with them and try to help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why does Google do Google  News? Actually, that's a very interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  question. Well, because I think it was  Christopher Rott, who said after  9-11,  I can't get a good sense of  an uber view  of news and what's going on and I want a  compilation. And so he just built it.  It's a classic engineer's way  to look at the world. He had a problem and he solved it.  That simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's how Google has  creeped into other areas  is they really do encourage  their team to try

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  stuff. You make creep sound like it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  bad thing. Here's why it's a  bad thing because if you're a search engine, you  have a lot of power. Who says they're limited to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  be a search engine? That's the point.  Well, if they want to be in the search engine business,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which they still do,  they want to be in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  making information accessible  business. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the problem  is, and I don't know if they're doing this or not,  but I don't think we can know it, since they  have things like platforms like Blogger  and they have content like  YouTube and they could  easily prioritize  their internal content  in the search results. I feel  that's a conflict of interest. Now,  I think you've said that, and others have  said, well, it's their company. Why can't  they promote their own internal stuff  in the search results? Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do say that. An example that the  European publishers gave is they made a video  about, uh-oh,  go to Google, search for shoes. What do you see?  You see ads on the top for Google's  shoe advertisers. What do you see below that?  You see everything else impossible  in the world of shoes. Yeah, I mean, I don't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a problem with that. That's how  they pay for shoes.  If I go to BILT, which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  one of the publishers that's complaining,  and there's a whole shoe section up there,  what do I get? I get nothing  but BILT. There's no obligation on  BILT, the largest paper in all of Europe,  to link to their competitors or link to other  advertisers or link to those who don't advertise to them.  Zero. Nada.  Google  does link to the whole world, and it pays  for that by indeed  linking to  advertising. And the only issue for me is, is  it clearly labeled? And I believe  it is. And in the now  pulled back  agreement, antitrust agreement, with the EU  or the EC,  Google was going to label  things they had an interest in even more. They were going  to guarantee links for outside, and they  were going to make sure that guaranteed people could buy ads  in this position, making them more money.  And there was a settlement along  that line which Google was ceding to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I don't mean to imply that Google is  using their power  in search to  favor their own content,  because in fact, it's pretty obviously they're  not. If you search for Cuba videos,  I get a C-SPAN video,  I get a history.com video,  there's YouTube, a couple of them, but then there's  Vimeo, TripFilms,  cubavideos.com.  In this whole thing, there are only two  YouTube search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't look for maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pretty clearly,  they are not doing  the thing we're afraid of.  There's a Google Map  right at the top of Google Map, of Cuba Maps,  but then there were old Atlas and  University of Texas and National Geographic.  So no, I think it's pretty  clear that they're making an  effort to include other people's content.  I just worry. I feel like  it is a conflict of interest, but I mean,  I'm not accusing them of  taking advantage of it yet,  but I do feel like it's a conflict of interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This idea that they're building  the tools. I mean, you know, listen, if I was a map maker  looking at those search  results right there,  I mean, you know. Oh, no, we get

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  great benefits. We get great benefits  from Google. Don't get me wrong. That's not  the argument.  That's not the argument at all. The argument is merely  that, and this is  this is the essence of monopoly.  If a company uses  its, this is  what, this is why there's antitrust laws.  The company uses its monopoly  in one sector to  take over other sectors, to  succeed in other sectors. But that behavior has to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  demonstrated and proven. But if they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  don't, I mean, you just, the fact that they could do  it isn't enough, I agree. Is not sufficient.  Absolutely not. Right.  But there, but, but on the other hand,  I do see Google  getting into all these other related fields.  So you wonder, well,  what are they up to? Maybe they just want to,  they're hedging their bets.  No, it's pretty clear they're not,  although it's hard to, it's hard to prove  they're not.  Because, you know, they say, well, we just put the results that are most  popular there. We don't pay particular  attention to our stuff. But they could be,  and it would be hard to prove whether that was happening or  not. Nobody knows how the algorithm works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But again,  I think you have to agree that  there's some level of them linking to their own properties  that's perfectly legitimate. Right, because they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a private company. Time magazine,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well, I'll put it the other way. People magazine promotes  Time magazine. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So then it would be up to me,  and this is why monopoly is the  important thing. Then it would be up to me  as a user to go to some other search engine  because golly, Google's stuff, they're just promoting  their own content. And I don't want that. I want  a objective search result.  The problem is, because they're  a monopoly, where are you going to go?  Being?  So that's the issue. That's why  there's antitrust rules. Because  once a company becomes a monopoly,  then things that are completely okay to do  if you only have a small percentage  of the market are much more

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  problematic. That's why you watch  them carefully, and that's fine.  But you do not, but if they,  just having a monopoly,  becoming so huge because you were good,  it's not illegal to be a monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not illegal. Now, I understand  that in Europe they are a considerably  more dominant monopoly.  Here it's 70% of search results.  There it's 90%. Well, maybe  they're more concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it also  says that the media coverage  and government actions there are out of  sync with the populace who obviously like  Google. They want Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but okay, okay, I'll say one more thing,  and then we'll drop it.  Just because people like the benefits  of a dictatorship doesn't mean it's a good  thing. That's not the only  measurement of whether  something should be allowed.  Hey, I love our overlords at Google.  They give me great value,  great benefit, but that isn't the only  criterion for judging whether they have  some trigger

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for action against. I agree, and there is no,  at this point, there's no evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no legal behavior. There's none of that.  I agree. At this point there is no evidence of illegal  behavior, as far as I could tell. Some of us

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  certainly have. The only evidence is it's a big  American company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. It is really  important, though, and something the chat room  says, yeah, this isn't just any old  monopoly. This is free  speech. This is information.  This is, the  potential for misuse is  vast. So I don't think Google  should. Well, but the misuse of power,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, was the Spanish  government passing a law  putting the tax on links. That was a far,  far greater misuse of power  affecting speech. No, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we do have competition.  There are other search engines.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it looks like  I'm just seeing from  the New York Times editor, Lydia Polgrain,  that Sony is pulling the interview.  Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  theaters have all day  today because the hackers have  threatened a 9-11  style action against theaters that run the  movie. But this is  a real mystery to me because  the GOP, the  people who are doing these hacking, and it's not the grand  old party. It's the guardians  of something, guardians of  poo poo.  The hackers who did this don't look  governmental. And the  North Korean government said, hey, we  didn't do this, but it is a righteous action.  And yet,  they're pursuing exactly what some  say were the goals of the,  that would have been the goals of a North Korean hack,  which is to get the interview, a  movie that's unflattering. In fact,  Kim Jong-il,  Kim Jong-un gets killed  in this movie. Un.  Gets killed in this movie.  I could see why the North Koreans would be unhappy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about that. Yeah, well, but that's also  free speech.  They don't have free speech in North Korea,  dude.  But they can't come in and change. But what they've  done is they've created the lowest common denominator  of free speech around the world because we're now living  under North Korea's rules. Yeah. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  many theaters, in fact, most of the big theaters  have said, hey, you know what? We're not going to  run this. It's too dangerous. We don't  want, I mean, I understand that. If you're a theater  chain and these guys are saying  we're going to create  havoc in the theater if you run this movie,  first of all,  it ain't going to be a big money making  movie anyway, I don't think. So they just  said, well, in that case, you know, we've still

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  got The Hobbit.  Now it might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now people are going to want to see it. Yeah, it's one  of those experiences where all  of the hubbub about it is going  to attract people to it. The

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  real truth is this hack is a mess.  It could very well put Sony out of  business. It's certainly going to put them out of the movie business. I think  there's no doubt about that. There's now a class action

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  lawsuit. Why is it that bad?  What's the actual business harm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that was put forward? Nobody wants to do anything  with Sony.  Nobody wants to make a deal with Sony  because of the risk that it will be revealed.  Nobody wants to talk to Sony.  No writer,  no producer, no director, no movie  star. Nobody wants to work for Sony.  That's enough  right there, not to mention the class action lawsuit  from Sony employees.  I think this is a death

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  blow to Sony. What difference would  encrypted email have made?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What difference would encrypted email make? This is a very big conversation  which we've had a couple of weeks running on  security now.  Unfortunately,  of course it's possible to  fully secure it.  But it would be very difficult  for Sony to do the kind of business  it did in a fully secured environment.  You can encrypt,  you can silo, you can need to  know. For instance, we have  here, there's a  program called App Locker that you  can run on Windows machines that white list apps  to say, employee,  you can't do anything that hasn't been  approved by the IT department.  Those things are all very good for security,  but they're kind of bad for business.  Sony made a conscious decision,  perhaps wrongly,  that it was more important that information  flow freely  for the various divisions than  that they fully secure it.  What I think they underestimated was  the damage  that could be done to the business should this  particular thing happen.  In any event,  this is  just the beginning.  This is really a mess.  It's very bad for Sony,  I think. By the way, Sony  itself, the company, is in deep financial  straits anyway.  It's not like this is  a robust company that can fight back.  This whole thing  is a mess.  By the way,  it's not at all clear  if this was North Korea,  if this was a disgruntled employee.  There's evidence on both sides.  You might see reports  in the mainstream media that imply that we know more  than we do. It's very hard to know  who did stuff like this. In fact, the only time  hackers really get caught, almost always,  is because they boast about it. They go out  in public and say, yeah, I did that.  If a hacker is a smart guy  or works for a government and keeps  his head down, it's pretty hard.  If he's any good, it's pretty hard.  We don't even know how good the hack  is because there's a complete  news blockade  on any information. The FBI is not talking,  Sony is not talking. We don't know how  they got in. We know more about the target  attack, for instance,  than we do about the Sony attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we know more about the Google  attack. That was traced  to the Chinese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Traced to  a hacker attack is very difficult.  Unless somebody takes  responsibility for it, it's very hard to  know. In any event, one of the things Steve Gibson  said is that  essentially,  if  whoever did this  and had the skills to do this, attacked  almost any company in the United States, they would have  the same success. One of the reasons  I feel that that's true is  the story that came out last week that  the Sands Casino was hacked by  the Iranian government.  The Iranians were very unhappy  with its owner, Sheldon Adelson.  Adelson is an outspoken supporter  of Israel, has been  very politically active, contributed huge amounts  of money to the New England campaign in the last  election cycle,  and has really won the enmity  of Iran.  Looks like we lost Jeff.  I'll just finish the story.  So his  casino was attacked,  and this is the back-end operation,  the thing that runs the slots, the  thing that runs security cameras.  The thing that you would  I mean, look, Sony may not have  known diddly about security.  There's a lot of evidence that they never did.  But you've got to think,  an organization  like the Sands Casino,  big in Macau,  big in Vegas, had  the top security, because  that's guarding more than a bank.  That's guarding everything.  And it is an attack  target. I mean, everybody's hammering  at them all the time, and they got  attacked.  I guess the point is,  even in a situation where you can presume  that the security was top flight, top  notch, they got in.  And brought them down.  It cost them millions, tens of millions of dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So in pre-show, Leo, you were  saying that you made an editorial  decision not to discuss it.  Let's take a break, and we're going to talk about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff and I are going to get into it on this one, I have a feeling.  And by the way, Steve agrees with you,  Jeff. He thinks there's good reason that this  information, the treasure trove of information,  including movie star salaries,  private emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I don't agree with that. I don't agree with that. I think there's  a newsworthy test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, we'll talk about it in a second. Because otherwise, if you say that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  theft makes the information invalid,  then you've erased  Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, and I don't want to erase Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden,  or the Pentagon Papers.  There's plenty of cases where  illegally obtained material has,  because of the public wheel,  the public right and need  to know, but the public has  no need to know how much Seth Rogen made  to do the interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. Oh, well then.  Oh boy, it's really interesting though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's such bad gossip. It's like looking at  the naked pictures of J-Log.  Don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I looked at those too.  So I got no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  standing on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did so well, and then I  stumbled upon them accidentally, and I felt  awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hard to turn away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I clicked on a hashtag that I hadn't recognized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem with this, isn't it?  Yeah.  So we editorially, I guess we're in this,  so I won't do the Harry's ad quite yet.  I edit unilaterally,  but I do own the company so I can make that decision.  You said, I don't want it, we're not going to  talk about the contents. Clearly, this  hack is a big story for us. It's a technology story.  It's huge. But I  don't think there's any reason why we should talk about  the content. Initially, I did a little bit like  one factoid.  Well, the story on the rundown is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but the entertainment  industry strategy  against  or in favor of Sopa Pippa against  Shorcan Valley.  Sony's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  reacting in ways that I think are illegal,  or at least borderline illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's the contents, that's part of the contents  of these documents, that's newsworthy  to this show. So is that something  that you wouldn't talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, we reported on that. I just wouldn't say.  In fact, Steve gave a list of the  kinds of information that  was leaked out. I think that's fine.  It's the information, it's fine  for me to say, naked pictures  of Jennifer Lawrence were stolen.  It's not fine for me to show them.  Now, the news media  didn't show them because there's limits on what  you can do on TV. They would have loved  to. Are you kidding?  So in this case,  there's no nudity. So of course,  and I think it's very self-serving of most  of them to say, oh no, there's a public need to know on this.  So let's talk about what the need to know is.  There's lots of other news, including  the Google change log. This is going to be like an  eight hour show though, if I don't do a commercial.  Do you know  there is a relationship between the commercials  and the length of the show?  The shortest show we can  do is three minutes.  All right. So this is Harry's.  I love Harry's. You love Harry's too,  I hear, Jeff. I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  love Harry's. Harry's is so good.  I'm not being paid to say this, the Leo does pay me  a little bit. But I'm not paying you to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can say anything you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I use Harry's now that frankly,  my baby-like skin,  I use the Harry's, first time I've done  this, I use the Harry's razor with no lotion,  no nothing, just razor. What? Well, you're a mad  man. Out of,  after I get out of the shower, I just  cut the neck. And that is testament to Harry's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many blades can you do  that with?  So Harry's bought the factory, and that's  what I love. I think that's the real, that's kind  of the real story here. Harry's was started  by a couple of guys who  really felt like the, the, the  old adage, you know, you give away the razor and  you make it up on the blades, isn't very  nice to consumers.  They felt like you deserve  a good shave at a fair  price.  Razor blades from Gillette, four dollars  each. Harry's  half that. But are they  worse? No, they're better because  Harry's actually  bought their own German factory.  They make their own blades  from scratch, taking  high grade steel, grinding it  to sending it right to your door.  There's no middle man.  You are essentially buying the blades from  the factory. And these are  beautifully made blades. In fact,  if you go to Harry's, h-a-r-r-y-s dot com,  you can see the whole story.  They found out that there are only  two factories in the world, both of  them in Germany, that can make high quality  blades, and so they  bought one of them. And  the factory continues to make things, other  kinds of things, but it produces millions  of precision razor blades every  year. And that means you're  going to get great blades. In fact, they're doing  research to make them even better, which  I love. And  you're going to get them at a very fair  price, the actual cost. And they ship  them to your door. Now the best way to  start Harry's is with a kit, and we've got some great  Harry's kits. That's what we sent out to all of our  hosts. This is the Harry's Winston  kit, which is...  How much is the Winston? The Winston is, I think,  20 bucks? It's on the site for 25.  25 dollars. But I'm going to give you five bucks off.  So 20 bucks. What do you get?  You get the handle. Now this is  the less expensive. They have a nice metal  engraved handle. You can get your initials  on it. That's what I have at home.  But this is the... Steve prefers this  because it has a flat back, so you can really tell  the orientation just by touch.  I guess Steve shaves in the dark.  You get this. You get three  blades, three of these great Harry's blades.  They're really remarkable.  You get the Harry's shave cream, and they have  a cream or a gel. I like the cream.  This is the foaming shave gel. Just smells  really good. By the way, they now have, if you  like that scent, their aftershave lotion,  too, to soothe your face after you shave.  And don't overlook the travel  protector.  My first couple of Harry's kits,  I just threw it out. I thought, oh, that's not  important. It's very important. This is how  you travel with your Harry's razor  and blade so that you don't get  cut. They put it in your Dopp kit there.  It dries out. It's got a little ventilation.  This is like the best thing ever.  Somebody in the chat room said, I bought  two more kits so I get a couple more travel adapters.  We're going to save you five dollars off your  first order. That means 20 dollars  for the kit. Three blades, the handle,  the travel protector, the shave  cream. The Winston set is awesome.  Take a look at that, too.  See, that's 25. What's the Truman?  Truman's like less.  Yeah, I think it is less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Truman's 15. So you take five bucks off,  that's 10. 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got the Truman. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Truman's great. Ten dollars.  That's like two blades  from Gillette. You get all of this.  Just do me a favor. Just try that.  You know, ten bucks. What are you going to lose?  And if you decide you like it, you can get  the subscription plan and get your blades  delivered to the door. I am up to my  third or fourth Harry's handle. I like having  Harry's everywhere I go.  Harry's, H-A-R-R-Y-S, the best  shave you will ever have.  Take five dollars off. Use the offer code  TWIG at purchase.  So you don't disagree. We don't disagree.  What information?  Now see, Steve Gibson said, OK, here  is the public's right to know on this  leaked information.  If we don't  show the pain,  we don't talk about all the things  the hackers learned in detail,  then no one's going to learn this lesson  and other companies are going to fall in the same way.  Well, I think they're going to learn.  I think they learned their lesson.  If you  still think it's OK to get hacked,  I don't think you're paying attention. And it doesn't matter  what we report.  But you agree, there's no reason James  Franco's salary is...  There's no public interest in knowing that.  There's gossipy interest.  Well, yeah, there's public...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, there's interest by gossip sites.  Yeah, but that isn't...  No, that isn't necessarily...  Aaron Sorkin said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you're helping the Sony hackers  if you print that stuff.  And you are.  Really? You're helping them achieve their aims.  Well, you're feeding the trolls.  You're feeding the trolls.  Trolls, by the way,  won in this case because the interview has now been cancelled.  It has not been cancelled.  If that was actually their goal. See, I don't know  if that was actually their goal.  Aaron Sorkin has a little bit of a dog in this hunt  because he, of course, wrote the Jobs movie.  And  our good friend, and I love her,  Christina Warren, Film Girl, wrote a very long piece for Mashable  in which she,  using emails she found in these  hacked trove of data,  told the whole story of the Jobs movie  that Aaron Sorkin wrote.  The ins and outs, the ups and downs, and why Sony  eventually passed on it.  Which is of great interest, especially to our audience.  It was interest in the movie.  Yeah, but I don't...  I don't think...  We didn't report this data, and I don't think I ever  will report this data. I don't want to support  the hack. I think it's stolen material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But, you know, Leo,  I do get torn somewhat. I'm a journalist, and so  I love a scoop, but it's not just a scoop.  We go back to the right to be forgotten  issue. Is that my fear  is that if... What if you said...  What if somebody tried to pass a law to say that if you  did reveal this information, that itself is a crime?  We don't believe in that.  Otherwise, every leak  and every whistleblower  leak to a journalist would then  become illegal by the precedent.  So I think we have to be careful about  how we regulate this.  We're not to regulate it, but it goes back to a question  of us negotiating new norms.  It's wrong to...  You know, I said this on the show some months ago.  I saw the beginnings of a new norm,  and people saying on their own, it's wrong  to share and wrong to look at the behaving  videos. It's wrong to share and wrong to look at  Jennifer Lawrence  photos. And now I'm hearing  people say, with some debate,  it's wrong to share and wrong to look at  the Sony leak material.  Unless there is public  interest. And so we're trying to negotiate  a new norm of behavior around this.  Now there is some information that might have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  public interest, for instance, the way Sony  looked the other way in cases of sexual  harassment and so forth. And those

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  things have been... Or the campaign about  Silva Pippa, I think,  is legitimate

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  public interest. They used  the code word Goliath  to describe Google.  They saw Google as the enemy, much as the  Spanish publishers do.  Because Google was... Apparently,  you could search Google for BitTorrent  links. And so they  did a lot of stuff to try to shut down  Google.  So you're right. That is newsworthy.  I don't think that's... I think  that there's a right to know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay. So we actually  all do agree, then. Yes.  And the difference between this and the Snowden  leak is that Snowden leaked to a trusted journalist  who would... And just released bits  and pieces of the things that... I mean,  Snowden redacted or held back a lot  of stuff, right? It makes you really appreciate what he did,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what he did, no, what he did was...  He gave it to the journalist and said, it is your job  to do that. Assange,  off and on, has done that.  But he said that  there is a role of redaction  and responsibility and expected  that's the role of journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just... I feel like  this is kind of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  link-baity world we live in now  where anything  goes as long as you get clicks.  And there's a lot of  people practicing as journalists  who aren't really thinking about  the larger picture.  Amen. And that's  the business model. The business model

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is an old mass media business  model, reaching frequency,  unique users and page views, clicks  for the sake of clicks, and then  unless we have metrics and business models  built around quality, we are doomed  to go down to the sewer. I couldn't agree  more. But I do see hope  for new business models. And that's part of  what I think I want Google to invent.  Right? If you want to help news Google,  invent new business  models, because, hell, you've invented them  before, that encourage  quality rather than just clicks.  Now, this was a big test for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nick Denton, by the way, Gina.  Ha-ha-ha-ha.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha-ha-ha-ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it kind of went both ways, because on the one hand,  they did do some actual, Gawker  had some actual, like, reporting.  Some good stuff. But they  also took  this as an opportunity

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to talk a lot of gossip.  A lot of  gossip. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, I don't, I mean, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  depends what your definition of newsworthy is,  right? I mean, this is,  this is what it is. They were doing great stuff on Ferguson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were really starting to do some really  good reporting.  And then they have a story on how much pizza  Jennifer Lawrence ordered  when she was hanging out with her new bow.  And so,  it's like, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  There isn't, I didn't see that one.  There isn't harm in that.  I actually do think that there's harm in  people looking at her photo, at her photos.  But the pizza thing,  I mean, I, you know, I don't know.  So much of this is depends on the publication.  Right.  About the pizza thing? Well, I don't know.  No, the pizza doesn't come,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the pizza comes from a source, not from  the leaked material itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I apologize, Nick.  That was a legit  gossip story.  He says, tomorrow's news is today's  gossip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At the bottom of Google, I just put up the Sony  statement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. I, you know, I still  don't know if it's, I mean, it feels  like the hackers have take, taken  this opportunity to look like they're  South, North Korea. But I  still don't feel like they are. Here's the  Sony statement.  Sony says, we respect  and understand our partner's decision.  Oh, here it is. In light of the decision by the  majority of our exhibitors not to show the film  the interview, we have decided not to move forward  with the planned December 25th  theatrical release.  We respect and understand our partner's decision and, of  course, completely share their paramount  interest in the safety of employees and theater  goers.  Sony Pictures has been the victim of an unprecedented  criminal assault against our employees,  our customers, and our business.  Those who attacked us stole  our intellectual property, private  emails, sensitive and proprietary  material, and sought to destroy our  spirit and our morale,  all apparently to thwart the release  of a movie they did not like.  We are deeply saddened at this brazen  effort to suppress the distribution of a movie  and in the process do damage to our company,  our employees, and the American public.  We stand by our filmmakers and the right to free  expression and are extremely disappointed by this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  outcome. So I just tweeted  Sony, if you put this up online, I  pledge right now I will pay to watch it  no matter how bad it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just to make a point. Yeah,  it feels like this is an opportunity for them to distribute  this movie  digitally, right? And everyone  will want to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think really this is the North Korean  government that did  this hack as the guardians  of peace?  It doesn't feel like  it. It feels like  this is some 18-year-old  slob sitting in his apartment in  Bucharest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With terabytes and terabytes of data?  Oh, sure. Nowadays

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's no big deal. Yeah. Let me ask

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you a bigger question, Leo. Is any  business safe? You said people don't want to do business with Sony.  Well, why would they want to do business with any company?  Any company is vulnerable. Well, I suspect  one of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  side effects of this will be, and this was  we were talking about this with Steve, will be to move us back to  a pre-internet era where most  of the kinds of  conversations that you want to keep secure  will be done either on  the phone or in person.  And you're not going to... Oh, God, I got to get a  fax machine. Yeah, you're not going to commit  it to email.  By the way,  I'm now being told that I need to apologize  to Romania. I'm sorry,  Romania.  I thought you said Bulgaria. I said Bucharest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just a city  with a funny name, folks. It's not...  And Gardner,  are you in Romania  or you just decided to be a policeman to the world?  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, what could  Sony done differently? They could have used  they could have not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They could have encrypted the email,  which means that it's hard to  forward, right? And of course,  the way it works in Hollywood, as you can even  see, if you look at these emails, there's a lot  of... It's stuff is circulated,  larger groups and stuff.  That's not going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold on right there, Leo.  I never thought of that. It's obvious. And I think you just  presumed it, but some of them like me.  If you encrypt email, it's hard to forward.  It's one to one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Oh, wow.  So there's certainly things you  can do, but in every case, and this is what Steve's  always talking about, there's a trade-off between security  and convenience. And Sony decided,  I think consciously, it's more important  that we be able to work, do our business  than it is that we secure our stuff.  After all, how bad could it be?  And unfortunately, we now know how bad  it could be.  But honestly,  if you think about it, the reason  this movie is being canceled has nothing  to do with the hack.  The reason this movie is being canceled  is because somebody, maybe even somebody  different, has threatened the movie theaters  that if they release it,  there will be a 9-11 style incident.  It's like a bomb threat.  It has nothing to do with the hack.  It might not even be  the same people.  No, it doesn't. Anybody could have  done this. That actually could be the  North Koreans going, hey, here's our chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, but now  let's pull it further. So now let's say Sony says,  okay, we'll put it online.  What does Apple say? We're going to sell it  on iTunes. Apple's going to say, yeah,  no thanks. What's Amazon going to say?  Nobody's going to want it.  No thanks.  It's just a movie.  What's the one way you can distribute this?  BitTorrent.  BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way,  one of the things the GOP, the hackers  did is they put BitTorrent,  they turned the Sony servers into BitTorrent  servers for the movies.  You're not the only one arguing for this, by the way.  This is...  No. Hey, so an interesting  associated story with Reddit.  Sony sent a DMCA  to Reddit. Reddit was  publishing in one of its subreddits or  several of its subreddits  contents from the email trove.  Sony sent a DMCA  takedown request and Reddit agreed  and they took it down.  Reddit had to agree. They didn't have any  choice, right? Yeah.  And now they're starting to ban users  who are sharing Sony hack documents.  Reddit is mainstream media.  Let's not forget they're...  they were bought by Conde Nast.  I guess Conde spun them off, but there's still some

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  association, right? But creep shots  of teenage girls, those are totally... Those?  No problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So discussion and news stories regarding the hack  will still be allowed throughout the site.  But Sony has been sending notices  warning of legal action against the posting  of information discovered by the hacked  documents. So in theory,  they could send us one if we had started  talking about the contents as well. That's not why I didn't.  And I actually  don't celebrate these heavy-handed  techniques from Sony.  I  sympathize, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a weird news day.  It is a weird...  Fark declares  a truce.  North Korea, by some accounts,  gets a movie killed.  It is wild, isn't it?  You know what? I want to cheer everybody up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's do the Google change log right after  this word about my shoes.  You want to do that? Yeah.  So Jeff, we haven't sent you any  Jack Irwins yet.  But you're a professor. You don't walk into  class wearing sandals  with socks, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have weird feet. Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you mean, weird?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You really want to know? No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no. We're good. We're good.  That's TMI.  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was a little bit right, Jada?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Finally. We can know  that you're colon, but your feet? No.  So shoes, they  say, make the man. And I have to say, there  are times when having a nice pair of shoes  on your feet is going to help you  on a date at that  Christmas party when you're talking to the boss for a raise,  when you're talking to venture capitalists  for funding. You don't want to be wearing  the Tenny Runners. You want to be wearing  some nice shoes. Yes, these are comfortable.  Don't feel like you're going to be hobbling  around. These are beautiful.  You know what? The real problem is  you're going to wear these and you're never going to want to wear  anything else. These are Jack Irwins. Now, normally shoes  like these, handmade  in Spain, of the finest  leathers from the traditional  leather craftsmen in France  and Italy,  hand sewn uppers,  hand sewn lowers, leather soles.  Normally shoes like these would cost you  a pretty penny. You get them  about a third of the cost at  JackIrwin.com because they sell direct to you.  Although, you New Yorkers, you,  they have a showroom in New York. So  you might want to stop by.  These are beautiful shoes. You just go to  JackIrwin, J-A-C-K-E-R-W-I-N  dot com slash twit.  And you can see our pics.  I have been loving these Jack Irwin  shoes. They're, you know,  I want to warn you because people are going to say, oh  it's $200. No, but that is for a shoe  of this quality. I know you've only been running, wearing  Nikes with $140.  So you pay a little more. But these are all  leather. These are beautiful. They last forever.  Every pair of Jack  Irwin shoes comes with a second pair of  insoles made in Portugal and a beautiful  travel bag. You can carry  your Jack Irwin's in your suitcase  without fear of damage.  I love my Jack  Irwin's. If you do order, order  one size smaller than you  do usually. If you're a size 10, order a size  nine because all Jack Irwin's shoes are  made one size larger so that you have  a skosh mo rim.  If you've never had  a great pair of shoes,  you owe it to yourself  to have a great pair of shoes  from Jack Irwin. They have striving moccasins  too. I'm going to get  those for myself for Christmas.  JackIrwin.com  slash twit. The best  shoes you've ever worn.  By the way,  if you don't like them, shipping's free  and it's easy to return them.  To pay  the shipping. JackIrwin.com  slash twit.  Don't buy cheap. It's too expensive  said grandpa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right? They sure are spiffy.  They're spiffy looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina.  They are spiffy looking.  Gina. These are great shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for  the Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Google changelog.  Gina Trepene has the latest

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  New feature on your Chromecast.  Your friends can come over and  cast your Chromecast without connecting to  your Wi-Fi first.  It's called guest mode.  Get off my Chromecast.  The  headline is that guest mode lets anyone  commandeer your TV. It's not quite  as aggressive as all that.  This is opt in of course.  If you want to enable guest mode on your  Chromecast, you can open up the Chromecast app  and you tap devices and  you select your Chromecast and you turn on guest mode.  And then anybody can walk in  and cast a video.  You have to enable it.  Yeah, exactly.  But nice for the holidays.  Throw some YouTube videos up on  the TV, relatives TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been doing so much Chromecasting lately.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chromecast is great. It's still my main  media thing.  It's how I watch YouTube now.  Me too. I love it.  Let's see. What else we got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to watch the interview on my Chromecast.  It looks like a really, can I just say it looks like a terrible movie.  Oh, it looks awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was trying not to say that because  that's not the point. But it looks  terrible. It looks terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I tell you it is the point in a way because  if this were The Hobbit, I don't think  there would be that rush to not run it.  But anybody...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Neighbors was just awful. I went to see the...  Did you see The Neighbors? No, I hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, that also looked terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The end of the world movie they made? Oh my god, was it bad.  So...  It's like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not the point though. It's not the point.  It's art.  It's art.  Let's see what else we got. Oh, Inbox.  The app that I'm dying to use in my Google apps account.  Google, I know you're listening.  They got  a little new feature in  Assist. So they've got this feature called Assist  which helps you, gives you kind of  contextual information as you enter  reminders into Inbox.  Well, Assist are getting  a new kind of boost, a suggest  as you type based  on what you're entering. So, for example...  I just got that. Just got updated.  Yeah, you just got it. It's really cool.  It's killing me because I really want to use Inbox  on a daily basis.  If you tap compose, you say I'm going to start a reminder.  I start to type the word return  and the Assist  actually start to auto fill items  that I had just ordered from Amazon  and had just been shipped to me.  So it's amazing. It's really, really  smart, personal, contextual information  saying like, oh, I want to return this thing I just  ordered. It works with local  businesses. It works with calling people.  You know, remind me to email Jeff  about lunch next month, which we have to do  Jeff, and it'll fill it in  and put just contact information. You'll know  it's an Assist when there's a little icon  in the suggest as you type drop down.  Jeff, did I cut you off?  Did you have a question? No, I was just making a joke

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that we're going to hear immediately this  wonderful new feature is creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the most  convenient creepy thing you'll ever see.  Hangouts in Gmail got  updated. You can now  set a status message.  So if you  log into Gmail on the desktop and  you turn on Hangouts, you  can click on your name and you can set  your status to whatever you want.  Happy Holidays, I'm available, I'm not walking  the dog, whatever. And I think you can also use  emoticons and stickers as well. I think  I saw that in some of the examples. So people  will see your status in their friends  list. A couple of Google  Drive updates. You  can now share Google Drive files  through Gmail as  attachments and not those  share links where  you use the wrong Gmail address  for the person and they say I don't have access  and can you give me access? It's all complete pain.  You can now share  Google Drive files and it just attaches it to the Gmail  and sends the whole file through email.  When you select the insert as attachment option  from Google Drive. So that's handy.  Yay!  Because I love Google Drive and I love sharing  but I also have a couple of Google accounts  and people always share to me with  using the wrong one.  Next up, the Google app on Android  has voice search for Google Drive.  So you can say, okay Google, search  for a certain file name on Drive  and you'll get the file without  opening the app or typing keywords.  Google Fit  got an update  that brings a hundred new activities  to the app. So Google  Fit can automatically detect if you're  walking or biking. Now  you can manually enter  activities like  skiing, skating,  biathlon, volleyball, circuit training,  boxing, cricket, dancing.  So when you go to the gym  you can hop right into Google Fit  and have that be your kind of one stop shop of all your  activities. Of course manual entry  is not the most convenient thing in the world  but nice if you want to use Google Fit for everything.  And another upgrade  to Google Fit, the Google Fit app  is Android, new Android Wear support.  So Google's still calling  things experimental here but your  smartwatch will measure your step count  when it's not connected to your phone and the watch  will remember and sync it up to your phone  and the Fit history the next time that it does, that it  reconnects. So that's really nice  if you want to go for a run without carrying your  big phablet.  Finally, Google for Android  and iOS got updated with Nest  integration. So you  can now set the temperature of your home through  Google Now. You can say of course  if you have a Nest and you have it set up and you've  opted in, on your mobile device you  can open the Google app or tap the mic and say  OK Google, set the temperature to  70 degrees and your Nest  will do that.  If you try that search right now and you don't  have it set up, it will say  it'll give you a prompt that says this works with Nest  and you can tap through and actually configure your Nest  to work with that. So you know  it obviously doesn't work unless your  Nest is, unless you opted in and your Nest  is set up. And  that's it, that's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that is the Google  Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well a few updates as well  while we were away at the change log.  One is that  Deadline reports that  a Steve Carell new regency  thriller set in North Korea has  been cancelled.  Newt Gingrich  tweets  quote, no one should kid themselves. With the  Sony collapse, America has  lost its first cyber war. This is a  very, very dangerous precedent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder if this is  cyber warfare. I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it kind of doesn't  matter because the weapons  of cyber warfare aren't necessarily  in the hands of government. And  so anybody can... Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a very good point.  So it doesn't really matter if this is North Korea or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In this future era, the power  of government diminishes immensely  because whether you're  anonymous or Occupy or  GOP or  whoever, you have tools  at your hand that you don't need to be a government to have anymore.  Wow.  Not saying that anonymous or Occupy  or anybody or people that are doing that or  anything else, I'm just saying that, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't imagine a very ugly future  where this kind of stuff is just going on all the time.  It could have been worse though. They could have attacked the  power grid or something. I mean it's just Sony Pictures.  Let's get this straight.  It's Seth Rogen.  Yeah, it's Seth Rogen. Ryan Bishop

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  at The Verge just put up a piece.  Why Sony Pictures should release the interview online.  Not even North Korea can stop the internet.  It does kind of feel like  at this point the only way we can prove...  We need to invoke the Streisand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm serious. How?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're Apple, are you going to  come along now and say with stores  in every mall, say, okay,  we'll put the movie up on iTunes? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no. BitTorrent. You said it. BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then you don't  make any money on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  At this point I think they should just release it  for download for free. Everybody gets to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. This is how you screw  North Korea. They say, well good.  More people are going to see this now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's the thing I wonder is what's the...  It was an interesting discussion just on Twitter,  Leo, because I said  I wonder who holds the insurance on the movie and what  clauses are being invoked.  And somebody said, well, there's usually a  terrorism exception. Well, that goes to  your point. Is this terrorism in an insurance

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sense? Well, and usually insurance is a  completion bond. The movie was completed.  I don't know  if they have insurance for this.  I wonder. Interesting.  Well, all I can say is that Hacker  in the basement in Bucharest has now moved  to Budapest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Take that!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where our ambassador has said the new  head of government is a schmuck.  No! I'm going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in Budapest in June.  Please don't  cause problems with Budapest.  Well, there's some issues there.  The year in search 2014.  Now this is a happy, bright, upbeat

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  story. Yeah, this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google does this every year, right?  Do they still do zeitgeist? Is that now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  place that? Yeah, I think this was kind of a  part of it. Every year

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they say we reflect on moments that made us laugh,  smile ear to ear,  or stay gripped to our screens  in our annual year  in search, ladies and gentlemen.  In 2014,  we searched trillions of times.  What do these searches  say about us?  We search for hope.  Ah, Malala.  Nobel Prize winner.  Fear.  Science.  More than fiction.  That's fiction, by the way.  The hoverboard. We search for things we love.  Pharrell.  House of Cards.  Game of Thrones. Nicki Minaj.  And for greatness,  Sochi.  We search to make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Here's what gives us hope.  The world knows how

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to fight this disease.  Ferguson. Ebola.  Ebola, yeah.  Search to remember. Joan Rivers.  Maya Angelou.  Robin Williams.  We search to be inspired.  That's really just an ad.  I love this dancing guy.  And there's Benedict Cumberbatch  getting doused with ice water,  and that's what I've been waiting for.  You know, this reminds me a lot of,  and we spent some time talking about it on Twitter,  the YouTube year-ender.  The rewind.  Which really celebrated  all the YouTube stars.  This is really,  this is the things we search for,  there are many viral videos in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the old person version.  Like I recognized everything in this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had no idea who those YouTube stars were.  I actually had to ask a 12-year-old.  Michael knew.  He knew at least half of them.  He said, oh yeah, that's the,  and I only knew Jai Justine  was the only one I knew.  So here are the top global searches of 2014.  Robin Williams, number one.  World Cup, number two.  Ebola, number three.  MH370, the Malaysian Airlines flight.  They still haven't found.  Even Google can't find it.  Even Google can't search for that one.  ALS, the ice bucket challenge.  This year, that was the thing of the year, wasn't it?  Flappy Bird made it to the top 10.  Number six.  Flappy Bird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was this year? I guess it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Conchita Verst,  the winner of the Eurovision Song Contest.  ISIS.  And I hope people weren't searching for beheading videos,  but somehow I feel like they were.  Frozen, the Disney movie,  and finally Sochi.  So that's a pretty good mix of the big,  you know, this is all done programmatically,  but those are the big stories.  Those really are the big stories.  And then they have a nice little  page at Google.com slash 2014  that you can scroll through.  Here, we'll go there.  I like it when they do this.  I really do.  This is fun.  What is La Dethema?  Touchdowns, knockouts, trophies.  Formula One royalty.  And this is very global, right?  Because Formula One, you know,  it's big worldwide, the US less so.  It's the grip of the world.  Jared Leto into Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not sure how Jared Leto made it here, but...

I'm sure you talked about it all about it,  the Cyanogen Mod did a deal  terrible.  An exclusive deal with another company.  Micromax.  And Micromax is now complaining about  1 Plus sales in India and they've halted them.  Terrible.  That sucks.  Nexus 5.  What is going on there? Is Google going to continue  to sell that? Apparently so.  They are a limited number  in stock, but they are  saying we're going to continue to sell it until early 2015.  This is because a lot of people  who want a Nexus phone say, I'm not buying that  giant whale of a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, it's their small phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you try to buy the darn thing on the Play Store,  you can't still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it still  out of stock? What do they say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right now, it's still out of stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which was fueling rumors.  That they weren't going to do it.  That they were just worth stomping altogether.  No, the Nexus 6.  Oh, the 6 you still can't get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, can I just share a little problem?  Just a word of warning about the Nexus 6.  It's very easy to root. Of course, you can easily  unlock the bootloader and root it. I found a one-step  root and unlock.  But remember, Google,  and I am really questioning this decision,  but they decided they wanted to do an Apple  and make it hard for  law enforcement to see what's on your phone.  So they have encrypted this phone.  Remember, if you used Android before, you know that after  the fact you can go into the settings and say,  if you're giving it a pin, you have to give it a pin or password.  I want to encrypt it from then on.  This comes encrypted.  Which caused me a bit of a hassle now.  Because I've rooted it and I have a special recovery.  I've got twerp recovery on here.  And I got 501 this morning.  I was so excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, I got it on the watch too, Jason.  Yeah, I got my notice, but it's not charged up yet.  Me neither. Too low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Damn, that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the one moment  out of every...  all the days in the year where I regret  the fact that I can't just plug any micro USB  into this. It's the only moment.  Otherwise, the wireless charging...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have two Qi chargers in my office that work.  Well, there we go. I might upgrade you.  You can put it on the Qi chargers in there.  That's the nice thing about the Moto 360  is it supports Qi.  Which I love.  The handle is a standard Qi charger.  And you have to position it carefully.  But if you position it just right, you can charge the watch  on any Qi charger. Good news.  However, I was talking about this  and I'm screwed.  Because I rooted it.  And now,  in order to install 501,  twerp is saying, well, what's the password for the encryption?  I don't know.  I didn't give it a password.  No, it's not your Google  account password. It's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was what I was trying to joke before.  Try to imagine what Google's own password is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it is.  Actually, I didn't try my Google account password.  I should try it. I shouldn't say it's not.  Did they use a password  when they encrypted it? They must have, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is some old farted CNN  that found a 1997  acronym dictionary  and thought it'd make a good  clickbait.  This is not true. Don't worry about it.  Not true.  And she debunks it quite nicely.  CNN has no  This is a line from  Steven Grabowski  who is her 24-year-old  cousin but also a  staffer at a New York magazine  called Relics, which is a  music festival, a youth culture magazine.  CNN has no idea what sexting  is but they're pretty sure it has  something to do with acronyms.  Anyway, don't worry  Gina. The kids  are not having sex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, wait, can we do one last story  really quick? Sorry, sorry.  I just thought that this Microsoft knucklehead  blog post, did you do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  on Wednesday? I put that one up  there, yeah. Thank you, Jeff. This

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  thing is just funny. So Microsoft does  a company blog post, which is  clearly about Google, but it's  weird and like  they pulled it, but it's still in Google's  cache, ironically.  And it's just, it's  it's basically saying that Google  Apps is terrible compared to  Office 360. But it's got this long  story about this guy's  knucklehead son. Yeah, if you click on the  cache version link, there's a link  like it. Oh, Lord. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This isn't the first time. Remember  Gmail Man reading your  email? Yeah, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's along those lines.  This post  is gold.  It's kind of gold.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My knucklehead son doesn't want to go to college. No.  Instead, he wants to wander around the country in a  Volkswagen camper van, posting his  adventures on YouTube for legions of  adoring fans, pausing just long enough  to cup his hands under a gushing  spigot of money piped by grateful  advertisers. I tell him he  sounds like Google. And it just goes  from there. It's crazy  and weird and funny.  So anyway, yes.  That was my last. Thank you, Mark

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Penn. And I'm going to give you one  more breaking tweet. Oh, yes.  The situation room.  U.S. investigators  determined North Korea is behind Sony  attack. Oh.  Oh.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then the whole GOP  Guardians of Peace thing was probably  intended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll put it up on the rundown right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's from CNN.  The FBI has not been talking  about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  What are you doing? What's that? You can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  watch CNN unless you prove you get CNN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But in the embedded tweet, it appears.  Well, thank you. It appears

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in the tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On behalf of the North Korean government, the question  now is, what do we do about it?  We expect that there's going to be an announcement tomorrow  from the U.S. government that  will assign attribution  as they describe it,  for responsibility for this hack.  And then the question will be  what the U.S. government's response will be  because obviously  nothing happens in North Korea without  orders from the  leadership of the regime. They control  the Internet there. So there's no way  this attack could have been done by anyone  other than if it was ordered  by the leadership of that country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  So I'd like that's very light on  facts. So,  I would like to know  which department of the  U.S. government announced that  and why they think that. And of course,  none of that was available.  U.S. investigators. Is that the FBI?  I don't know. Yeah, I know. We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alec Ross, who was a  Secretary of State  under Hillary Clinton,  was the social person. Very, very smart guy.  I just put up a link to his piece on  Huffington Post where he talks  about this as  cyber warfare.  Where does it stop?  And he has, it's lighthearted  in some ways. He says that it's only  a matter of time before some hot shot group of engineers  recognizes and stalls a cyber attack.  And instead of calling the authorities,  who can't do anything anyway, the VP of Engineering  orders a counterattack against the aggressor.  If Sony had a better engineering  department, if it were a little more northern  California instead of southern California,  I wonder what would have happened  if they had identified the source of the hack and shot  back with a DDoS attack. Would North Koreans  have considered this an invasion by the United States or Japan  where Sony is actually headquartered? I'm going to call BS

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on the CNN report.  Yep. I don't think,  I would like to see where they got this from.  I would too. I think  there's a lot of, first of all, if North  Korea did it, why would they deny they did it?  Well, oh. Wouldn't they want  to crow about it?  I just got to crow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sane, motivated, sane  activities around Kim Jong-un, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then there's  a Wired magazine,  a Wired online article about  that says North Korea  almost certainly did not attack Sony.  Now, the problem is, I don't know  what investigators  they're saying.  There's so much more we need to know.  And I'd like to see their evidence.  True, that's true. I don't mean to jump to anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Breaking news,  the Situation Room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  US investigators is not sufficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this will  make your head explode, just like Kim Jong-un's.  Time magazine has a piece.  Three reasons people think North Korea  hacked Sony. Main head, sub head.  And four reasons it might have been somebody else.  Which is to say, we don't know  we don't know anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it wasn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sony, North Korea, but I think  that the Guardians of Peace, once they  sniffed that possibility,  decided to play along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're  a wise voice of sanity here.  I'd just like to see the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd like to see more.  We know so little because they haven't revealed much.  Gina,  your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's our tip of the week.  So the Hangouts dialer  app is now a full-fledged  system dialer. That's on  Android. That means  that you can switch over to using Hangouts  for your phone calls for everything.  You can say,  when you tap on a phone  number in your email or calendar  or whatever, you'll get prompted  which dialer you want to use. And now  Hangouts dialer was not before a full-fledged  system dialer that you could set to.  But now it is. You can say, always use your  Hangouts dialer and you can always use Hangouts  for your phone.  So moving farther and farther away from  depending upon carriers for your  number and your calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, would you trust Hangouts  as your always choice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do already. I mean, I use Google  Voice and I switch over to Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. I don't do it on my phone.  I do it on my desktop. That's how I make  phone calls at home. I put it on my phone.  I want to hear my headset and it just sounds better.  It's more relaxed. But my question,  Google Voice was not VoIP.  This is VoIP.  This does not use your  minutes. It uses  data only. Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  Yes. When you make call to Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not the Google Voice system.  This is a different system that is data only.  It's VoIP.  Wow. That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it works great in my basement  where I don't get bars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only issue for me is  there's a little bit of lag.  More lag than there would be in a cell call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  For me, it's like kind of lesser to evils  though. I mean, I feel like cell calls can be so  bad. They can be bad too.  I mean, they can be bad too. So it's like  one or the other. But if you do want to switch over  to Hangouts, you can make the switch now.  It's a full dialer.  And of course, you get the choice  always or just this once. So you don't have to commit  to always. I might try that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting.  Jeffrey, your number of the week  is 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the last of the three  links in my numbers section.  And I don't know why  this fascinated me so much. And I tweeted it. I got tweeted  like crazy. Gina will soon tell me exactly  how much.  And  I think I've already did.  And it's the top  20 websites every December from  1996 to 2013.  And it's really small. But if you just click  on the chart, it doesn't work well on audio.  But it's a stroll  through memory lane.  So 1996, two years after  Netscape,  AOL was  tops. AOL was tops for two, four,  six, seven years.  Web crawler, InfoSeq,  Prodigy, CompuServe,  umich.edu,  cmu.edu, mit.edu.  I just found that people just  were digging into this and having all kinds of fun.  Try to remember  Tripod, Switchboard, of course  Altavista, of course LightGhost,  of course InfoSeq.  This is really cool.  Penthouse was a top  20 website in 1996.

Transcript:  I read it for the letters, man.  I read it for the letters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way,  right after Penthouse, Excite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's appropriate.  Now, AOL disappears in 2003.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And I noted that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then somebody said, no, no, no, it just  mixed it with Time Warner.  That's why Time Warner is number two in 2003.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other thing that struck me about this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that in 2013, the last year of this,  Yahoo, which I think we said at the time,  came back,  was the top website,  which also shows you that being the top website  is not necessarily a great business.  It doesn't mean much.  Google's business is not about being a website at all.  Who's Glam Media?  Well, funny you should ask.  I'm an advisor to Glam.  They're number, what, eight on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now they're number seven.  And Glam is amazing.  The reason I like Glam, Samir Arora is the CEO.  He came into my office one day  many years ago.  And he read What Will Google Do?  And he said, I have to show you this.  You're going to understand this.  Glam is a network.  Glam is 6,000 sites as a network.  And they sell ads across all of them.  And it's the power of the network.  And it amazes me to this day that no one in media  has understood the power of Glam's model.  And it's not about creating all your own content,  owning your own content.  Glam at first was just a women's brand.  And it fought against  iVillage.  iVillage was the queen of women  online. iVillage recently has been fully  shut down by NBCU.  Glam won. Glam has gone to other  areas, men and other  things. They've done Foodie, which is a great  site. They understand how to aggregate,  how to create ad networks.  And nobody knows them.  I was just talking  to Sameer only yesterday.  And their first goal  was to get this. They bought Ning.  And they believe that every...  So they say that every  social site needs content. And every  content site needs social.  And they're going to be doing some new things  soon around that. So pardon the little  ad for Glam. But I think Glam is a fascinating  story. What was the only one  on that list? I didn't know. So there you go.  Exactly. And they're huge.  And they grew huge by creating networks  to enable bloggers, basically.  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my tool of the week  kind of tags on something that we talked  about last week. Android Studio now  out of beta and available to all.  And Go.  The language Go  from Google, which is a really nice,  elegant, concurrent programming  language designed for web.  But the confluence is, they've  just released Go 1.4  and you can write Android apps in Go.  Wait. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? Wait, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not full... They say  simple Android apps, but I'm going to investigate.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's interesting.  But it's very interesting because I hate Java.  I hate it. I don't want  to use Java. And so  I have a simple app I want to write  that would be a purpose-built app  for me that would... I want to put on my Nexus  6 that would just do the  countdown timing for the radio show.  And I did the Hello World, as you said,  and it was very easy. I got it on my  nice... and I kind of added to that.  But then I saw, oh no, now I have to  write the rest of this in Java.  Womp, womp.  I've written Java and I don't like it.  I guess I could go back  and learn it again and do it again.  But I'd be much happier  if it were in Go. So I will investigate.  But the newest version of Go, Go  1.4, which is the fifth  release, one of the new  features is it's going to be  more than just kind of a system file,  system language. They are going to  start supporting Android development in Go.  Much as Apple now has moved  or is allowing Swift  in Xcode.  So I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What makes... I asked you this last week.  What makes a good language and a bad language?  I'll ask it again. Why don't you like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  JavaScript? JavaScript is not  what I don't like. I actually don't... Java.  Java. Well,  that's personal. I just don't like it.  Is it creepy-peely-o?  I like languages. I like interpreted  languages because it's really easy to iterate.  You write, compile, run  very quickly.  But the disadvantage of traditional interpreted  languages is  that they're slow. There's a lot of overhead.  So Python,  Ruby, Perl,  these are all interpreted languages.  Go as well.  Sometimes they call them kind of pejoratively  scripting languages.  But I feel  like  if you... There's a certain  advantage to having this quick iteration  cycle and a very clean,  simple syntax.  The other thing about Go that was written specifically  is to support concurrency and  so forth. So it has nice  features for that. That probably won't benefit you with  Android programming. But I just  feel like I could much more easily write the program I want  in Go. But I don't  have to investigate. I'm still investigating  what does that mean when they say  Android support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. I'm reading about it and this is  interesting. Yeah, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you write your to-do  text, it's written in Java.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To Java, yeah. I love Java.  Java was the first truly  object-oriented language that I  kind of cut my teeth on.  That's why you like it, sure.  I do like it. But I do agree that  a language like Go... I haven't played with  Go a lot, but it sounds like it's similar to Ruby  or PHP or a scripting language.  It's easier to start with  for sure. Lighter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lighter. And just for something  like what I want to write, very simple. I wouldn't  want to write even to-do text in  Go. But for what  I want to write, which is really a very simple  app, it might be more than enough.  I would sure prefer that. Go is fun.  I know the hour of code is  over now. It was a minute of code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My hour of code is never over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can we make this a year of code? What about it?  How about a decade of code?  Let's go  for it, man.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you don't believe  CNN? You believe the New York Times?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they say it too? I do believe them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  American intelligence officials have  concluded that the North Korean government  was centrally involved, quote-unquote,  in the recent attacks, da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Senior administration officials  who would not have come to record about the intelligence  findings said the White House is still debating whether  to publicly accuse North Korea of what  amounts to a cyber-terrorism campaign.  The officials said it was not  clear how the White House would decide to respond  to North Korea. So this is all trial balloon stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is all trial balloon to see what the reaction is,  particularly from North Korea  at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some within the Obama administration argue that the  government of Mr. Kim must be directly confronted.  But that raises the question of what consequences  the administration would threaten.  We're going to force you to read, to watch  the interview.  But is that torture?  But that raises the question  of how much of its evidence  it would make public without revealing  details of how the United States was able  to penetrate North Korean computer networks  to trace the source of the hacking.  Others argue that a direct confrontation with the North  over the threats to Sony and moviegoers  might result in escalation.  What are they going to do? Get rid of  Into the Woods next?  North Korea, the kind of  confrontation it often covets,  feed the trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is more effective than their nuclear weapons  program.  And I think if  this is North Korea, the success  they've achieved is absolutely  going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Putin's watching this saying, this is going to get me out of this  currency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is good for the oil dollars. I'm going after Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That accent's better, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Spanish accent,  just give up.  Not so good, I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You ought to hear my Romanian accent.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Japan,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for which Sony is an iconic corporate name,  has argued that a public accusation could interfere  with the delicate diplomatic negotiations  underway for the return of Japanese  nationals kidnapped years ago.  Very true.  Well, well, well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well, well, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, so this was leaked by the  administration to the Times and  CNN.  And NBC as well.  And, well, I think it must  be true then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I wouldn't, you know, don't forget the New York Times  said there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so  let's hold off a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, really, all they're saying is the senior administration officials  say, off the record  say,  although why would they say that if  they didn't think it was true?  That is inflammatory to say that.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  Anyway, that is this,  the end of this show.  Phew. What a good show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good show. Good year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love this. What a good year has been.  Next week, if you tune in  at this time, you will see the best  of Twig, some of our best  moments from 2014, rants, raves,  like, like  like

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this year? Was that this year or last year?  Oh, God, it all blends together. I believe  it was this year, wasn't it?  We're not talking about Glee this year.  Yeah, no, no, Glee is so

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  2012. We could do this show for five years now.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My new favorite, my new favorite  is MasterChef Jr. Did you watch the  finale last night? I just saw the promos

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for it and I thought, I really don't want to watch  Gordon Ramsay  scream at children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, he didn't, though. And it was just these

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  kids were amazing. They look like  they really are good cooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know what made me so happy about it is, let's  be honest, every one of these kids is probably  treated like a food geek at school.  Right. Right. And they're going to  go back heroes. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Food, by the way, is  the new tech. I have decided.  Yes. It is the new information  technology. It is  it is the new thing.  And I am announcing now today  on this show for the first time ever,  Twitter is abandoning technology.  We're going to cover food nonstop  from now on. This week in Asparagus,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  breaking news Asparagus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll do a live stream for my mom's Christmas Eve dinner.  Don't you think we really, we'd just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  be happier in general  if we forgot about all this  tech stuff and just talked about food?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This isn't a good way  to end this  show.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're renaming the show this week in Grub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Last twig ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no. We'll be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We live in an amazing time. We do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we're watching it. Ring seat,  ring side seats on the Revolution.  The two weeks from now  will be New Year's Eve and we are starting  at three in the morning on New Year's Eve Pacific Time.  We'll go to three in the morning New Year's Day  Pacific Time as we greet  every time zone across the world  and wish them Happy New Year.  And I think we have calls from almost every time zone.  Do you mind if I do a short list of time zones  we're still looking for? And you can go to twit.tv  slash nye  and sign up. We need Norfolk Island.  We need the Northern  Marianas Islands, including  Guam, Micronesia, and Vladivostok.  If you're in Vladivostok,  Burma,  Cocos,  Afghanistan,  Iran,  that ain't going to happen,  Azores, Cape Verde, Trinidad,  South Georgia, or Sandwich Islands,  but most importantly,  our last time zone  of the 24 hour period,  3 a.m. New Year's Day,  Jarvis Island,  a bird sanctuary  in the Pacific. Fly me there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fly me there and I'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff, Jeff will do it. It's got Jeff's name written all over it.  Literally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's apparently a bird  sanctuary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem is it wasn't really named after a guy named Jarvis.  It's a typo.  It's a typo?  It's some other name. It's not Jarvis.  You're kidding me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here it is. No trespassing.  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,  Jarvis Island.  You sure, Jeff, we can't get you to go there?  I'm thinking so.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It has a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  flag of its very own.  It's an unincorporated,  unorganized territory  managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  So it belongs to all of us.  It belongs to America.  It isn't very big,  but it has to have its New Year's Day  just like every other island.  So we need somebody from Jarvis,  and then we will go home after that one.  That will be the last one.  So if you're in those time zones,  twit.tv slash n-y-e,  we are doing this all for UNICEF.  We hope to raise lots of money for UNICEF.  We've got auctions and prizes  and all sorts of stuff.  We're going to do it just like the Jerry Lewis  telethons of my youth.  I'm going to wear a tuxedo.  We're going to have a tote board.  We'll have a drone roll.  What platform are you using for the contributions?  United Nations Children's Fund.  UNICEF has a platform  for us.  In fact, right after this, I'm making a video  for them.  It's UNICEF USA,  but the money will go  to children all over the world.  We're looking for an international charity  that was highly rated.  Charity Navigator gives them  four out of four stars.  91% of every dollar spent goes right to children.  Everybody's familiar with this,  at least in the US,  because we all went around the world.  We're doing a lot to help children in Africa from Ebola.  I thought this would be a good one for us.  Indiegogo just made its  personal campaign platform free.  Neat.  Neat.  So for future times, when you want to raise something for charity

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  or want to raise it for yourself,  I need to send my kid to college.  That's not an option.  Isn't that great?  I think it's a great idea.  I think it's a great idea.  I think it's a great idea.  That's not an option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that great?  That's appropriate.  So do join us  anytime in the New Year's Eve time frame.  3am New Year's Eve, 3am New Year's Day.  I'm going to be up all night.  And we have so much stuff planned.  It is just going to...  We had so much fun last year,  we said let's go all in this year.  And it's costing us a pretty penny.  We've taken over the street out front.  We got permits from the city of Petaluma.  Please don't rain.  What happens out there if it does rain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll be wet.  It'll be a lot easier to fall off the mechanical bull.  It'll be a lot easier to fall off the mechanical bull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll keep the line moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's going to be weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll give you one more.  More tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Donald Trump.  Oh, Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just go to  twitter.com slash realDonaldTrump.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does he say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't even watched it yet.  How can you avoid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are a lot of tweets on this,  aren't there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, it's going crazy.  Donald Trump.  A sad day for freedom of speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I got it right here.  Let's play the video.  Wait a minute, I guess I don't have the video.  You got the video. Play the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interview movie. A sad day for freedom of speech.  I posted something on Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it playing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I hear it was a terrible, terrible movie.  Sony has absolutely no courage  or guts. They should have never  pulled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  King John, you're  fired.  I like it how he has to preface it.  Although I hear it was a terrible movie.  That was gratuitous.  Hey, hey, Kim, you want to mess with  this man? I don't think so.  Look at that hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I said, who has weirder hair?  Donald Trump or Kim Jong-un?  There you go. Feels like they should know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Happy Christmas.  Happy New Year. Happy Hanukkah.  Jeff, Gina. Love doing this  show with you. Take the week off next week.  Merry whatever.  It's not Edda's first Christmas.  It's her second Christmas.  She's going to start to know what's going on now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, wait. What am I talking about?  It's her third Christmas.  Yeah, yeah.  She was born in September.  She was only tiny little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Baby's first Christmas. Yeah, she didn't remember that.  But she'll never remember this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty great. We get to watch.  Rudolph.  She's starting to understand a little bit more now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, do you do that new thing, the elf on the shelf?  Did you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We love the elf on the shelf. Grandma has one of those.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We didn't have that when I was a kid, right Jeff?  That's new. What on the shelf?  See? See? That's all you need to know.  This is something new.  I don't know if you can have a new Christmas  tradition, but apparently you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can do the elf on the shelf for a couple of days  and it quickly becomes a tradition.  It's kind of cool. The kids love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you're seeing this everywhere, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so now it makes sense. On Shark Tank,  for their holiday, the first business  in was a guy who did  mensch on the bench.  Now you get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now I'm getting it.  It's kind of a hallmark  tradition because there's this whole  elfontheshelf.com  and they have kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, they have tons of merchandise here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's been heavily merged, although I don't know if they  own it.  But you hide the elf  every day in December?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, we don't hide the  elf. Sorry, the elf.  What am I saying? The elf hides himself.  At night, the elf flies back to the North Pole  to tell Santa how the kids have been  and then positions themselves  in their house in a different place for the next morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a second, Jason.  So now your kid is surveilled?  Yeah. Is it the NSA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it getting ready for the NSA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pretty much. That's exactly  what I was going to do.  But see, this is the thing.  They opt in because  they are genuinely curious.  So they opt into their location tracking.  It's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, the Washington Post  has an article that says  the elf on the shelf is preparing your child  to live in a future police state,  Professor Warns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've taken your quote and they've made it  into the story already.  So here's the thing on the elf on the shelf.  It's a registered trademark.  To me, Christmas  tradition should not be a registered trademark.  Santa Claus is not  a registered trademark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're saying capitalism, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody owns the elf on the shelf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just searched elf on the shelf creepy.  Tons of wicked place.  Tons.  The elf on the shelf is terrorizing our kids.  Really?  No, I think kids like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't kids like it?  Yes, because they name it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They give it a name.  Where did you get your elf on the shelf?  Did you hand make one from sticks and old rags  just like grandma did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we bought one.  You got it at the store.  But here's the story behind it.  Santa creates all these elves  and puts them in a box in the store.  They aren't magical until they name them.  So you bring it home, you give it a name,  and that's when they start moving around at night  when they don't watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alright, a few dirty words here, but I recommend  elfontheshelfwillkillus.us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a little chucky.  It's a little bit chucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Elf on the shelf is creepy, says the headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently, Rudolph was created by a  department store. Santa Claus, as we  know him, comes from a Pepsi commercial.  This is a long  tradition of Christmas commercialism.  God bless it.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas everybody.  That's it for this week at Google. We'll see you  in two weeks in 2015. Bye bye.
