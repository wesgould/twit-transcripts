Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's talk. Hey them. Let's talk weird tweets. Shall we?  We are we going with Dorsey we're going with Dorsey  So much fun. He's having such a good time now. So now that he's not the head of Twitter. He's tweeting  And a good tweet. I thought that he put out yesterday  You don't own web 3 web 3 is all the rage these days  Everybody's talking about this decentralized blockchain based worldwide web  You don't own that he says the VCs and their LPs limited partners do it will never escape their incentives  it's ultimately a  Centralized entity with a different level label know what you're getting into. Of course the promise  Among all the web 3 advocates is that it isn't centralized it is completely decentralized and  You know  He's his point. In fact, I think he he had a kind of in all in of all of his replies  he kind of implied this his point is it's really a  buzzword created by  Andreessen Horowitz and  That's the VCs he's talking about and their limited partners are all their investments that he's talking about  He says this they really own it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oops. Yeah, I did have in the the thread and I screwed it up. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like I was yeah, there was such a long thread  I'm not gonna find it because a lot of people responded to him a lot of people called him crazy. Mostly the web 3  Advocates the bros. Absolutely. Yeah  VCs congratulating themselves VC at VC Bragg's tweeted. How dare you question the integrity of VCs

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know  You've taken a lot of VC money. So I don't know what you mean says Adam are to which Jack says  This is why I know exactly what I mean  Now he's out of it he can he can say this so, you know, I'm not gonna weigh in on this  It's just right now. It's it's just a catchphrase anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the beauty is when Jacks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tweeted that he was banned from web 3. Yeah, so and market Marc Andreessen who of course is one of the principals at Andreessen Horowitz  He was the guy who made all the money on Netscape became a venture capitalist  He immediately blocked  Jack Dorsey, how dare you question Jack is like so so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  block happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Andreessen yeah, Marc Andreessen blocked like two years ago  I have no idea what I did wrong. I've never criticized him never had constant. I know I've never criticized the company  I don't know what I did. I've been blocked for a long time before Jack

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Take well  Okay in his defense and there's no reason to defend him  But in his defense, that's the best way to use Twitter is to immediately block people. You don't want to hear from  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would say the reasons he blocks people are not I mean  He's got either the thinnest skin in the world or he's just like he just doesn't need it. Yeah, I want the noise I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  honestly  That's kind of my motto with Twitter is follow freely and block justice freely even more freely

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, I block happily if someone's insulting me, but I don't block maybe not a block maybe just unfund disagreeing. Yeah. Yeah  This person has a different take I should probably I mean I'll at least read it and see yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  some people want  To hear the other side most people don't most people just they want to you know, I kind of feel like it's my job  Yeah, yeah, that's different. Yeah. Yeah, you're different. Yeah  You know, I if Marc Andreessen doesn't like I don't want to hear criticisms of web 3 fine. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't know. Yeah, that's certainly is right  But yeah, but you lose out on some interest in fun and and and challenges that are worthwhile sometimes, right?  Especially in a best come back. I miss you. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do we miss Jack at Twitter? I don't think we do I  Don't think this Jack is fair or no. Yeah  Jack has not lost his enthusiasm for Bitcoin. However  He he does say Bitcoin is gonna replace the US dollar someday  This is in another another tweet tweet exchange with Cardi B  Who is of course as everyone knows a world famous economist and rap star?  Cardi asked on Twitter if crypto will replace the US currency  To which Dorsey replied yes Bitcoin will  There you go, I love how worlds come together. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's Twitter right there for you right there Twitter in a nutshell

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cardi B inject or see back and forth

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Talking about crypto. There's nothing more Twitter than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dogecoin co-founder Billy Marcus in response posted a meme about how Dogecoin is more stable than the US dollar  I want to be the  Fiat, yeah, you know, yeah  Boy that's all of our stories. Thank you so much for joining us. This could be a slow this could be a very this nothing  Is going on did we I think we already maybe this was on a twit  That's right, cuz Jeff was here talked about I'm kind of confusing you because you think  About that Jarvis we were talking about reddits. It looks like gonna go do an IPO  And we talked a lot about reddit on on Sunday on the twin  I think my reddits my favorite social network and I the reason I like it is because  You very much in control of what you see you follow subject matter not people you could follow people  But I don't I think most people just use it by following subreddits and then and what I like about it as as my  Enthusiasm shift which they do rapidly. I  Can just shift my reddit to follow the things I'm interested in

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It seems like so I've been trying Leo because you said that on Sunday that yeah  You like credit and I wasn't using read it much. I've been trying to more it. I still like Twitter better

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well Twitter's short but reddits fun for I feel like Twitter is  Maybe a good coffee shop and reddit is like the local bowling alley. Yeah, that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's let's deconstruct that I hate bowling  You wear strange shoes  Get sore

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're hanging out like a coffee shop. You've got this veneer of an intellectual whatever  But really it's just a coffee shop and people are chatting about their eyes there whatever their thing  They're just kind of focused on they have some pretensions around it, right in the bowling alley  You know, you can be ironic, but you're still gonna be pretty unpretentious  Well, and I didn't mention this I did mention this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That the best part of reddit for me is following  The hottest posts and not necessarily reading the comments on those posts  Sometimes I do but the posts themselves are what I follow and that's less of a bowling alley because it's not so much a conversation  As people saying hey, here's a here's something I realized her which is why you like Twitter top articles  It's similar to top articles except it's long form instead of being you know, 280 characters  It could be and there's often images and you know, it's just more you know, I follow basically  You know a few  Lusiasms like the shows I like the the hardware I like the you know  And then news and politics and the kovat chat was was really good the kovat  19 I guess I stopped following it probably should be time to follow it again. I  Just I like it  Anyway, I think they'll do well. So that's who benefits from that Conde right kind of asked owns  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We Conde I said this on on twit, but I'll say it again. I was there or I guess it was yeah, I was there when when  Steve Newhouse my boss loved dig wanted to get in on day was for forgot  He tried to get me to get him in on Facebook. I failed him  I failed him on dig but he after I left he he out of nowhere bought reddit because it was kind of the second choice  To dig it was poor man's dig. Well, I guess who won  And he very wisely  Spun it off such that they had equity so that the the owners still felt like owners and employees could feel  A steak and so that they had something to trade with so it wasn't it wasn't you know  Stock market equity, but it was spun off in essence from Conde but Conde owns the lion share of it  So they'll do very very well. He bought it for a song. What do you buy? I forget what he bought it for a couple hundred million

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That much even let me see here

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come on tell me this is oh quora that's why since quora's a pain in the butt

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Quora results quora results come up 10 million to 20 million. Oh nothing a song. You're right being nothing Wow  Dig was even valued at 60 million. Wow  Nothing  What was Kevin Rose when he was on on the cover of business week?  It was the 60 million dollar man and Kevin we used to mock Kevin  He was still at tech TV when that came out and we used to mock him  He said yeah, no, I didn't get any of that 60 million. He's doing our on the other hand. He's doing fine. Yeah  He was an early investor in Twitter among other things. Oh  Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Oh nice. Nice work if you can get it. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have never gotten anything my only early investments have been in things that have failed

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pretty much the same here. I have no I was going through well business cards. I had my partner at Daylife business cards  I don't boxes of partner. They were like, what was I don't even know what that was. They life was a Google News as an API. I  Know that the brand sounded like a day spa where you get, you know hot stone massages, but it wasn't

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would like a hot stone massage  I'm like, yes, please

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Survey says Americans widely distrust Facebook tick-tock and Instagram. I know I I believe I would not be doing this  I would not be doing this story if it weren't for such a slow week. You left it off the rundown just to know it's in the  Rundown I hate to say it okay Heather Kelly writing for the Washington Post, but they're quoting a survey from  The Washington Post's Shar School poll  Many Americans use social media and most use Facebook, but 64% say the government  Should do more to rein in big tech companies problem is it's one of those things where it's really easy to get people to say  Stuff like that exactly. Yeah  I like that idea good idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the one question was  Do you depend upon your phone?  Yeah, and?  Depend upon the toilet too. What's the problem? What does it mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't know a lot of context  Internet users here's the question. How much do you trust each of the following?  How much do you trust each of the following companies or services to responsibly handle your personal information and data on your internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Activity on guard you just you did the setup for that is so obvious

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much do you trust these country companies with your privacy in other words?  And then the dark is trust not much at all  The light blue is trust a great deal a good amount and the gray is no opinion  Facebook came out worse people are not wrong  They trust Amazon's number one they didn't trust yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think it's you do trust them you trust them with your data  You don't trust them to necessarily do right by the merchants trying to sell you stuff  But Amazon's they your data goes in it never comes back out I guess that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple is actually behind Amazon by a goodly amount then Microsoft. How much data do you really give Apple?  versus Amazon well potentially everything because you carry their phone around so  Potentially if they wanted it they could get a lot of information  historically they are they don't try to get everything and of course they make a lot of  Do a lot of marketing and spend a lot of market  Yeah, yeah, it's saying hey, you know we're safe  43 percent trust Microsoft just slightly under Apple  Google is actually doing fairly well 48 percent trust them a great deal  35 percent trust  YouTube  For whatsapp 19 for Instagram 12 for tik-tok tux the least trusted  I'm sorry the interesting whatsapp was a huge. I don't know yeah a lot of I don't know on whatsapp. That's the  Yeah, I don't know I don't know why should I trust oh, I don't know I don't know who they are  And you know it's it's because of the large and shifting I don't know percentage you can't really it's kind of weird because  for instance YouTube is  Trusted by 35 percent of people but mistrusted by 53 percent which is a fairly hefty proportion  So it's a little it's a little confusing. It's it's I mean I often quoted these moments

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The brilliant James Kerry the late professor from Columbia University who said the opinion polls preempt the public conversation  They're meant to measure. Yeah, we have here is is a case of  Self-fulfilling prophecy from media right three billion people still use Facebook, but the media are beating everybody over the head  Yeah, it's awful. It's evil. It's terrible. Do you think they're awful and evil and terrible yes? Oh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's almost a measure of you know have you been reading our stories more than exactly yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Most there is something going on here. I'm not denying that but it's just  Media never acknowledge  their own

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Self-reflective impact and by the way conflict of interest most say targeted ads are annoying invasive and not helpful  This is very counterintuitive 82 percent say people say targeted ads are  Annoying invasive and not helpful. I don't understand that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well no I also think people get creeped out slash upset over like a pair of shoes following you that is  It is disconcerting especially if like  You looked at something that isn't related to something you actually want right that's when you tend to notice it  Well, I can see why people think it's annoying. Yeah, I'm not buying horseshoes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right anyway. Yeah, yeah, it's you know I even don't even want to continue on because it's right. It's not thank you  It's not it's not good. I'm putting my blood pressure. Yeah, it's just a poll  I don't think they're that I don't think they're very useful for anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but is it the one one one you're you're willing to go over?  I'll just note newspapers went after radio they went after billboards. They went after television. They're going after the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, nothing. Yeah, nothing. Yeah, let's take a little break  We can actually this might be interesting go back and in time and look at the year in review  Jason's put in a bunch of stories from the past year with oh wow  Yeah, that's nice. Thank you Jason. We'll do that  Finally something to talk about instead of  Washington Post polls have either of you ever done imperfect foods I?  Have I had a completely wrong impression of what these guys were?  imperfect foods  They're actually pretty perfect. That's the place that was my bottom line on this. We've been we've been getting it now every week  I love it every day delicious groceries fall through the cracks of our food system  Just because how they look  Imperfect foods is turning this around by sourcing quirky yet delicious foods and delivering them to you in a way proven to reduce emissions  By the way, this this is a sponsor in case you didn't notice  So let me talk about this because when I heard that and I know that's the mate that's the kind of the  Top line pitch of imperfect foods. I thought well, they're all you know  They're gonna gonna have a rutabaga that looks like Richard Nixon or I'm gonna have a you know bruised apple or something  No, actually, this is fantastic food  I'll give you an example we got pomegranates  There's they're smaller than the pomegranates the size of my head that I can buy at a Whole Foods  But in every other respect they were delicious. They were sweet. They might even be better than the giant pomegranates

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Turns out 35% of the fool's food supply in this country gets unsold or uneaten  more than a third  Just because the grocery store doesn't you know what thinks nobody will buy it or whatever  So you can change that equation with imperfect foods as a grocery  Deliver delivery service offering an entire line of sustainable groceries by the way  We can get a lot of our shopping done there because it's not just produce. It's everything now. They taste delicious. They reduce waste  They the way they do it is great. They they  Organize the deliveries in the group so that the truck only goes to the neighborhood once a week  So they reduce emissions fact is about 25 to 75 percent fewer emissions than individual trips to the grocery store  on average imperfect food customers save six to eight pounds of food with every order I  just I  This is better than your grocery delivery in so many ways  I get some of the best broccoli I've ever had from imperfect foods last week  artichokes  And then we can also get butter cheese  Chips everything almost everything we buy at the grocery store from imperfect foods, so this makes me so so happy  And by the way, I really like this say goodbye to packaging guilt  It's the only national grocery delivery company that makes it easy to return your packaging after every order plus they don't use plastic bags  So it's just a cardboard box with cardboard liners  So the the waste is very very minimal and there's no plastic in it  You know except for the you know prepackaged stuff like fruit  I know that's my big thing right now. I'm really trying to cut back on plastics you get to choose. It's really good  I  And I just think that the name of the company implies  There's gonna be something wrong with these and there's nothing as far as I could tell there is everything right with them  I guess they know if I may yes, you know you think about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's annoying now. I don't understand does a creator have to go along with that or is tiktok just doing it to them?  I think they repost it. Yeah, okay, the creator reposted. So tiktok tells you what your most viral video is and then you post it  Yeah, they do that on facebook people do that my top 12 pictures from facebook or 10 or whatever it is  I kind of like it not facebook instagram instagram  I do not no because we've seen them all and if yeah you want new you want  There's a demand for fresh content on tiktok  Henry tells me i need my fresh  He feels the pressure man.

We have a lot of blind listeners and I know  You know while podcasts are great for blind listeners the uh worldwide web not so much so websites often  Leave them in the dark if you will  It's all about accessibility and by the way  You have a legal obligation to make your website accessible  According to the americans with disabilities act you've got to be ada compliant or you're open to lawsuits  User way solves that problem. It's an incredible ai-powered solution  That with one line of javascript enforces the hundreds of web content accessibility guidelines  It can achieve more than an entire team of developers  I know the idea of making your website. I mean everybody likes the idea, but it also is  Challenging because you worry it's going to cost a lot  It's going to be hard to do going to be a lot of maintenance not with user way one line of javascript makes your website  Accessible it's simple. It's easy. It's cost-effective  Start by going to user way.org  slash twit  And using their ada scanning tool to see if your website is compliant  You can run it through you can check it. You can see you can see where the problems are  You might decide as some of the biggest companies in the world have decided to use user way over a million websites now  Use user way including coca-cola  Disney ebay fedex wal-mart  Unicef uses user way  And now user way is making its best in class enterprise level accessibility tools available to small and medium-sized businesses for a small and medium-sized price  In fact, it's very very affordable, which was a huge relief to me  Because you know, I know I want to operate an accessible compliant website. It's not just the right thing to do it  It's good business sense. You don't want to turn people away 60 million americans with disabilities  You want to purchase your products?  But when they can't use your shopping cart, that's the end of the line  User way will fix image tags. It will remediate complex nav menus  It'll ensure all the pop-ups are accessible that your your shopping cart is accessible  It'll  Make sure you use accessible colors while remaining true to your brand colors  And it'll give you a detailed report of all the violations that were fixed on your website user way is easy to install  It's just a plug-in with some of the big sites like wordpress  It works with shopify it works with wix aem site core sharepoint  But any site you can add a line of javascript to user way will work with and it integrates seamlessly  It's affordable and it'll help you meet your compliance goals and really  Most importantly improve the experience for your users just ask susan bennett the former voice of syria

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hi, i'm susan bennett the original voice of syria  You won't hear me say something like this too often i'm sorry, I don't understand what you're looking for  But every day that's what the internet is like for millions of people with disabilities  User way fixes all of that with just one line of code

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's it user way can make any website fully accessible an ada compliant with user way  Everyone who visits your site can browse seamlessly  Customize it to fit their needs  It's a great way to show your commitment to millions of people with disabilities  And it's easy and it's very affordable when you go to user way.org  You'll get 30 off user ways ai-powered accessibility solution user way  Making the internet accessible for everyone. I like that user way.org  slash twit user way.org  slash  twit  If you've been waiting and waiting for an update to your pixel 6 jeff you thought you got it  Did you no I didn't yeah  Stacey you did somebody got it. Maybe it was an I thought I got it. Yeah, so you were the unlucky one  Because google paused it  So the big december update which is not just a security update but was a fix for a lot of things  Apparently caused some number of people to have connectivity problems that reduced it reduced their  Uh, you know the bars and they were dropping calls that were getting low low quality

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if you've been my island has terrible cell service. So you wouldn't even notice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's been a lot of you know question back and forth what's going on why can't I get it what this is the slowest  Rollout ever in history. Well now it's pretty apparent that google has actually paused it because of these  connectivity issues  And until they fix it, they're not going to push it out. So the december update at this point probably a january update  And uh, and don't feel bad if you didn't get it because very few people except stacey got it  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This just in this just oh you wanted this just in yes. I don't know. Is this just in?  Um  The ftc is looking at amazon's cloud business. Did you see that story? No, I didn't see it was in blueberg. It's a it's a blueberg. So  Federal investigators have contacted several companies about aws amazon web services  um, and lena conn at it again

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  She I think you know, I think we can safely say congress is going to do uh diddly  Because they can't seem to get anything done anyway, so this seems like an unlikely  Scenario, but if there's any hope of regulation of big tech in the united states, it's going to be through the ftc

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's terrible because the ftc a  They have regulatory guidelines. So what will happen is if they fine or censure amazon here  Amazon will sue them. They've clearly they've already demanded a recusals amazon's clearly not going to just like roll over on this  So then we'll get a lawsuit  Then we'll get the inevitable  Countersuit then we'll get you know the appeals process and everything and it'll be just like microsoft antitrust all over again. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She of course when she was a columbia law school professor, uh wrote papers, uh  Warning about foundational antitrust paper. Yeah warning about amazon and that's why amazon said she has to recuse herself  Uh courts said no she doesn't and now that she's the chairperson of the fcc  Ftc it looks like there's gonna be a lot more activity against big tech from the ftc

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which and she has certain muscle, but you're right congress wall and congress is doing stuff for headlines  Mike masnick and jeff kossup were going angry today because clobas char and company were demanding to know about  Moderation decisions from the platforms. Well  That's a first amendment question it's not that government's right to do that you wouldn't ask the near times you how dare you ask anybody else  Um, but they're just doing it for they know that they can't do it  They know it violates the first amendment, but they're doing it to get a headlines. Yeah, so that's what congress is out for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of depressing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's real work to be done, but they're yeah jerks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

I said rafa. Everything's fine. Your baby sister is arriving the 20 minute drive  To the hospital felt like two hours each time  She caught her breath between contractions. She glanced at the gps to clock their progress  Because just as they pulled up to the hospital the tesla driving the whole way I might add she whispered  Oh my god keating. She's out  The pediatrician happened to be standing right outside the doors. He summoned nurses who raced down cut the umbilical cord over the car's front seat  baby healthy mother healthy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And car made it the first he he said he had to do some major cleaning of the car

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey who cares, you know, that's fine. That's why you get the leather seats. Yeah, uh  That the birth apparently was flawless  uh, and um  You know they the the family of four made it to the hospital. Thanks to the tesla driving them there  So they're calling it the first

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  tesla self-driving baby they considered briefly though. She I think quite properly vetoed this  Using the middle name tess. Oh, no, no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they're gonna call her mave mave lily  obviously westworld fans  Uh, that's pretty cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's pretty cool. It is pretty cool. Yeah, nice family. It's so dangerous because we know it's not good. I know well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know, but what are you gonna do if you're if you're in that position?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You pull over just like everybody's done since the car was invented. They did it in buggies  You just pull over you call 9-1-1  Have the baby  But we're but we're almost there we're almost there watch the gps honey and breathe

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you go a little lighter on my hand can you let go of my hand a little bit the case of the self-driving baby

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should they really should have named her tess. I think that's  Why about you 10 to 1 10 to 1 nickname? That's what she gets called, right?  So this is the tic-tac story you put in here from the verge tic-tac kitchens  so, you know, I have a little bit of a  self-interest  Conflict of interest with this one because my son is on tic-tac with 1.7 million followers. He's a tic-tac  chef  But apparently he picked a good time to become a tic-tac chef because  Cooking is huge  on tic-tac  And tic-tac has decided to create pop-up kitchens  With some of the creations of their content creators. This is you know, all of this  Every one of these platforms is vying to get creators to make stuff on their platform because essentially you get free content  It's what drives the platform whether it's youtube or tic-tac or snapchat or twitter or whatever or instagram  So this is the spiff that tic-tac is offering these cooks, you know, we'll take your recipe and we'll let people order it  They're gonna open 300 locations across the us to start but plan on expanding to 1 000 by the end of next year  they partnered with virtual dining concepts, which is uh,  I guess a pop-up kitchen ghost kitchens. Yeah, it's a ghost kitchen company

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They use they use some existing restaurants. I think and then they create kitchens. It'll be delivery only no brand to go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll cook up some of the trendiest recipes on the app. I know that henry's stuff  I'm, sorry salt hanks stuff would probably be among those  Uh tic-tac kitchens will operate out of some existing kitchens, uh, like buka de beppo and bertucci's  um  Oh near me. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they'll share revenue with the creators, but they don't have to right because you can't copyright a recipe, right?  No, right. So but tic-tac knows that you know, it's about the creators

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at they they all they have to do is look over their shoulder at twitter and what and how they killed vine  By not valuing the creators and they know that how easy it is to lose these people. So  Yeah, they're gonna make sure so the very first menu will feature the baked feta pasta by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, who really wants that? All right. It was fun to watch. I don't want to eat it fun to do  Are you gonna order that brought home? I don't think so air fried strips of corn known as corn ribs

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, they really need to talk to my son the crispy cheese covered pasta chips and the smash burger. These are all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Novelty foods not good foods, right? You want to you want a great killer? Yeah  Roast beef sandwich with cheese on it and then jus

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like what you want is to taste something crazy. This is this is a search. This is entertainment. This is food

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right. You're not ordering this for dinner. This is just say hey, you got it  Well, then you do it once and you don't do it again  Mr. Exactly. Mr. Beast the mr beast burger. Mr. Beast the number one youtube star  Vdc created a kitchen for him with the mr beast burger towards the end of last year  They sold 1 million burgers in three months and there are now 50 me  Yeah, and there are now 1500 kitchens throughout the u.s canada in the uk. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's good time it is possible that some of this will become like part of the  food lexicon, but the nice thing about ghost kitchens is you just  They're outfitted specifically to make  To to churn out batches of stuff and then flip. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah  Right. The fad goes fine. You're done  Yeah, geez, I could order a mr beast burger

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you could have I don't know if they you should check no, I don't know maybe two cheese will bring one over for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your heart jeff your heart. I can only get um delivery though not uh, pick up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Up yes pretty far away. No, I think they don't want you to see where it's made

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the bodega of the street

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think it's probably bertucci's for you or maybe a trailer where they make meth other days. Well, you don't know. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh  We had mentioned that google tv's were yanked from best buy uh, summarily  uh, we  We hypothesized it's because tcl is going to be making the amazon tv's featuring the fire tv  But tcl has resumed selling its google tv's  They had to roll out some uh software fixes. So it was just a sort of problem issue, right? Yeah  These are actually very nice tv's  Tcl has for years offered roku built in and now they're offering  Uh google tv built in into its six five and six  Series apparently the software was sluggish and buggy and now that it's updated they're back on sale  Uh sidewalk labs  Which is google's uh data focus smart city. Yeah now folded back into google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because the core not corey doctor. Uh, dan doctor. Yeah doctor off. Sorry  Has health issues so and they also, you know, they were this is their ignoble retreat from activists

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Against what they were trying to be on next year's kill list. I'm afraid. Oh dear. Yeah  I still think there's very neat things to be done there, but I wish oh I totally do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  um, I do think  I think anytime we talk about smart cities you have an inherent conflict of interest between citizens who  You know are distrustful of data in cities that are like, uh, yeah  We'll do whatever we can to help get a cool service and offset some of our costs because people don't want to pay taxes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's just it's a it's a nasty dynamic. I think it's also somewhat there is some i'm sorry jeff moral panic here  uh  And this is the trademark leo. That's my this is the tension throughout everything we cover  Which is the data can make it better, you know, this is you know having the data that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They didn't want to share that data with others. They wanted to take that data  But they didn't want to provide it out and that that's not cool. No, it's the city's data

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that obviously is a non-starter  And if they're going to be in transigent about that, yeah, it doesn't work  but there's also this  legitimate, I understand concern for privacy and and uh,  I don't think there's any evidence that a city government is going to protect your data any better than google would  Uh, they would probably be worse. Yeah, probably worse  Yeah, but people don't want the big company to get it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So well, it wasn't just that they didn't want what they didn't want was google getting access to this data when other competitors  Couldn't come in and get access to I understand that yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that but see that's an easy thing to fix and if google doesn't fix that then that's just then they're wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, well then google but to google's point they're like why would we share this data?  This is why we're doing and investing in this is so we can get access to this information

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh  You mean they're not doing it for the public good  Right. So, you know  Now you must have put this in because there's a question mark next to this story. I did. Does this mean anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can tell you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Verizon and google because let me just give them the story then you can explain it. So my news

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Feed because what I do is to look at the show and irritate stacey and put things into the rundown  If I go to google news and and and type in google, it's weird  But if I go to search google for google and then click on news, then I get a nice feed  suddenly today there was kind of a  Redesign and there were also more press releases in it, which was a little interesting  And so I came across this one for google and verizon  And and so my mind was thinking it's a news story I realized it's a press release  But then I read it and I think what the hell does this mean? So I thought i'll ask stacey  That's fair because it made no sense I couldn't get any sense out of this thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so what's happening is, you know big picture

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, did you read the headline out loud? No, I didn't. Verizon and google cloud to collaborate to deliver 5g mobile edge  computing  To bring the power of the cloud closer to mobile and connected devices at the edge of verizon's network  A lowercase edge in that case next paragraph google distributed cloud edge all uppercase verizon 5g edge  It tends to bring compute and storage services to the network edge lowercase e to support real-time enterprise applications  I throw my hands. I said that I don't I have no idea what's happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there anything basically what's happening? Yeah, there there is a thing happening and there's this thing is this  One the telcos have given up on the cloud and we saw this coming this happened in 2020  We saw these deals microsoft has one of these with azure. Sorry at&t has one with azure. Verizon has one with google and with aws  At&t might have one with aws. Anyway, the point is  all the stuff used to happen in google and azure and  the  aws is cloud  Data centers, right? You know the ones that keep going down  so  with 5g and everything happening on your mobile devices and then this idea of like  The edge being like inside a factory  Latency becomes important. So you don't want to send your data all the way back to google's data centers  You want to send it someplace a little closer. So verizon they have  Little tiny data centers all over the place because they've got cell towers all over the place and at the base of those  I've got a bunch of servers. They also have like central offices for you know, the telco networks  So now you can get access to google or amazon or any one of depending on the partnership  They run their cloud software in verizon's data centers because it's lower latency. So what is it's it's like it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, what's the what's the company with the hawaiian name that puts everything on all servers around the country in the world  akamai  So a sponsor by the way, I ought to off. Uh, so you so it is near the edge  It is literally physically around their network. That's what you're saying. It is physically on their network. It's a little different

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so akamai only does  Well, they've they've expanded but they  This is just serving google's cloud software  So basically you if you build something designed for like amazon or google's clouds you're you're using certain services  You don't have to change anything about your  Application to run it now a little closer because it's going to run on those same services located. Got it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. Now it makes sense. Thank you. Stacey. I knew you would know. I don't know if it was worth talking about but I just didn't  Couldn't figure it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We throw that term around so it's good to explain it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I was I was going to say the biggest deal with the edge and you're going to hear this this will be a  point of contention for like the next few years is people be like the edge and there's the  The telco edge, which is what these people are talking about. There's the  you know edge edge, which is usually like a gateway device like a  Just a server that's sitting in like a factory floor  And then there's what a lot of the cloud companies call the farthest edge, which is actually where i'm most excited  Which is actually the devices themselves  in so when  What i'm actually really excited about is what the cloud guys call the farthest edge is the most interesting place  Because that's where you're seeing a lot of really cool innovation happen with distributed computing  And you're seeing a bunch of startups arise  trying to make it  So you can actually do an ad hoc distributed  computing kind of system  and  That's going to be awesome because then you don't have to send stuff back to the cloud  There's going to be more data privacy. There's going to be lower latencies  It's going to be really cool  But nobody yet has a dog in that hunt except these startups and so you get a lot of like the big guys kind of like  Calling thing that's the edge that aren't really the edge and you're going to start seeing the big guys buy companies here  As they realize their container strategy is going to ultimately fail for the iot  So like next three years or so that's going to be a huge thing to think about like a big macro picture

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what does this have to do with microsoft's edge browser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh actually, uh speaking of browsers chrome 100  Which is that's a major landmark. What is chrome currently? Is it 96 97? We're getting close  Uh chrome is set to reach virgin 100  but  Apparently it's according to the chromium bug tracker. It's going to break some websites  Uh, yeah, the websites that are known to be affected are primarily those developed with a web design kit called  duda  Or duda these websites all use the same bit of code to check what version of chrome you're using  They're used to two digits. This is kind of like a mini y2k  But three digits, uh, I don't know what the hell that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what the hell it is. That's uh, I love how people just make the same mistake over and over and over again

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So duda blocks automatically any version of chrome below 40  However, when you get to 100 if you only look at the  If only look at the uh first two digits  It it looks like chrome 10 and it will be blocked  and uh, so they're uh  So something's gonna have to give I think they'll figure out a way around this  but uh  anyway  This is so stupid one one solution is to add a flag to chrome colon slash slash flags  That will be able to give you a chance to test whether a site will be affected  Uh, and it looks it'll let you put the major version  100 in the minor version position  In user agent, huh? So instead of saying chrome  100 dot whatever dot zero it'll say chrome 99.100  thereby bypassing it that's ridiculous, but  That's what we have to do sometimes that is the world we live in that's the world we live in as life is a  Cluge. Yeah, what a clue. Is that crazy?  Uh, it's time for speaking of the edge time to go off the edge with our nft segment  melania trump planning to launch  Her new nft platform and of course  It's its intent is to inspire  It's it's all about the inspiration  uh  President donald trump once called bitcoin a scam that competed against the dollar because everything's a competition  But on thursday melania announced a new business venture embracing cryptocurrency and digital art a platform to sell nfts  This is the first thing she's done since leaving the white house  um  I don't sure who's nfts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The fun part is on twitter all the time people people fighting about  nfts and web 3 and nobody knows what anybody else is talking about  But when I go to academic things they spend the first half of the day explaining finding terms. Yeah  But but nobody knows what these terms mean  Well, they think they do but everybody's saying different things to each other  And then they're arguing about it and I can't get my head into it. It's like you're in an eternal clubhouse loop

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm I'm trying to read and I haven't finished it yet, but did y'all read tim o'reilly's thing on web 3? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I said it's an open tab stacy. It's an open tab

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an oh, yeah, that's i'm like it's an open tab that i'm getting to as soon as i'm done with my emails  so maybe next week or

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it may sit there for a while but  Because when you think about a web 2.0 itself  Was hubristic of a sort  Like oh we already finished web. We know what the next one is. We don't have the third one. Um  No, maybe web zero dot zero zero one  We're early in this thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me uh, let me do the google change log and then we can um  We can get your pics of the week because it was like you guys we were just suffering here. It's painful. It's just  Google change log  So you remember last week we all got severe weather alerts for a cyclone coming to the philippines  I guess there is a fix which is essentially  They've turned off severe weather alerts in the pixel launcher's at a glance widget just completely disabled. That's one way to fix something

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh google is when the snow hits seattle later this week. I'm not going to get a notification

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you might but you won't get it through that widget if you use the at a glance widget  You might get a notification on your phone in other ways. You probably will  Um, yay  Uh, no one's saying google hasn't said  But nine to five google noticed that that they've been the severe weather alerts have been disabled  And you can't re-enable them. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a change right that counts  Google is turning if you've got an on hub router  Now i'm not even a fan of the of the current google wi-fi routers, but I don't remember these on hubs

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This goes back. Hey people people did buy them. I think kevin used to have them many many years ago  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're turning off the controls. So this is an example of an iot device that doesn't actually work  without support from the company  Although you know most routers that were used to do  They're just a box. It's a computer in a box  But these on hub routers apparently need support from a google server that will be  lights out  December 19th

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well most of our routers these days already did that's a couple of days ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they did give you a discount a 40% off discount on the nest  Google wi-fi routers if you want those I would not recommend them. No, I wouldn't either  And I think those recommend these days

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh euros good. I like the euros. I like the um orbs. That's exactly so scott wilkins asked me and that's the two I recommended  TP link has some good ones, too. There's a problem in uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TP link

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  apparently setting up a  Invisible wi-fi public wi-fi network  On some of its routers  You know we get all up in arms about that every single time someone does it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know comcast has it all the isps have their little fake wi-fi network their public wi-fi is on existing drivers  Yeah, we've seen it  From oh, I can't think of the company right now  I mean, i'm not saying that you know if that's not your jam then  I think this one you can't turn off  I mean, I think it's a good one  I'm not saying that  You know if that's not your jam then I think this one you can't turn off

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think they're going to fix that by adding that  Feature in a in a firmware you're automatically opted in. Yeah, just like amazon sidewalk network kind of like that  Hey, I like this new rules for incoming voice calls if you use google voice  You can now control  Who gets forwarded?  You could forward calls from specific  Contacts to linked phone numbers or directly to voicemail  So if you decide I don't want to get any more calls from jeff jarvis send them straight to voicemail by person  You can opt to scream

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead groups in your contacts  So if you actually like i'm like sitting here thinking oh if I had actually labeled all the pr people in my contacts  It's pr people I could be like, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This mail yeah, you could set custom voicemail greetings for specific contacts used to be able to do that for groups  I mean you can do that for groups  I remember it kind of puzzled my family when I said hi, this is leo. I can't take your call right now  Leave a message. I love you  Jennifer said do you say that to everybody who calls he said no, no, it knows it's you it knows it's you  You just call yourself leo leo. Well for my family. That's my real name. That's the name I use. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, oh, I just was wondering about that. I'm t i l

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We could call you leo you could call you leo. I like leo. It's very classy. Yeah, it's l e  Akshanti goo over the e acute accent over the e. Oh, it was the bait of my childhood because you know, I mean, you know  right a kid with a  diacritical mark on his  His laio what the hell so when I got into radio  For a while. I used a phony name. It was dave allen and dan haze  But when I got the radio in san francisco  Um, I said I would like to use my real name now and my program director said well, what's your real name?  I said, it's leo laporte and he said that sounds gay. You can't use that  It's san francisco. It's gonna be huge. What are you talking about?  So  So I said well my and the driver's license is spelled leo. I could just say leo and they said that's fine  much more manly  So but so  Leopards  I guess it's too fancy. Yeah, if you want to call me leo do lisa. It's funny because  I tell lisa you should call me leo. That's my name and i'm your husband. You can call me my real name now  But she she alternates back and forth  Because you know work she calls me leo and  yeah, anyway, so  I am leo and so  That's why I said that on my that's the thing they got a custom message because they knew who I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I grabbed onto that. That's what yes like a jack russell terrier out of foot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Opt to screen calls from specific context so you can really go person by person  Uh apply rules for all your contacts or specific groups within your contacts. This is great  I hope they can that google fi will get this because when I got fi as you did too  You gave up your google voice phone number to your fi number and I think you lose some of the  Features of that now, of course, they're giving google voice new new features. So that's cool  Brand new there's your that's a change  And the home mini  They finally stopped selling it  This is that's the little google home

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fabric colored google home, which was the least expensive about that should have on the list of things killed

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know, but you can get the you can get the nest mini for 25 bucks. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why it's important that they I think they still sell these inexpensive ones. They have to compete with amazon echoes  And the sound is very good on them. They're better than the echoes. They sound fine

I can't begin to describe performed beautifully  uh in this in this um recording and and and it's wonderful, I just bought the library book

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That he recommended so I know I know I just wrote about that the library of fragile history by andrew pedigree  But if you think the layman, uh, oh, I think the library is also very they're very very very different  Well now I have the 40 hour big book of espionage  That's the best

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you go to my medium feed i'm going to plug rare plug here if you go to my medium feed jeff jarvis.medium.com  I have two new posts  One is about the library and about bit streams and the continua  I saw in them about about how everything is processed and everything is a conversation nice  So and that library what library is this? I don't know what it is. I just stole the photo, but it's magnificent, isn't it? Yeah  Uh, I saw that photo because somebody said  uh  He or she was being rushed out by security guard wondering why I would want to take a picture of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you doing there? Why would you want to take a picture at a library?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A guy escorted me out baffled by someone with a sneaker to the building to take his picture. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, I would I would like to know what the library is  The uh, the famous library at the milk abbey in austria is the model for uh,  Uh  Was it the library in the name of the rose I think so but anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the great things of libraries pedigree and devetovans the library of fragile history at the beginning  Of course, they start with the library of alexandria because you have to right and the funny thing was when nixon went to alexandria  In a triumphant tour of egypt. He asked to see the library  Yes, and  And what was the response well the thing was they didn't even know where it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where it had burned down a few years ago, uh, mr

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nixon but a fascinating little tidbit here from the book is that is that because they were papyrus scrolls  Pedigree and devetovans said that they would have had to have been copied every century or two because they would have crumbled to their own accord  Interesting and and the larger the library got the more impossible that became so scale  Was sought after and also a curse. Yeah all the way back then. Yeah. Wow, that's fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay  So the public domain, you know, that's good  Did you want to do the internet hall of fame inductees too? Because that's good we could yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I I never much like awards and things like that, but I wondered how many of these names, you know  I didn't know many of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, let's go through them coming up  Uh carlos alfonso advanced internet development in brazil  bob bloxell the from the netherlands  See, these are all so hans verner brown  designed the national science foundation network nsf net  in the u.s  for the grazen from denmark who founded the e-bone which is  Not what you think it is, but the european internet back. I think that's a song that just went into the public domain  The e-bone is connected to the toe bone  Jan grunt orad from the czech republic champion of networking for research and development in czechoslovakia  solhan  Caribbean and he's named superior so far. No. Oh, yeah, dan kaminsky who passed away this year. That's the one  That's the one I knew who of course created the dns system actually no  Repaired the dns system when he found the kaminsky bug  Um, yeah, he's the only one I think on this whole list  But that's actually why I think it's important to cover these these are not publicity exercises  Yes, these are really about remembering the people who made such a difference and really didn't get much credit  so internet hall of fame  dot org  Congratulations to the 2021  Inductees leo leo you should be there. We know I did nothing  Me  No, nothing  Although this might be in there. This is very  cool  The story of well, I love the title  I blew 720 on a hundred notebooks from alibaba and started a paper website business  Uh  the idea is  The author thought wouldn't it be cool?  If I could write a website a blog post a medium post  In my moleskine notebook  And then have it say it i've always wondered is no there is no way to say it i've i've asked them many times  It's all phony because they're pretending to be you know, a classic notebook from france, but  They and when you when you go to the website it says pronounce it wherever you want  I always say they come from statin island. Is that yeah exactly. I always pretend it's italian moleskine because moleskine

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is disgusting sounds kind of like it was something that was  Taking off a dead animal. Yeah. Anyway, so he bought whatever those notebooks it sounds like a like a moles

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Skin a moleskin  A moleskin exactly perfect. Yeah, or yeah covering a notebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, perhaps except that it's not it's just paper cover  um ben  Ben who is a full stack developer an entrepreneur started an ice cream business in a cookie dough business among others  Uh thought it would be really cool if people could  Write their website in a notebook  And then scan it in when he first did the scans with his phone  The results were so terrible. You can show this on the screen john  I mean the jester gobbledygook, but then he had a brilliant idea run it through gpt3  Everybody's favorite artificial intelligence and in fact  with a little work  It he was able to get excellent results. So he built a little prototype  Then went online and he bought a bunch of notebooks  from moleskine  Went online sold them  And created paper website.com and you can now  Go to his website  And sign up the pricing is affordable. He'll send you if you get the ultimate deal for eight dollars a month  He'll send you actually ninety nine dollars for a year a a notebook that he these are the ones he bought from alibaba  Uh, but the idea is you then take a picture of it and it gets uploaded and put on your blog  And in fact the entire post  That i'm reading from here was written in a notebook  And uh uploaded  To his blog. It's actually a really cute story tiny projects.dev  And uh and and it has a very happy ending because it actually worked  He went viral on twitter  And uh, he's now got got on product hunt. He's now making a living. How do you think you'd do with this?  Yeah, I think if you go well, you gotta start stop crying while you're doing this  You gotta start stop crying while you're taking your notes my head ready  It's it's impossible to read. I can't read you must have been doing it in the rain then because it does look like it got  That was a spilled thing  You you know what you really need  And I now i'm getting one the elevated craft hybrid cocktail shaker  No more spilling martinis as you succeed.
