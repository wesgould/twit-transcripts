Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm at school. I'm back. I have connectivity. I have a wire plugged into the computer.  Oh, I'm loving it.  It works.  I'm loving it.  I just saw somebody on Twitter last week.  I worked three hours to get on the darn show and you give me hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People just are mean and I love the picture of you in the modeling session that was going on at the poolside.  Yeah.  Yeah. This looks like you had a good time. Did you ever get to talk to Jim Jarmusch?  No, I didn't. No, I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York. That's where he is right now.  Are you doing office hours? Are there kids there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, not many. Well, our social students are here, but I haven't been here for like two weeks.  Just checking the mail.  Yes, I have a lot of meetings, but between VidCon and Mexico City.  That's right.  And seeing my parents in Florida. I'm back.  Good. Well, we like having you back.  I'm going to put down the shade behind me because the sun is not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, but I like seeing the kind of sweaty Manhattan behind you.  Should I leave Manhattan?  Sweaty. You're there on what, West 44th?  West 40th.  Fortieth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Center of the universe, Times Square, New York, New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. Kind of a nice locale. Also with us from Austin, Texas, Stacy Higginbotham.  Not the center of the universe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it is. Absolutely. The People's Republic of Texas. Are you kidding?  Are you guys going to secede? Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no. If Texas secedes, Austin's going to have to secede and then we'll be like an island nation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it'll be like, we'll have to do an airlift. It'll be like East and West Berlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say like Puerto Rico, but that's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There'll be a wall. We have an airlift. There'll be a corridor.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So, hopefully not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to Austin tomorrow. I'm flying to Austin tomorrow.  Oh yeah?  For the association, what used to be called the American Association of Alternative Newspapers.  Oh.  But now they made the end stand for something else.  Like the Berkeley Barb.  Right, the Bay Guardian.  Bay Guardian.  Austin Chronicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now mostly they're just classified ads.  Bar recommendations.  Bar recommendations, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's the one at Austin?  Austin Chronicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it still around?  It is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It feels like Austin could keep an alternative paper alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well some would argue that our local paper is an alternative paper.  And we have the Texas Tribune, which isn't...  Which is amazing.  Which is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And yet, Austin's the state capital.  Yes.  Oh, I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.  And yet, well it's kind of an interesting mix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's as if Berkeley were the capital of California. It'd just be a strange mix.  You know what I'm saying?  Can you dig where I'm coming from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sort of. Austin for a time was...  Not Austin. Austin was a democratic state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Texas. No, when he had Ann Richards. Great governor, Ann Richards.  Thought the world to her.  I'll never forget going...  There was some South by Southwest going to visit the Capitol building there.  The Statute of Slavery. It was great.  I'll never forget that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm sorry.  Did I say slavery? I meant states' rights.  What am I saying?  I am so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've taken some of those down and we just had a thing where we renamed a couple of our elementary schools from Robert E. Lee to something else.  So we're getting there.  Wow.  It was problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So how was life without Uber and Lyft there, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I just took...  We just went out for a while and I took a site called Fasten.  And that was really nice.  And the driver gets most of the revenue there.  How is that allowed though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought Austin made it illegal to do that kind of thing, right, Sharon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Austin isn't...  They have a month to get their fingerprinting.  And Austin actually wasn't actively pushing for Uber or Lyft to follow the regulations.  They just were like, hey, look, we want to come to terms and set something up that's tenable going forward.  And Uber and Lyft were like, well, we have written some legislation for you.  Oh, geez.  We were like, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They had a sniff it basically and said, that's it.  We're out of here.  And you'll see, you'll be sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we are because Paul Graham keeps making some snide comments about us and it hurts.  Oh, ow.  Austin is just sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Fasten is like F-A-S-T-E-N?  Fasten.  And then there's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's see.  I've got to look at the app.  Oh, where'd you go?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fasten like fasten your seatbelt.  Yeah.  Before you get in the car, fasten.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's the Austin ride share.  And then there is a Facebook group that I'm a member of.  So there's plenty of ways to get...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's Get Me...  It was really only over this background check issue.  And it didn't seem like the state was being unreasonable about it or the city was being unreasonable.  The city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The city.  It was that they also wanted the ability...  There were a couple other things in the Uber written legislation, like letting them stop  in lanes of traffic to discard passengers, to get off and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That seems like a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there were just some things that the city was trying to negotiate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Uber certainly...  I don't know about Lyft, but Uber has certainly in other locales been kind of chased out by  the incumbents, by the taxis and the medallion owners and so forth.  But they use that as a mantle of goodwill.  And sometimes it's not always the case that they really should probably do what Austin  asked them to do, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the city was willing to negotiate.  I don't think Uber would have liked all the things that they would have gotten.  So I can understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it wasn't about protecting the taxis this time.  Didn't the taxi companies back this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the taxi companies were part of this too.  Don't get me wrong.  It's not like a total citizen uprising or anything like that.  But you're surviving.  We're surviving.  It's a little less convenient.  If you're really trashed, you're going to have a hard time.  You're going to be like, why doesn't my Uber app work?  But other than that, you'll be okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My mom, who's 83, I set up with my credit card on her Uber account, but she still can't  figure it out.  Because I'll tell you why.  She's so used to calling for a cab.  And so she doesn't understand.  That's all you do is you open it and you say, get me a car and you can see it approach.  It doesn't register.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't get my parents to think about a smartphone at all.  How did you get your mom to use a smartphone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just kept giving them to her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what?  I'll tell you how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got her a, I think it was called a Cricket, one of the smartphones for the elderly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, like the jitterbug?  The jitterbug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it.  And she was so insulted.  I said, oh, well, how about a Galaxy Note 3?  I think it was.  And she loved it because she had a stylus so she could draw on it.  And now she's got an iPhone 6S Plus.  Loves it.  Loves it.  She's, you know, she's I think she feels like it's a way of staying connected with me to have a lot of technology because, you know, then she can call me and say, well, I can't.  Can you help me?  And then we get to talk.  So.  But I think it's a gadget freak.  Yeah.  See, I don't think I don't think it happens.  Jeff has an article.  This is what happened.  It's not quite an article.  This is where everybody loves Raymond.  Is that what this is from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, this should be.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I put Seinfeld in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, is it Seinfeld?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Listen, I wanted to talk to you about Deborah's birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  Talk about birthdays.  Your birthday gift to me finally came this morning.  Did you know you sent me a box of pears?  Yeah.  From a place called Fruit of the Month?  That's right. That's right.  How are they?  Oh, they're very nice pears.  But there's so many of them.  They're over a dozen pears.  What am I supposed to do with all those pears?  I think you're supposed to eat them.  Myself?  You, you and Dad and Robert.  How many pears can Robert eat?  I appreciate the thought, Raymond, but please don't ever send us any more food again.  That's what happens when I give my parents technology.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Don't ever do that again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the pilot for everybody loves Raymond, I'm told.  Nougat!  Nougat!  Triggering an avalanche of searches for what the hell is Nougat on Google.  Android N is going to be Nougat.  That was kind of what I thought it would be all along.  I'm glad it wasn't a brand name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was kind of ridiculous to make this whole hoo-ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, especially Hiroshi Lockheimer saying, I'm not telling you, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  And it wasn't going to be anything with nut.  Maybe they could have gotten something really creative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But no.  I like Nougat.  What's wrong with Nougat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, this is the mistake of doing what they did, which is making this big deal about it.  And just instead of saying it was going to be Android N is Nougat.  I mean, do you think that they got a lot of people contributing suggestions and all poured  over those suggestions, trying to figure out what the best one they knew it was going to  be Nougat all along?  Come on.  I think it would be nice to have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  bit of of diversity in this and pick something from some other nation other than the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is from a nation other than the U.S.  Do they call it a Nougat there?  Oh, my God.  Nougat's huge.  Nougat is is French and Italian.  It's not.  But do they call it Nougat?  Well, they call it Torrone.  Well, you see, that's my issue.  In Italy, they do call it Nougat in French.  Yeah.  All right.  German is Nougat.  OK, I'm going to get back.  I don't know.  In fact, I remember when I was a kid in 1967, we went to Europe and there was a town I can't  remember what the town was, which famous for Nougat in France.  Nougat was everywhere.  They had Nougat in the gas station.  Nougat was everywhere.  It is a European thing.  I think it's European.  I think this is very international.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's at least European.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sugar, honey, nuts, almond, walnut, pistachio, hazelnuts, your choice.  Sometimes there's candied fruit in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fruitcake of candies.  Oh, no, it's good.  You don't love Nougat?  Have you had Nougat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not a Nougat fan.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Torrone is great.  We used to, in fact, the local bodega when I was growing up had Torrone and we'd go in  there and get a Torrone, the Italian Nougat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yuck.  So then can we start speculating about O?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ah, good question, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess I was next.  Oreo.  Oreo.  No, see, brand name.  I think they learned from the Kit Kat that that was an Oreo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't Oreo special?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't it special how?  It's just an institution.  It's a wafer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's special.  It's special.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Nilla vanilla wafers would have been special too, but no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nilla wafers are not a dessert.  We have this argument in my house.  It's a cookie.  What is it?  It's a, I maintain that it is a cracker.  Nilla, no, no, you're wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you're wrong.  It's a dessert.  A cracker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is how I get my daughter's lunch with her school who doesn't let her have dessert.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're a cracker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She goes to a school that mandates that the lunch brought from home may not have a dessert  in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They can't have like cookies and sweets.  They encourage us not to bring them.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Aren't you right?  You're not in Texas, you're in San Francisco.  In Texas, states' rights would say no.  What the what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Again, I live in Austin.  It's like the Berkeley of Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a public school?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's a private school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's why.  Is it like one of them Waldorf schools that can't watch TV or nothing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  It's an international school.  Oh, it's international.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So at least they say it with a charming French accent.  That means students come from Austin and Houston.  You may not bring any dessert to school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course, but no dessert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm concerned about your accent.  I don't know what it is.  It's definitely foreign.  It's foreign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all that matters.  It doesn't really matter.  In fact, it's better if it's not definable in nationalities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just a generic foreign accent.  I do a lot of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In Malta, Nuget is known as Kubajd and sold in village festivals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In Greece, it's known as Mandolato.  Sicilian Nuget is Kubaita, Kupetta or Tarone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've now passed the line that I know way too much about Nuget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Nuget is a traditional French candy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, all right.  So it's a sop to the French.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Largely associated with the Christmas season.  Nougat.  That is not news.  That's just a story.  There's nothing much to say except that now we know.  They got us to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They got us to talk about it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Used again.  Google expands its ad tracking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course, it depends which article you read.  Nine to five, Google celebrated that it was opt-in.  Wired magazine said, uh-oh, Google expands its ad tracking.  Google expands its ad tracking, but yay, it's opt-in.  In fact, there's a new tool that you can use to change this.  It's My Activity, a page that bundles search history videos you've watched,  pages you've visited that serve Google ads.  There's a setting there.  If you opt into the setting, always when you visited Google pages,  Google included what it knows about you from search into the recommendations.  I did not know this, but they didn't apparently do that when you see Google  AdWords on other pages, third-party pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm surprised there hasn't been a furor over this.  I mean, it is good.  It's transparent.  I think it's great.  But people say, oh, my God, look at all they know about me.  Yes, because it's just very explicit.  This is what you did, and you can erase it, and there it is.  I think it's great.  But I'm waiting for the privacy panic to ensue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Oh, I was going to say, they've been super proactive with the opt-in,  with the transparency.  This is kind of exactly what a lot of the privacy people are calling for.  I agree.  So what would they complain about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I think some idiots will come along and say, oh, my God, look what's there.  Oh, well, I mean.  The same thing happened when people discovered Google Dashboard, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at all the things they know about me.  You're absolutely right, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is exactly what they should do.  I completely agree.  But privacy panic is idiocy.  I put up a story somewhere in here under Facebook of some stunt where you go into, you know,  Starbucks, you get a free coffee.  If you like the page, you tell them your first name and, oh, my God, look at all they know about you.  Yeah, it's on your public Facebook page.  What's the big deal?  But we can make a panic out of anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you go to myactivity.google.com.  Here it is.  Welcome to my activity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, we're going to see what Leo's done, aren't we?  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, apparently I searched for nougat.  This is interesting the way they spin this.  Rediscover the things you've searched for, visited and watched on Google services.  You're going to rediscover those.  And page two, we put data to work for you.  Your activity helps make Google experience faster, smarter and more useful.  So what could be wrong with that?  And page three, you're in control.  You can easily delete specific items or entire topics.  You can also change your settings and decide which data gets associated with your account.  So this is kind of like the dashboard, but very detailed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is. Oh, man.  Oh, I thought I was going to give me a time frame for how many quirky videos I have.  Wouldn't that be great?  It just says eight of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've watched eight corgi.  Do you have corgis?  No, I have a corgi mix.  When they wag their little tails and their butt wags with it because they're so stunted and deformed.  It's so adorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. My daughter loves them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I do too, actually.  My sister has two of them.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I visited.  So it's up to date because it's showing that I visited rideshare and Fasten.  Fasten, Fasten rideshare and com.android.yadayada.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've gone there three times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, see, this is the kind of thing you'd want to explore.  Like, what is that?  It's something obviously that happened on my smartphone.  Journal two times, Android calendar.  I'm kind of nervous about how deep I should go into my search history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can also show how you can erase one.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Under the three dots.  So here's the three dots.  I've been searching for free BSD workstations.  Details.  Details will show me like all of the searches.  OK.  And then I could do so.  I could. That gets pretty right.  It gets granular.  So I could say, well, you know, this one where I typed workstations without an O, let's delete that one.  Not that that will make any difference.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  So I, you know, when I played with it, I there was something I'd search for for a gift.  I wanted to think that I wanted this.  Yeah, I could think about nobody's going to go to the trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Like your Amazon recommendations.  All I'm seeing on mine is YouTube stuff, which is I feel like I went through what account.  My main account you usually use.  It is. Let's see what happens when I go to my other account.  One is work and one is but I, you know, it's Google.  It intermingles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, no, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, OK, it doesn't.  You're right.  Much to Jeff Chagrin.  Much to my chagrin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, don't get me started.  Get me started.  Niagara Falls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He wants it.  He wants it to bundle it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so some activity.  So 35 items, Android search now, video search, YouTube voice and audio.  So those are the kinds of searches it's showing.  And then you could delete any search.  And if you if you want more details, you can see what devices you used, why this was saved.  And this is basically going to be for ad.  Ad recommendations. Yes or no.  I mean, what?  So what? Also Google Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Google Now.  It'll also possibly feed into their machine learning stuff.  I mean, you could use it to make recommendations later on based on a person's individual habits like Google Now could say, hey, she really likes corgis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish it would tell me what Google what com dot Android that yada yada is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seemed to spend a lot of time there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you click on it and see without us knowing details?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think? It's dirty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't. I just like no, I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is all I can get is what time it doesn't even say which Android device app store for is it a app store for Android?  Oh, it's the app store.  Well, they should have a better name than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's a game on the app store.  Oh, it is.  Oh, I'm just looking up com dot Google dot yada yada on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting.  It's cool.  Tells you what videos you watch.  Yeah.  So on Sunday, we watched some videos from Don't Hug Me.  I'm scared.  It's showing me I saw those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's all Android L yada yada dot APK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think I have to look at see.  So you know what?  This is kind of like your your browser history, but it's not kept in the browser.  It's kept elsewhere, right?  So that could bother people, especially now that we know law enforcement is allowed to look at your browser history without a warrant.  This simplifies things for them because they don't have to ask me for my browser history or come to look at my computer.  They just go to Google and say, all right.  Now, I use Chrome.  Obviously, if you don't.  Well, I don't know.  If you go into a Google site, it should know that if you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I visited YouTube from somewhere else that would see it.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What goes down?  It's day by day.  So you can see how many videos you watched on any given day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's across all your devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently, that account Android search, but it's Google services.  It's interesting.  So where is the part where I can have to have?  That's what I need to find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, don't you have to you opt into using this for ads?  Here we go.  Opting out. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Activity controls from better commute options and maps to quicker results in search.  The data we save with your account.  Ah, so here we go.  Include Chrome browsing history and activity from websites and apps that use Google services.  That's checked.  Location history.  Device information.  That's a switch I can turn off.  Voice and audio activity.  This is one thing that does bother people.  The fact that it has all of the voice, all of the things you say after you say, OK, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  That was a big deal a couple days ago, weeks ago.  Really?  So fun.  Yeah.  People got upset because not only does it record it, they store it.  And everyone is like, Google can hear all of my voice text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  What did you think when you said, OK, Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm like.  I'm like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think so.  But Apple's making a big deal about, oh, we'll do this on device.  It won't get sent back to the server except Siri will.  And the difference is Apple doesn't tell you all the things Siri heard.  At least Google is exposing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's how Google gets better at understanding a variety of voices and everything else.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, the fact that they save it.  Yeah, I doubt Apple.  I don't know.  Maybe we don't know.  Apple doesn't say whether they save your Siri queries or not.  I don't know.  YouTube watches.  So I'm not sure.  So I'm not sure you can turn.  I don't see the thing where you opt in the new the new thing, but maybe I'm just not  looking at the right places.  As is often the case with privacy controls, there's there's.  On the one hand, you want granularity, but on the other hand.  Nobody's going to do it.  It's so granular that you don't even know what you're looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does provide cover for them.  Hey, you want to know what we're doing?  Here's what we're doing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you have to opt in, it should be whatever's turned off there.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, but everything's on.  So so I don't know what they're talking about.  What are you talking about?  They do say here we are committed to your privacy and security.  And look at the people have little blue shields.  They're hiding behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're hiding their data behind.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do not know who I am.  I'm because Google is hiding.  You do have to log into your account, obviously.  Every day data makes our see she removed the blue shield and now she's happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my web and app activity is paused.  So mine was already off.  My controls.  But I'm a pretty vigorous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat saying is it happy is in your security checkup, which I do.  You know, once while Google say you really ought to be doing your Google.  You know, security checkup.  And so let me let me run through that here.  This is the OK.  So that's why I couldn't see my anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But YouTube is because mine was already turned off.  There you go.  By default.  OK, unless you unless you turn it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I probably have turned it off, but I don't know if this is new or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never hear security checkup.  OK.  And then here is your connected devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those you might want to look through.  Looks good.  Or something looks weird.  OK.  And then check your account permissions.  Those are the things when you when you you log into a Google account in a browser  and it says, OK, remember this?  And that's the name you gave it.  It's quite a few of those.  Check your app passwords.  OK.  Check your two step verification settings.  OK.  I didn't get it.  Maybe maybe you should just turn your computer off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe maybe you should just turn yours off and then you'll stop seeing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I thought they said it was opt in.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I know anyway, it may be that it's not turned.  Oh, is it privacy checkup?  Is that the one I need to do?  Privacy checkup.  Sorry.  Again, with the granularity, more privacy.  OK.  And then this is your Google Plus profile.  Weird.  OK.  Next.  Oh, this is a connect with you.  These are all my phone numbers.  Next.  Choose who could see my location and how well they could see it.  Manage what you share on YouTube.  Jeebus.  Privacy.  Manage your Google Photos.  I probably have everything set to like just, you know, tell them every.  Ah, here we go.  Make ads more relevant to you.  Manage your ad settings.  Oh, look at that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I've been here once before because it always thinks I'm a guy who used to think  I was a guy like a really old guy.  What?  Because I read about tech in most of my websites that I visit skew mail.  That's interesting.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or they thought only old men like corgis.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  That's a common thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK.  See ads based on your interests.  OK.  With it on, this is what you get.  With it off, you're still going to see ads.  That's important.  But they won't be based on anything they know about you, which I see.  This is the thing that I always it's my it's my assertion that if ad recommendation engines  worked better, people would like the ads based on your interests turned on.  Well, that depends upon the ads that they have to serve and how messed up they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's true, too.  And the stupidity of the ads to the problem with retargeting when you've already bought  the damn boots you looked at at Amazon two weeks ago and they keep on selling you the  damn boots.  Well, let me ask you guys.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I have been seeing and I'm not sure if this is advertising or just Google trying  to be helpful.  But so whenever I've been searching for a computer bag and Google is like it on Google  now, it'll be like, hey, continue researching handbags, et cetera.  But now it's also telling me, hey, this particular bag you looked at is now on sale at 33 percent  off, which is the lowest price we've seen.  And then like the other day that happened to me and I was like, that's my bag that I've  been looking for.  So I bought it.  And I was like, that was really helpful to me.  But I'm curious if that was Google showing me was that a quote unquote ad or was that  just Google now getting aggressive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was there an action you could take like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I clicked on like I clicked on the little Google now card and it took me to Saks to  buy an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's interesting.  That's a really because up to now, I don't think anybody's ever said that Google now  had ads in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and that's what I because I didn't feel like it had.  It felt like it's helpful.  Nice, helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like a friend would do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I purchased something from it.  So I'm like, oh, and I would never have known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What did you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What did you say?  Who?  You?  Oh, no, I started.  I was speaking to which you see the share.  I thought you said son of a bitch.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should have done that while you were drinking.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Speaking of which, you talking to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What did you say?  Did I hear what I thought I heard you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Did you see the shared endorsement setting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I did see it, but I went right by it.  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go back to the activity controls under under my activity.  Go to shared endorsements.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook got in trouble for this once upon a time.  This was this I don't like where this says you liked this.  So I'm going to show Jeff Jarvis because you're his friend that you liked it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you're and you can appear in ads.  So this is your place where you can turn that off.  That's the one thing I would turn off.  Don't put my name in an ad.  I didn't know Google was doing that.  I didn't either.  So go look, go to that.  You're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you there?  It takes me a while.  I got to go.  I can't remember where it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I go back to my activity dot Google dot com.  Yeah.  I'll go to the activities and I go to controls.  I'll go to the bottom of the page.  Yeah.  And besides Google Plus.  Oh, remember that?  It says shared endorsements, shared endorsements.  So now it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't mind that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, now go down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This isn't as bad as the way Facebook was doing it.  In ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In ads.  And you can turn that off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if you're looking at summertime spas and your friend Katya Klinikova says it's a nice  spa, you would like to know that, wouldn't you?  In their Yelp review?  Yeah, I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess if you're recommending, you are recommending to the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is finding your review somewhere.  All right.  All right.  I don't know if I'd mind that.  All right.  By the way, it's it's off by default because mine's not checked based on my activity.  Google may show my name and profile photo and shared endorsements that appear in ads.  Mine is that I've never seen this before.  I don't think I've turned it off.  Mine was unchecked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, people would be livid if that happened.  Imagine if you had a sponsorship deal with Nike, but you.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could cost me money.  Yeah, that's a good point.  If you're under 18, you may see shared endorsements from others, but your own name and profile  will not be paired with shared endorsements in ads and other contexts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So yeah, on the ad settings, it says that it does not a mail age.  It says question mark and it gives me no chance to tell them how old I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's funny.  You wouldn't you want it when you wanted to have that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a Google Plus setting.  It looked like it was because when I went.  It's related to Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  There you go.  That's the everything you ever want to know about Google ad tracking.  But we're afraid to ask.  Rumor persists that Google is going to do not a new Nexus, but it kind of its own phone.  I'm not sure exactly how that differs.  The Nexus is devices have all along been built by other companies.  LG and Huawei, the Nexus five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the last time the technology Telegraph had a prediction, it was all messed up.  This is wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe James Titcom says Google's planning a shake up of the smartphone market, but releasing its own handset.  Now, there are some arguments for this.  I mean, I can see why Google might want to do that.  We have even seen leaked shots of the new Nexus phone.  I think Ron Amadeo and Ars Technica had some leaked shots.  Google wants to control its own destiny a little bit, I think.  Right.  And if it does its own phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  From a security point of view, its own phone and having a Nexus phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a little unclear in my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple has the manufacturing done by another company.  What's the big deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Obviously, Google is not going to have a factory in Mountain View.  No.  But in the past, it sounds like it's a little bit of a looser connection like LG with the 5X or Huawei with the 6P.  Google would say we would like to design it like this, but those are very different looking phones.  I mean, the 6P very much looks like a Huawei phone and the 5X very much looks like an LG phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does Google give them specs and let them source the hardware?  And this could be a way for them to control specifically what chips and firmware and everything else?  Possibly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get the feeling that Google lets these companies design it themselves.  That's why the distinctive design.  I think this would give Google 100% design control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they've been working with a chip company called Movidius to put the embedded vision in their phones.  And as you start working towards VR, that could be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and clearly Google has some influence because most recent Nexus phones have the fingerprint reader on the back.  That's kind of unique to both of them.  And that's a Google thing.  But on the other hand, they have other things that look more like Huawei or more like LG.  This is the Ron Armati article on the 2016...  Now he still calls it a Nexus.  Kind of two-tone. We're not sure if that's shiny plastic, but people seem to think it's glass up top.  So that the radios can get through and the camera can get through.  Notice no camera bump, which people are applauding.  Android Police has created a render.  This is a render from the Android Police based on the leaks.  Five inch device called Sailfish.  Five and a half inch device called Marlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, this is saying HTC is going to design it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it doesn't have an HTC logo on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, because I loved HTC Sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it would definitely not have Sense on it.  It would not have Sense.  Yeah, I mean, clearly that's not going to happen.  Do you have an HTC 10? Is that your current...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I've got a Nexus 5X, but I had an HTC.  I miss it still. I really like the Sense UI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought Sense was pretty nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I like the Moto.  In the Moto X, you know, they had that like shape to put the flashlight on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, is there all things you're not going to see, I think, in a Google phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. I'm like, I want to design my own phone with all my favorite features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm really loving the OnePlus 3. The more I use it, the more I feel like this is the phone.  Especially at that price.  And I'm not even price sensitive because I have to buy them all no matter what.  But boy, it's easy for me to recommend this to anybody who's spending their own money.  What's your favorite bit of it?  Well, it's just a clean... it's very pure, clean Android phone.  It's very fast, has an excellent camera.  I like a metal body. It's got an HTC style aluminum body.  I would not recommend the plasticky shells.  I bought one and I thought, this is terrible. I don't use it.  People were complaining about the screen. It's an LCD screen, but it's very good.  I don't think it lacks anything compared to my Galaxy S7.  And it's M equivalent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's what equivalent?  M equivalent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's their OS, which is Oxygen, which is as far as I can tell, virtually indistinguishable from M, Android 6.  It even says Android 6.  In fact, there's a new update that's just coming out right now. I haven't got it yet.  It's Android 6.0.1.  There was some question about whether they were going to keep up with the security patches.  Mine is currently security patched through June 1st, which is pretty common.  If I get the July security patch, then that will reassure me.  That will let me know that OnePlus plans to keep it up.  There's no reason not to recommend this phone at $400.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me know if you get your security patch and then I might go get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will. I for sure will. There's no reason why they wouldn't do it, especially since Oxygen is such a pure version of Android.  Six gigs of RAM, and apparently one of the things the patch does is allow full use of that.  It doesn't right now use it or seem to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think this is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When is N supposed to be released?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fall. Probably with these new nexuses.  Nexci.  Nexci.  Is it Latin?  I guess it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a product of the Texas Public School Board. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But hey, on the bright side, you got dessert in your lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you think about evolution there, Stacey?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you grow up in Texas? You're a Texan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a straight up Texan.  Nice.  I even moved to New York and moved back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because those New Yorkers, they got New York values, if you know what I mean.  Yeah, we do.  Yeah, we know what you mean.  Our show today brought to you by the Ring Video Doorbell. Stacey knows all about these.  But you never did install one. You had a different companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did install the Ring. I didn't do the Ring Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Well, the Ring Pro is cool because it's essentially the same as the Ring.  But if you already have a wired doorbell, you don't need the battery that's in the original Ring.  Which makes it compatible in any environment. You could put it on a bedroom door, which is what I was thinking.  But what this does is replaces your existing door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, you're going to put it on your bedroom door?  Who's there?  Knock before coming in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Ring the doorbell, kids.  Mommy and Daddy are having nap time.  And that way you can see who's at your door.  We have it on our front door, but I can think of all sorts of applications.  Actually, one of the things I want to do is put it in the back door, too.  But now they've got the Ring, what do they call it? The Stick Up Cam, which is kind of a weird name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought so, too.  It's like the Stick Em Up Cam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not the Stick Em Up, but the Stick.  Because the reason is it doesn't need any wires.  In fact, if you get the solar panel, it doesn't need power even.  And it has not the same camera, but also a speaker and a microphone.  So you can talk to people in the backyard or wherever else.  So this way you get full coverage. You get the front door with the Ring Video Doorbell.  You get the back door with the Stick Up Cam.  And with their chime, you're never going to miss a doorbell ringing ever again.  They have optional cloud video recording for all their devices,  which means you can capture and share video with family and friends or law enforcement.  There's a robotic dog at my door.  I love this. I'll tell you what.  I was mentioning this earlier.  The UPS guys have just decided in our neighborhood to stop leaving packages on the porch  because they say there's too many robberies.  I guess there's been a slew of robberies.  But that's okay because I got the Ring Video Doorbell.  So if they left it on the porch, I could monitor it.  But better yet, when he comes to the door and I'm not there,  what they were doing is just leaving and taking the package with them  and saying you can get it at the UPS store.  So now what I do is say, no, I'm in here. Just leave it there. I'll be right out.  Or put it in the bushes. It'll be safe. Whatever.  But I don't miss packages anymore. And I can keep an eye on them.  It is a great, great idea.  The Ring Video Doorbell. We've got kind of a bundle here for you.  The Ring Security Bundle Kit.  Or the Pro Bundle Kit if you don't need the battery.  Both kits come with the stick-up cam, the solar panel, the chimes.  You get everything you need. They call it their Ring of Security Bundle.  $50 off when you go to ring.com slash twig.  R-I-N-G dot com slash twig.  $50 off for a limited time for this week in Google Listeners.  This is the one that Richard Branson put, he led a $28 million investment into Ring.  He must have known not just about the doorbell, he must have known about the other stuff they were doing, like the stick-up cam.  There's a cool story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Jamie, the CEO of Ring, actually met Richard Branson several years before he had the doorbell company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because Jamie pitched something in Shark Tank, right?  He did. This is a Shark Tank thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Jamie pitched, before he was even at Ring, when he was a 20-something-year-old baby entrepreneur,  he ran into Richard Branson in a hotel in Germany or some crazy place and was like,  oh my God, you're my hero, you're great.  And Richard Branson was like, hey, send a note to my room.  And I'd love to talk to you when I get back to.  But it was a total misconnection.  So Jamie was telling me about this when they got the funding from Richard Branson.  That's so cool.  I was like, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google Chrome now comes with Google Casting baked right in.  That's as of 51.  Makes sense. I wasn't this done ages ago.  Right. Right. Crazy.  Did you? Chrome 52, I'm sorry.  No, I'm sorry. It is 51.  Chrome 52, which is already on the horizon. It's in the beta channel.  Looks like you'll be able to cast a tab into a video hangout, which would be really cool.  Here's what I'm watching. Yeah.  Wouldn't that be cool? That would be it.  You'll have to enable cloud services first.  Cloud services allow you to share the contents of your browser tab of your desktop with other users through services like Google Hangouts.  But you must sign into Chrome and turn that option on.  Nice.  So Chromecast, I think Chromecast is awesome.  I don't have much else to say about it.  So do we want to talk about? Yes, will we? Something. Anything.  Anything. I feel a little lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to talk about the Wi-Fi kiosks from sidewalk labs and sensors?  Shoot, yes. What is it?  Because, well, OK, so this was from Recode and a bunch of other stories this last week because Alphabets company,  Sidewalk Labs, is putting in or applied to put in smart city infrastructure in Columbus, Ohio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is not like the ones in New York, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so it is. So that's part of a consortium that part of a consortium that backed a company  that put those in. It's really complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they've got a hundred. Have you used these yet, Jeff? They have a hundred and thirty four link NYC kiosks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I remember I did a speed test on it. It was very good. I can't remember what it was.  But again, you're standing on the street corner with your phone out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they old public phone booths? Is that what they're converting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, not the booths. They're the old connectivity to them.  But they had to rerun fiber and all kinds of stuff to them.  So they're basically the hole in the sidewalk where they can put them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They hundreds more are on the way this summer and they plan to have seven thousand to ten thousand in the next five years.  No, I'm sorry. Five years. They're going to twenty twenty four in the next seven years.  I think it wasn't they weren't wired up when I was in New York last, but I did know on 8th Avenue, for example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now they're working. Yeah, they have a keyboard.  But can you imagine this is going to be the scuzziest keyboard you ever want to not touch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the knuckle typing. But what's cool about them is the sensors.  So the New York ones don't have the sensors.  They have the cameras in them. But people were like, oh, no, no, do not record me on the public street, which I totally get.  But the new ones they're pitching have like air quality sensors. They have vibration sensors.  They have a bunch of sensors.  And so I'm really keen on the idea of adding all this like super granular data about, again, air quality and things cities want to know.  And I actually saw this demo of vibration sensors on a streetlight from Busan in South Korea.  And they actually had it. So if someone hit the streetlight, it would send a vibration signal and a camera would turn on and it would show like if someone was injured or hurt.  So it was kind of like instead of like those police call boxes, you could just hit a piece of street furniture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These have big 911 emergency buttons on them.  What I didn't know is it also gives you free calling to any number in the country.  So it's a phone booth with free long distance.  That's going to touch that keyboard. That's pretty cool.  That's pretty cool. Two USB charging ports in case you want to just hang out.  An audio jack for headphones and unlimited.  They were saying gigabit. I don't know if it is gigabit. Internet. Very fast internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somebody's going to stand there and watch a movie with the headphones on and charge their smartphone.  By the way, if you're going to make a phone call, then it's going to be a.  Everybody's going to hear your call, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you put on your headphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about I mean that what about all the people who?  Well, it's a scam, but there are also legitimate people who are like my phone's out of battery.  Can I use your phone to make a call?  And you're like, you have to make the go use the kiosk, buddy.  Yeah, exactly. Now you can be a jerk without being a jerk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I remember looking into the security they're using.  And it's actually now I'm not Steve Gibson, but it looked to me to be very good.  When you first join it, it sends you a token that you use to join it.  That makes your your connection unique.  Nobody can spy on your connection.  You have a token that you're sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So like no man in the middle attack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. Well, that was the design.  Whether you know, again, I'm not a Steve Gibson, so I'm sure I will.  I'm willing to venture. These are going to be the most hacked or people will attempt to hack these quite a bit given the capabilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the reason I thought this was interesting is because at the bottom of the recode story, they talk about this being a hard sell.  And I met with the CIO of the city of Chicago and we actually started talking about chaos.  And she is totally not sold on them because they feel like a very temporary, like two or three years solution.  And they're concerned about, you know, vandalism and having all this infrastructure to maintain.  And so I was just kind of curious.  I'm curious. Y'all's thoughts about kiosks and is really that the way that we want to usher in the 21st century?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to defer to Jeff because he's a New Yorker here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it gets me Philadelphia.  You remember back about, oh, God, now six years, seven years, Philadelphia was going to do major Wi-Fi around the whole city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tom Cast and Verizon went to the state legislature and gave him a bunch of money and said, can you overturn?  Can you make a rule against that? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it was going to power communications and emergency vehicles. Amazing.  The thing about it is that if you want to bring people online, let's say in a poor neighborhood, doing it on the street doesn't really do them any good.  You've got to do it somehow into their home. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think this is not such an altruistic venture.  As the Recode article points out, they estimate each kiosk will generate thirty thousand dollars in advertising revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that's what the city opt-ins opts into it, though.  And that's another reason why I think these are kind of a weird.  Is it basically like a billboard that has extra sensors at high level?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love the sensors. I mean, not only can they monitor air quality, they can monitor street noise.  You can see how much bike and car traffic is pedestrian traffic.  I mean, I think I don't think that's an intrusion. I think that that's potentially very useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the city, right? I wrote about I did a story on Medium.  Are we ready for naked transparency? And this was again from Busan.  They actually measured on streetlights noise pollution and they made the data very open.  And apparently all the people who had property and noisy districts complained because they were like it was lowering their property.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can't sell our house. Oh, too bad. Oh, that was my reaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the city actually decided that they needed to make that data harder to get to.  And so they changed the data formatting. So these people would feel better.  Oh, there's the streetlight. See, if you hit it, it will send a message to police.  That's really interesting. So I just thought that was really kind of fun because, you know, I can see my neighborhood being like, oh, my God, we're too noisy or there's too many coyotes being tracked.  No one will want to live here anymore. Well, but sorry, but that's fact. That's factual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I really don't. I think when I think if it's factual and it's city owned information, I think the public has a right to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's we have a right to that. I mean, I wish there's all kinds of terrorist related air sensors in some ways in New York.  I wish that data were public. Maybe it is. I don't know. I haven't seen any of that.  Yeah, it's data. It's public. This is my as long as it's occurring in the public, the public and the public's paying for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you could make a case that there's some things like information about terrorist activity that need to be kept secret for security reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but I think I think cameras. I mean, listen, if you look at some of the horrible Turkey, the horrendous tragedy of the Turkish airport and Istanbul, the security cameras,  the fact that there are security cameras and you can see the people that matters to our security. I'm OK with that.  Around New York, there are amazing systems that if a bullet goes off, the police can zoom in on it right away.  And I'm OK with that. It's public. It's in the public. If you do something in the public, the public has the right to know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the shot spotter, I don't know if they're using shot spotter, which is the gunshot.  They've got sensors measuring gunshot and they tell police where the gunshots are.  They triangulate it. Thank you.  That data isn't always available because that's one of the things the Chicago CIO was telling me is they don't have access to some of that data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Only the police department gets it. Not necessarily. I mean, I can understand making an argument that that's not a good idea.  You know, that's there's some stuff for you could you can make reasonable security purposes should be kept, you know, maybe after the fact later or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, the point is, once we start having this information, it's it's going to change a lot of things.  And the question is, does it change things for the better? Like it promotes action, like everyone's like, oh, look, the air is really polluted over in our poorest, saddest district.  Maybe we should do something about that. Or is it just going to create a bigger divide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My argument, Stacey, is that we should never try to control knowledge, that more information and more knowledge is we should assume is a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you have to balance that with privacy and security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What you do with that knowledge is a different matter. But to control the knowing of something is antithetical to a modern society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Again, balancing with privacy concerns of individuals. That's the issue of what you do with it.  And security. So if you have bomb sniffing sensors in the subway, you may not want everybody to know that.  If you know, you know, something about individuals, you may want, you know, if you have a kiosk out out front of an adult theater, you don't want to necessarily publish the video of everybody going into the adult theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Adult theater, maybe you do. I don't know. I feel like you should. Now they could just watch the porn on the kiosk outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what a moron. Why are you going to adult theater? Yeah. Come on. I feel like this is very Blade Runner, the idea of these kiosks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You see, but that's that's an emotional, creepy argument. No, I like it. I mean, that's I just I just read. It's emotional, but I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Far had Farhad Banjoo just wrote a piece in The Times today that just had me gritting my teeth. He's becoming quite the Luddite.  Oh, well, so so is my good friends at The Guardian. I got to say at the Times, all the major publications are it's now the vogue to be against technology.  So in recognition of Alvin Toffler's death, we need futurists. We need futures because the future is coming too fast.  Who says it's not coming fast enough, man? Let's get that future here now.  Yeah, let's let's cure for a few more diseases. Let's spread more information. Let's educate more people. Let's connect more of the world. Geez.  And and and just the whole of the future is bad. Let's make America great again. That's what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't email me. Yeah. Don't don't email me. How much does as a professor of journalism, I'm asking you, how much does the public zeitgeist inform what the journalist is writing about? It is far hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I think. Why? Very good point. Sure. To the I mean, I think that the at a cynical level, Leo, I have seen publications, you know, news organizations now.  That at a very literal level, watch trends and then go and rewrite articles based on all those trends things.  That's demand media. That's just right. Exactly. Well, that's happened all over in ways that are more subtle now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what worries me is the more subtle thing where you you let you let I guess it's always the case. So right. You're in a business. You're trying to generate traffic and views or you also get feedback loops of another sort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. You know, you're right. You write a lot. I piece like that. You write a techno panic piece like that. And I'm like guaranteed there'll be lots of tweets and emails saying, yeah, yeah, good. And then you can say, well, this is the right public wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a look at all the reaction I got. I guess it's true. It's obvious. And I've been in media long enough to know that there's certainly a great temptation to do that.  I always argue against doing it because I feel like it's the tail wagging the dog that was boring to it's what it's boring because it becomes uniform. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  It's just telling people what they already think. Yeah. In some ways, don't you want media that challenges your beliefs? And? Well, maybe no. No one. No one. No one wants that. I'm serious. Like, no one wants. They want something that will either validate their thinking. Yeah, no, you're right.  In many cases, I shouldn't say no, I subscribe to I subscribe to magazines of political thought that are completely opposite of mine because I want to I want to I want to be challenged. I want to I don't want to just sometimes it makes me mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was I was my parents the last two days and helping them pack and all kinds of things. So the and plus they watch Fox News. So we don't want the TV on at all at all. Right. There's no TV news. Nothing. We're busy for three days. I did really enjoy the respite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is this is a bad year for politics. So I don't play. Our 13 year old does it? He just goes he does not want to hear the word Trump. He doesn't want to hear the word Clinton and I can I can completely understand that it's kind of it becomes overloaded.  I'm a I'm a political junkie, though. I like I've and I and I love these conversations. I really love the you know, a lot of times a lot of people on triangulation. I disagree with and I love the conversation. Because I want to hear the other people's points of view. I do too. But yeah, but we're in the we're the few, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe maybe it's an American thing. I've got a friend of mine from Germany. We go out sometimes and he's like, every time the conversation gets interesting, everyone skirts away right talks about something else and politics, religion, sex. Those are the three most interesting things you can talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I was talking to a professor at MIT and they're looking to do a conference I'm not sure when on what you can't talk about.  Oh, I love that. What a great conference. It is a great, great idea. And let's let's let's talk about what we can't talk about. And what's the impact of that in discussion and in the academia and in politics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room says I want to construct a belief system that's robust enough to face its critics. I like that.  And maybe modify it.  You can't back down on the internet. No, no.  Yeah. When I find myself when I find myself kind of knee jerk reacting to something I actually I take note and say, wait a minute.  Well, you also you this is part of what drives some of your fans crazy. They don't see when you are doing the contrarian piece to have a better discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, partly that's because I'm capable of seeing also many sides to an argument, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you also do it for the sake of the show.  Well, I do it for the sake of the show. But it's also my it's also kind of my bed. I mean, to a fault. I you know, if you say, you know, I'm going to I'm a murderer.  I would say, well, you know, there may be some justification for that. You know, and I don't know why, but that just to a fault.  I I I I.  But but it's a unique property. Not only that, not only you see it, but you're not afraid to argue the devil's advocate position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, the show. But I can do it with shows. I can do it with often with.  With least empathy. Yeah. With some real empathy for the for that position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And you do a very good job of that. That's what makes the shows special, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But some so you and I will go at it sometimes. And I know what you're doing.  So we'll we'll we'll we'll both play our. Yeah. And you'll have to learn this to Stacy that sometimes I might I might say something that you think reprehensible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I would just leave it on leave it on that every time he does it. Oh, that was Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you may you just will never know if I believe it or not. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's basically everyone on the Internet. So we're good. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is normal. Fearing surveillance man shot at Google and set a self-driving car ablaze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, now this is OK. My empathetic instinct says the guy's crazy.  It's called paranoid schizophrenic.  He told police he feared surveillance by Google. Google and he's been arrested in charge with arson after one of the company's self-driving car.  He told police he feared surveillance by Google. Google and he's been arrested in charge with arson after one of the company's self-driving cars was destroyed in attack in June.  And then he started. He was hanging around the campus in Mountain View after midnight in the car.  He had homemade explosives and good Lord, a pipe bomb and the firearms.  And oh, my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Never go into the dentistry business because people will think that you've installed transmitters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, there's you know, that's I mean, that's a sad situation.  I think it's dangerous, too, but very dangerous. We're lucky nothing more serious happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it was his third time. What I thought was it kind of proved his well, it proved him wrong in some ways because it was his third attempt to and they never knew to blow up a car.  So they caught him on surveillance video. But if they were truly stocky, they probably would have stopped him sooner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, we're that good. Yeah. Why didn't you know that was going to happen?  It's an old psychic joke. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More on tap translate, discover and improved search by image.  This from the Google inside search blog today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you use now on tap?  Only by accident. I don't think I'll be only only for the show of I used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's when you're on a page and you hold the home button down a little extra and a little screen comes up.  Now you can do translate translate any text on the screen.  If you're on Google Maps and you come across a location, a restaurant review in a foreign language, just hold it down.  You can even do multiple languages at once.  Let me try English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Russian.  Although the example they're giving is in Japanese, so I don't know what that means.  Discover more interesting content.  Tap the discover icon and get a stream of visual content related to what's on your screen.  So they're showing Earth may an article Earth may have a second moon.  According to NASA, you do now on tap, press and hold the home button.  And of course, you have to have marshmallow for this and you'll get a whole bunch of looks like.  Probably is. Yeah, they're not all YouTube, though.  There's some Yahoo videos in there. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This this looks like somebody like I would have the worst time with this.  I'm the type of person who used to go to the dictionary to look up words and end up reading everything else.  It's for you. I would never get anything done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This features for you. No search by image barcodes and QR codes.  So you can use now on tap to search via your camera app for objects like famous landmarks.  And now they're including barcodes and QR codes.  So the next time you're shopping, if you see a QR code or a barcode, you point your camera at it and you'll get helpful cards related to that object, such as user reviews.  It will work with packaged products, books, DVDs and more women.  So what do I do? I just do I.  Do I. OK, here's a barcode.  Do I have to have the camera going?  And then press and hold now and tap.  And yes, it did. It's looking it up. Oh, my gosh.  That was cool. Do you have the over the shoulder?  Because we can do it again. I can I can do it again.  So I say, oh, there's a barcode. Let's press and hold the hold the home button.  You see now and tap encircled it and it looked it up.  And there it is. That's what I'm looking at.  Can you scroll up and see like lower pricing or anything else?  It offers Google Discover Shopping, YouTube or share.  Let's tap the shopping icon and then it's going to pull up Google Shopping.  And yes, I can shop for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Leo, go, for example, the New York Times site.  OK, let's try to hold down the button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, hold on. You're trying to figure out the logic of this.  New York Times. I'm on the New York Times site.  OK, should I hold down the button?  OK, let's hold down the button.  Hold down the now and discover.  Now, I've never seen discover before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So go to discover and it's kind of a somewhat related but random story.  Yeah, I was looking at Hillary Clinton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rough day for Clinton sends wave of regret through the GOP.  And I got Bill Cunningham's obituary after I pressed discover.  What is your Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I go to Twitter and I get Hillary Clinton.  Because the story is about Hillary. OK, fine.  It seems to be just random New York Times stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let me actually go into a story.  This is open with the New York.  Oh, now I'm going to. Should I do it in the New York Times app or Chrome?  You can see what happens.  Oh, I see. Oh, maybe you could do it.  I think I can. That's the whole point of now and tap, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly. Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So wouldn't that be kind of cool?  You're reading an article and you say, I want to see some opposing points of view.  Now it gave me now and tap gave me Hillary Rodham Clinton.  So click on Twitter. You're going to get her Twitter account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's a nice way to quickly find somebody's account.  I think that could be useful.  As with a lot of this stuff, you've got to be trained to think of it.  Yeah, trained.  I like the barcode thing. That's great.  That is that's super helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if it's image search, I'm curious because you know how Pinterest just did their whole image search stuff where you can hold your phone up and take a picture of something or sorry, search by image for similar things in Pinterest.  It's not with your phone.  That would be very useful, actually.  It is. It's too.  And if you think about it, it could give you, you know, it could.  Does it do? Let's say, all right, I'm going to look at this mouse.  I mean, this is a very distinctive mouse. If it does image recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, see nothing.  Okay, because I was like, if you could do image recognition, then think about all the cool stuff you could do.  Would that be great? Well, they say for landmarks, you can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if I'm standing in front of a landmark in the Washington Monument and do it, it'll say, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's a database thing as opposed to like actual computer vision.  So that's a nice way to do it.  But they're getting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, come on.  It's progress. It's progress.  Come on, future. Hurry up.  Forget Monju.  Don't listen to Farhad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hurry up, future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Future. Future.  Come here. Come here, future.  Was it field trip or Google goggles where you could?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is like years ago where you could hold up your phone and see where you were in the world.  Like Google would give you data about Google goggles.  I don't think they even have Google goggles anymore.  Yeah, but that's what this sounds like. Right.  Because all right, they said, let me try it with your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody said, try it with a face.  You think it would do? No, it's not going to do that because that would just that would enable creeping.  Yeah, no, it doesn't do that.  But you know, you know, it could though, right?  Oh, yeah, it could easily say, oh, that's Stacey Higginbotham.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Oh, yeah.  It could easily say, oh, that's Stacey Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have her picture in her Google Plus profile.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish it would do that, to be honest with you.  Yes.  Speaking as an old man with no memory, I would be very useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hold on a second. Just stay there.  Oh, hi, George.  We went to school together.  I see you have two children.  That would be so useful.  You must have this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You must have this problem.  No, because then that happens.  All the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you don't know whether you really know the word.  You wouldn't believe how many people come here, and with all,  and don't mind this, and say, do you remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was at the cottage five years ago.  It happens to me almost every day.  And I always say, oh, yeah, it's nice to see you again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did I tell you how the affectation,  when I was a columnist in San Francisco,  and God bless them, they had my face on news boxes  and news trucks for a while, right?  Wow.  And nose-sized.  Wow.  So people would come up and say, hi, Jeff.  Is that when you worked at the Examiner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I remember that.  Yeah, with those people.  Yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's fame and glory, huh?  So the problem was that if you say hi to someone,  it contains an ellipsis.  Like, hi, Leo.  Right.  Right?  Right.  I can't say hi, so I started saying, howdy.  Because you don't say, howdy.  Very Californian.  You just say, howdy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did they say howdy in Austin?  Howdy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Howdy-o.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, Goggles is still around.  I apologize.  It is.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it does the same thing.  It has search from camera, get Goggles results for pictures you take.  If you've enabled location in the Settings app,  as well as in Google Settings, they will send location data.  Okay.  So now it does.  You take a picture or something, and it'll figure out where you...  Will it recognize your logo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, there's a lot of things wrong here from a Google perspective.  Although, did it put me in glasses?  It did put you in glasses, which is really weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really weird.  Do your own face.  I'm installing it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Should I do it?  OK, I'll do my own face.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can push yourself.  We are such idiots.  God, people turn in the show to learn something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Instead, we're going, hey, here's this five-year-old program we've done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Five-year-old program we've just rediscovered.  Look what it'll do.  Yeah, Leo, it did that five years ago, you nitwit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  The next show will stick hats and funny filters over our faces.  Done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Been there.  Done that.  I should do it to you, Jeff, because it probably...  You can do it to me.  Would you think it would think you're a woman?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Probably.  No, it'll think I'm dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was like, not with that beard, I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Amish, this is very odd.  Wait a minute, I'm going to do you again, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to do you again, Stacy.  I think I'm about to be humiliated again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just feel we could do better.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe if I just took it straight on instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like how it does this analyzing.  Oh, I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm still a boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's, you know, yeah, are you worried about Google search results?  I don't think so.  Can I do a picture of me?  Wait a minute.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's hard to do.  Okay.  Do you have to use the rear camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't seem like I could turn it around.  It's not for, it's not made for selfies.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, that's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we're going to retire this application.  Okay.  Yeah, that's me.  That's me right there in a nutshell.  Yeah, that's me.  All right.  So Google goggles, not so great.  That's so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's so great.  Or we're just, we're just not landmarks.  That's, that's the challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It worked with, what's weird is it worked with the Twitter logo.  Yeah.  I think you have to be a landmark or maybe I wonder, I should take a picture of a famous  person with this and see if they, they're recognized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll put up George Clooney and it will put up me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be pretty impressive.  I don't know how George would feel about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like screenshot that and give it to Jeff.  It would make his day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google did recently buy a image recognition company from France.  Two weeks after Twitter acquired Magic Pony in a little bit of confusion over the name  because I think Twitter probably thought it was a magic pony.  That was for machine learning.  Google has announced its acquired mood stocks, which is a startup out of Paris that develops  machine learning based image recognition for smartphones.  Shazam for images.  They call it kind of interesting mood stocks.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That, that would give it the AI ability to have you take a photo of something and be  like, oh bam, here's other things that are this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, this kind of what we were just doing.  But maybe Google realized it could do a little bit better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like mood stocks.  We'll, we'll make sure I'm not the person with monster tattooed on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  That is just, wow.  Here's that wonderful euro cookie privacy statement that appears everywhere I go.  That's really, you know what?  I feel so much better now that those sites have those.  Let's see.  Wi-Fi kiosks.  We did that 10 million Android devices are infected with Chinese malware.  Well done.  Mostly not in U.S.  But I guess something to be aware of.  You have to go to a third party store, I believe.  The malware called Hummingbird actually comes from a Chinese ad company.  Let me turn off my audio.  I don't know.  I hate auto start videos.  Thank you, CNET.  It's a team of developers at a company called Ying Mob, which is an otherwise legitimate  advertising analytics agency based in Beijing.  But they apparently have a team responsible for developing malicious components.  The development team for overseas platform, 25 employees, HummingBad, not Hummingbird,  I'm sorry.  HummingBad, it was a drive-by download in which phones were infected when people visited  websites.  So I guess you didn't have to install intentionally.  The first component attempts to gain root access on a device with a root kit that exploits  multiple vulnerabilities, probably the stage fright, I would guess, vulnerability.  But I'm not sure if successful attackers gain full access to a device.  If that fails, the second component uses a fake system update notification, tricking  users into granting HummingBad system level permissions.  It generates fraudulent advertising revenue through the forced downloading of apps and  clicking of ads.  And researchers say Checkpoint, which discovered this, said they're making about $300,000 a  month, they would guess, on doing this.  Most of the victims in China and India, 1.6 million in China, 1.35 million in India, Philippines,  Indonesia, Turkey.  The US, though, has 228,800 infected devices.  The UK and Australia, fewer than 100,000.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And coming from a legitimate company, that's what's really interesting.  They actually have a division to do this kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what are the best practices right now for security on my phone, for example?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Getting a phone, and you nailed it, Stacey, when you said it, that does the Android monthly  security update.  OK.  And Samsung does it.  LG does it.  I'm pretty sure HTC does it.  That was one of the, in fact, pretty much the only question mark on this OnePlus.  OnePlus has not yet said whether they plan to.  There was some question about it.  But I notice I'm up to date through June.  I would, I'll let you, I mean, I would guess in the next week I'll get the July update.  If that's the case, then this would be another one.  And the reason is, there are issues.  Most of those, I would almost guarantee most of those affected phones, and the reasons  so big in China and India are inexpensive phones that have not been updated ever.  And they're running older versions of Android.  Although, you know, there's, there's, you know, there is a way to tell if you have hummingbad.  CNET has a, a article, how to kill hummingbad.  How can I turn this off?  Auto play off. Thank you.  Thank you CNET. I want to watch your video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there not an app that lets you just stop, like, kind of like ad blocker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, and the reason, no, and the reason, oh, on the, on the, no, in fact, you know what's funny?  I have, you, you block origin running an ad blocker on this and it's still auto running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well that, cause it's, cause it's a legit content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's first party site. Yeah.  It's coming directly from there.  I thought you were going to ask if there was an app, an antivirus app you could run on Android.  And there, and there really isn't anything that's effective.  Google does the most effective thing, which is scan downloads every time you download something.  Unless you disable it, Google will scan it.  There are third party apps that do something similar.  Lookout is a very well known one.  But I, the way mobile devices are designed, you really don't, generally you don't let apps kind of  snoop around on the hard drive.  Scanning for things, stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's so much better than the old days when I had a windows machine, you know, 10 years ago, 15 years ago.  And the hell you'd go through with that and your father.  Yeah.  It's gotten better.  Security situation is much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But unfortunately there are much more malicious bad attacks out there like ransomware attacks.  I think we saw the first ransomware attacks on smartphones this week.  Oh.  Yeah. I think there's an Android, let me just check real quickly, ransomware.  Ransomware is really nasty because what it does is it gets on your system and encrypts your files and then says,  if you want to ever see your files again, you got to pay us.  Yeah.  We've been talking, this is aggressive Android ransomware spreading in the US.  Actually, this is from last year.  Sorry.  That's not a, that's not an up to date story.  Cyber police Android ransomware.  It's been in the wild for some time, but it's using a new technique.  So yeah, ransomware would be the thing you really don't want to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, isn't there also some sort of, I guess this would be ransomware.  It's not encryption though.  It takes your photos and threatens to send them out to everybody.  Bad enough.  That would be bad.  That would be a bad thing.  Which happened to a friend of mine.  Did it?  Yeah.  It was, I mean, it wasn't a terrible photo, but you know, she was, it was a little sexier than she probably wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It found a provocative photo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, like it was looking for provocative photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if there was a person behind it and they got all of her photos and picked the most embarrassing one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they found the most embarrassing one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it was embarrassing enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So she said, okay.  No, she actually, she did not pay the rent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They sent it out.  That's how I know about it.  Cause I got a copy of my friend.  That's horrific.  Right.  It is.  That's what I like.  I'm like.  That's terrible.  So, but I don't know what that was.  And I looked for more information about this because I was like, holy cow.  That's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That, you know what, that see with ransomware, if you have a good backup and the truth is most Android devices are probably backed up.  There's nothing on there that you can't afford to just wipe the phone and start over.  But that bypasses that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it can find a compromising photo and send it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why I have no compromising photos on my phone.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Nor do I.  My wife, my wife put the kibosh on that.  Oh honey.  Stay right there.  No.  Don't move.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, so the, the ransomware that is reported in this article.  The, and it's, it's, it's called cyber police because you get a pop up that says this is the cyber police and you've been up to no good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All actions are illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are fixed history query stored in the database of the US Department of Homeland Security.  Attention.  Your device has been locked.  Reasons indicated below.  And then if you, you have 71 hours on this screenshot to give them money to get your thing unlocked.  The ransom to $100 Apple iTunes gift cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jesus.  And by the way, it doesn't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And but the thing is this gets on your machine the same way that previous one did by a side load from a web page.  This takes advantage of older Android devices.  This is not going to impact you if you have an up to date Android device.  In my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  So they're saying I can never say Kaspersky Labs did a report at the end of June saying, yes, there's a fourfold increase in the number of users attacked using Android ransomware.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Terrible.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I feel I feel kind of sad and dirty and but nobody having up to date iPhone device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're probably all right.  Because these take advantage basically of flaws in this in the operating system.  The problem is that because Google of the way Google has done Android, there are a lot of phones that are not being patched.  And Google's doing the best they can to fix that.  They're moving a lot of the components that were part of the updated operating system out into Play Store where they can be updated automatically via Play Store mechanisms.  They've instituted these monthly security patch fixes, which are really, I think, important.  But there's but there's nothing to do about low cost Android devices that were sold and have never been updated by the carrier since.  With older versions, a lot of them are vulnerable because of the stage fright vulnerability.  Google now is trying to twist the knife in its victory against Oracle.  They're asking for sanctions against the Oracle attorney.  You sue us.  We will murder you and your children.  And what this was interesting plays Apple a billion dollars to be on the iPhone.  What?  That's an interesting.  This is Joe Mullen writing in Ars Technica.  What's the deal there, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With.  With.  Oh, OK.  The attorney basically shared the details of this deal, the billion dollars on the iPhone.  So and they're like, dude, that was under legal protected.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this was during the discovery procedure.  And that Hearst, the Oracle attorney, said that Google's Android operating system had generated revenue of 31 billion dollars.  That's 22 billion dollars in profit.  Or remember when this came out?  Yeah, I mean, it was big.  And for the Google search bar and iPhones, they pay Apple a billion dollars.  So they want her to be censured and the figure to be struck from the record a little late for that.  That's Google's right to be forgotten.  That percentage just stated that should be sealed.  We are talking. This is just sour grapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is like, OK, fine.  We're just going to make your life a little bit harder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  If you've got the lawyers and the budget, why not go for broke?  Scorch that earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  You'll never sue us again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And actually, to add insult to injury, a jury has just ruled that Oracle is going to pay three billion dollars to H.B.  Enterprise for some patents.  The the the I.T.A.N.I.M. actually wasn't patents.  It was I.T.A.N.I.M. systems that Hewlett-Packard stopped making, I guess, actions that contributed to the decline of a once lucrative line of high end computers.  Oracle violated a contract when it decided to stop creating new versions of its database software for the I.T.A.N.I.M. chip, which HP was still selling into Enterprise.  Amazon robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  Oh, I was like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What? Amazon robot challenge.  Deep learning A.I.A. robotic arm that could do the work of a warehouse worker three times faster.  It will not take long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'll be aiming for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they already you know, it's already somewhat automated, right?  Because the pick and pull system that moves you around.  Yeah.  So it's just really the arms is the one thing the humans contributing at this point.  And these these robots are getting better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They could get the dog from Boston Dynamics, the new one that does that empties the dishwasher for you.  What?  I'm buying that.  That's not what it's sole job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dishwashing emptying dog.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go look at this.  This was this is a couple of weeks ago.  It's the latest version of the nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not so scary anymore.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's still scary.  That thing is got it haunts my dreams.  Nobody empties your dishwasher and it brings you cokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it is scary looking, though.  You're absolutely right.  It kind of looks like a dinosaur.  A raptor.  OK, there it goes.  These are the Boston Dynamics dogs.  They're not as noisy either, right?  They're now battery got rid of the hydraulics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, this isn't the video where they do the I thought it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just taking a walk.  They're walking the dog.  Look, it can go under its dog tricks.  Robotic dog tricks.  Isn't that cute?  Stupid pet tricks with the dog.  No, I think he's going to go in and help that in the.  God, you would just be terrified if you looked behind you and that was walking around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know where what show I was at, but I was next to the original one.  Like the real version of you seen in person.  Yes, it is.  It is just as scary as you would imagine.  Like if that looked ahead, what's it doing?  Push ups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's showing how it can keep the head one position while the body changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the lack of hydraulics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are we is there sound on this, Carson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here we go.  It needs a tail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's not how you load a dishwasher spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's how my daughter and my husband load the right.  They just throw stuff in there.  It's in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good.  I'll get clean.  Look, look, that's not recycling.  It is recycling.  Good job, Spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, God, it slipped on banana peels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, literally.  There's banana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is I'm telling you, they're remembering all this.  Look at all the marks against the wall of robots falling.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is terrible.  This is terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It will chase after you.  It's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Farhad's right.  Oh, now what?  It's got its head stored on top of it.  It's trotting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dancer version.  Why do they make them so scary looking?  If they made it like cuddlier, they need to tail the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So glad Google sold that company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, like, OK, I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's here's a cinder blocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do these guys not laugh?  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just threw a cinder block.  I don't think you want a dog that'll do that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Holy cow.  What's disturbing is that same little clicking dance that it does before it throws it is the same like thing my dog does when she's excited about a treat.  Scary juxtaposition there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  Now, I guess the point of this is this could be digging out people out of rubble.  Rubble.  But you better hope you're not behind it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or that you're not like it's not owned by police and you're you're like trying to get away.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacey, have you been being bad lately for thinking that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but every I mean, like as a journalist, I'm always like, how can the state use something like this against you?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, she lives in Texas.  Jeff.  Oh, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How can I buy it and use it for my own defense?  Exactly.  Can I outfit this with a gun?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So.  Pardon me for this, but you know, Texas could use it for executions.  Oh, yeah.  Stoneham death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The machine did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, guys.  No, no, that is what you mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey, do you are you do you conceal carry?  No, no, I don't.  OK, just checking for saying to upset you.  But you see how this preserves the peace.  If I know you're armed, I'm not going to, you know, do anything too challenging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I could take you, Leo.  Totally.  You don't know I'm not armed.  Like what about my martial arts?  You probably could take me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure you could.  I always tell my kids that don't yell at people as we drive down the street.  You don't know if they're armed or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my parents used to tell me this and it was kind of nice when I lived in New York because I could yell at anyone down the street.  I felt pretty good.  But in Texas, that's actually true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so it makes us a more civil society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's this is an example of Leo doing the devil's advocate.  No, I'm just so you know, Stacey, don't worry.  Don't go to the show with this guy.  You're on with Leo's alter ego right now.  Leo will come back.  Leo will return.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If everybody in that nightclub in Orlando had care was carrying a gun, there would be more people dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, just the one.  Yes, more people dead.  Probably also the shooter, which makes people feel good.  But others.  Well, collateral damage.  Yeah.  Friendly fire.  That doesn't belong in nightclubs.  No, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Finally, Yahoo is going to get sold.  Finally.  Maybe.  Finally.  A third round of bids is comes in today.  And then the final selection process in about two weeks.  Verizon still, according to recode, the leading bidder, Tim Armstrong, the head of AOL, is leading the negotiations.  The founder of Quicken Loans, Dan Gilbert and private equity firm TPG also apparently in the running.  Current bids estimated to be around three and a half billion to five billion dollars for Yahoo's core business.  That's down a lot from the eight billion dollars.  I think it was that they were talking initially.  And this article and see why don't we keep getting much was much was Microsoft going to spend on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, was it 21, 31 billion, some huge amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's crazy.  It's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was about this time because it was around Sun Valley that they had their little billionaires sleep over and.  We're trying to do all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, Dan Gilbert, the Quicken Loans founder, also owns a Cleveland Cavaliers, the world champion Cleveland Cavaliers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Poor Marissa didn't get invited to Sun Valley this year.  Really?  Oh, that's a burn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought she said twins.  Maybe she said, I don't want to go.  I'm busy drew the same.  Yeah, just like I don't want to go to Apple events.  I don't want to go to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want to go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have to invite me.  I don't want to go.  So we'll just I guess we'll just have to wait and see.  Meyer will get a pretty big payout.  Oh, yeah.  I think it was something like fifty three million dollars.  Her buyout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But she's the kind of person who could sit back on her Google.  She gets it back.  Nothing for the rest of her life.  No, she'll go to something else.  It's an affront.  And I don't think it's clear that she she didn't save Yahoo, but I don't think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  clear that she could have saved Yahoo.  I agree.  I think someone someone told me this and I thought it was actually a really astute point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is that she was brought in as a product person.  And what Yahoo really needed at the time was a financial engineering person who could  basically monetize what it had and get out.  I think that's probably true.  So so Microsoft's bid in 2008 was $31 a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Microsoft's bid in 2008 was $31 a share worth forty four point six billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's where the 31 came from.  Three one dollars a share.  Forty four billion dollars.  Now, did Yahoo turn that down?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah.  And now Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They asked for forty dollars a share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Steve Ballmer went, oh, wow, we just touched a bullet.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They bought Nokia.  Not for as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not nearly as much.  Yeah.  Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.  Time to invest.  Time to save.  Long term savings.  So important to your financial future.  If the kids are going to college, they're important.  If you plan to retire ever, it's important.  Maybe you want to buy a house or just a rainy day fund.  But the question is, once you get you start building your nest egg, how do you keep it  growing?  You can't just put it in your mattress or your savings account, which is about the same  thing these days.  Interest rates are so low.  So you're going to invest it, right?  Are you going to do that?  I did.  Problem is you also then have to pay attention, like every few months, readjust, reassign,  reinvest.  I did that for a while and then I forgot about it.  And ten years later I went, oh, I wonder how those investments are going.  That was not a good plan.  You could go to an investment advisor, go to the guy down in the strip mall here and  he'll charge you.  Oh, yeah, he will.  Between one and three percent of what you have under management every year.  That means you'd have to make three percent more just to break even.  Not to mention the hidden fees, the transaction costs.  I got a better way.  Wealth front.  Because it's a computer managing, you may say, well, I don't want a computer.  Yes, you do.  Because the computer software has the best, most intelligent thinking about investments  already built into it.  It monitors your investments, not weekly or monthly or yearly, but constantly.  So, it does things like tax loss harvesting and rebalancing every minute.  Constantly adjusting to get you the best return and the lowest tax bill.  You can do this for college savings, too.  They just introduced their 529 college savings plan.  So, like a Roth IRA, it lets you invest after-tax dollars and save for a child or grandchild's  college and other higher education expenses.  They've got retirement.  They've got long-term investments of all kinds.  If you go to Wealthfront right now, Wealthfront.com slash twig, if you will, you can get a sample  portfolio based on the few questions.  It's not a big questionnaire they ask you, but they've really boiled it down to just a few  simple questions.  They'll make a portfolio for you.  You can see what they would invest in for you.  You can really get a sense of the idea.  You can even bring your existing portfolio and have them automatically, no human, take  a look at what your costs are, what you're losing to expenses and that kind of thing.  If you do decide to invest, it starts at $500.  That's the minimum investment.  And we're going to do something really nice.  Actually, they do it.  They're going to manage your first $15,000 absolutely fee-free forever.  So not only is it only one quarter, 1% a year, but it's on the assets above the first $15,000.  And you'll never pay commissions or transaction fees.  It's really a good way to do this.  It's just you set it and you forget it, and it's fantastic.  Wealthfront, find out more.  Wealthfront.com slash twig.  Get that free portfolio.  Answer the questions so you can really get a sense of what's involved.  I think you'll be very impressed.  Wealthfront.com slash twig.  Senator Warren says Apple, Google, and Amazon have too much power.  Competition is dying in America.  It's all because of mergers.  You agree?  I really like Elizabeth Warren, but I think maybe that's not the best message to send right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's not.  It's the European view of antitrust that big is bad as opposed to the American view of antitrust.  Does it pass the test of harming competition?  And that's the law, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the U.S.  In the U.S., antitrust law says you have to use your – nothing wrong with monopoly unless you use it to enter new markets and harm competition.  Nothing wrong with being big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So she's arguing for different definitions of antitrust, which is just big is bad.  But then –

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't disagree with her that we maybe have a few too many mergers, that the oversight hasn't been great.  Although they've stopped a few.  Sprint and T-Mobile, remember?  Yeah.  AT&T and T-Mobile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And –  There have been a few, I think, good printables there.  Protect first?  Protect first?  What's it called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The cable one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Time Warner and Comcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that was – that went through.  But they allowed charter.  No, they allowed charter.  Charter and Comcast.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So – and that – was that the FTC who was going for that or was that the FCC on those two?  It would have been the FCC, right?  Well, they both have to agree.  They both have to agree.  I can't remember who actually made the call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the FCC said it was anti-competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were not wrong.  Yep.  I'm trying to –

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Airline mergers have been a mess, right?  Continental and United American, USAir.  And as a result –

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, as a United customer, I've got to say I was a Continental customer, now a United  customer, and I have benefits because I fly a lot and I'm better off at more roots, I  got to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ms. Warren voiced potential concern about three major tech companies.  This is from the Wall Street Journal.  Google, Apple, and Amazon because they control essential tech platforms that other smaller  companies depend upon for survival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the problem is what have they done?  Go ahead, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I was just going to say this is the same argument that actually has been made in the  past about like the broadband people, and that's what Net Neutrality kind of was trying  to solve because there's a lack of competition there.  It's really interesting to actually see it move up a layer in the stack from like the  access layer to the application layer.  That doesn't make it right.  I'm just like, I see where the temptation to do this comes in and I just don't see  a way for her to justify it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, God bless America, you can become very successful.  And one could absolutely argue that Google has taken the money it's made and instead  of plowing it into, well, Ireland, but instead of plowing it into savings bonds, has invested  it into new markets, new sectors, and fostered innovation in areas that frankly wouldn't  have been, look at Google Fiber, would not have seen that kind of innovation.  Exactly.  On the other hand, I think that there is a lot to be said for the fact that if you're  an entrepreneur and you want to start a business, you probably hope that Google doesn't decide  that that's a good business for it to be in because that's it for you, right?  Unless they buy you.  That's true, that's true, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But on the other hand, there's all kinds of businesses that you can start now that you  couldn't have started if Google didn't exist.  Well, and Amazon too with Amazon websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And eBay and name them.  There's other mergers I would like to see happen.  Here's a merger, I just thought about this this week, we'll talk about the show.  You know what I want to see happen?  I want to see, I'm a customer of Fios.  I've had problems with Verizon Mobile, don't you know?  But I'm a very happy customer of Verizon Fios.  It works wonderfully, but it's orphaned, right?  I'm always nervous that they're going to decide to get out of this.  Years ago, they didn't expand anymore.  They're just getting more customers in the markets where they are.  Google Fiber should buy Fios.  Ah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be wonderful?  And you bring the Google quality and guarantees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Instead, they're selling it.  Verizon sold Fios in LA to Frontier.  Well, they did?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they sold their DSL lines to Frontier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, not the, I thought it was Fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's double check that.  So Verizon needs its Fios lines because it's actually going to become the basis of its next  generation for the small sales networks.  It needs the dense fiber coverage in areas.  So it's actually expanding Fios in Boston for this.  But they stopped building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, they really stopped a lot of the buildups.  They really did stop a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's going to happen?  What we're going to see happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right.  Verizon sold land lines to Frontier.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be beautiful?  So Google's going to stop building out fiber to the home in a lot of places too, I think.  Because what we're about to happen is gigabit wireless.  So you're going to have fiber to a node basically.  And then you're going to have the 5G spectrum.  So the FCC classifies that in any of the gigahertz spectrum.  So that's actually what we're about to see.  Google is going into six new cities though, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it is.  And it has to have fiber in the ground to build out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So for instance, it's in Austin.  You're not getting it because you're not in the specific geographic region.  But now that the fiber is there, you may well get high speed wireless via Google because they have the fiber into this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which goes back to our discussion about the kiosks on the street.  That's why that's kind of stupid and worthless.  Whereas if you could turn that into building, pursuing wireless, then it's really valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the kiosks on the street are probably an information gathering device as opposed to an information delivery device.  So you want to have as many of those kind of edge things as possible.  And if you can get a city to actually pay for it and share that data with you, you're like freaking it's like a gold mine.  If you think strategically about what's happening with that.  So that's less about delivering.  I mean, I know it's free Wi-Fi.  That's your carrot, I think.  Did that make sense?  Yes.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  It's like long silences.  No, you make me think, Stacey.  I'm really glad you're on our team now because you're really so well informed.  And I think you're exactly right.  But getting back to Elizabeth Warren, I feel like it's going to be this is interesting.  This is that same thing that's going on in Europe, isn't it, Jeff?  Yep. Yep. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's anti-big, anti-technology.  And, you know, I just I just did an interview this morning with KGO radio in San Francisco because I tweeted the contemplation of a tech tax in San Francisco.  Are they thinking about that?  Yes.  And I just said, you know, enough of biting the hand that feeds you enough of looking to get tourists in the mouth.  Find all those tech companies.  Come to New York.  You'd be welcome here.  So we tried to make a, you know, New York versus San Francisco thing.  But it's a real problem, I think, in San Francisco.  It's what we said before about the New York Times and The Guardian, which I love, and other papers.  The contrarian anti-technology attitude that's spreading across liberal worlds.  This is Elizabeth Warren.  Right.  This is Europe.  Well, thank Bernie Sanders for that.  This is a real problem for our industry, for the things that we care about, for the galloping like a mechanical dog future coming our way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not a huge tax, by the way.  And it was only proposed by three members of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors.  But it's indicative of an attitude.  It's an attitude.  One and a half percent payroll tax just on tech companies.  And why single out the tech companies?  I could see if you want to do that citywide.  That's a different matter.  But to say, oh, tech companies because you caused our homeless problem?  Yeah, that's ridiculous.  Fine, fine.  Then take away all the tech companies tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where are you, San Francisco?  You're a cute little boutique with some good restaurants that won't be able to afford to live anymore.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to be very careful.  Look, we all want income equality or better.  We don't want as much income inequality.  We don't want companies to use their power to strip mind the American economy.  But at the same time, these companies are adding so much value and innovating so greatly.  It's a balancing act.  It's a balancing act.  But the scales should not swing too far against these tech companies.  I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But we see it over and over again now in throwing crap at the buses.  San Francisco's problem with housing is scarcity.  As long as San Francisco wants to be a low-rise, scarce little cute city, the housing price is going to go up.  Welcome to capitalism.  You want lower housing prices?  Authorize more building of housing units.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is a failure of the city and they're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just these three supervisors.  I think it's ultra-liberal socialists leaning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there is a failure to communicate well to people and maybe even to allocate resources.  I mean, if you want to fight income inequality or you want to have lower cost housing for people, the city has to make some decisions.  And they have to decide to build more.  They can decide to institute all kinds of taxes.  I mean, having a discussion about this isn't bad.  We can mock these people for trying to do it.  But I don't know.  These are discussions that need to be had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Homelessness is a huge problem in every city in the nation.  It's not unique to San Francisco.  San Francisco's very different.  It's unique problem is that it's seven miles by seven miles and it bounded by water and you cannot build any more.  So there's a scarcity of housing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could go into the south of the city and build high rises if you chose to.  But it wouldn't be the city.  The other issue.  Well, that's what they said when the Trans-American Pyramid went up.  It was ruining the city.  Diane Feinstein was accused of ruining the city by allowing more buildings to go in, which allowed more offices, which allowed more jobs.  You know, the other problem in San Francisco is that it is.  Sorry, lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got just the motion sensor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You need to get him hooked up, Stacy.  Yeah, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacy does an IOT podcast as an IOT website.  She's an expert on motion sensors.  Where was I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  San Francisco problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Diane Feinstein Trans-American Pyramid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of course, it is a magnet for people looking for a dream.  Yeah, not just cooks, but I'll be nicer than that.  People who think that that's going to solve their problems with wonderful place on earth and San Francisco is a wonderful place.  I loved it.  Oh, I love it. I was there.  I still love it. It's Shangri-La.  Yeah, but that's the problem.  It's Shangri-La and people are drawn to that.  And so San Francisco's homeless problem, I think is Stacy's right, is materially different from other cities.  Really?  Yeah. Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  New York, even with the complaints of late notes, nothing like this in New York.  Every other city I go to know San Francisco is is absolutely.  I don't want to say worse sense of judgment.  Yeah. Well, I'll say worse. Yeah, it's worse.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That in Seattle has the probably most obvious and maybe most aggressive homeless population.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the only reason it would be germane to the conversation in San Francisco is if those people were made homeless by raising housing costs, rising.  Which is not the case.  I don't know if it's the case or not.  I mean, but that's the only way it would be germane to this conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not the homeless receive.  There are other people who can't afford what you what you do have also, I think is a real problem.  How can you be a teacher on the peninsula teaching these incredibly rich tech people's children?  Well, that's a problem statewide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  A problem in Austin, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wouldn't be surprised if it's a problem in the entire country because we're so undervalued education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  New York has built and we're from the way real estate is not expensive, but it's not as high quality.  They built a housing complex for teachers.  That's the way to think.  Yeah.  All right.  But we need we need more.  This is the same argument I had about about taxes in the UK with Google and Facebook.  And I'm sorry, Google and Amazon is this is government's job.  You shouldn't you shouldn't blame or expect the tech companies to solve these problems.  They're doing what they should do as companies, which is make products and make money.  Right.  Well, the government is looking for a solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's that's what this payroll tax is a suggestion for.  It's this government going, oh, crap, we have all these people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's government, but it's government demonizing that one sector.  There's plenty of evil bankers in San Francisco.  Believe me.  Well, you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What you don't want to get is a situation is, well, whatever the most successful sector of the economy is right now, let's blame them for our woes.  That's the problem.  Right.  That that isn't that isn't going to fly.  By the way, Verizon did sell its fiber businesses in Texas and California to Frontier.  We did.  They sold landlines all over the country, but they sold the fiber.  Verizon, please.  All is forgiven.  And Frontier, by the way, is not from what I hear from all of my callers in Los Angeles, a very good steward of the business.  People are so Googleers who are watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm telling you, buy buy us.  Please Google.  I would be a great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What a great solution that would be.  Would they be?  Would there be any trust issues there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's back to back to the discussion with Warren.  So that would be something that we as customers would die for die for.  But you bet your BIPI right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There would be, you know, why we want that?  Because there is the Internet service in this country is so and is uncompetitive that we want to see more competition.  So you'd have to again, you can't there's no formula.  You can't do it mechanically.  You have to look at the situation and say this would be good for competition, even though Google is a big incumbent.  It's not a big.  It isn't a big ISP.  It would be a big company coming along to to become a big ISP to make competition for Comcast and Verizon and AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.  And the reason it's OK is because Fios is only an overbuilt situations.  Right.  And no, no case is Fios the monopoly player.  Fios came in to create the competition.  Google can strengthen that competition.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it wouldn't.  Hart Hanks.  No, not Hart Hanks.  What is the antitrust?  There's an antitrust ratio.  German. Oh, there's a ratio.  There's a ratio that the F.C. anyway.  Yes. Verizon buying files would not are sorry.  Google buying files would not mess with that ratio.  It's popular in telecom mergers to look at competition.  I wish I could remember what it's called.  But I can't.  Anyway, it would totally pass.  I think the biggest question actually would be coming from vertical integration,  kind of like when Comcast bought NBC Universal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that didn't bother anybody, did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they put some conditions on that and they went they went forward.  So I think that's probably how that deal would be viewed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think of Comcast putting Netflix on its set top box?  Is that a big deal?  Kara Swisher says it's a very big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is because Comcast has been.  They hate each other.  They hate each other.  For years, just like how can we screw over Netflix?  I once wrote a story about seven ways, you know, Comcast is trying to like,  I don't know, it was Comcast is doing something devilish or evil to over the top service providers.  So it is a big deal that it's putting it on its cable box because that's that's its flagship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should point out from the consumer point of view, there's 800 ways to get Netflix already in your house.  This doesn't add in any way consumer choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What it does add, though, is if I'm buying something that's on my cable box, I expect it to work and to be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I buy something, you obviously do not have a Comcast X1 cable box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The worst.  That's their state of the art technology.  And it is the only thing worse than it was the previous Comcast cable box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought the X1 was better.  It's supposed to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You must be seeing those ads, those great ads from Comcast.  It's a piece of crap.  It's the worst technology.  It's very it's exactly what you would expect from a company that doesn't have to innovate because they dominate and, you know,  basically have a monopoly in markets.  So they don't have to make something better.  Because what is your choice?  Zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Until the FCC was, you know, does force them to enable us to buy our own cable boxes.  I hope they do.  Better boxes.  I hope that happens.  X1 had a lot of promise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this was a great idea.  But I own them.  And I've and I had a whole X1 setup and slowly of trading them out for Tivo's, even though it's hideously expensive transition to make.  It's it's just unusable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Would that FCC move change the DOCSIS standard that is hold things back?  Or do you start to hold the DOCSIS?  You think the DOCSIS standard hold things back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a physical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  Physical layer thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's DOCSIS is that's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's fine.  Yeah, that's good.  That means everyone.  Oh, because that's like Wi-Fi.  It's it's kind of like the equivalent of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it means you can buy a cable modem that is lives to the standard and doesn't have to be from Comcast and plug it in.  And that's that is a very good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the FCC wants to do is make cable boxes more like the Internet, make you able to access anything that's on the Internet via a cable box.  And right now, cable companies run their own software and control everything that goes through a cable box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's that is why this is a big deal.  Right. Because now you've got an over the top service on your cable box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Comcast basically saying, wait, wait, before you regulate us, let me show you how we're being nice here.  By the way, that's what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the Hirfindl Hirschman index.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there you go.  See, no wonder I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How could you forget that?  Thank you, Gardner.  Gardner in the chat room says, as a matter of fact, it's the Hirfindl Hirschman index.  I like him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Gardner is great.  Actually, he comes up with these are the things that, you know, I've spent years reading about, thinking about and then forgetting their names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's only so much room in that head for information.  That's true.  At any head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google. Google is my my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. We don't need to know this stuff anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So anyway, so this is actually the in Comcast actually also with their data cap.  Remember, a couple of months ago, they boosted it to a I was going to say a terahertz.  But it was one and a half terabytes.  It was a huge amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's one terabyte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One terabyte.  All right.  And that was because they saw the FCC putting conditions on Time Warner Cable and Charter.  So Comcast isn't stupid.  They're big, but they're not stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they do what they have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not saying they're like going out.  They're not altruists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, they're not altruists.  And I wonder what the economic relationship, what the what the business deal is.  Right.  Does Comcast get a buck from Netflix now from for every?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, is this or does does yeah, does Comcast favor Netflix?  Is this a net?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think the whole point of this is so Comcast can point in that and say, what do you mean?  We're net neutral.  Look at that.  We actually put Netflix on our box.  So don't do that thing.  FCC with the net neutrality and the cable box.  Don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's true.  This could be a way to get around the data caps.  So if Netflix is all over the same.  Yeah.  And because they're they're cable box stuff shouldn't be no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  X1 does not count against your caps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then this is a way to grandfather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this zero basis that zero rating.  Yeah, there's your rating rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Netflix sold us out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the Hirschfeld Heinefinial ratio on that?  I ask you.  Yeah, there must be right.  That must be the deal.  Yeah.  And don't you think Netflix is paying for that a little bit?  A couple of bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or maybe they just sold their soul.  I'm serious because they were the biggest advocate for net neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  They've been moving in that direction, I think, for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Susan Crawford said anything about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was about to say, let's call Susan.  We'll have to go check.  She usually takes a day or so to write.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because she actually thinks, geez, we're no fun.  I was going to say she has a real job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  File, Susan, file.  Well, I'll check.  I'll ask Comcast next week.  I can tell you if it counts against caps.  Yeah, because we are making an assumption here.  The journalist in me is like, wait, we can't actually say this yet.  You're right.  So I'll shoot it.  Oh, Stacey.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're going to fall out of it.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I suck the joy out of our tirades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We know what else is sucking the joy out of Snapchat.  Grownups.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Teens are not happy as their mom and dad are starting to use Snapchat.  According to the Wall Street Journal, 14% of US smartphone users, 35 and up, use Snapchat.  14% of that is up from 2% three years ago.  70% of all smartphone users are on Snapchat.  Everybody uses Snapchat.  I bet you use Snapchat, don't you, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I have it, but I don't actually use it because I'm old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you want to give your child a place to...  My child does not have Snapchat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, we're all too old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  How can you be too old for Snapchat?  Oh, we're too old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got so much stuff that is going on in my life.  I'm like, do I really need Snapchat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I post less on social media than ever before, really.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You do when you quit Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I practically quit Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I love Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you post or you just read?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my God.  I post, I read, I put pictures of weird things that my dog does.  I put pictures of the hedgehog on Twitter.  It's super fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm following you, but this is the problem with it is...  Why do you have the Sydney Opera House on Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I thought it was a nice picture.  I don't post a lot of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would make one think that you are Australian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm Texan.  It's like the same thing.  Our accent isn't as cool, but that's basically it.  We have the same mentality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that might be true, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I love Australia.  We went down to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I do too.  I love Australia.  And the Sydney Opera House is gorgeous.  Just gorgeous.  Have you been over the bridge, the Sydney Harbour Bridge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, yes.  I thought, oh, yeah.  Not me.  In the harbour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can actually, Jeff, and I think you'd really enjoy this.  Oh, no, I didn't say it.  What did you say?  They put you in jumpsuits and they attach you to a wire  and you can climb the cable all the way up and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We would have done it.  We were there with Michael, who was at the time one week short  of his 13th birthday, and you have to be 13 to go on it.  So we couldn't do it.  But next time I'm in Sydney, I'm definitely...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Save for yourselves.  No, Leo, no, don't do it.  Definitely doing that.  Literally, my palms are flowing with sweat right now,  with a mere mention of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you afraid of heights, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bridges.  Bridges, just bridges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somebody added, some smart-ass Twig fan added that to my Wikipedia profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They should add that you come to it, honestly, because it...  I don't know if you had it before 9-1, 9-11, but it...  It got a lot worse.  It got a lot worse after 9-11.  And he was...  Stacey, you probably don't know this,  but he was coming into the PATH station when 9-11 happened.  Oh, okay, yeah, that was...  And was covered with...  Asbestos.  Asbestos and all sorts of crap.  Any other stories you guys see that you really want to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, open cellular.  But wait, do you have another ad, or was that all your ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have another ad, but do the open cellular, and I'll do another ad.  One more ad before our Picks of the Week is what I'll do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Facebook, since we've been talking a little bit about wireless  and access to the internet,  they put out today actually this thing called Open Cellular,  which is a...  It's...  They have this telecom infrastructure project,  which is basically designed to make telco infrastructure cheaper,  is kind of the way to think about it, and easier to implement everywhere.  So with Open Cellular, they're doing...  It's like an access point, it's what it kind of looks like.  It's got processing, it's got ways to make backhaul easier,  so instead of just using fiber, you can use other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is what Facebook did with their network operation centers  and their servers.  They just published the spec and said, here's how you can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and so this isn't open sourced yet, but it's going to,  and the cool thing about Open Cellular or Open Cellular  or their telecom infrastructure project is it's got Deutsch Telecom,  EE, and some other telecoms actually really interested in implementing this.  And I'm not sure if they're going to do it in European and high-cost markets  or if they're going to do it more in Africa and other places,  but anything that makes your telecom infrastructure operate efficiently  and at scale like your computing infrastructure is awesome  because it could potentially lower the cost of data,  and that would be great for everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This would only... I mean, the problem is I have with this is that  if you're AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile, you probably have, you know...  Yeah.  You already have your designs that you use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So AT&T is actually moving to a...  On their backend infrastructure, they're actually moving to more  what looks like a compute core as opposed to like a traditional...  Oh, really?  Yeah. I went into one of their...  They have a test center here in Texas for their wireless networks,  and it's really like if you're a super nerd like me,  it's awesome because you can see their 2G network takes up like two aisles  of data center space.  Their 3G network is like a full... or actually it's also like two aisles,  and then their 4G is one aisle, and then their 5G,  their next generation is called Domain 2.0.  It's like one chassis with like Arraka servers, and that's it.  And that's like... It's just crazy to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Software radios, baby. That's what's happening, man.  It's happening in every business. You don't really need the hardware.  You do it all in software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's a software-defined network.  And then this particular Open Cellular thing does have a software-defined radio  so it can cover more bands, or you could just do an SoC  that is dedicated for some bands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure, but it would just have basically the same software  just built into the firmware. Wow. That's cool.  So yeah, this is really awesome. I'm super optimistic.  I'm trying to think who would use this.  I mean, would there be amateur cell networks springing up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could, because it does power over ethernet.  And look, I'm getting so excited. This is like the kinky stuff I love.  You're such a nerd.  But like with power over ethernet, and you still have to get a license for the FCC  if you're going to start broadcasting like crazy.  But Facebook could build their own networks if they wanted to.  They just have to... That's what's compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Google has the home and Facebook has your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Google has efforts to bring more network connectivity.  Is Project Loon Google or is that Facebook?  Loon is Google and Facebook has the drones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the problem is in the U.S., this is a highly regulated area.  You can't just put up your own cell towers.  And I guess in the developing world, this would be amazing.  And it's probably the intent for this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's my guess with the carrier partners where they would put this.  But you never know. And anything that makes this stuff cheaper.  I mean, I could see Sprint or Timo, which has nothing to lose,  like trying to adopt a lower cost radio access network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And all four of the big carriers have spectrum that they've purchased.  They leased and they have access to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, but there's lots of people who have spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there kind of spectrum just available somebody could use?  You wouldn't do it on 2.4. You wouldn't do it on an unregulated spectrum.  I guess you could do it on an unregulated spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You couldn't define and control quality that way as well.  But there's spectrum.  So the economics and the math around spectrum is super complicated.  But what's happening is we're trying.  We're able now with better silicon and software to use spectrum that  previously was unavailable to us.  So that's like what a lot of the gigahertz spectrum that people are excited  about is about.  So I don't know what these radios would work on,  but there's a lot of companies that have spectrum and they even like  Dish has both spectrum and they have rooftop access to places where  something like this could be really interesting.  And that's a play that a lot of people don't think about is that a company  like Dish could basically put up little mini cell towers on people's roofs.  Although AT&T owns Dish right now.  So AT&T's probably thought about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is a big spectrum auction just wrapping up right now, by the way.  They expect it will be around $33 billion.  This is a reverse auction.  That thing is so crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  600 megahertz spectrum.  I cannot wait to see what happens there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So during this process, the FCC and television broadcasters go through several  rounds of bidding until the agency is able to purchase the most amount of  spectrum at the lowest price.  I don't, it's too complicated for my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, oh, AT&T owns DirecTV, not Dish.  Thank you.  That's right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Nice people.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The reverse spectrum auction.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, that auction format is so nuts.  I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the FCC is trying to buy spectrum from the television broadcasters.  Which they will turn around and sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  So the FCC had to convince the broadcast owners that it was worth giving up  their spectrum.  Because at first the broadcast owners was like, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they made them give up 700 megahertz, right?  They made them all go digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that was that.  But the digital analog transition, what happened with this one is a little bit  different.  We won't get into like rebanding and all that crazy stuff.  But basically what the FCC has done is the broadcaster said, I will give up my  spectrum for $10 if you pay me $10.  And so the FCC was like, OK, we'll give you $10 because we think the carriers  are going to come around and give us $12.  Yeah.  The question.  So the FCC has done the half where the broadcaster said, we want this much.  The FCC negotiated with them and they came to, I thought it was like an 86.  It was a crazy number, but I don't know it off the top of my head.  And now they're going to go now that they've got that chunk in.  They've got a commitment from broadcasters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now they're going to telecom and saying, what will you give us?  And that's where they're going for the 30 to $33 billion target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if this works, if they bid that, then we're all good.  But the telcos may be like, you know what?  We don't think it's worth that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  T-Mobile has committed $8 billion.  AT&T has committed $10 billion.  I don't know what Verizon is bidding, but they're expected to participate.  Sprint is sitting out the auction.  But Comcast and Dish Network will also be bidding for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, see, there's that Dish thing again.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Owning the rooftops.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good for gigabit wireless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the first half may be over any day now.  And the next half will begin at the end of the month.  So here's the thing about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In New Jersey, where I live, the government, Chris Christie,  owns the public broadcasting licenses.  And when he decided to get out of that business, basically,  he handed over the licenses to WNET in New York, and WHY in Philadelphia.  And Buddy Shull owns them.  They're licensed.  And so estimates say that the state could get anywhere from, you know,  $1 to $2 billion out of this.  Now, the fear is that our dear governor will use this to plug the many holes  he has in his Swiss cheese budget, where some of us believe that this was money  that was, this was an asset that was meant to inform the state.  And that there are those of us who believe that we should be able to get at least  part of that money as a trust fund for news and information in the state.  And there's some efforts going on to push that in the legislature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you, Stacey, seen the new Alexa skills?  I guess you don't, you know, I don't have to enable a skill anymore.  I can tell Amazon Echo, I want the fart skill and it'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Play. What was the fart?  I've actually played with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ask for you. I used to have to say ask for a fart.  Ask for a fart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just just in case you keep track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yes, Alexa, play my seven minute workout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've only used it once.  It was it was once.  No, it's seven minutes in your whole life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all you need to do.  It's a miracle.  No more working out.  Miracle of fitness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have seen that.  And the new dash buttons in the new organization is really nice, too.  So tell me about that.  So that they reorganize the way Alexa skills and I should say your name.  Echo. Yes, the Echo.  Well, it's hard to say it with the app.  Anyway, they reorganize the way the skills are set up.  So now you can.  They're like organized by like smart home or terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just go through page after page of random skills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now I mean, there's there's more than 1400 of them.  So at a certain point in time, you're like, screw it.  I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I never got the past page five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I just I found one I liked and I stuck with it.  Yeah, I didn't even know they had a Jeopardy skill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But now I do that one all the time.  I love that one.  So this is more like an app store now, which is nice.  They have highlighted skills.  They have trending and then they have categories.  Get entertained.  That's the Jeopardy one.  Make your home smarter.  Business of finance connected car.  This is good. This is a lot.  They needed to do this badly.  Yes, but they were probably just waiting.  I mean, they have 1500 plus skills now.  Yo mama joke.  So all I have to do is you say echo open yo mama joke and now it'll do it.  President's picker.  Ask Doc Rogers why I'm happy today.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK. OK.  I don't know. That's not under the novelty category.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I should say.  Let's see if it's Fred Wilson.  They actually did a thing.  He did a blog post because one of his partners did the implemented an echo hack that lets you play your Sonos over your control yourself.  I want that to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want that to work so badly.  Although I have my my dot hooked up to a very nice speaker system now.  So in the bedroom, at least I have good good echo audio.  Also, you can buy anything on Prime now.  It doesn't have to have been something you bought previously.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I accidentally bought some emergency underpants the other day.  I was to accidentally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What what are emergency underpants?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't know.  Didn't know. But apparently I got them and they come in.  I should have I meant to bring them in.  They come in a roll in case you need them.  And so what I thought this would be funny on the radio show, I said, Echo, buy some underpants.  And then nice lady says, I found emergency underpants.  Would you like to order it?  And I had to demo it.  I was demoing it.  So I said, you know, I gave it my magic number and then they arrived.  They read the next day.  I guess I really thought I was an emergency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leaks against the mail and just shout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She did wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess they just realized when you need an emergency, you don't.  I think it's one size fits all.  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't even want to know.  All right. Actually, I do.  Boxers are tidy whiteys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't try them on.  I just have in a box.  But I'm guessing they're tidy whiteys.  But I again don't know.  I'll tell you what. I'll do some research and I'll tell you next week.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll find out.  No, I'm really pleased.  You know, I keep meaning to study up on how to write Echo skills because it'd be so useful to have.  Like, I really we ought to have a twit skill.  I mean, it's crazy that I don't have a twit skill.  So it is crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I put I put under my Stacy's thing the Sonos hack from Fred Wilson.  So thank you.  See the blog post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That could be your thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I have another Echo related thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Two things.  Does Fred Wilson own is the investor in Sonos or Echo or is he just like an interested party?  Huge fan.  I guess.  Huge fan for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's a lot of Sonos hacks out there.  Like if you if you Google that, you can find some of them.  They're just they're not easy, which is why people don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he so his friend Steven used the skills interface, which is really it's open to anybody.  Use Amazon's Lambda Cloud.  And you don't have if you don't do a lot of requests, it doesn't cost you anything.  If you publish it, then it can cost you something.  And then it sends instructions to a server on the laptop.  Oh, see, that's what you're that runs the code that controls the Sonos on his home network.  So you have to have some intermediate system that can access the Sonos network and do the work for you.  You know, Raspberry Pi could probably do this pretty well.  So it feels like somebody's already done that for some reason.  Yeah. Why Sonos hasn't done this is beyond me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they're still trying to figure it.  They still haven't published an API for their smartphone stuff, even though they promise to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They need to do that.  All right, let's take a break and we will get your your picks, your tweets, your your numbers, whatever it is you want to end this show with.  We call it the back of the book coming up in just a second.  Smart things. Dr.  Mama's saying smart things works fine with the echo on the Sonos.  So that could be the thing that intermediates.  OK, I didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it does.  You can only, though, play your favorites.  And I think can you do volume up and down?  I it's been so long since I've played with a smart thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I just have my dot paired via Bluetooth to a very nice JBL speaker powered speaker system stereo powered speaker system.  I can do all the commands.  It's great. It's in the bedroom.  I can rock out.  It's wonderful.  I can do playlists from Pandora and Spotify and listen to books.  And it's just great.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you just can't with smart things.  You can't play an exact song because I've got my Sonos.  So no, so no, so no, sis, set up on my echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you just know, see, like the other day, we had the day off.  It was the Fourth of July, I think.  And I wanted to dance naked.  And I said, Echo, play Madonna, celebrate.  Or holiday, holiday.  That was it.  And I danced naked.  And that's what you need the echo for.  She doesn't judge.  She doesn't.  Instead, she sends you emergency underwear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can't get that out of my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Holiday, it would be so right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I think it was at the 25th or 30th birthday for True Blue,  because it wasn't holiday on True Blue.  That was my first cassette tape I ever bought.  Wow. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've touched a nerve.  Touched a touchstone, basically.  Touched a touchstone. Yep. Yep. Yep.  Let's kick things off with Stacey Higginbotham.  By the way, can I just make a recommendation that you subscribe to her newsletter?  You know, if everybody listening to this show, it's free, right, Stacey?  It is totally free.  If everybody listening to this show right now went to Stacey on IOT,  well, first of all, we bring the site down.  But then after the site came back up and subscribed to the newsletter,  I bet maybe we wouldn't.  You would triple your audience instantly.  And you should. You deserve it.  You get this. You can tell what a brilliant analyst Stacey is.  She really knows her stuff.  So sign up. It's the free weekly IOT newsletter.  And you'll find it at stacey on IOT.com.  I want to give you a big plug. I don't plug it enough.  Thank you.  Yeah. And you can see she's doing all the research.  You're doing all the reporting.  And this time you're doing it for yourself, which I love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's true. This is how I'm going to make my money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I support it. No, I think it's great.  I want to support it.  And then, of course, the podcast is IOTpodcast.com.  You can do that with Kevin Toffle.  Also must listen.  In fact, you did a whole episode on the new Alexa skills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, we did.  And the Wink and this tomorrow's tomorrow.  My episode coming out has a cool thing on insurance and the smart home.  And super fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you say you're using did you ever get a Luma?  You're using the Eero. I'm using the Eero.  Luma is delayed. I have an order, but no shipping yet.  And then there's Plume, which is later this year and is the least expensive of the three.  But I think similar.  Totally different architecture.  Oh, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're like not similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not similar. It's not a mesh thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not a mesh. It's controlled in the cloud.  So you get like six radios with no intelligence in them.  And the radios, all the intelligence lives in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, well, it's worth a try. I'm going to review all of them.  By the way, you said you were getting great results with your Eero and I've set the Eero up.  I don't know. Did I mention this last week? It's been working great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it has. OK, yeah, you said I had a very bad experience with two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They sent me a set. Didn't work.  Sent me another set. Didn't work.  Must have just been. It was very early.  I don't even know if they were in production yet, but the production unit I have now is easily the best Wi-Fi we've had in the house.  So which one do you recommend?  Well, the problem with the Eero is it's really expensive. It's 500 bucks for three units.  But that's what you're using, Stacey, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I. Well, because beforehand I had all these access points and every time I tried to mess with my router, my husband would get mad at me because God, my network was held together by duct tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, me too. Lisa did the ultimate insult.  She said, well, we could just bring Russell in and do it.  And that was like, oh, just stab me in the heart.  You're married to the tech guy and you want to bring in Russell?  Just kill me now.  So I wouldn't let her because I have too much pride.  But it also put the pressure on. I had to find a solution that worked.  Yeah. But this where the Eero works great.  I'm really and the speed is very good.  Not hugely better, but very good.  And the coverage is a lot better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we've got coverage all the way from our garage to our rooftop deck.  Yeah. And we've only got three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah, but they're 200 bucks each.  Very expensive. I mean, the best routers you can get are 200 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, but how like as you start connecting more crap into your house, you're going to be like you need Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had Airport Express and Airport Extremes that didn't work.  Took those out, got a Asus AC3200, which is an excellent really my favorite Wi-Fi router, but it didn't have enough.  It didn't cover far enough.  So then I was using TP-Link Powerline adapters to get the Wi-Fi out into the edges.  And oh my God, it was just it was a nightmare.  This just worked. It's great.  So thank you. I apologize to Eero for that.  But I was I just could never get it working now that it is.  I'm very happy with it. Eero.  But Luma is very similar, right? That's similar.  But I think 100 bucks less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is. It's 100 bucks less.  Similar mesh network.  Their angle is security and parental controls, although Eero just announced parental controls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? They have a really kind of nice parental control where you can say this MAC address, this one right here.  This is off during dinner and after 9 p.m. Love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish I will say, though, here's my here's my complaint.  I want to know what my devices are. And right now when I look, just God, people name your freaking devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree. I can. And you can, by the way, if you figure it out, you might have to use the MAC address.  You can name it. You can reserve an IP address for it.  I do port forwarding with it. It's not as sophisticated as like the AC3200.  It doesn't have nearly the number of settings. Doesn't seem to have QoS.  A lot of the stuff is done in the cloud, which means you don't know if it's being done or not.  They say they're, for instance, that they're noting what kinds of devices you have and tuning your network to work best with a Roku or Apple TV or whatever you have attached.  I have to take that on faith. But it does. It works quite well.  And I'll be curious about the Luma and then I'll get a plume to as I'm sure you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll keep you up on this. But I'm still you to have to answer the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get the euro. Which one you buy? Well, you can only buy one right now.  That's the only one available is the euro. I know that. But it works.  I think the two negatives are price. Three negatives are price.  The fact that you have to give them a real phone number or email address, you have to have an account with them.  They say that's so that they can keep it up to date, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they said it because it's in lieu of a password because the CEO noted that everybody was using like Wi-Fi one, two, three, four.  And that was crappy security. So they changed their setup.  OK, that works. So it is more secure that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say they update constantly, which is unlike any router you've ever used before.  Yeah. And the third negative is it doesn't have as many fiddly bits.  That may be a positive, depending on who you are.  But it does all the things I have a server running on inside the network and it works fine with board forwarding.  And the fact that I can do a reservation so I can lock in an IP address and do poor forwarding is nice.  So anyway, I think I would I would not hesitate to recommend it if you don't mind spending five hundred bucks.  And you can add more, by the way, five bucks gives you three.  But if you want to add a few more, you can't because it's mesh.  And I'm Stacey's using it in a better way, which is she's got Ethernet to all of them.  But I'm using it Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And if you use it Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi, you're going to see a slight drop in your speeds.  That's true of all repeaters.  Yes, that's how that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So your pick, I'm sorry, Stacey, I didn't mean to interrupt your pick,  but I just wanted to thank you and apologize for dissing your ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't take my tech as personally, I think, as you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I take it very personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, you can hate my routers.  I hate your router.  My pick is an app called Lexa, which is kind of like Echo Sim.  But what it does, the cool thing is you don't have to have your own Echo.  You just have to have an Amazon account and you can treat it like an Echo.  So let me do this because I got to make my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And don't confuse this with the Dutch Lexa dating for singles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't know that.  That's also on Google Play.  This is what it looks like.  I can't do reverse stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got a big button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And when you press the button.  I'm not sure what went wrong.  Oh, she didn't hear me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry.  I'm not sure what went wrong.  You pushed the button, but you didn't say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. I was like, I froze.  I didn't know what to ask her because I realized I don't have any lights or anything that could turn on and off in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's from UCIC.  If you're searching for it on the app store, is it only Apple or is it Android, Android and iOS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the company that it's hard to find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the problem.  Search for UCIC.  Lexa, UCIC, I think I actually went to an article about it and then click the link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's basically an echo in your pocket.  So you could use it again.  I showed you an app a couple of weeks ago called Rogers that you could turn it into a remote control.  But here they say and because I have my Amazon account tied to my Echo and dot, I can't try this.  So I'm curious if someone who doesn't have one can try it and see.  I doubt it would control your smart home stuff because that needs the radios and stuff in your house.  But you could ask it all the things you ask at the Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Huh.  Lexa, L-E-X-A by UCIC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They just used the API that was put out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I assume so.  This company is kind of cool.  It's been around for a long time.  They started out building something that was almost exactly like the Echo.  But Amazon did it way better.  Give me a fart noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, ask for a fart.  But you have to first say, add the ask for a fart skill, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Add the ask for a fart skill.  She's not quite sure how to help you with that.  Yeah, maybe that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a really interesting idea.  But of course, Amazon should just build this into the Alexa app and it'd be a game over.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This company is probably this is what they've encountered their entire life.  Right.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe they should try to find some greenfield technology they could get involved in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So maybe this is the one that let's.  This is the one.  That maybe Amazon will buy them, but I kind of doubt it.  I use it as a remote for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Add the ask for a fart skill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't find the answer to the question I heard.  That's even her voice, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of cool.  Buy underpants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Based on Leo's order history, I found a Cootherman's emergency underpants dispenser.  It's seven dollars and fifty seven cents total to order it.  Tell me Leo's voice code.  Never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I already have a pair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There you go.  It's an emergency underpants dispenser.  Yes.  How does it dispense underpants, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's at home.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't really hang it on the wall.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Reach over and hold out a pair of pants.  It's it's possibly a joke app, but I didn't get that joke novelty.  But I didn't get that feeling at the feeling it was really a response to it.  Perceived me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, maybe it's for like depends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe it's like, yeah, or you had an accident or something and you need something in an emergency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really want to know more about that.  I'll just look it up on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, here's here's in our chat room.  They have a an article apparently about it from here's the here's a picture anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Always ready to use.  Yeah, I do.  I have underwear that's not ready to use.  Just grab and go.  Oh, actually, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of pricey.  It's 13 bucks for one pair.  Great gag gift.  Useful as well.  It's a gag gift.  It's useful.  Oh, no, there's five pairs.  There's five pairs and secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, there's also a one pair.  Archie McPhee's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, if it's from Archie McPhee, it's not serious.  Oh, OK.  Jeff, your number of the week.  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was trying to figure out how to dispense underpants or dispense with them as the case  may be.  So in 1995, Kurt Vonnegut gave a lecture in which he said that you could take all the  stories there were, put them in a computer and figure out the shape of them.  And indeed, now, Andrew Reagan at the Computational Story Lab at University of Vermont in  Burlington and a few pals analyzed 1700 stories and found six core trajectories, which I love.  So here they are.  One, a steady ongoing rise in emotional balance, as in a rags to riches story such as Alice's  Underground Adventures Underground.  Two, a steady ongoing fall in emotional balance, as in a tragedy such as Romeo and Juliet.  Three, a fall, then a rise, such as the man in a hole story discussed by Vonnegut.  Four, a rise, then a fall, such as the Greek myth of Icarus.  Five, rise, fall, rise, such as Cinderella.  And six, fall, rise, fall, such as Oedipus.  So that's it.  There are no new stories.  There are only six.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That kind of makes sense.  It does.  Yeah.  And it really all has to do with the rise and the fall.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be that narrative arc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's called the arc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can see the shape of the arc, yes.  Wow.  Which is very cool.  There's a video as well, apparently.  I didn't watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's interesting is that it really did.  I mean, it's real.  It's not...  Yeah.  Huh.  My tip comes from Tech Republic.  I love you, Tech Republic.  Jason Heiner's publication.  And I was going to kind of do it, but I think I'll just refer to the article.  It turns out, and I did not know this, that Google Keep has transcription capabilities.  It can OCR an image.  Did you know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google did the world's worst voice transcription I've ever had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I cannot make any sense of it.  Well, it's famous for that.  I don't have any images, unfortunately, in my Google Keep.  But the idea is if you have an image that has text in it...  I used to use Evernote for this.  Evernote raised their fee about 40% on the Evernote premium.  And I'm probably going to stick around because I haven't found anything anywhere near as good.  But I have been looking at alternatives.  And Keep would be one of the obvious alternatives.  Keep is Google's free notekeeping...  There it is.  Free notekeeping app.  The problem is that Keep, it's all on one page.  It doesn't really have the kind of organizational features.  In general, I use it just to do the most shopping lists and the most recent stuff.  But if you have an image in there, it turns out that once you've got the image, you can open the note,  click on the three-dot menu, and from the pop-up, there is a menu item, Grab Image Text.  And it will do it instantly because, of course, Google has more CPU cycles than God.  And you can quickly get the text from an image using Google Keep.  And here's the Tech Republic demo.  They had some poster from iZombie.  If you scroll down a little bit there, Karsten, you can see that it adds the text.  And it does a pretty, at least at this example, pretty credible job.  Unfortunately, I don't have any images in my Keep.  And I meant to do that before the show today.  But just thought I'd pass it along as a useful tip.  It's there in the menu item on your notes.  If you have images with text, try the OCR free and built into Google Keep.  If I may.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's see here.  So I thought it's like when you wake up in the middle of the night, you think you have a good idea.  I was driving and I had to make a note.  I'll use Keep.  Yeah.  And you transcribed it.  Google Privacy, first level, three practices, one transparency, salute transparency,  about 10 smartest people to accessibility, 3,000,  you expression of the value to both parties and resume before I'm watching that thought you were asleep  to write a review about relation and said he was working Christmas wishing well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I understand perfectly.  It makes as much sense as anything I write.  Yeah, when I wake up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the middle of the night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That makes perfect sense.  Exactly.  Oh, my friends, I hate to do it, but it's time to say good night.  Bye, Lassie.  You guys is great.  I am really thrilled to have Stacey Higginbotham part of the team.  Now, this is the core team.  We are we've been talking to Dan Lyons and he's been traveling as much as you, Jeff.  So we're hoping to get him on the team as well.  And that'll be a lot of fun.  He's, of course, the former fake Steve Jobs, one of the funniest guys in tech reporting  and most recently worked at Silicon, the TV show Silicon Valley, where he was a staff writer.  And he has a book called Disrupted, which is wonderful.  So we hope to get him on very soon.  Meanwhile, you can find Stacey at Stacey on IOT.com.  Subscribe to her newsletter because who wouldn't want more Stacey in their inbox?  I say every week.  Thank you so much for being here, Stacey.  We appreciate it.  Jeff Jarvis is at Buzz Machine dot com.  That's his blog.  Don't forget, if you are looking for a good journalism school, there's none better than CUNY.  You can find him.  Find him there during the season.  Professing.  That's what he does.  Also a regular contributor to medium.  Thanks, Jeff.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to argue with you on the journalism school.  Oh, yeah. You got a better one.  I got my alma mater.  Is that U of T?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is U of T.  Hook him horns.  Or is that New York here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, did you study with the wonderful Rosenthal Alvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did.  He taught my favorite class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was international reporting.  He used to tell us to meet him outside and he would pretend to be a Colombian dictator and he would hold a press conference.  Oh, fun.  It was awesome.  I had him and let's see, Rusty Todd, who whenever we would come in, he used to work at the Wall Street Journal and he did financial journalism.  And the class was held at the end of the closing of the Wall Street.  And we'd have to come in and write an earnings story or a stock market story.  We had 20 minutes.  Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Real world experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So not all of U of T was that way.  But those were guys.  Those were good.  Jeff, I'm sure you're the best journalism school in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was actually.  I'm just I'm just odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
