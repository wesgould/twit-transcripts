Great to be back.  Thanks to Tom Merritt for filling in on the show last week when I was at NAB.  Also here, Jeff Jarvis from Buzz Machine.  Fuzzy, very fuzzy.  We're in Toronto, that's why.  In Toronto.  The entire country's out of focus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the haze in the air from all the cold and moisture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it cold up there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I left New York where it was 70 and up here I'm wearing two coats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do love Toronto though.  I love going up.  You know what I would like to go to is the film festival up there.  It's fantastic.  Yeah.  Have you ever been to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I haven't.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd love to do that.  They should do a North by North East.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Instead of a South by Southwest, do North by North East.  Let's do it.  I'll talk to Amber.  Yeah.  It's a great idea.  Nobody would go because everybody wants to go to Austin.  You know it's like 90 degrees in Austin today.  Speaking of Canada, you're up there by Waterloo, which is where RIM is, the Blackberry folks.  Look what I have in my little hands here, a seven inch tablet.  Just came out yesterday.  It's the Blackberry Playbook.  I bought this.  I actually had handled it before because I brought it on to Regis and Kelly.  This is the 16 gigabyte Wi-Fi edition, which is $4.99, same as an iPad.  It's just starting off.  Look it, I have to update my tablet.  Again?  Again.  I already did one.  I guess I have another one.  What a play.  First update was 227 megabytes.  This one says it's 141 megabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How long has this been out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It came out yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This isn't unusual.  They have to fix these things.  They realize after they put it out, oh, this is 287 megabytes.  Well, we'll come back in a couple of days and we'll take a look.  We do have somebody asking the chat room, do you have a Zoom?  We do have a Zoom.  We got a Zoom for our All About Android show.  Jason Howell and Eileen Rivera host that show on Mondays on the channel.  All About Android covers Android phones, Android tablets, Android stuff.  Great show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I met a great Twit fan at what used to be recording for the blind and dyslexic is now  called Learning Ally and he already is a fan of the Android show.  Yeah, it's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really a great show.  You can get that twit.tv slash AAA All About Android.  I ordered it and I might get it before the show is over.  I think this is the current hot Android phone.  It changes every week.  T-Mobile's G2X, which is basically an LG Optimus 2X, Tegra 2 phone, 4-inch IPS screen,  and a lot of people are raving about it.  Cyanogen has already said that he's got one and he's going to start doing his C7 mod for  it.  So we're going to let AAA root it because you know what?  It comes with Froyo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that was my next question.  Isn't that sad?  Yeah, root that sucker instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the deal?  It's a Google experience phone.  They didn't have any LG sugar on top of it, but they didn't give it gingerbread, which  is really strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a phone.  But I'm hearing really from the people who already have it in their hot little hands,  I'm hearing very good things.  What happened is I had a Nexus S. I like the Google experience phones.  Those are the vanilla Google phones.  I even lost hers in New York or Boston.  So I gave her my Nexus S, which Google had given me.  And then I went back to my Nexus One, which you still use a Nexus One, right, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am still rocking the Nexus One.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love, love, except it doesn't have enough memory for applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the problem, right?  Yep.  So I've been drooling kind of over the Nexus S for a while.  But yeah, I just need more room to store stuff on it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I've been really wanting to buy a Thunderbolt or something.  But A, I want the Google experience and B, I'll be honest, I want a dual processor.  If I'm going to get a new phone, why get a single processor phone, right?  So there are a couple of dual processor choices.  This is the G2X's one.  There's a Galaxy S4G on Sprint, but I think that's single processor also.  There's the Atrix, which I wasn't going to get because that's AT&T.  I have enough of them.  And then I was waiting for the Droid Bionic from Motorola, but that's got Motorola Blur  on it.  I'm not a fan of blur.  So as soon as I saw the G2X, I said, okay, good.  Google experience, dual processor, check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But must jailbreak, not jailbreak, must root, right?  Because you don't want to deal with rodeo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They say they're going to put gingerbread on it quick, but I don't know how quick.  And you're right.  And this is a chance for me to let Eileen and Jason ruin my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She loses them, she ruins them.  Boy, you just can't give her a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That way I own them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at the matrix that you just laid out of all your decisions about what you wanted  a phone and what you need to do.  Can you expect a regular consumer to make those decisions like the Google experience  versus blur versus different processors, versus the different rodeo, gingerbread, honeycomb  even is sort of confusing.  I mean, and it's not even like a sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what I tell people now, because of course I talk to normal people, not on this show  ever, but on the radio show, that's the normal people show I do.  And so what I tell them is good news.  If you wanted a good smartphone, you used to have to use AT&T for an iPhone.  Now you're going to go AT&T Verizon.  But I said what you now can do is what you used to do in 2000s, pre 2007, which is choose  a carrier first, one that you like, one that has good customer service, most importantly,  one that has good connectivity where you are.  If you want 4G, that's a consideration.  So choose your carrier first.  And then I think, to be honest, at best there are one or two choices on sprint, T-Mobile,  AT&T Verizon.  It's not like you have eight choices for each.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think starting with carrier is a really good way to go about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That narrows it way down.  And I think, and I, boy, I'll fight to the finish on this one.  I think having choice is better than no choice.  I agree.  I know it confuses people.  If the, I mean, you still have choice because you have to choose iPhone or, you know, but  now this brings up the big story of the week in some ways, Samsung versus Apple.  Apple says Samsung intentionally designed the Galaxy S to look like an iPhone to confuse  consumers down to the Samsung interface, which is a grid icon grid interface, the design  of the phone to look like an iPhone with a home button and everything.  What do you guys think?  Merit to this case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If Apple thinks that's what makes the iPhone special, then they're thinking poorly of themselves.  It's not what makes the iPhone special at all.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know that is the question, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  It's just another smartphone and all these phones are a bit alike.  But I think Apple is unique and people, I think even the real people you talk to on  the radio know it's unique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I said.  That's what I said.  And Neil I Patel, who we had on a tweet this week, or no, I'm sorry, Macbreak Weekly yesterday,  said, no, no, my mother wouldn't know the difference.  I think that's really insulting to normal people.  I think normal people can tell.  He said, but if you went into Verizon pre-iPhone and said, I want an iPhone, what Verizon would  say is, well, we don't have the iPhone, but we have something just like it, which is probably  true.  And they'd show them an Android phone, probably the Galaxy S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It goes back to Trio and Blackberry.  Can you own a whole category?  Are they going to start trademarking a category now, patenting a category?  It gets to be too much.  Gina, what about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  I'm looking at pictures of it right now and it does look a lot like the iPhone.  I have to say.  But yeah, I mean, this seems just like a total waste of time on Apple's part.  It's true.  I mean, how many things can you sue over?  And there are pretty clear differences.  I mean, I don't know.  Is my mom going to know the difference?  I don't know.  Is someone who doesn't use the technology a lot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does your mom know the difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Listen, I don't know the difference between some Nissans and Toyotas.  So?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in fact, Neelay said that this is a very common lawsuit subject in car dress,  that there's frequent Ferrari sues all the time for people who imitate their trade dress.  One of the issues was trade dress.  Now, here is the Galaxy S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It says Samsung on top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  If you really wanted to hide it.  Okay, here's something that maybe look at the icons.  So on the left, Apple on the right Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the icon side by side is a pretty strong case.  I got to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It should have been a blue phone icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the phone you can give them, but it is green with a gradient.  I mean, they're close.  They're pretty darn close.  The gear in both.  I don't know.  I think this one is a...  I don't think this is a slam dunk by any means.  Who knows what a judge and jury are going to say?  Apple wants an injunction that forbids them from selling this phone.  They say that they infringe on patents as well.  So there's more than just the trade dress and the copyright infringement.  But I think the crux of it is would a consumer, I asked Neelay this and he agreed, would a  consumer be fooled?  Is there an intent on Samsung's part to fool or trick users into thinking they were making  an eye for something that if it's not an iPhone, at least it's just like an iPhone?  I agree with you.  I think nobody's fooled by this and it's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the sincerest form of flattery.  I mean, Apple should be standing out there and saying we're way ahead.  Everybody wants to copy us.  Of course they do.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You agree, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do.  I do.  And this is Apple's whole thing, right?  Yeah.  I mean, the copy machines, wasn't that one of their ads at a formal Mac world?  I mean, yeah, exactly.  Sincerest form of flattery.  And this is what happens when you have a successful product.  Other products borrow ideas from them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, remember, Apple sued Microsoft over the trash can.  Microsoft called it a recycle bin, but it was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, clearly the trash.  And they lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, Neelay says that was a flawed suit and they know better now about how to pursue such  a thing.  But I think that a court's going to say, no, this is how technology innovation happens.  Somebody comes up with an idea, the idea perhaps to have a touch screen that fills the front  of the phone and it makes sense.  And everybody else does it.  Somebody has a home...  The funny thing is the Samsung does not have just a home button.  It has a middle button, but it has, as all Android phones do, it has other buttons down  the bottom.  Yeah, there's a grid of icons, but that kind of makes sense.  If you're going to have icons, what are you going to do?  Put them in a circle?  Of course, I should point out Microsoft didn't with Windows Phone 7.  They were very careful not to do this grid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the home screen by default, the pictures I'm looking at, I mean, you can do widgets.  It's not just the plain grid of icons.  Oh, but the Samsung...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the Samsung Sugar.  So that's the thing.  Yes, you're right.  Vanilla Android, the phone I'm getting, a Samsung Galaxy Nexus S will be widgets and  all that stuff.  But the Samsung UI does look a lot like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm.  Hmm.  I don't think there's merit, but this stuff takes 10 years.  And it definitely has...  It employ a lot of lawyers.  Well, the funny thing is Samsung is Apple's biggest supplier.  They make the A5 chip in the iPad.  They make the A4 chip in the iPhone.  They make all the SSDs and the RAM and all this stuff.  It's kind of funny.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'd be suicidal and they can't do it, but it'd be fun if they just said, okay, fine,  cut off Apple and cut off their air supply for a month or two to find new suppliers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and this was something that Neelai said also is that it has to do with the structure  of Samsung.  Because it's a big Korean Koretsu, each division is almost autonomous.  So in fact, the phone division has to bid for processors from the processor division  against Apple.  So the processor division is not going to shoot themselves in the foot.  They're going to continue to do business.  I think it's interesting.  I don't like it.  Yes.  Moving on.  Yeah, I think compete, don't litigate is just seems like that's the right way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's the American way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, actually litigation is the American way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It depends on who you're talking to, I guess.  The idealist versus the realist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, I'm going to, we're going to take a break for an ad, but I want to ask you guys,  I'm going to give you a minute as I do the ad to think about, to help me out.  So you know, the G8 is coming up in May in Deauville, France, President Sarkozy, the  host of this.  And he is convening a couple of days before the 24th and 25th of May, a blue-ridden panel  of internet entrepreneurs to create a white paper for the G8 summit on how government  should treat the internet, particularly the government and the internet and the economy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We know Eric Schmidt's been invited.  Mark Zuckerberg has been invited for some reason that I still haven't quite figured out I was  invited.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Congratulations, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's awesome.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was bizarre, but I am too, because I think that the existing big business has kind of  an entrenched interest in the status quo.  Look at Google Verizon.  Amen.  And I want to step up and say, look, if you want innovation, if you want an economic future,  you can't let the entrenched interests determine your policy.  They've already made it.  Don't let them pull the ladder up.  The future of your country, of our country, of all the G8 countries relies on an open  internet to encourage innovation, to encourage fluid, friction-free economy.  This is vitally important.  So yes, I know it's the tendency of a national, of a government to look to the current business  for guidance, but your stakeholders include the future and maybe even more importantly  include the future.  And don't forget that when you consider it an impact on the government.  So anyway, I just said what I thought I might say, but I'd love to get your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When is it, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  May 20th.  I have to find the invitation.  I think 24th and 25th.  It's a Tuesday and Wednesday, so I won't be here for Twig.  But if I can, I will report back.  There's, you know, I got the, I got the, it's kind of mind boggling.  I got the schedule.  First of all, I get a letter in French from Nicholas Sarkozy.  So that's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bonjour, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm framing that.  And at the end it says, my rough translation, I hope you will take this as a measure of  my esteem.  I cannot figure this out.  I think somebody like Cedric Ingram at Planet Cran or somebody in France, maybe Loic Lemur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's Loic.  Loic was an advisor to Sarkozy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Loic is going.  So I actually, I thought it was a hoax.  This is how little I think of myself.  I thought, oh yeah, April Fool's a little late.  You're like Loic is messing with me.  So I emailed Loic and said, do you know anything about this?  Is this for real?  He said, yes, for real.  I'm going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See you there.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I made my reservation.  I'm going to try to bring my daughter who lived in France for a year and who is even  more than I represents the future.  A 19 year old who is like your son, Jake, who is the real stakeholder here.  Let's not mortgage their future for Verizon, Google, the record industry, the movie industry.  So anyway, yeah, I'm really so excited, but I'm also completely intimidated and terrified.  Apparently Zuckerberg has been invited, Schmidt, Jeff Bezos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the thing, Leo, you're the representative of the people.  They're all companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I'm going to try to say.  I'm a small company, but I'm but more than that's what I'm trying to say.  I come here.  My portfolio is to represent the people, the people who use the Internet.  And furthermore, I mean, there are plenary sessions, but there's working groups.  We break off into groups.  We create a recommendation.  This is a genuine.  This isn't just like, hey, hey, you don't have a cocktail party and shake Carla Brune's  hand.  This is really a working two days in which we're supposed to create a recommendation  for the G8 Summit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eric Schmidt, Jimmy Wales, Jack Ma, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg.  Look at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, some horrible mistake was made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am not worthy to be on the Skype call right now.  Not worthy.  No, that's awesome, Leo.  I'm so proud of you.  That's awesome.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's one of those things where I go, oh, forget it.  I'm not going to that.  But I feel a real obligation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As you should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To speak up for us.  So I don't know if I'm the right person to do it, but I got tapped.  So I'm going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm going to send you if you, with your permission, I'm going to send you my manuscript  because the last two chapters are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I would love that.  Jeff, I mean, I really, if you please any, I want to hear from you.  Tell me what I should say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some of you have heard here on the show, but yeah, this is important.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, thank God I've been doing this show for the last year and a half.  I think I've learned a little bit from you too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should really, I think you should try to recruit twig guests.  I think that should be your, your main mission.  Hey, Bill, you want to be on twig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, Jeff, we talk about you a lot.  Come on to show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just calling.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, there's this podcaster here.  Keeps trying to get people to see that guy with the gray hair.  Stay away from him.  It's really pushy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you hear that guy with the happy voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's with him?  Who let him in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, this is all about Jeff and creating disruption, you know, creating frameworks  in which disruption can happen, can happen.  Innovation can happen, right?  That's where you want to go with this.  Jarvis is your man.  I just know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I end the book with a quote from Schmidt, you know, ironically, because I go both sides  on him, but just saying that he blesses that the fact that the internet was made such that  24 year olds in a garage could do what they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  And it was Larry and Sergey, but it's not anymore.  And who's the next?  Exactly.  And I just feel like I'll walk in the door and the master control will say, he's not  any kind of plutocrat, Sark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's a user.  Throw me out.  Plutocrats only in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it'll be worth the whole trip.  What's your bank balance, son?  Can you kiss Carly Rooney's hand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, my daughter, who's very excited, of course, said, well, she didn't say, will I  meet Sarkozy?  She said, well, I meet Carla.  I've been pledged to get Carla's autograph for Tom Merritt, believe it or not.  He's a big fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's too much information, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know Glee's one thing, but Carla, Brunet.  I see. See again with my mouth.  Nicholas, I'm sorry.  I love her. She's beautiful.  She's wonderful. I love her singing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I do too. It's fine for her.  It's just scaring me about your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to get uninvited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We need to get those headphones back in your ears to make you do the four minutes of  silence.  Blow those suckers up again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to try to shut up for the next month so that they don't know we've let a  subversive in.  Let's talk a little bit about FreshBooks and then we will continue.  And I will. I would like to get your advice, frankly, because I don't I don't I am not  worthy. Believe me.  FreshBooks, of course, the easy online invoicing service that I first found out about in  2004. That's when they started.  Amber MacArthur was a big fan.  A Toronto company, Jeff, actually.  And that's how she knew about them.  She knew them. And of course, since 2004, I and two million other folks have used FreshBooks  to change our lives.  If you're a freelancer, an independent contractor, if you have to invoice to get paid.  I got the wrong lower third up.  Let me just put this up.  FreshBooks.com.  There you go. They're both blue.  That's what fooled me.  FreshBooks.com is the way to do your invoicing.  Look, we all we all hate invoicing.  Anybody who's ever invoiced is just a pain in the butt.  But here's the deal. You upload your logo.  They actually have automated invoicing, which is fantastic.  They'll automatically send it out.  And you can even if your client agrees, have automatic payment, which is, you know, most  clients would agree to that because they don't want it.  It's just as hard for them to do all the payments as it is for you to do the invoicing.  That's why they love those emails from FreshBooks users, because there's just a button on  there that says pay it now with a credit card or one of 11 authorized payment services  like PayPal authorized net to go.  And if they don't pay automated late payment reminders, which make it easy to collect,  there are clients I know who still want paper invoices.  They do that, too.  And they even have FreshBooks on your iPhone or on your desktop so that you can track  hours and then automatically put them right into the invoice.  So many great features.  And now you can try it free, free for the first three clients.  Go to FreshBooks.com and sign up today.  Free forever for the first three clients.  I think for a lot of us, that's all we ever need.  FreshBooks.com makes invoicing easy, easy peasy.  You got to use I'm sure you still send out invoices, right, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Occasionally, although I'm pretty full time now.  Really?  At ThinkUp?  Yeah, at Export Labs.  Yeah, it's kind of my full time gig.  So I'm not invoicing as much.  But yeah, I would definitely do FreshBooks if I was 1099ing, you know, a lot more.  It's a lot easier.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I need to get my wife to take over my invoicing because I'm terrible at it.  And maybe if I can get FreshBooks, maybe I'll convince her to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She'll do it.  I mean, it's actually it's fun.  She doesn't yell at me.  It's really fun.  Did you see that Eric Schmidt, besides the fact that he's no longer the CEO of Google,  got a raise?  He was earning a dollar a year.  Is this a number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's not.  Would have been, it's not.  Yeah, what's the percentage increase there?  I won't say.  It's not a number.  It's not a number.  It's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was earning a dollar a year.  Of course, because he's an owner, he's one of the wealthiest men in the world.  He doesn't really need to get a salary.  Steve Jobs did the same thing, but he's going to get a raise.  What is it to 1.25 million dollars?  What is the percentage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is a raise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need a big calculator to do that with a potential six million dollar bonus.  So I just think that I, you know, I've been talking to people.  He was kicked upstairs, but it's pretty clear by Larry Page because the first thing Larry  does is create a new gang of six.  Marissa Meyer, not a member.  And this is his little hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I disagree and agree at the same time, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know more than I do.  You've been inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't know much more than you do at all.  But you know, when I saw him, he nodded at what I'd written about this.  I do think that we forgot, as I said on the show before, that it was always his job to  prepare.  He was the Prince Regent preparing Larry and it is their company.  It's not his company.  And so once that happens, once Larry is really in charge, then he's got to be really in  charge.  And yeah, Eric's still there and Eric's on the board and Eric's love advice.  But Larry, I think the key to Larry's reign is that he had to put his own team in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess so.  I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you guys talk?  I think this was an agreement from the beginning.  We're going to bring in the dad to kind of bring up Larry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and that's what Eric tweeted is, OK, time is over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, that's a nice raise, though, that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's on top of a hundred million dollar stock grant.  Of course, you can't get that money for till 2015.  So they just want to make sure he's not on the street, that he makes sure he comes to  the board meetings with shine shoes and a nicely pressed suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So just a little.  I hear you're getting the same percentage here at Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a little walking around money for for Eric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll put on a tie for that, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You start off higher than he did, so it's going to be really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, his percentage is actually more.  Because he started so low.  We saw Scoble took pictures of there was a lot of press on the Facebook, the new  Facebook open server farm thing.  Google's also planning a little investment.  Hundred million dollar investment in a wind farm.  There have been complaints about the Facebook  operation center up in Oregon because it's running basically on power from coal  fired plants. That's a good that and Mark Zuckerberg's dog

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Beast took a pee on the floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, that's green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is green, which was on the on on Beast's Facebook page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got my dog with me.  Ozzie's with me right now.  I don't know.  Bring Ozzie on camera.  Do not be inspired. He's sleeping.  I let sleeping dogs.  What does they say about sleeping dogs?  Tell untruths.  Tell no tales. That's right.  Ozzie, are you I'll show him later.  Once the playbook is updated, he might want to play with that for a little bit.  This has happened several times.  Unable to download software update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What what's up with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. It keeps trying.  It's downloaded some stuff, but these are hundreds of megabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you even set up the network for it or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. The first thing you have to do is plug it in because it's got some power.  But there's a plug this in and then get on your Wi-Fi, which I did.  And maybe our Wi-Fi is I don't know.  Maybe it's our Wi-Fi. But this is hunt.  I mean, literally at least two 200 plus megabyte updates before I can even use  this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So popular, everybody's downloading at the same time.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe. You know, I think we don't talk enough about how expensive,  environmentally expensive our Internet use is.  But Google search uses energy.  And to Google's credit, this is from CNET's Green Tech column,  Martin Lamonica editors, is to Google's credit, they're trying to find  sustainable energy sources.  They will invest 100 million dollars in the Shepherds Flat Wind Project in Oregon.  Everything's in Oregon.  This is its second investment in renewable energy in the last two weeks.  It would be enough energy for 235,000 average US homes.  Now, the Facebook  network operation centers, I think they put two or three online.  Each is using enough power for a town of 40,000 people.  They also invested 186 million in a solar power plant last week.  Google.org is one of its three main causes is energy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they fully acknowledge that it's in their best interest that they can get the  cost of clean renewable energy to be cheaper than coal.  It's hugely beneficial to Google and, of course, to all mankind.  And Google can afford this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. It's an investment in their future and our future interests are aligned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is kind of this is where we're at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very rare.  There's a nexus in between corporate profit interests and our interests.  And I think it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's great for business and for marketing for them to make them look like  the good guys for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. They did pretty well this quarter, although the stock market kind of spanked  Larry Page. Apparently, they wanted Larry to come on and explain.  Explain to me, Larry, why costs were up so much.  He just came on, said, hey, and left without answering questions.  And the stock took a little news dive, even though Google announced.  Eight point five, eight billion dollars in revenue in the first quarter.  That's a 27 percent increase year to year.  And a net income of two profit.  Of two point three billion dollars, that's only a mere modest gain.  Of seven hundred million dollars over the first quarter 2010.  Oh, but the real issue.  And I think the reason the stock took a hit first was that the analysts  predicted more. Second was expenses were up 33 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And one guess on that is is personnel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They hired 2000 employees this quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hired a lot and they're having to pay a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. They're paying for top talent. Right.  Yeah. And all those ice cream sandwiches and gingerbread men  for Android releases. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and and all the money that reportedly they're giving people  who Twitter or Facebook's trying to steal to stick around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. To stick around. Yeah.  They're they're they're competing, right.  With with Facebook and Twitter for the best top talent.  So they're offering a lot of money. Bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep. Bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I offered Eileen five dollars not to go back to CNET.  She stuck around. Well, she hasn't told me yet.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the here's the number I thought.  Oh, I'm I can't do any stories with numbers in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, you can. The numbers on there already already have a number.  Oh, well, let me look at one you'd never guess. So it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'll look at the doc. That's what I should do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. We're safe here.  You're safe. We're doing Google Doc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're so way safe. It's a stretch.  Oh, that's a good number. I like it.  So I'll mention this number then.  Three hundred fifty thousand Android handsets being activated every day.  So that's what is that 15 times 700 is seven.  I mean, it's almost a million a month, right? Or no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo's responsible for five hundred ten million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I do I do my share.  I do my share. I do. I got a new one coming today.  I'll activate I'll be one of those  three hundred fifty thousand people activating today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll be a lot easier to activate that Blackberry thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look, new software is available. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, it's a few more megabytes to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So close. I've got two hundred twenty one megabytes of 287.  So close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's a piece of the app downloads are up 50 percent in the fourth quarter, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is I mean, look, there's just no question that Android's on a rampage,  which may be why Apple is so anxious to go after Samsung.  Maybe this is the beginning of a jihad against all Android devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. Yeah. Somebody pointed out they sidestepped Google in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So but I think a lot of they took the easy one because  they're going after much more direct  trade dress infringement on the part of Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're going after somebody for whom they are a huge customer.  But Apple has said something that I do, but sit down and and and.  Right. Self-flagellate. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple and Apple has said that they do believe that Android  haven't they? And Linux violate some of their patents.  I know Microsoft has said that.  I can't I can't keep track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, so someone calling himself Chipotle in Twitter,  otherwise known as Chip Clark, I don't think he works there, says about your summit.  Hopefully, Leo equals FDR and not Neville Chamberlain.  The responsibility is on you, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I shall not bring a furled umbrella and a bowler hat to meet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People are saying in Twitter, Leo is after all, the president of the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's what happened is that they saw my about.me page  and they got confused. Oh, I can hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how is the promotion?  Yes. Have that French gentleman lost something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Monsieur le Monsieur le président de l'Internet.  Bienvenue à Paris.  Where's your where's your Air Force one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, I came economy class on Delta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you seen the price of flying to Paris?  Short notice in May.  Oh, I can't even imagine Mr.  Sarkozy did not offer me a ticket.  That's all right.  I'm going to see if I can hitch a ride with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should go. Yeah, that's a good idea, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If there are any CEOs listening who are flying in their G8 to the G8.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I hitch a ride?  You stand out on the on the private jet airfield. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, you're going to the G8.  Need a lift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you should go on Kickstarter and send Leo to France.  That's a good idea.  Send Leo to France.  You know, the people the people who who who give you money, get a special report from Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But incidentally, we are actually we've applied to Kickstarter.  I don't know if they'll accept us, but we have applied to Kickstarter  to raise money for our new studio.  Ah, no, right on.  I thought that that seemed like an appropriate use of funds.  And this way, our community knows there's a direct connection.  And we've got some, you know, you have to give premiums.  It's like a public radio.  So I think for a hundred dollar donation, we're going to have your name on a brick  on the brick wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which when you're mad, you'll pull it out and throw it at somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You your brick might be used to be Tom Merritt.  It'll be amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I leave you lost another phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I say you bricked my phone, I mean, you bricked my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, that's a better idea, Leo.  The wall of Leo phones, you name one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, you know what?  We should add that for a donation.  You can have one of Leo's old piece of junk.  Leo's handsets, Leo's handsets and a lot of graph it.  That's a good idea. Nice.  There's a lot of lying around.  Old stuff.  Maybe this playbook, if it doesn't update itself,  this could be this could go straight straight to gazelle.com.  Instabrick, instabrick.  Maybe it's not going to go on.  Yeah, it's us.  And well, I'll keep trying.  So to this afternoon, President Obama will be at at Facebook.  And at the same time, Eric Schmidt's going to interview Tina Fey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you love that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Zuck gets Obama, Schmidt gets Fey, which are you going to watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're both going to be awkward as hell. Yeah.  That's the beauty part of it.  I mean, just obviously, Marissa had it was Gaga over Gaga.  I've got a crush on Tina Fey.  I think Tina Fey is magnificent, right? Oh, agreed. Right.  So you can just imagine Eric Schmidt, who must have a crush on her.  If he's if he's taken this duty, that's going to be hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to hear him giggle like Marissa did in front of Gaga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this was maybe part of his severance package.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get to interview Tina Fey.  That is a really awesome, awesome interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When he's at the G8, he gets to meet Carla Bruni.  Oh, oh, oh.  They said him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let me see, actually, I think the president is speaking right now.  He's doing a town hall meeting.  Is this I mean?  Wow, this has really become the Facebook has become the town hall.  Or is that a bad thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the journalism professor in me should get all hotty and say, well,  they're not journalists, they don't know what to ask for all that.  But bull, I think this is just the point.  You know, Larry Lessig has a really good new Larry Lessig PowerPoint up.  And, you know, Larry has his I love his way to do it.  This magnificent and it's very, very good.  And he was talking about the architecture and how we try to regulate  the wrong things, the wrong ways and  about how the architecture acts and the art, you know, it's code is law.  And he just broadened it.  And it occurred to me that what, you know, Andy Carver and I bring up  every other week, Chipotle every week, Lee every every third week.  But any Carver and what we're seeing is  news starting to be architected like the Internet end to end.  That the powers at the edges, right, the witnesses can speak directly to the public.  And if a journalist was to be in the middle and do add some value, fine.  But in a sense, I think Obama going to Facebook  is symbolically like him being online and as a bit of Internet architecture,  it's edge to edge.  Plus, I like that Silicon Valley  technology should be seen as a very important constituency.  I agree. Politicians to come and kowtow to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know what they usually do?  In fact, Obama's done it is they go to the CEOs and they have fundraisers  and they talk to them.  So I do like the idea that he at least if he's going to go to Facebook,  it's not just to talk to Zuck, it's to talk to everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  God, I wish he'd worn a hoodie.  Well, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mark Zuckerberg is wearing a white shirt and a tie.  Oh, I hope they show him again.  They haven't shown his footwear yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You wear a suit for the president.  I think you better. Period. Yeah, I think you better.  Yeah, this is cool. This is going on right now.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're saying that I should probably get a suit for the trip to France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK. I think you should have an Internet uniform.  Battle ribbons on it, right?  Is your Microsoft ribbon?  I'm the president of the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's here's Zuck. There is on a stool.  He looks like he's wearing a tennis, though.  Doesn't look like he's wearing.  Can I rewind this in any way?  I guess not.  Because you're not allowed to rewind the president.  But they showed him.  And yeah, it looks like he's wearing sneaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But is Schmidt on with Tina Fey at this very moment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple's earning call is in about 45.  No, it's right now.  Now, this will be the first time an Apple earning call  is kind of pretty much ignored by the tech press.  Let's see.  So where would I find Eric Schmidt and Tina Fey?  Would it be?  It won't. I can tell you one place it won't be Google Video.  We tried to get somebody from Google Video on.  And what did what did Karen Wickery say?  They're otherwise occupied.  They're what?  Re they're they're busy regrouping.  I think I understand why you've got YouTube.  You don't need Google Video.  In fact, I probably could, you know, I'm on record saying,  what's the deal?  But I like Google Video.  There was no you didn't have the same time limits.  There was some great documentaries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I don't understand is why they couldn't just port  the videos over to YouTube for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I heard a thought.  Oh, here's Zuck in his tie, by the way.  Oh, no, actually, he's got a nice black tie and he's rolled up his sleeves.  Oh, the president's going to roll up his sleeve, too.  Look, look, he's mirroring the Zuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have tie parody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my. He's loosened his tie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Zuck looks like such a grown up in a tie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good job, Mark. Infrastructure and clean energy.  So my question to kind of start off is what specifically do you think we should do  and what specifically do you think we can cut in order to make this all add up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let me first of all, Mark, share with you.  Roll up my sleeves because and then I think a lot of my ties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Loosen the tie.  I understand that it's a problem, but but aren't sure how it came about.  In in 2000, at the end of the you can watch this yourself, kids, if you want to see it.  But we actually had a we have a show to do.  I'm sorry, Mr. President.  And that was in. I'll see.  I'll see you in Doville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Mr. President.  We're with the real president.  We are with the president.  I'm sure what you have to say is important.  The Eighth Continent, the future man.  We got to talk about the old world, Obama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where can I find where can I find?  Would you see chat room if you can find Eric Schmidt talking to Tina Fey?  Charon could find it.  Charon will find it.  They could find anything. They'll find it.  They say Google it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google it.  We did find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like they're taking questions via moderator, but they're no longer taking those questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this for the president or Tina Fey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, Tina Fey.  So if you go to youtube.com slash at Google talks, it just says this is going on today.  And no longer accepting questions.  So they must be recording it.  And then we're going to edit edit together and probably put it in the same thing with Gaga.  Didn't they? Yeah, I think that's how it worked with Gaga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just in case Sarah giggles or says something's creepy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Either way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I mean, Tina's new book just came out, right?  Yeah, Bossy Pants.  So that must be what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did I tell you the greatest book blurb in history?  Book blurb is worth it.  Signed trees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's too damn funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She is so damn funny.  Do you watch 30 Rock?  Love 30 Rock.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's consistently original, which is why I like it.  It's very unpredictable.  It's as if 20 very funny monkeys wrote it.  I mean, it goes all over the place.  Sometimes it's non sequitur.  Sometimes it's wordplay.  Sometimes it's a pun.  You just never know where they're going to go with anything.  And the throwaway jokes, that's just out of the side of the mouth.  And you go, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then you pause it and then I pause it and laugh.  And then I play again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what did we say?  We said Google had 8.58 billion in gross revenue, 2.3 net income.  Apple announced in this earnings call going on right now.  24.67 billion in revenue, 10 times more.  And a profit of 5.99, almost three times the net.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  They sell really expensive hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.  Good for Apple.  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the reason I think, Jeff, that they, to get back to Google video,  that they didn't do that, and I think what I'd heard floated was  the concern about copyrights.  Really?  Yeah.  There's a lot of stuff on Google video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if they actually touched it, well, they could have created a routine  in which they make you do it, but you could just do it.  They're making you copy the stuff back to your own machine  and copy it back up, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought there is a move this to YouTube link.  I thought I read that somewhere.  No.  I'll be honest.  I haven't used Google video in a long time.  No. There's a download link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a download link.  Let's just download that.  Just download.  There is no move to YouTube.  There's no process to move to YouTube.  If you want to put it on YouTube, you have to download it and re-upload it.  Oh.  That makes no sense to me.  Must be a server issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It seems like that.  I don't know.  It can't be a server issue.  It has to be some sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not legal.  I smell lawyers.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I smell lawyers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google video did kind of feel redundant for quite some time, though.  It did.  It did with YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it was a kind of thing a geek like me likes.  It was not the most popular thing.  And YouTube is so overrun by little kids and Fred Figglehorn.  Right.  And it's 10 minutes, videos.  And so it seemed like the grown up version of YouTube, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  But the interesting thing is that this is indicative, I think, of Google's management.  Is that they should have killed it two months after buying YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Then it wouldn't have been such a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, no sense.  Well, we have a new and better video platform.  Goodbye.  Everybody say, OK.  Yeah.  That makes sense.  But some people seem to be a commitment to it.  And some number kept using it.  And it didn't make any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  There's a, what is that incredible BBC documentary?  Is it The Power of Dreams on the rise of the PR industry?  That's a must see.  And the only place I could ever find it is on Google Video.  I don't know where it will go now.  And I think it's because it's, in fact, one of the reasons it doesn't air anymore is  because, like eyes on the prize, there's a clearance issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking to look this up.  The Power of Dreams?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's The Power of...  Chatron, maybe you can help me out.  It's the story of, he was Freud's nephew and the creator of the public relations industry.  This guy was an amazing guy.  I did an Ignite speech on him once.  Oh, cool.  I can't remember his name, of course, because I'm old and I don't eat enough carbohydrates.  But he, for instance, he's widely credited with getting women the right to smoke.  In a suffragette rally in, I think the 1910s, he hired a bunch of comely young lasses and  they carried signs like, you know, now we can smoke.  And they were smoking.  And it was like power to the people.  You know, it was Virginia Slims.  He invented this stuff.  He's the guy who created Four Out of Five Doctors.  He was hired by the Pork Council to promote the sale of bacon.  So he asked doctors, is a hearty breakfast a good idea?  Four Out of Five Doctors said yes.  He somehow conflated that with eating more bacon and basically said Four Out of Five  Doctors say eat bacon.  Wow, amazing stuff.  The Persuaders?  That's a classic, but that's a later generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Century of Self?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's it. The Century of Self.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  God bless the chat room. Who needs a brain?  No, I don't. I've externalized them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, you know, this was Ray Kurzweil suggested that I just use the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a great scene in Evita where the army just marches together with a Parone.  The chat room seems like that with you, El Presidente.

Transcript:  So this guy transferred his VHS tape.  You can see it says EP and LR.  There's Freud.  And sad to say, this very classic, you've got to get it, download it or whatever.  Century of Self says this video will be removed April 29th, 2011.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Matthew Freud, who's the big deal PR in the UK now, is he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this guy's name was Edgar Bernays.  And he's widely considered the founder of public relations and ultimately advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting that Matthew Freud, who is it a Senator Freud,  is one of the big deal PR guys in the UK now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, Bernays, and there's by the way, that's the video of Edgar Bernays on the screen right  now. Bernays was Freud's nephew and thought Uncle Sigi had the right idea.  Uncle Sigi said that people were motivated by unconscious desires.  And he said, you know, we could apply this to advertising.  So at the time, I mean, basically when he started in 1910,  advertising was a serious catalog.  Here's what it does.  If you need it, buy it.  He's a guy who came up with the whole notion of, you know, you've got bad breath, you smell,  and girls would like you more if you smoke or drink or use right guard.  And really the whole advertising industry came about because of this insight  that you don't get people to buy stuff because they can actually use it or because it has  features they want. You get people to buy stuff by tricking them into thinking they  can't live without it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Triumphant as I am, I would like to think that the internet becomes an antidote to that.  I'm not so optimistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the point of my speech was that in an era where the consumer has access to  a huge amount of independent information, they become more information driven  and it no longer works.  People are much more sophisticated and cynical and no longer works to trick them.  They know better.  So in fact, what I said is our advertising has changed as a result of it.  All the ads that we do, for instance, on the Twitter network are about features and benefits  and they all have trial offers.  If you don't use hover.com, people will stare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you require that or you just tell them that's the only smart thing to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody would advertise with Twitter unless they got that, I think, to be honest,  because we're no good at tricking people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What this means is coming soon, we hope if we do our job right, free trials of burritos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They contacted us after our episode talking about the Chelsea restaurant.  Mr. Chipotle tweets sent us an email saying two things.  First of all, if you do do twig at blog world, please do it from the Chelsea burrito store  and we'll feed you.  And he also did raise the issue of maybe we should advertise because somehow  our sales seem to increase 38% every time your show is on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I made that last part.  Mission accomplished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get tweets all the time saying I heard you on twig so I went and tried it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's Edgar Bernays style advertising where we just talk about how delicious something is  and it makes you hungry and then you unconsciously your needs and desires  and you have to have a chipotle now.  So it's actually not the kind of advertising we do.  I really believe you're exactly right, Jeff, that you can no longer  get away as effectively as you used to with the deceiving people kind of ad.  You've come a long way, baby.  Cigarettes represent freedom and power for women.  You have to give them features and benefits.  I even go a step further with our advertisers.  I say you may only advertise if you come to our community  because that's where you're advertising to.  These are my people.  This is my community.  And come to them as an equal saying here's what we have to offer.  We trust your judgment.  Try it if you like it.  Use it if not, fine.  And you have to be part of the community.  And I think that that's really what is happening.  And I think it's one of the reasons that frankly new media advertising  does in fact work better than having an ad on Seinfeld.  It's not going to work for Coke because Coke has no features and benefits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meanwhile, the chat room web 4805 says Freud studied burritos for many reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sometimes a burrito is just a burrito.  Ladies and gentlemen, we did talk about features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patron is a feature.  Patron is a feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patron and the margaritas is a feature.  That's a feature.  Big feature.  With potentially benefits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think you're right.  I think we do talk about the features and benefits of a fine meal at Chipotle.  That sure tastes good.  That's a feature benefit.  Hey, actually, let me do an ad if you don't mind and then we'll be back with more.  We are talking about Google the Cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Free advertising for Chipotle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I keep giving it away.  What is that?  What's wrong with me?  This is a show where as you can see, we cover ideas.  And that's what I'm most proud about.  This is a smart show and I hope you are enjoying it.  We trust our audience as a smart audience and I think that's one of the reasons we have to do ads differently.  When you have a smart audience, you can't say you will smell bad if you don't use hover.com.  They just don't buy it.  What I do invite you to do is go to hover.com, twig.hover.com and try it out.  It is domain name registration made clean, made simple, made disappearing.  Above all, I'm trying to put the O back in domain.  Hover puts the O back in domain name registration.  How do you like that?  There is a slogan.  If you go to twig.hover.com, you will notice something right away.  They are not trying to upsell you.  There is no hover girls.  There is no dead elephants.  There is just a great clean site that does one thing and one thing simply.  Sell you domain name registration at a fair price.  twig.hover.com.  In fact, if you go there and use the coupon code twig when you buy, you will get 10% off.  I just bought leolaport.us.  I realized I didn't have that in leolaport.tv because I thought I should really have it.  It was so easy on hover.  It took me just a couple of clicks of the mouse.  If you do have problems, you won't.  But if you do, you can call their tech support number  and they guarantee no hold during business hours.  They also have, click this link, transfer your domain right here at twig.hover.com.  They have a domain name transfer concierge service.  You can do it yourself, but I tell you, it is such a pain to transfer a name  that I recommend this concierge service.  Now normally it is $25 flat fee for one domain or a thousand.  They just do it all for you.  You call them at 866-731-6556.  We are going to waive that fee for you right now.  So if you go to twig.hover.com, if you say you heard it on twig, they will not charge you  and they will move all your domains for you.  Domain name transfers are $10.  But really the transfers for you are getting another year for $10.  You are getting a renewal of your name for $10.  I think that is a great deal.  They do include who is privacy at no extra charge.  The other guys will try to sell you that.  They won't try to sell you hosting because they don't do that.  They will do email hosting and email addresses and email forwarding.  But that is it.  It is a great deal.  Domains start at $15.  I think I paid $25 for a .tv because they are more expensive.  But .us was $15.  They have .ca too if you are in Canada.  twig.hover.com.  Give it a try.  I think you will like it.  See?  Features and benefits.  Features and benefits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No dead elephants.  No dead elephants.  That is a good feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I am talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I do.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was one company, it was another domain registrar that capitalized on this.  They said something like, we will donate a dollar to PETA for everybody who signs up.  Brilliant.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that the number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that was not Hover.  You have got to think that has hurt GoDaddy.  Did I say that?  There is no reason to be coy.  Everybody knows what I am talking about.  Spain.  This is probably something for you Mr. Jarvis.  Spain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I want to go ahead.  I want to talk about the iPhone thing sort of related to this a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, we have got to talk about that too.  Yeah.  Well, let's start with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I added another thing to the list.  It is in turn related to that.  Everything is related to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we talked about this on security now.  This just came out today that the iPhone, for reasons not completely clear,  it logs everything everywhere you go.  And that file is stored on the iPhone and backed up to,  every time you connect your iPhone, backed up to your hard drive.  And it stores all your GPS data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then if you get a new iPhone or iPad, moves the file onto it.  It lives from device to device.  Wow.  Right.  Yeah.  And there is a new software that will actually grab the file and plot out for you,  all your GPS coordinates.  Right.  And it is not clear what this file is for, why Apple is storing it.  So it just sort of came out today.  Apple is storing it on your machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple is storing it on your machine, on your phone.  There is no evidence that they are taking it.  There is no evidence that they are getting it, but we do not know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it is funny.  I was talking to a friend of mine who has been using an Android phone for a while.  And she said, you know, I do not download apps because I always get that warning that  they need access to my contacts, they need access to my network and my location.  That kind of freaks me out.  I just want to get an iPhone because I do not want to have to worry about that stuff.  But the difference is that the iPhone does not tell you what it is doing.  As much as, you know, as Android tells you, and it is a little scary because it is like,  why do you need access to my location data?  But I would rather know than not know.  So I think this is what it is.  The issue with this is that they are just not transparent about it,  about what they are collecting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is another issue here, which is that this is a story I put up on the list.  The ACLU just said that Michigan police have a device where they take your phone.  They stop you.  They take your phone, whether or not you are charged with a crime,  and they download all kinds of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is a device designed, it is called CellBite or something,  to plug into a cell phone and within 90 seconds, copy it.  Just copy everything that is on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is just a violation of privacy.  Hey, I am Mr. Public and all that.  That is the most horrendous violation of government authority and privacy.  And now the added problem is with this Apple thing,  they could easily get where you have been in the last, what, year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is all there.  But I got to tell you, thanks to pen registers,  they can get that data from the carrier easily without a warrant.  So there are plenty of ways you could…  This is the thing that I keep trying to say to people,  is that if you are carrying around a cell phone, this is a spying device.  And we have no idea what kind of data is being recorded.  You know, we know now that there are at least three applications  in the iPhone store that turn on the microphone without notice to you.  All three companies say, oh, but we do not send data back.  Well, okay, fine.  But they turn on the microphone.  You know, color, that $41 million thing.  This is what they told Robert Scoble and said, make sure you tell Leo this.  We turn on the microphone, but all we do is we listen to see if you are in a noisy room  because maybe there will be other photographers there and we store that information.  We do not send that information back.  Well, first of all, I do not understand the merit or value of doing such a thing.  But second of all, there is nowhere that it says they do that.  Right.  And there is nowhere where you give them permission to do that.  And just because they do not send it back does not mean they could not send it back.  Or even that I should trust them that they are sending it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Gina, I think the point you raise is really the huge point here,  which is that our devices are not our devices.  No.  We do not have control over them.  We do not even have knowledge of what they do.  And that is a violation, a personal violation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it is amplified when it is a tiny personal computer that is in your pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With a microphone and a camera.  With a microphone and a camera.  And a GPS and an accelerometer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is if you were going to try to, if you were James Bond 20 years ago  and you were going to try to track Dr. No and find out what he was doing,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that is what you would give him.  It is not cookies that are going to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is a phone.  And everybody who ever watched, you know, a born identity or any of these thrillers knows that  the first thing they do is throw away the phone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He takes the, he always, you know, there is some ingenue who he picks up  and she is now going to have to tag along for the rest of the movie  and close it will be perpetually falling off.  And the first thing he does is he says, give me your phone.  She says, what?  And he takes it and he smashes it with a hammer.  I am sorry, why did I bring that up?  I do not know.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe it was the head of the FTC, why do not I for Google just now,  because they did not put, do not track into Chrome.  Well, there is no law that says you have to have do not track.  Right.  And he is enforcing a law that does not exist yet.  I am not, you know, and even though I think you and Steve were very  rational about this Apple thing, I think you are right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Steve was more rational than I am.  Okay.  I allowed him.  He is a security guru.  He said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But do you think he would be the one to be going security, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, he does not like to, he does not like to sound the alarm unless there is evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  But I do think that this is where Gina's point is exactly right.  If we ever needed transparency is in what our devices are doing to us, for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Although I do agree that since Chrome is the last browser not to support do not track,  I mean, there is a plug-in for it, but Firefox, Internet Explorer 9, Safari.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are in the ad business, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think that they are actively not going to do it because of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I do not think so.  But I think it is a way, you know, because the PR they are going to have to at some point.  But I, you know, they are in the ad business.  We got that free because they do ads, they do cookies.  They want signals to be able to give us better search.  It is going to affect their business and they are being told, they are being pressured  to put that in there when there is absolutely no law or authority to tell them to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except the head of the FTC who can put a lot of pressure on them to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that is not the way government should work, should it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, is it in our interest that they put that in the browser?  I mean, in the people's interest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would argue that that is being put forward as an obvious, you know,  a self-evident truth that cookies and tracking are bad by the likes of the Wall Street Journal.  Tracking are what support media.  Right.  They help give us news.  All the whining about the future of news, if we hurt the advertising business too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We hurt the whole media industry.  And, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but I would say, for instance, there are ad blockers in the world.  Right.  And if I acted totally in self-interest, I would say,  oh, we should make ad blockers illegal because that will block my ability to make revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, what I say, when I say this in the book, if you, you can do all these things, right?  You can turn off cookies, you can erase cookies, you can block all kinds of things,  and that's fine.  And, you know, you don't even need a cookie-killing, do-not-track thing.  All you do is turn off your cookies.  But what you've done is you've made yourself less valuable to those  who are providing this stuff to you.  The same as when we fast-forward through ads.  And you just need to be aware of that.  And it's a decision you're making, and the decision has an impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should point out that it was Computer World's headline that said that  Leibowitz called out Google Chrome.  As far as I can tell, the quote merely is Apple is now going to put it in their Safari browser  that gives you Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla.  Really, the only holdout, the only company that hasn't evolved as much as we would like  on this is Google.  I guess that's calling them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you're right to be more reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not the FTC saying, Google, you better do this or you're in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're just getting your diplomacy muscles going before parents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's encouragement.  But I think this is appropriate encouragement.  I think the FTC should encourage companies to protect consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But again, there are unintended consequences.  Go back to the story you mentioned a while ago.  There's now a suit by many parties in Spain to try to enforce a notion of a right to forget.  There's no right to forget, to be forgotten, right to be forgotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like this.  You don't like this?  I hate this.  Well, you can't do it, for one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one, but it also is a terrible record.  So if you're a sleazy Paul, if you're Bralessconi,  and you try to argue that you have a right to be forgotten,  that he has some right to take out of the public record things that he's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That impinges, then, on my free speech if I want to say that I saw him with a 12-year-old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But okay, so a public figure shouldn't have the right to forget,  but should a personal private figure have the right to forget?  What about a teenager who committed indiscretions that made it to Facebook?  Shouldn't she have the right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where's the line, Leo?  Where is the line that says that's okay?  What if that person runs for president someday and we want to be able to judge that?  And so what you do is you then get to a point where you try to erase everything about you  just in case.  Yeah, that's a good point.  And everything about everything.  And then what you've also done is you've impinged on my free speech.  If I'm the one who says something about you,  and you can come to me and say, no, you must forget that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's a very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a first-time eminence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a very good point.  And in fact, that's what happens.  That's what I warn teenagers about.  I say, you may never blog about this or post on Facebook,  but if there's 10 people around you with camera phones,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right, you can't control it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not up to you.  Got it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which means we've got to adapt society to that.  It's just a reality now.  Well, yeah, what do you tell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, so what I said is consider that as you behave in public.  And I also said, and maybe this is what you would say, Jeff,  that in time, I think we will evolve to the point where  we'll all have skeletons in the closet.  We'll recognize that every human does.  And we'll maybe be a little more tolerant of such things.  That's what I said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, Gina, I hope this isn't an untoward question,  but since you live around university folks and young people,  and your wife deals with these issues,  how much faith do you have that young people today are smart about all this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that young people today are actually pretty savvy about this,  just based on my experience with my young nephews  who just instituted a no adults rule in their friends list on Facebook,  which is kind of funny.  Yeah.  To change their names, who list themselves as married to friends  and siblings with friends, kind of play with their identities online.  And who have both had issues where parents and family saw things on Facebook  that didn't make them happy, and then they had to suffer the consequences.  I think that that happens to university students all the time.  Things come up on Facebook, parties in residence halls,  alcohol, that kind of thing.  Judicial cases at the university are tried that way all the time.  Sometimes they're learning the hard way, but I think in general,  when you grow up with the internet, you become circumspect about this as you go.  I do think that there's an understanding about this.  And I do think that there will be a little more leeway,  that everybody will have something wacky that happened online  when they were a kid going forward in the future.  But I also think that young people are becoming a little more circumspect,  especially when you're in university and you're wondering,  how am I going to get a job and how am I going to interview?  I mean, listen, some students, that UCLA student who had that YouTube rant about  that horrible racist YouTube rant, she obviously didn't think about what that was going to do.  She's out of school now, and I think that students learn from those experiences.  Well, that's an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in Spain, what they would say is not only,  she has a right to, it was her own video, so she can take her video down from YouTube.  But the fact that she did that, and it spread, that's the internet spread,  what the Spanish case would say is that the claim is that Google should erase  all links to any references to that.  I find that scary. That's trying to erase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I find that scary.  You've turned me around on that, Jeff. You're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that video spread all over.  People uploaded it to their YouTube accounts because it was deleted,  and they wanted it because everyone was talking about it.  And it had to become an event.  But kids make mistakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the solution is not to expunge the record.  Although we do that with criminal records for people under 18.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but we don't do it to the newspaper record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But newspapers don't normally…

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They generally don't use the name, but in some cases they will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're not legally obligated to protect minors.  They just choose to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know, the other thing about that video,  I think it's a really good example, Gina, is listen, it was stupid, but it wasn't.  So god-awful offensive. It was just dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was really dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But not everybody's going to… I mean,  that may not be the universal reaction, especially later in life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. That's well, welcome to responsibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but if you're 12, can you be held to the same standard of responsibility?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you're 12, you can say, listen, Zuckerberg sent those IMs about the dumb idiots who trust them.  And we cut him some slack because he was 19.  And we did. And he said, I was 19. I was stupid. I mean, this happens, right?  Right.  That's the issue for society. If society can't forgive a kid for doing something dumb,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  then we've got a big problem, and it's not the kid.  It's a bigger problem.  Interesting. All right. That's a great debate. And it's a tough one because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's merit on both sides of it. But I have to say, it's too draconian to have a right to forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but you'll have this debate in Paris, Mr. President.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good. I know. I'm taking notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the EU has presented four pillars. Vivian Redding, I'm sure, will be there.  I've gotten into fights with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should be doing this, not me, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it has four pillars. And I can't remember what the other three are.  I'll find out for the next week's show. But one of them is the notion of a right to be forgotten.  And it's easy to say, and it's easy to be popular saying that,  but there are unintended consequences. And the internet is too young and too new and too fresh  and too unknown to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you have to, on surface, it sounds like a good idea, but if you dig at all deeply into it,  you realize the consequences of doing it are too great.  But you've got to figure that Monica Lewinsky and Rebecca Black both wish that people would  just forget who the hell they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Rebecca Black is enjoying the fact that  she just beat out Bieber on YouTube. That just proves that the internet is  happier to make fun of stuff than actually enjoy things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a very good point. Although now we don't really know how many of Bieber's  views are making fun of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's true. A good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It could be. That's the secret of his success too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm going to argue that most of Bieber's views are young teenage girls who  really just want to watch Justin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I drove carpool the other day. Did I tell you this story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm scared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My son, for some reason, wouldn't get in the car with me. So instead, six teenage girls,  I guess they're probably all 15, 16 year old girls got in, plugged in their iPod and listened  to Justin Bieber the whole way home.  Really?  I thought, wait a minute, you're 16. Aren't you at least a little bit arch and sardonic  and cynical yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should be very happy about that, Leo. That should make you so happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not my kid. My kid's arch, sardonic and cynical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's cute and my nephews hate his guts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Henry says, don't you get by now that nothing I say is serious?  Okay. Sorry. I didn't realize. Nothing? Nothing.  So maybe there was-  You're raising Jon Stewart.  I'm raising an ironic child.  I guess it was just inevitable.  We have been sent to copyright school, by the way. How many strikes do we have?  Not just this video. In fact, I just already violated copyright law by showing  Mark and the president talking on Facebook.  We get taken down-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Surely that should be Creative Commons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's got to be Creative Commons, isn't it? No?  I don't know. Let me look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's the president. I have no trouble with it because it's news.  In fact, while there is no-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If there ever were fair comment, you'd just fair comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. But that has to be- it's not written into law. It has to be  defended by a court.  Yes.  There's no copyright on here at all, as far as I can tell.  Well, it says Facebook copyright 2011.  So I think they do assert- I mean, I don't know.  I mean, if it's the president, I think that's public domain.  But anyway, the point being that we frequently show clips from stuff  and we almost always get either a takedown or dinged in some way.  Sometimes they don't take it down.  And it's always, in my opinion, because this is a news show,  fair comment, fair use, we defend it.  But because we have so many strikes against us, A, we're not on YouTube live.  And B, in order to get on YouTube live, we have to go to YouTube copyright school.  Are you serious?  Really?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's really- I thought you were kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  There's a- for users who continually violate copyright, YouTube copyright school.  Uh, please take a moment to watch this video on copyright  and answer the following four questions.  Let's see if you can answer the questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God, they quiz you afterwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just without seeing the video.  Let's see how smart you guys are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In order to determine whether specific copyrighted content is authorized to be used on YouTube,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you should upload it to your account and wait for the content ID system  to remove any unauthorized content.  True or false?  False.  False.  False.  If content is available on the internet, it is in the public domain  and therefore okay to upload to YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  False.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you'd have to be an idiot not to get this right.  Of course, my son would lie all the way through and say, I'm joking.  The following item- oh, this is a good- here's a tricky one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tricky!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The following item is protected by copyright.  Your name, your original idea, your original YouTube video, or your cat.  I'm going to say your original YouTube video is protected by copyright, right?  Apparently your name and original idea are not.  If someone alleges that you have infringed their copyright,  you will receive a notification in your account, in your email, both A and B,  or via text message, I think both A and B.  Let me see if I can pass.  That'd be nice.  Then we could- evaluation of your answers.  Correct, correct, correct, correct.  Congratulations!  You have successfully completed copyright school.  You passed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You graduated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yay!  See, there's a pirate.  Look at the pirate.  A bad cat pirate with a hook.  He's stealing videos.  I have to say, I think YouTube has been over way too far in the realm of rights holders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's also what Larry Lessick said because this is his whole issue.  So he puts examples in his videos, and he puts the videos on YouTube,  and he has to appeal every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every time.  Every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd need a whole department just to deal with the appeals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it is not a de minimis loss to us because it's a significant number of impressions that we lose,  and because it's a news show, even a 24-hour takedown  basically means that that video is no longer used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let's use the power of Twig.  Let's get someone on, and let's lobby Google on this,  and hear their side of why this is difficult for them,  or why they're defaulting to this,  and try to give them some cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, Eileen's listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm all for it for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Meanwhile, if I were you, YouTube, I'd take down this video of the guy  with the glasses and the liver in his hand, his bloody hand saying smell your own breath.  That's the video I'd take down, not this week in Google.  Stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, let's take a break now while I recompose myself.  Deep breath.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cleansing breath going all up and down your chakra.  Baby.  Somebody sent me a book, chakra exercises.  I can't wait.  Thank you.  But you know what I do when I need to relax?  I go home and I watch Netflix, and I encourage you all to do exactly the same thing.  Netflix.  I love Netflix.  I just checked a minute ago.  I've been a Netflix customer since 2000, November, December 2000.  That's how long I've been using Netflix's amazing DVD by mail system.  And of course, a couple of years ago, they started doing this watch instantly thing.  And now I'm in love.  The truth is I have a five disc at a time subscription, which is the max, I think.  I guess you get multiple five disc at a time subscriptions.  But my discs are collecting dust because I almost always am watching instantly.  YouTube has tens of thousands of movies you can watch right away  just by searching for them on your TV set.  Many new internet connected TV sets have the capability of doing this.  Almost all the new Blu-ray players do.  And of course, your Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, your Wii, and my favorite, the Roku box.  All can do this.  Look at these.  There's just so many great movies here.  Then Netflix does a really good job of making recommendations so that as you go through,  oh, they got Toy Story 3 on watch instantly in high def.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's on watch instantly right now, Leo.  What?  Glee season one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they've got TV shows.  Mad Men's going on there.  They just bought rights to Mad Men.  Yeah, I actually am going back to the original Glee pilot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The pilot is the best.  Isn't it funny?  That don't stop believing.  I watched it again this week and I cried.  I'll admit it.  It's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And of course, it's a little dated now because they put their stuff on MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it is a little dated.  Yes.  It's really funny.  But there are early John Stamos references that you don't get until you realize that  he's on later on.  It's worth rewatching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so great.  Let's make that our recommendation for the show today.  Glee is available the first season.  Oh, and Monk and Drop Dead Diva.  Oh my gosh, there's some great stuff on here.  All you have to do is either add it to your instant queue for later reference or play it.  Now, I got to warn you about the queue thing.  So I have a queue of DVDs.  You get the DVDs in as little as one business day.  And I have a queue of watch instantly.  And my DVD queue is 234 DVDs.  Watch instantly, 358.  So you don't really need a queue to watch instantly.  Frankly, you just watch it instantly.  Try it free for 30 days.  You're going to love it.  Netflix dot.  Look at all these movies I put.  I don't know why I put them in the queue.  I guess so I don't forget that I want to watch them later, I guess.  Netflix dot com slash tweet.  What's nice about watch instantly is none of these things gather dust.  They just sit there waiting for you to watch them later.  Netflix dot com slash tweet.  Try it free for 30 days.  Who doesn't love Netflix?  My only concern with this entire ad campaign is who doesn't already have Netflix?  Right.  I mean, we're preaching to the choir here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, yeah, we got just.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's converted me.  I never did it because I didn't want to do the whole DVD thing and this convinced me.  It's already paid off.  You're kidding.  No, I'm weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't have an iPad.  I didn't watch Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This show is making a wreck of you.  Yeah.  And your personal life.  Yeah.  That's what we're here for.  Time now for.  And thank you, by the way, Jeff, if I could just, I don't know, maybe  have a little earpiece with you on the other end and you could listen in and then just  tell me what to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Represent the people, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you're going to be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I could bring the chat room with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, seriously.  Where's my RC channel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My chat room says you're full of it, Nick.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I need an army of Googling research assistants as I talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why can't I bring the chat room with me?  Seriously.  I think I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People are the back channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I will.  Deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, everybody in the chat room so excited right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're like, we're going to the EGH, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going virtually chat room, virtually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Meanwhile, President Obama's sleeves are still rolled up, but his tie is not loosened.  This update brought to you by Facebook.com slash Facebook Live.  It is time for our tool number and tip of the week.  Let us start with Gina Trapani and her tool of the week.  My tip is really simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So two things.  One's really tiny and one's bigger.  The really tiny one made me so happy because I love favicons  that tell you something about what's going on in the tab.  Google Calendar now puts the date in the favicon.  What?  Yeah.  So if you go to Google Calendar, I live from my Google Calendar.  If you go to Google Calendar, the favicon will say today it'll be 20 because today's April 20th.  And it works so well.  If you pin tab, that in addition to Gmail's unread count in the favicon  lets you glance up at your tabs and see what's going on.  So it's just a little date helper.  Oh, that is so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it's an HTTPS, I have a padlock in my Chrome.  But if I go to the tab, I could see that in fact, it is the 20th.  And then I will say, oh my God, it's my 20th anniversary today.  I better not forget to buy some flowers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  There you go.  That is cool.  That's cool.  It's just a little tiny thing, but it makes me happy.  The other big thing that launched is US, and I hope, oh, I hope Leo, this isn't your tool.  Map Maker, Google Maps Map Maker launched for the United States.  So it's basically like Google Maps, editable Google Maps.  You go in, you put down where your favorite coffee shop is or, you know, bike route.  And there's this apparently team of Google Maps editors who can  review and approve changes to the map.  So it's basically correcting and augmenting maps.  This is so huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Open Street Maps has been doing this all along, but they didn't have any data to begin with.  By the way, as a result, Open Street Maps has some great maps,  especially for bikers and hikers.  I expect this will make the same kind of difference to Google Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Companies and governments and such can put up piles of batch data into this too.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I think I saw something in that way.  I don't know what that means.  Maybe the park service could give you more data on the parks or something than they now have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Certainly, I immediately filled out our Google Places thing, but that's a separate thing.  Let me zoom into San Francisco.  So will it show if I zoom in on Google Map Maker, will it show things people have done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a community edits tab on the top left there.  You see my edits, community edits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, look at that.  So here they are.  A lot of this is, in fact, business information.  Tiburon International Film Festival.  Oh, actually, some of these are places closed.  A lot of these are places closed.  Interesting.  So people are cleaning up the Google Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's better than plus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Aye, this is crowd sourcing.  I agree.  You bet.  This gets it.  This is totally awesome.  So Google Map Maker at google.com slash map maker.  You know what Open Street Maps does, and I'd love to see this kind of functionality,  if you've got a GPS, you can upload your track to the Open Street Maps and they'll use that  just to know where there's streets and stuff where there's and you can then annotate it.  There's a lot of additional features I'd love to see in here.  This is great, though.  I mean, this at least you can fix these maps.  Actually, I was a tool I was considering, but I decided instead to do a tool that I  hope you didn't do last week because it did come out last week and I dibs did then,  which is a Google a day.  It's a trivia contest on Google.  Oh, no.  So if you go to a Google a day dot com every day, a new Google trivia contest.  Oh, Jeff, I skipped your number, but I'll get it next.  How do these homes relate to molecular soccer balls?  And so it's kind of a it's a it's a Google in effect.  That's the answer.  I'm going to say it was about Google.  I think it's geodesic.  I think it's a it's a bucky ball, isn't it?  Or whatever that let's see their geodesic domes.  Buckminster Fuller held the first patent for geodesic domes.  So there you go.  The bucky ball.  So so you can every every day learn something cool and new and different.  Google a day dot com.  And now your number is Nick Carr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does Google make us stupid?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, see, Nick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, and in the tab, it says what day it is.  So there we're smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jeff.  This is not a left field, but but Henry Blodgett, who was an analyst in the bubble  and got in some trouble, rightly or wrongly, for touting stocks in the one hand and emails  that he sent privately to others disagreed with that.  He settled with Eliot Spitzer and the SEC over all that.  And Henry's been open about his past.  He's Henry started Business Insider, which is kind of see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually a great blog.  I read it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great site.  It's a tech crunch of business.  And it's really good and really well done.  It's a lot of stories faces his past and talks about it.  And that's that.  But he never really got a big interview.  So he put up he allowed one of his people to do who was a tough writer to interview Henry.  No holds barred, except for a few legal matters on his site.  And what fascinated me just for a number today is that Henry people ridiculed Henry because  he said that Amazon was going to hit $400 a share back in the day.  And this is part of the old bubble blowing up problem.  Henry points out that the split adjusted price for Amazon today

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  He was right on Amazon.  You couldn't buy a better stock if you ask me.  I'm just a quality company.  They deserve their success.  Well, I can't wait to watch this.  So this is James, I'm sorry, James Altucher.  Do you know who that is that's doing the interview?  No, no, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this looks good.  It's fascinating because it takes you back to the bubble.  It takes you, you know, something cited to Spitzer and it's been such the whole thing.  I think there's a movie here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't it funny that since Blodgett's downfall, Spitzer had his own downfall  and now he's a CNN commentator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, and Blodgett's been on his show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And here's the irony of this.  I said earlier, America doesn't forgive.  America loves to forgive.  If you've got to check your rough past, all you have to do is say,  I'm sorry.  And even Rod Blagojevich can have a TV show.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whatever happened to him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, another show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good question because I keep saying.  I haven't heard that name in a while.  Yeah, I just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Once I learned how to pronounce it, then I stopped hearing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Spent so much energy doing that.  Jeff Jarvis is the author of this fine book.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What Google do you see?  I keep it on my bookshelf because I need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are wonderful, my sire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's a new one coming.  I can't wait.  Public parts.  And will you send me the manuscript?  So I mean, I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually will.  My publisher will be happy, but I'll send it to you.  We have a new subtitle.  The other subtitle got thrown out.  So it's now how sharing in the digital age is revolutionizing life, business and society.  Well, that's close to the one we liked.  Okay, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's straighter, but you know, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's well, as I've learned, you kind of have to.  Sometimes you have to say what the book's about.  Otherwise, people think it's about penises.  Not that that wouldn't help sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Evidently, the PR person for the publisher has said, we don't want to do too much on Jeff's penis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know the trees will say it's worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't wait to see that.  Next day on the Enis Pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we have a show title, by the way.  And now, and Gina, thank you so much for being here.  Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org.  I didn't know this expert labs is occupying most of our attention these days with thinkupapp.com.  Yeah, check it out.  Can't wait to get back and talk some more.  You guys are just so great.
