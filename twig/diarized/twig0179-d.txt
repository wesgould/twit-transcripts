Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're basically still looking around for a producer to help us out with that because we realize that we're not producers  But we're gonna try and revive it this year. Yes, it's been it's been quiet since March ish. Don't tell Chad

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But a good producer is worth his weight in gold. Yeah  Chad's not here. He's on vacation actually Carson Bonnie who's I've worked with since  ZD TV since the site on MSNBC is produced this show and he's a great producer too.

We are just very happy today to have you both. Happy New Year  Happy New Year to you both. What'd you do for New Year's Eve?  We played cards against humanity and played Nintendo. I'm amazed and how many people played cards against humanity. I had never played it's amazing. It's  somebody played it on the show  late night on on on the network and  We heard a little bit about it later. Whoops  Have you ever played that Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, I have played it once or twice. Yes, it was a big thing at XOXO conference

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were those gnarly sponsors of it or something. It's like it's a card game, but you're doing horrible things

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're saying horrible. You're trying to say horrible things. Yes. Yeah, you're not actually doing the nastiest sentence by

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically doing mad libs with what you've got. In fact, they call it a card game for horrible people. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the nice part about it's open source you can download you can download the cards and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know print out whatever you want. You can make your own. I'm so tempted to pick up a we need to do a twit  No, we know no we don't we did it and  Your I got the emails  Not nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is horrendous. No, no, no, we could do a twit set of cards  Oh, they're nice that makes to do it has to do with your show. Yes, that would be fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They would and that would be nice. Yeah, maybe the open source them. Yes  So, you know normally I don't like doing shows on January 2nd because what could possibly have happened over the past  Year, but there are a few things for instance this morning. Ava said we're gonna buy zip car  That's interesting for half a billion dollars  Zip car is in San Francisco. Have you ever used it? Yes, I have so the idea is they're just sitting there in special marked parking spaces  You have a card on account with them, right? Absolutely. You tap your thing and you hop in the car

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And where do you get the key?  They they they leave them in they have a thing where you a dongle the dongle pops out  It's it's quite amazing and it actually leaves open a hole now now that Avis hasn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Frankly scares me because I think I wonder if Avis bought them  To put them out of business because it's got a mind their stand their traditional rental  Indeed hard business Kevin you have any have you ever used this? I haven't used zip car  No, no, um a lot of people come up here use zip card to come up here because we have a lot of San Francisco  Correspondents who don't have cars indeed. Yes, we don't need them don't need them

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I've been San Jose so I need cars, but I'm in San Francisco. He's a bicycle, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's funny because in Paris and many other European cities they have zip car only it's bikes  Zip bikes. Yeah, well London has those. Yeah, it's great. You just really good you rent a bike  They're not great bikes, but they're not horrible bikes and you can go anywhere and you just it goes as a special  They have a special locking bike rack and leave it. Don't worry about it. So of course now  inevitably  the  Securities litigation firm of powers Taylor along with Willie briscoe the ex-us sec attorney have announced they will be investigating  The zip car sale and possibly following a lawsuit to block the deal  turns out  That at 500 million dollars. That's only twelve dollars twenty five cents per share  Which is below their 52 week. I have sixteen twenty five  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sold a little cheap there then but you know, what's the trade at the moment? Well, that's a good question

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think oh you should have paid what it was. I think it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twelve dollars and twenty cents. So they're paying a nickel premium  Seems to me that's the established going price. That's what people are paying on the stock market

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You want them to pay a premium? It's closing price on December was eight dollars twenty four

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there you go, right and the deals probably been in and that's at twelve twenty

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is one of those things where they're probably trying to squeeze a little more money out of a bus

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's always gonna be litigation. There's litigation for litigation. You're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right. If you're a zip car stockholder, you can join the class action

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Car stockholder you should be happy because you never know what could happen and I would take less take the half a billion

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Run with it drive with it drive with it drive away fast  But from a point of view of users, I think it's a little scary because I hope that Avis keeps this business  Maybe they see this is as a part in part of their portfolio of rental cars, right and don't kill it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean they're gonna have to run it as a as a separate entity  I mean once they start mixing the two then we know how that goes it goes away lines start getting crossed and forget it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's blurred. It's gone. And then it's just the same thing zip car becomes the Avis Bureau bingo on Mission Street

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a cheaper version of an Avis right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I thought that was an interesting story. So thanks for joining us and oh go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Compared to get around in the ones where you're actually renting your own car out that they seem more interesting to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're interesting only because the mind reels with the possibilities you have an extra car. It's lying around  You're not using it today. Somebody can just borrow it. Well, the logical one for me makes sense is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Trains and train car parks and and the airport car parks because that's where you go two weeks and that would be a direct

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just sitting there great idea. It's a great idea. So somebody runs it  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like the Airbnb for cars, yeah, so that's that's what yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what get around does but they you've got to work out where to pick it up  Whereas the you know, the airport car park for me is like I'm paying them for 15 bucks a day  Well, I'm like our sits there  It'll be nice if someone rented for a week few days while I'm away and you know  it would be at the airport reminds me that episode of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seinfeld with George Costanza found a very cheap parking lot turned out they were using his car to turn tricks. There you go  Kind of using it while you're not using it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is the self-driving part of the theory of the self-driving car, isn't it?  Is that we spend all this time pay all this money to have these cars sitting around most the time just that they're there when  We need them, right?  And zip car is one answer that and get around another but the self-driving car thing is say  Oh, I need a car and the car drives around to a house and picks you up  And also when you go somewhere you don't need to park it  You just get out the car and it goes and lurks somewhere else and comes back when you want it  So that's you know, that's one of the obvious things you can do with a self-driving car once you've got that  but the other thing is you can do the same kind of  Car sharing thing where you just say, okay  I have you know  I have an interest in a pool of cars in this neighborhood and when one, you know  When I need one little turn up and it'll go away and so you can use fewer cars and you know  Have fewer parking spaces. There's a whole bunch of sort of  interesting things that become possible once you can  Arbitrage these things between people because the transaction cost goes down, you know buying a new car is this enormous transaction getting a  Even renting a car is fairly painful  But these things are sort of converging on that that easiness of this is well there when I need it  But you need some, you know at the moment  The rental comments will bring a car to you  But that means they've got to have two drivers to deal with it for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right two cars have to come out  No, that's everybody who talks about Thomas vehicles the people who are doing this research and stuff  That's what they really say is it's the end of car ownership  Yeah, and car and it makes sense because a car is such a huge consumable that has only used a small percentage of the total  Time it's a huge drain on the environment  Correct. Why should we build a car per person or two cars in some cases per people when you could have one car serve ten  People just as if it much more efficiently and that's effectively

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah collaborative consumption is like the big buzzword right now because you're seeing things like  Airbnb and all that you just had a house that you can't be at but you could make money

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you convince?  Maybe it's an American illness  Or a first world illness. How do you convince people that it's better not to own?  Well, I mean I want to own stuff don't they I mean they don't like to rent

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right, well this is somebody  I suppose I'm gonna give a  Ignite took about this a couple years ago and they said actually this is less true  If you look at the really rich people they just rent stuff  That's true at least that they least they least apartments they lease, you know, how are they say they you know, they do least a bar  I am you know, partly there's there are tax gains that means you can do as a company  But it means you've got option value. It means you can say okay  I don't have this commitment of this giant house and this to maintain and this car. I've got to take to the shop and  You know all the sort of little niggly things of ownership. Actually, if you've got enough money, you it's easy to rent stuff  And the trade-off you know that that transition has been you know  Gradually happening is it because we used to be the way around it used to be if you were rich you had land  Right and other people paid you rent  They've had a rentier class who owned the property into that but now there's you know  A financial class that actually spends all their time, you know renting and stuff and doesn't own much. That's probably chiefly for tax reasons

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They get bored with things but it is really adds to your flexibility  They said that one of the reasons Detroit went downhill so fast  after the most recent  Economic crisis was that everybody was upside down in their houses  And so it just because they were all subprime loans. So just made a lot of more sense just to walk away  and and and just leave them there and the banks didn't want them so it just and  They and actually the same piece suggested that if you're young you're smart  You do not buy you rent because the problem is you need to be able to go to where the jobs are when there were no  Jobs in Detroit owning was a bad thing if you'd been renting you just pick up stakes and you move on  You got to go where the where the resources are so it does make sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess I think it starts catching on once people figure out that they could take that money and put it elsewhere  So if the American dream is to own a house  Why own a car when you could just save that money put it aside?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who's gonna be who's gonna start making this sexy and appealing? I guess it cars done a lot to that clearly have the Airbnb Airbnb

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a little bit there's still people who are afraid of the idea  They're like I wouldn't want my house other people living in it  But once they do it and the money comes in they're like well that was great

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this why the venture capital community was so excited by Airbnb Kevin they really I?  Thought at the time you know people were I can't remember who it was but they people the other VCs were saying oh  This is gonna disintermediate everything. This is gonna change everything. I thought wait a minute. It's just it's a vacation exchange. It's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, but I think well actually it took him a while to catch on to Airbnb  There's a lot of if you actually listen a lot of them turned it down  It fools they are they were saying oh who would do that?  Yeah, but yeah, I suppose the other thing is is VCs are in the class of people who have two homes, right?  So they're used to either renting them or they get it have all that and so for them  It's like you mean you could be the managing agent from my Tahoe cottage  Oh, you know there's this they understand that that aspect of it it but the other and you know  The other aspect is when you're traveling you want you you want to stay somewhere now  You know if you're a business traveler and your employers paying your stay and I have over the full service thing  But you know my last trip to the UK  Was a flying visit my son was had a college interview  And my my mom and sister wanted to meet up with us while we were there and we looked at it  And it was actually a lot easier and cheaper to rent and a flight  That sleeps for an Airbnb that actually get enough hotel rooms to cover it in London  So and you know and it was straightforward to do so that that  In fact for me that was like oh, there's a crossover point here where this makes a lot of sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a mindset of utility too. I think I mean nobody gets any in their homes  They don't get internet hardwired right you rent  You have a line that comes in and you have a cable modem and you can you don't want it  You can get rid of it and the same thing with a car drive a car for a week  Don't like it try a different car

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You maybe it's your generation because you know I see the co-working spaces in San Francisco people don't have offices  She's they rent time in an office space. They rent as receptionist  They rent off and they don't and they're it is important to be flexible why be tied to something right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know and if you really like a space  Then you can stay there figure out how to get a space just like it. I'm of the older

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  post-war baby boom generation we all wanted our little Levittown houses and  Our little piece of the piece of the world takes us longer to realize what we really want  Yeah, I look at people like like you and Kevin Rose who just mobile liquid

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Moving around it scares my parents

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kids you should have a job for life, and you get a gold watch, and you have a house with a cottage and the picket fence

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not necessarily the representation of that generation  No, it is but you know the the the thing of being able to change jobs and having that flexible is important  but also the other thing is a lot of this is  It is about you know complexity of transactions the reason we had offices was that's where the infrastructure was you had?  at your desk and you had your colleagues in the meeting rooms and the telephone system and the computers and  All this infrastructure, and you know a mailroom and stuff you know  There was a place there because that was what you needed to do business  And the challenge now is that and there was a separate realm it was also  I can give you my business card because that's a business card  It doesn't have my home phone number on it whereas now my phone's in my pocket my laptops  You know here my tablet. You know I can do business anywhere. I do I work from here most of the time  I'm going to San Francisco. I need to and  There are a lot of people who no longer need that that office space or are able to not have to  Spend two hours a day going up and down to  You know somewhere else because that's where the that's where the office is yeah overhead is scary

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to talk about NU e boredom and jaded  this next  Seems like the entire tech pundit community from Mike Harrington on down is just bored  With the whole thing topic yeah, why is every Brian block says I'm quitting Instagram  Tech crunch founder Mike Harrington says I'm bored.

That's it T W IG one  Squarespace.com the best way to create a high-quality website blog or online portfolio  We all know Mike Harrington. We know Mike likes to stir things up. He is he does he come around the office

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We say I mean, you know crunch crunch fund has a small office within our office  We see him once in a while still writes for tech crunch

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But because he became a venture capitalist he and MG and others have kind of pulled back a little bit from the daily report  Indeed indeed Mike though on the last day of the year posted I'm bored  What's next it's about 2013 I say I'm a little bored the blogger in me is  He says in an invest as an investor things are peachy  But as a consumer and observer of tech things feel like  2002 to me a lot of belt tightening  Yeah mobile yeah, I get it everything's mobile this day's let's go mobile  But really that's just an IQ test when you see bold new startups with nothing but a desktop strategy  You know, they don't get it. You just go nice kid. I'll see you later  But he says most of the mobile stuff is just radioactive decay from the iPhone launch in 2007  Now you could I don't you know, I don't know if that's fair  You could also say the other way the iPhone began something that was a  Transformation and is just now kind of getting in gear. I don't think it's decay. I think it's the opposite  I'm not gonna ask you to attack Mike Harrington. Oh, I disagree with them wholeheartedly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh good. Thank you, but I think you make some really good points God

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's and then Ryan block says I'm out of here. I killed my Facebook now  I'm killing Instagram and I know the terms of services are all right  I just don't like it and then somebody else's writing interesting point, but his his point was

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've just realized that I don't actually use it of anything  Yeah, and I have all these vestigial accounts on these different services  I only realize it when they get sold to someone else and start spamming me  And that's a good point. My colleague JP was saying this day said  Is there a way of keeping track of all the apps you delete from your phone because that will be useful information  It's like right my friends deleted this week  And I know Apple used to make you review them ask you to review them as you delete them  They stopped doing that because if I don't it's got really sad about it  But it's it is this signal is like, you know, I got a I got a reminder from planks  So yesterday said telling me it's like so send an e-card to Wow. It's like there's talk about us

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow flashback that that really is 2002

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, you know, it's like there's this sort of weird thing where  You know Tim Berners-Lee says eventually your websites turn into porn sites  But I think there's this sort of intermediate stage where all these sites turn into spammers and send you emails to tell you about other  People's birthdays. It's like what? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why are you reminding about this but that other people's birthdays? Yeah, so on the one hand you could I mean it really is glass  Half empty half full you could say that we're in an amazing creative  Renaissance with a thousand ideas germinating many of them crap  But who cares because there's many others that are great  Or you could say ah bored. I've seen it all before when is something gonna do something a  Completely new and innovative, you know, you're always waiting in technology for the big paradigm shirt

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I think the point of that article was to smack some people around and go hey wake up  You know  We're entering a new year like look when Instagram was bought by Facebook being a tech blogger  My inbox was full of you should check out our phone sharing  Now that Instagram is gone because Facebook bought it. It's like no, they're not gone. They're fine  You should check this out. This is the next big thing. That is boring  Yeah, very boring and annoying after a while. So, I mean, you know Mike goes over the top  That's his deal  but I think this year if people get involved in different areas like  Health care education like more niche stuff. We say this every year. Let's be more niche. It's true  It's like don't give me a photo sharing app  Give me a photo sharing app that helps my life in this way  Like let's think about consumers and stop thinking about like the tech  Circle where you think you'll get on tech crunch if you build this, right? It's boring

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but it's I mean, you know then  You've had you've had apps that disrupt that when disrupt that do those kinds of things  You know, it's not like that the only thing you cover but the challenge is that  Part of this is that it's so much easier to make things now  Right, it's true you you can throw these things together fairly quickly  And so I imagine that you know, they go  Oh, I've just built this thing and then they then they they email everyone a tech cruncher. Hey, I've got this thing  You're like, yeah, and so is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice are we and there's also I think a social overload that we are all experiencing  Maybe those of us on the in the in the punditry field experience it more than others  But people are tired to Facebook Twitter. I'm hearing it from more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Normals as we call them some folks that aren't in tech. We tried to we tried to do it all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We tried to post on Google Plus and Facebook and Twitter and we're exhausted

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're older we have you know, we're trying to start families and but I think we're what we've realized finally was if I put something  Into this meaning my time and my effort and my content. What am I getting in return?  And I think people are starting to go when am I getting out of Facebook?  I spend two hours a day on it. What am I doing? And what am I getting?  It's getting clear what Facebook's getting out of it. It's clear

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's Facebook didn't you love the the story that Randy Zuckerberg got all upset?  Yes, so she's Mark Zuckerberg sister  She posted on her private Facebook page a picture of the Zuckerberg family  Poking each other or something right at the kitchen and using the app  It was a Christmas picture and then a woman who is her friend. No, no, it was a friend of her sister

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yes, this is Facebook privacy, right? So it's she had her photo set to  Friends of those who are tagged could see the photos. Sorry. That's normal

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure, it's the defaults the fault  So the friend of the of the sister who was tagged saw the picture  There's no way of looking at and saying oh, that's private. So she tweeted it cute pictures

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think there are these tiny little icons, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so there is a way to see is a way to see it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can look at it and say oh that was like square and they are gray and one of them is a globe  And one of them is kind of three people if you like squint at them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The story is this woman this this gal who tweeted it had 40,000 followers and worked at  Vox media or so it was like a market or so that so the word went out  Yeah, so I think the wrong word that got used in this was private because nothing on the internet is private

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How'd you do that?  You got it cute up  Of my stream, but you know, that's but that's the point the point is right  These things are hard to explain but also they're not actually trying that hard to spend  You know that they're doing better than they were when you sign up for a Facebook app now  It actually gives you some options about whether it who can see what it shares  So when that says I have to build a person your behalf is like well, yeah, but only I get to see  You and thank you until I trust you. So there's there's a set of  There's a set of nuances around these permissions that are actually quite hard to explain to people  And the first iteration of this we were trying, you know, we were inventing this stuff collectively  We were trying to replace  Give me your your username and your password to the other service so I can pretend to be you right and let's give me some  Other permissions so the first iteration of that was it had to be at least as easy as that  And if we gave you a page full of choices people just back up. This is why I like pretty close circles

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just easy to figure out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not that easy when you started communities blew it out of the water like what am I why am I yeah  Well, I'm getting messages. I who are what he's did blow things up. Yes, Google does that all the time  I don't it's not so much a privacy thing  I think Google learned from buzz what not to do in that regard

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's it's an overflow of information last time we were on it was when Scoble blew up about events. Yeah  That video where yeah, he got invited to every event. I

Transcript:  We were having a micro formats meetup in San Francisco. He had a little a little anniversary dinner  Well, we have these we have these dinners every every  And you know, there's usually like ten of us turn up  But we try to tell a lot of people about they can turn up they want to and it's you know  We sit and eat food and geek out about about web standards. It's not it's not everyone's cup of tea  So I tried I so I thought okay, I will publish on the mic formats thing  I do it on Facebook  I do it on Google plus and the problem is on both of them  It's really hard to say I want to invite people who are within 50 miles of this event, right?  You know, I don't mind, you know, I should like to invite Leo my friends in London. They're not gonna fly out for this  He's just a bunch of a second dinner  and  So on Facebook, I went through every single person in the list was like they hear that  You know, I'm gonna press it. Oh, I've got groups here and they're smart about targeting  So if I just add my geeky friends group and my microphone  Then it'll it'll only show them if it's nearby because it knows where I am. That's nice now  No, it doesn't it doesn't at all. No, I got 16 pages of  You would think it would do that. It does thanks for the invitation, but I'm in London or  Friends long conversation. Oh great. I'm doing something else  but I'd have to come along later on then we eventually realized he was in New York and thought I was in New York and  Having an event there because no  Confusion so, you know straightforward feature requests to both of them when I'm inviting people give me a draw a circle around this thing and tell  And show me which people are within this distance  And you know ideally now but even just home location would be it would be enough  So I've had this one before, you know, I go on a trip to New York or London. I say great  I'd like to see who else is around and get together with people and I've got to the same thing of hi  I'm in New York. I said everyone hi. I'm in New York come to dinner  And then I've got a call a New York restaurant say well  I've got somewhere between one and fifty people coming to dinner because I don't know who's coming  All you've got to sit there and like individually poke everyone go. Are you around?  So it's an actual understanding of geography will be really nice for these things. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  one of them they they they they have to take is  Markets too small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's response contrary to Microsoft's claims. It's easy for consumers to view YouTube videos on Windows phones  Using our HTML 5 based mobile website including viewing high quality video streams  In other words, we're not we've worked for micro with Microsoft for several years to help build a great YouTube experience of Windows  In other words, we're not gonna write an app. We don't need to there's a web  Yeah, I mean it's heavy-handed but so what well Google Google has not it's interesting how Google has  Shifted a little bit is willing to be a little bit more heavy-handed especially with Microsoft turning off  support for EAS for oh, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, hey if Windows phone was selling off the shelves  I think they would build an app I guess there was a bunch of users and they were getting a lot of requests saying  We want this I think they would build it. Well in the holiday week

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to a flurry, which is an app analytics platform  Android and iOS device activations increased 150% combined 50 million  No, see when Microsoft selling maybe a thousand ten thousand five five hundred thousand even fifty million

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah a week yeah, I I would wrap if I'm a company I'm focusing on iOS and Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  20 million devices this time last year

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the other thing is you do the web version because that work on and everything it always works  Oh, and yeah, okay  You may say I want to build I was first when we Android first been what you're making and who your target is  But you do build a web version as well unless you're particularly silly who else doesn't have a Windows phone app does Instagram have a Windows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook doesn't even have a Windows phone. Yes. I don't know see that's how much I know she's gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's lawyers writing a blog post about it. You know what now. I won't even get into it, but it isn't any competitive

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean if you put that together with turning off EAS

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know kicking out Google Maps from iOS that was it was that I was any competitive sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no Google Maps on Windows fun  It was on the web

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that was you know that's the legacy of a different fight right that was the  Several years ago. I remember exactly when it was shortly after I left Google so we must have been around 2008  Google wanted to build apps for iOS and Apple wouldn't let them and they wouldn't let them build Google voice  And they wouldn't build right there was a fight about it and went to the FCC and blah blah blah and after that Google  Like well, I'm not sure why we're paying with these iOS engineers to build stuff  We can't ship let's make sure we put the Android one first because at least we know we can ship that right and  You know and the maps you know when you know the other thing that this is sort of the  Cosmet down thing when the iPhone launched it didn't have any way of doing apps unless you were Apple or you built web stuff  Right and so Apple who had built the Google Maps the YouTube and all these things so they felt they had to be there for  It to be a first-class thing  But you know they were doing the UI and they were calling the Google API's  So is this you know part of the argument between Apple and Google was?  Google isn't providing API's for the bits of maps that we want to do like turn-by-turn and stuff  Which they are they provide which they've built into the Android app  Yeah, Google's now made an iOS app that does that so is what Microsoft really saying is YouTube isn't providing as good enough API hooks  Do the things that they're doing in their other app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that what this argument really is well you know well what they really want is they want the government to intervene and say no  We have to have it even like a plague field is every Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Application on Android did they make Android apps can I get like no actually the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact there are Microsoft applications that are even on Windows Phone the photosynth for instance which is on iOS is not available

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go case case closed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  themselves  17.4 million iOS and Android devices were activated on Christmas Day

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I want to see the so that the developer dashboards link you know yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me show you this you just put this in the chat move it still says December 3rd

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we should keep an eye on this and see what when they update this so what so what is this this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is in the last 14 days  How many devices in what OS's have accessed Google Play cupcake through jelly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it says they haven't updated  December the third let's let's ask let's get them to do that  I'll find out that because I want to see that you know what that chart does over Christmas because that would be interesting  Let's let's find out we'll get into this you know figure it out particularly for web developers because you know  The people who are on ginger boy and less have still got still got the bad browser you cannot install Chrome on that right so half  Of and you know 60% of Android users according to this can't be running of a browser is actually caught up with the rest of the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you credit the rumors also reported on TechCrunch by Mike butcher, and I think by the Wall Street Journal that  and others

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That Apple might be buying ways. I don't buy that I don't buy it either, but Apple's got to do something  I mean look Apple wants to make its map solution really good, and it wasn't neither

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Neither side is commenting, but TechCrunch says another source confirms negotiations between Apple and ways are advanced ways want  750 million dollars good for them apples willing to do 400 million plus another 100 million in incentives  Ways had less than a million in revenue last year see the mistake is you don't want any revenue  That's how Instagram got a billion dollars because if you have revenue then you've got a multiple of that revenue

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then you got this case you have existing contracts that you have to deal with right when you purge somebody obviously ways  I mean ways is power or love ways maps right love ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's one of the advantage ways has over Apple Maps and even over what you know it would give Apple a jump up over Google  And Nokia is that ways is basically all crowdsourced so it's what you're it's watching your car drive around  And that's how it knows where stuff is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right which the stuff that Google Maps does but ways is also explicitly lets you mark stuff on the map and say there's a radar

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Trapped right it's a little more real-time than Google Maps. I betcha  Maybe not I don't know maybe not maybe a little bit more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But maybe not as comprehensive as far as coverage

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Places there's no places. There's no POI stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, hey, but they buy them if they buy them then obviously that changes quickly because everybody's gonna nice big story

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably buried the lead Ubuntu  Is announcing canonical the makers of Ubuntu mark shuttleworth's company that has really done a good job. I think of commercializing Linux  It says we're gonna do a phone OS first devices will ship early  2014 bravo bravo some people were thinking because from the the teaser from the last few days  It would be a touch interface to Ubuntu, but no it's a mobile version of an Ubuntu built around  the existing Android kernel which is Linux yes and drivers, but  Doesn't use a Java virtual machine  Dalvik which is the virtual machine that Android uses is a Google creation  And of course remember Sun was a little ticked about this is an issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Saying this is not fairly careful not to call it a Java virtual machine. Yeah. Yeah, because they didn't want to believe it's not Java. Yeah  It's something  It's pretty much compatible with the Java VM, but well, and that's what I didn't like is there was more it was more Java plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. It was a JVM plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was you know, you use the same tools. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ubuntu for Android which was announced last year. I remember seeing it at CES  Is gonna be the first step and then at some point there'll be a knit kind of a native non Java  Phone OS based on a bun to supporting arm and x86 Intel must like that now's the time I  See Microsoft I hate to get into the phone business right about now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this doesn't know there's a whole set of these, you know, the sort of open source tide is broken  There's this there's Tizen. There's the Firefox browser. There's the Firefox phone  You know that suddenly people say oh, you mean we can do this too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And remember me go and I mean there were a lot of other open source phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm saying they're all gonna succeed but it's you know  We're seeing that that there's there's a possibility space out there for people to do this  And it's what this party says is the carrier lockers has gone  Yeah, use the stage one of any mobile business you speak let's go into some carriers and this is this is no longer true

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, and there's a huge currently untapped smartphone market in the underdeveloped worlds  Where the iPhone and most Android phones are way too expensive still I like in this approach to what app operate it does with browsers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right there is opera ever gonna be the number one browser probably not it's gonna be number two probably not  But it's in there and making noise is it making money I guess it is  Yeah, they have all kinds of I mean they have all kinds of other little sub companies that opera right?  But you know now's the time if if micro if Windows Phone isn't doing well, I  Mean I if I'm gonna do an OS now is yeah, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, BlackBerry 10 everybody's talking about coming out the end of the month. Whoo one day

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tomorrow I don't know one day one day January 30th. I think it's coming  It's it's almost too easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What a thing that means that you can't take a picture quietly you have to hold the phone like I am taking a picture now  Watch out. That's for business. That's for government because that's a problem with these phones  Is people bringing camera phones and that you can't bring them into most secure installations miss your actions

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, look, I mean they still have every black bear user. I know is obsessed with tape over there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently a boot who showed a Nexus Galaxy Nexus phone, which had been modified to run  Ubuntu for phone pretty it's pretty  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think about this is um, I'd say it's the same with the Firefox phones  They're they're basically taking Android models and run them on that because there's this available  Infrastructure of these devices that will happily put Linux go and then you can install other stuff on top  So in some ways, this is an outgrowth of the of the you know alternate  Android OS hacking community and if people are just taking a bit further saying well, what if we replace a bigger chunk of this, right?  So I think that's healthy. It's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is slides in from up down left and right kind of like the Windows 8 charms bar actually  Yeah, if you can you show this John?  So you slid down to get the messages kind of like notifications slid up to get home you get an application  Menu by sliding in from the left. Yeah, I like that. That's pretty neat UI, you know what else?  It's fairly snappy, isn't it? It looks like it  anyway for those not watching on video you can go to engadget.com and look at their first hands on of  I mean, it's worth taking a look. It's cool. Right looks good  What about Intel getting into TV business at first the rumors where they would announce it at?  CES Intel was quick to say not gonna be ready  Internet based TV service and hardware to take on Apple TV  One person according to the Wall Street Journal one person familiar with Intel's thinking  The shill who called us from Intel's PR department  Predicted the predicted the company would launch its offering by mid 2013  Maybe not even till the fourth quarter  Maybe not citing delays in reaching content licensing. Isn't that the issue the Apple's facing and everybody's facing?  I was thinking about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple has it fairly solved they will sell you TV shows and they were pretty much, you know, the big companies there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're not a set-top box yet. They're not they're not they haven't got the deals with the live  Right. Yeah incumbents yet that NBC CBS CBS and ABC are saying  Yeah, but people care about that. I know you don't care because you're an erudite  Britisher

Congratulations. Thank you very much our  pundits of the week  This is Nicholas Carlson running a business insider. Google is attacking Apple from the inside out. They're actually making an interesting point that  Basically a lot of us take the Apple apps on the iPhone move them to a folder on the back page and use  Google's Chrome  Did you do that on my mini that's right? It's all Google and Kindle and there's no Google Plus. Yep, the Google search tool  Gmail instead of Apple Mail  Google Maps instead of Apple Maps  YouTube

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is there a g2 half the works yet. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's messaging there's nested messaging which somehow is different than g-chat. I don't even know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but you can that is a problem that Google has to address by the way, which is it's a plethora of strange things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's things need to be there's overlapped nicely. Yes  It's interesting. It's the old Trojan horse thing, right? It's like  But I'll tell you what I don't know what their overall strategy is but the mobile folks the mobile designers over at Google  They're doing they got they got the groove back that cuz that's a phenomenal rate

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think and maps is just fun. It's phenomenal  They've been not as pretty as Apple Maps, but at least it has places in the right spot  It's a new things with it. They're the UI and UX is like completely  It's not what people were expecting and they've worked on it for a long time  They worked on it way longer than people thought Liz Gaines wrote that 2012 was the year

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Work there because it would work in the in the browser and that's like, okay now  It's worth spending the time to do this and make this work there as well  So you you never not been able to use it on there even when Apple was like finding them fairly hard  And now it's like now Apple is being more calm about it and letting them build apps now  I understand that's a good one. That's what that Microsoft Deputy Council was saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why isn't Google trying to take us over from the inside?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because no, that's why when more than 40 years ago  When more than 40 people buy a phone there, it's not worth we don't want to take you over from the inside  Look, I used to work for an app development company and we sat there and we discussed Windows phones  Like do we want to build it survey says waste of our time everybody everybody has limited budget

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, there's no infinite even Google doesn't have an infinite development budget and you make some you have to always make some decisions

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's another thing that you have to pay attention to once you build the app and it's in the store  You have to maintain it you can't let it go to crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll see weird MI in our chat room says Microsoft is taking itself over from the inside. That's actually I think what happened  It's like it big from alien lawyers are blogging  Merry Christmas lawyers are blogging. Oh, yeah ships consoles to developers gosh darn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have received yet. I can't wait for this thing. I'm I wish I had bought the developer one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sad now stoked those of you who spent six hundred ninety nine dollars for this. It's an Android based  game platform, right  It's you what you would get is the developer count console is only  1,200 of them but they were they're being shipped out now  There was a lot of incitement when this happened did I wonder if Jason Howell or somebody from all about Android Jason?  Did you buy an uya?  Did you buy the uya on Kickstarter? No see  It was did you buy a Joey bra?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what's different about the OEA than just plug it in or into the TV? Well controller

It was just ridiculous  Who did Tom  Tom Merritt ordered one a new thing to Tom Merritt wins in the in the game  They raised eight point five million dollars. That's nine hundred percent over there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think now they have sixty three thousand building users who will use this platform  Maybe that's a way to first you gotta get a game going on  Well that yeah, so the developers now have it in their hands maybe and they can start making their games

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's solved you can't go to uya TV now and buy you buy a pre-order it. How much is it? Ninety nine dollars  It's not bad but again like with all Kickstarter things there's always this kind of pre-order one, but you're right  Will there be a good game? Will there be anything there be a little come out?  Yeah, you get one controller extra controller $30  It's 99 bucks. That's pretty tempting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, but what is it? But what are the what happens if they never ship it? You don't get your money back  No, of course not. You're an investor. You're not a you're not buying nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't imagine you're buying anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This should be a whole market for things that people have funded but didn't get done like people can come along and do and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Make money. No, I think there's a reason they didn't get done. Well, so Intel's Intel's TV. Let's get back to the subject. Yes  What is this gonna be that? It's not the Apple TV is not besides running an Intel processor

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds me too to me. I  Don't know until anyone can get the control of all the live television and do the deals with the networks  It's not I'm not sold on it's tough web TV. There's been web TV for 15 years. Remember when why is Intel doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is it? I mean traditionally they make the stuff so that other people can do these things  I guess Intel doesn't make PCs they make you know designer reference PCs, but they don't make PCs  Maybe now that Microsoft's making PCs that Intel says well, we got to get in the game. They don't make phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yeah, but  Why you know, I think this is this is going away, you know  There are there are there all these little Android HDMI sticks you can get for like right if deep bug  Now that is the size of an HDMI connect you plug it in the back and it will drive the screen and you can  It'll connect 20 networks. You got lying around and use Bluetooth devices  So, you know an Apple has already set the price point very low on this to the point where you know, Google Google's next  Compete with right that was 300 bucks  That was three bucks. Yeah, but the other things are hundred bucks. They're very nice. They do the job  But these Google sticks at the federal code for 40 bucks Roku's still doing well. I got a Roku stick  Plugs in the MHL HDMI port. Yeah, so, you know, there's there's you know that that  And if you buy a TV, you've already got all that features built in now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't know where the I don't I don't know where the opportunity lies

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The UX of the TV is still like in the dark ages unless they've changed a lot in the last year or so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know what I look at I look at TiVo because TiVo did everything right great UI really worked wonderful  Yes  It should have been the set-top box and for a brief moment  DirecTV actually did have a set-top box with TiVo built in and then it went away and yeah people buy TiVo and they're still alive  but it's not it can't take off because it's you have to have an  IR blaster and it's too complicated regular folks can't figure that out. I gotta come as a set-top box

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does and but again, this is like the the cable, you know, the cable companies and the network saying no  They don't want to do it  No, they don't want to lose ad revenue from people who like record stuff and then skip over the advertisements

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I got we got Kevin Marks on by the way, we coming up at three o'clock  We've got an incredible triangulation. You're gonna want to stay tuned for Dan  The author of predictably irrational will be on how cool what a great book  But that book yeah, if you want to understand why the Wall Street Journal has three different prices  It's cheaper to get the Wall Street Journal online plus paper than it is just to get the Wall Street Journal online  Why Dan explains that there's a reason for reasons like it's brilliant. Oh, have you read that book Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love when people explain things

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wonderful ever that right I keep getting I've got I accidentally got them signed up for the Wall Street Journal to be delivered now  I can't get rid of it. It's really nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They want you to get the paper, I don't understand why it costs more not to get the paper why there's a reason  Stay tuned  Google's but I'm glad you're here Kevin because you can explain this VP 9  VP8 wasn't good enough. So now we have VP 9 is this WebM

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He's gone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's like I don't want to talk about that  We should explain that besides being the micro formats guru  The guy but Kevin was the guy who brought QuickTime to Apple was in was responsible for QuickTime at Apple knows  Codex very well as the expert on that and of course Skype it took this moment to disconnect him  It's building up the excitement

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's building up the excitement

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because I sure know nothing about chrome has so VP 8 was the idea VP 8 was this is a  Codec that is unencumbered. This is a problem that everybody has with  All the other video codex area. We got Kevin back so he can explain this as you mentioned this my  Yeah, of course chrome has VP 9 built in so and then also this new opus audio compression  Which I've been starting to hear about this is another open source  Or is it opens is it open source? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not sure that there is no source implementation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there's oh dear the leaf the leaf blower brigade has arrived. Yep. Sorry about that  So Kevin I love Kevin because he he is you could tell he worked at the BBC he worked in television  He's always looking for the beautiful  Backdrop we've had Kevin call in from the top the Moscone Center at her boy in a garden in San Francisco beautiful  He's always in his backyard or garden as they would as the Britzer want to call it  I don't know where you are. It looks like you're in your garden  But unfortunately, so are the gardeners  So, let's see VP 9 and opus are codex

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Problem of course with h.264  5 and h e vc is that these are  encumbered by patents and they're owned by somebody and now I will interpret the hand signals  Write it down and hold it up the issue as I understand it and Kevin you just shake your head  Yes, or no is that currently HTML 5 has a bracket video bracket tag  But it doesn't have any standard implementation of what bracket video bracket. Well, there's two does

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the problem is there's dispute between the different companies about what they should do  H 264 has kind of been settled on as de facto  But that requires a patent license means you can't build an open source version of it, right?  I'm peg la owns it right and think ever la owns it and wants money for it  And you know there are there's a there's a lower threshold upper threshold in theory  Actually, but it's messy right and conversely Apple says  If we use this other one that doesn't have a patent license  We could be sued and we're a huge target because we're Apple and will be sued

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, in other words, they're saying yeah, you can have VP 8 and VP 9, but you can't indemnify us against  It being somehow somebody's patent. They're violating and now with the patent trolls out there. It's almost guaranteed. You'll get sued  So better to get something like h dot 264 where it's known who owns it you can give them a buck

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you know and things Apple's vision hasn't changed all this in in  12 years because when I was at Apple I spent a big chunk of time trying to get them to ship Vorbis in  Quicktime and being told no you can't do that  We'll get sued right and if you make us lose our license to decompress the audio in DVDs  You'll be enormously unpopular and I'm not gonna take  And  And that if you actually listen to what Apple is saying  They're still saying somebody somewhere will pop up with a patent on this and it might be Dolby Labs  It might be frowning off for it. Maybe someone like that  And they will say you cannot you you cannot do this unless you indemnify us and it's probably it's like  You are the richest company in the world  I don't think you need to be indemnified by an open source developer grow up Apple, right?  and yeah  You're gonna get me going on patents now and that's that yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We could go on and on and on about patents a leaf blower in the chat room. I wish somebody would just  Patent the leaf blower and we could put it out of business  MPEG LA I think is spreading a little fud about all this when VP 8 was announced. They said well, we've talked to 12  unnamed organizations who say they have  patents that VP 8 violates  Remember Google bought on to technologies which creative EPA

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was to get a bunch of good video engineers  And the other reason was to get to get these codecs and be able to have something that was opening licensable  Right and that was an investment net and that's that was you know, that was I think a better investment than buying  Up some of these patent pools. They're buying from companies like Kodak and things which seems like an enormous sort of money sink  attacks on doing business for these companies  I was having conversation with with I'm not sure I should credit who it was  But someone said, you know  If Google actually said if we took a billion dollars and decided to fight every one of these stupid patents instead of buying this  Patents from this company that would be a really useful thing for Google to do  Rob that would that would actually change this thing because there was another case today  of  It was an ars technica where they somebody is going around suing everyone who scans documents  them small businesses that have document scanners and  Demanding a thousand dollar per employee license for this  Oh, I some you know some bunch of lawyers on the East Coast who bought the patent from a corpse and going around, you know  harassing people and then they got some publicity about it and they've now split the company into  16 companies with six letter names that nobody can pronounce and that and they're trying to do they've sort of hide all these evil  Patent litigation stuff in lots of small companies and carrying on doing the same thing  So the app there is there is some massive brokenness here and we need to just say no, this is broken  We're gonna find ways around it. We have found ways around it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shouldn't Google just step up and indemnify it and say look. All right, we understand you're nervous about it  We believe it's unencumbered. We will defend you we will indemnify you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, you know, the question is indemnification is messy  Right that they said we will fight this I think an identification is when it's like I will I will make you whole and whatever  It's like no  We already have these

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft does this with Linux by the way Microsoft indemnifies people who use Linux  Encouraging use use Microsoft products naturally

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't know that one. That's but isn't that wild?  That's surreal  but the the the one for me is that  The point is we have these  pattern policies for open source stuff and for open standard stuff to say  This should be a royalty-free thing and we've we've built up structures to do that to the point where we can all  Work to you know, Microsoft is committing code to webkit now that you know  We're at the point we'll be on that point with the web stuff  But we're at the but we haven't gone the stage further and said and we will mutually defend each other against  this kind of nonsense now  The web stuff has  Damped down a bit  There is less of the nonsense around suing everyone who's able to use a hyperlink or any of these other silly web lawsuits  Because they suspect they will you know, the big companies will stand up and hit them  But there isn't like this sort of mutual defense and so partly  And the video stuff is still way worse and the mobile stuff is even more a rat hole  But there's I think there's potential here to do this  But but what's basically happening is we're just waiting for these things to expire  Most of these video patents are 20 years old nearly  Yeah  And we're sitting here waiting for them to die out and the sad part is we haven't come up with any new ways of encoding  video in the last 20 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  20 is it 24 years and out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anyway 20 years ish for the duration of time, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  by the way, and thanks to the chat room for passing along this link from broadband reports a  patent troll named brandywine communications is suing  Internet service providers for using DSL gear they've sued they're suing 39 ISPs to date  Claiming that they violated DSL related patent that they that they own

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a beta version out there it will allow users to download install every app on the Google Play Store  What what that's amazing? That's really cool. There's about half a million apps up there and you could just run them in a window  You don't have to have the little phone window. Sure  You can run them and it's an emulation. They call it layer cake  Because it has to emulate more than just Android and Dalvik it has to emulate arm, right?  It's not  Fruit ninja angry birds

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It depends on what services I have on I have 3g or 4g running on it  Will it slow it way down?

Transcript:  Maybe they're not lying, but it's weird. It's like your friend has just joined  It has 2,000 pictures

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're alive again now flickers waking up a little bit Yahoo's happy about that nice to watch it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead. I've got a tip. I've got a grumble. It's like from Wyatt  Everyone goes on about Android fragmentation. I am really sick of iOS fragmentation. I don't have an iPhone. I have it  And iPad 2 and half my apps have this black border around them all the time  It's like are they mourning the fragmentation of the Apple platform? What's going on here?  You know my Android apps they get bigger on different screens and on iOS  Everyone is still happy to make these little tiny things that don't do that. You can do 2x and you know, actually it's it's  16 X on some of the things now. It's just really really annoying and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They need to fix it. Isn't it funny because so for so long Apple  Laughed at Android because of fragmentation, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Android started out with lots of different screen sizes  So developers cope with they handed it handled it and iOS is like, oh I can still use bitmap  So I can pretend this isn't really an issue even though there are now  Going on here and you know, and there are some nice apps  You know flick is one of them because like you're a photo app. Why am I running you in 2x everything looks pixelated  Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, there needs to be native. I yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Screen you know the readiness screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't imagine how bad that looks but this goes back to the whole Microsoft thing if people aren't building native iPad apps  Why would they build?  apps from Microsoft phone, okay, I'm done  Sorry  Yes, everyone build a native iPad app, please

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do have to say that that is one thing that iOS has down when a developer wants to show off  How beautiful they can make an app even Google they make their most beautiful apps for iOS, right?  Google plus gorgeous then they do it on Android. Yeah flicker gorgeous  Then they do it on Android if you want to say look we we are elegant  We know UI we can make a beautiful UI. They always do it for I don't know if it's cuz it's easier or more likely because  Apple users expect that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's but it's I'm not sure is easier. I mean in some sense is easier because  Yeah, there's some things Apple give you as primitive

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there's am a  Animation primitive I talked to Dave Moran at path and you know  He said it was easier to do it for iOS because they have animation primitives that we had to actually rewrite for Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a promotional aspect to it too because a lot of developers if they are if they have a great team and are building something  Gorgeous they want Apple to promote it and for Apple to promote your ass  They you better be iOS only you better be shiny and beautiful. Yeah, you better be iOS only they're not playing with you  That's true put out an Android app. That's a very good point  Now after you after you get promoted in your path, and you've done well  Then you could put that's when an Android app comes back out. Yeah, so that's why you know, that's actually a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's Instagram same thing they waited until they got all the all the benefit of being in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want to be promoted you want to be you know high in the I mean if you're high on the leaderboards in the top  Free apps you get tons of downloads on that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I  Was gonna I found I you know, I can't remember the name of it now  I found a new launcher one of the things that Android is great as you could you know, basically with springboard is it on?  I've got lunch. You know break. Yeah, you can jailbreak it, but you're pretty much stuck with Apple's UI  Yeah  But on Android and keyboard etc and Android and many keyboards as you want and there's some wonderful launchers and I found a new one  That's free. I think it's a Google guy that developed it and I can't remember the name of it  But I like it because it has it's very clean and simple the app  He's his whole idea was you're never more than one second away  From any app on the thing. I like that. Yeah, it has this new folder type called cover  You can it looks like you know, like for instance, I use my phone  Icon you tap that it launches you double tap it. It opens up with a bunch of phone shortcuts things like that  That's me. Yeah, but I can't remember the name  so if anybody I was waiting for the chat room to tell me and  They they're failing me again launchers are great  Customization Nova launchers what I use mostly but I can't remember the name of this. It's kind of a generic launcher name  I'll find it for next twig next twig Gina and Jeff will be back  We missed them a little bit  But it's so nice, you know, you know, we've had these guys on the show with Jeff and Gina  It's so nice to have them. It's not go launcher. That's been around for a while. Maybe it's apex  Maybe it's apex ADW I've used action launcher. That's it action. There you go  You'd a man whoever said that  Some generic thing. Maybe he's the guy who wrote action launcher. Maybe  There's a free version and there's a pro version  Chris Lacey is the guy who wrote this and it's it's worth taking a look at try the free version  And you can kind of see what it can do. It's different, but it's really I think  Very interesting very sweet. It's brand new and so there were a little bug a little couple of little buggies that have gone away  399 for the paid pro version try the free version first, but I have to say I I love it that we're seeing these incredible  New ui's new launchers people can do that stuff on Android and and really play with it's a competitive advantage  Yeah, it is and I do and I'm actually back to using Nova launcher because I love Nova launcher  But action launcher is well well worth looking at if you'd like to try other launchers  I want to thank Kevin Marks for being here and his leaf blowing brigade  They've gone now. They've gone. They've moved on. That's one good thing about lift rollers. They don't they don't stick around long  Tumble vision TV anything else you'd like to plug
