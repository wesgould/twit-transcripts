Gina Turpani is here from ThinkUp.com, founding editor of Lifehacker. Hosted all about Android.  You guys had a great show yesterday with Miriam Jwar. That was great to see her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it was a good show. Always had fun. Always fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also here, Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York in his office at CUNY.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just got something exciting today. I got my new book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, congratulations. Geeks bearing gifts, imagining new futures for news.  Where can we get that book, Jeff Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pretty wonky, but it's what I do for a living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this was the white paper you were talking about?  This is the white paper that metastasized, yes.  Awesome. Hey, wait a minute. I hear a familiar sounding laugh.  It's Matt Cutts. And he's holding two dinosaurs.  Hello, everybody.  Welcome, Matt. I almost said Googler Matt Cutts, but you're in a leave of absence right now, which seems to be going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very relaxing with the cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that nice? Matt, as many of you know by now, Matt is an early, early employee of Google.  He does such a great job fighting spam on the search results.  And so the story at Search Engine Land was that you're on a leave of absence, which you may extend into next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So Google has been really generous.  They occasionally will let folks go on leave for up to three months.  And so that would have been earlier in October.  And talk to them and there's still some stuff that I'm working on and that my family needs me for.  And so we're extending that leave into 2015.  Has it been nice?  Well, it has been good. Yeah, I've gotten to go on an Alaska cruise with my family and visit Portland for XOXO in New York.  It's been wonderful.  But they also the other good thing is that the team is in really good hands.  There's a strong, deep bench of people who really know how to fight spam well, both on the algorithmic side and on the manual spam side.  So, you know, they don't they don't need me there.  And they've been doing a great job while I'm on the I think you're just being a great husband.  You write trying to rack up husband points.  You write on your blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, you wrote this back in July when you announced the leave when I joined Google, my wife and I agreed I'd work for four and four to five years.  How many years was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's been 14 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, and then she'd get to see more of me.  I talked about this as recently as Matt last month and as early as 2006.  Now, almost 15 years later, I'm going to take a little time off.  That's nice. Do they call it a sabbatical?  I mean, it's kind of like a sabbatical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, technically they call it a leave.  But, you know, the HR department at Google is very good about trying to work with people and trying to figure out, you know, what's the best way to make things work for everybody involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're not checking your work email at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've done a pretty good job of not replying to work email.  It's really hard to not even read work email.  And it's especially hard not to read Google News because, you know, I'm incredibly interested in all right stuff in the cloud and everything going on.  So I still kind of read all the things going on in Europe and and, you know, the NSA news and all that sort of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You really look like Dr. Evil in that chair with your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know, I love the Dr. Evil.  It's nice, like Matt On Lee and the Dr. Evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One million dollars, yes.  But she does this all the time.  And he loves to perch on me and she'll walk around with me around the house.  That's a perfect cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's enjoyed me being around the house.  I wish cats liked me more, but they really they could take her leave me.  That's why you have the spell dog on you.  Yeah, the dog.  Well, is that why?  Yeah, sense Ozzy.  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's more about the cat than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's great that you're extending extending your leave.  And I mean, you know, not speaking just totally generally, I feel like the work life balance thing is kind of like one of the dirty little secrets of our industry.  Like I think it's just so easy to get sucked into.  I mean, there's so many exciting things going on, especially your position at Google.  There's that, you know, so easy to just get kind of sucked into work.  But I think it's great that you're that you're taking a break.  And of course, like we know you as the face of Google and as so many so many people do.  But also, like I like when you're just Matt, like I love your experiment stuff.  I love your personal blog when you're writing about, you know, your own stuff.  And so I'm I'm all for you being Maxima Matt and whatever, even if that means, you know, out of the context to Google, I think it's great.  Thank you so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so Gina is doing a 30 day challenge or has been writing a lot more on scribbling dot net.  And that inspired me.  So my 30 day challenge this month is to write at least once a day.  So I've been warming up with little simple stuff and it's good.  You know, there's sort of a renaissance of people like Andy Bayo and a bunch of people writing more often on their own blogs.  And that's that's a good thing, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if only the blog would come back, if only I've actually failed miserably at doing it every single day.  But I decided it's not going to be an absolute like pass fail thing that it's going to be an ongoing just, you know, if I didn't do it yesterday, do it today anyway, kind of thing.  Because I I tend to get into that geeky engineering thing where I'm like, well, it failed.  The whole thing is broken. I didn't do it.  You know, I know exactly what you mean.  You're going to just try again. Try again today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What have some of your challenges been that's it wants to be gone, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here's one. This is his Halloween costume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, dear. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Edvard Munch is the scream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been playing around with a projector and canvases.  There's also one that I did about the shining, which really makes me look crazy.  I think the SEOs, the search engine optimizers, you know, they love whenever I act like a dinosaur or something because they get used to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's Johnny. Wow. That's amazing.  Wow. I think you need to go back to work soon, Matt.  Yeah, maybe so. All work and no play, Max Matta, dull boy.  Wow. Did you? But now you can't bring a projector with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For now. But what I did for the scream was I projected the painting on a canvas and then I traced it.  And then I could just I repainted the scream myself.  And so if you get up close, it's really awful quality.  But it's like a paint by numbers, you know, version of the scream, which is the real one.  That's cool. I have the canvas.  There you go. With me. So you can see the hole where I would stick my head.  So it's it's pretty fun to just tinker around, you know, make the sunset look about the right, right, you know, amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is exclusive content. Nobody else has this boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The making of. So you decided not to do the hang in there kitten poster, I take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that was a failed experiment.  You know, I'm trying to be more OK. Oh, yeah.  If you show that picture, I'm trying to be more OK with publicly failing.  Like I did a blog post about hitting the wall at a recent marathon and how humbling that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So, yeah. So do you think when you when you go, will you go back in the same role at Google, do you think?  Or maybe this is a chance for you to try something else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I really have been impressed with how well everyone else on the team is doing.  And it's created a little bit of an opportunity for them to try new things, explore different stuff, you know, approach problems from a different way.  And so, you know, we'll have to see how it goes.  I love the part of my job that dealt with, you know, keeping an eye on what important news was happening related to Google.  But, you know, it's not clear that having me as a lightning rod, you know, for, you know, unhappy black cat SEOs or something is the best use of anybody's time compared to, you know, working on other things that could be making the world better for Google or in general.  So we'll see how it all works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What an opportunity, you know, to be at somewhere like Google and to have obviously you have their trust and and say, hey, maybe I want to try my hand at that.  You get you actually get to do that. You're senior enough now. You must be able to say, could I do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The interesting thing is that Google, they try to get you to go and do different projects.  And the product managers, they encourage you to rotate every two or three years.  And so it's relatively rare to find people who have been around, you know, forever in a specific area.  Now you'll find Ahmed in search, Sridhar in ads, you know, some of these people that are really, really senior, you know, higher ranking than me for sure.  They do stick around in one area. But a lot of other people jump to different parts of the company to burnish different skills and try different things, which is a pretty good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We talked last week, didn't we, about those poor Facebook folks who have to look at all the crap.  Yeah. And so we thought of you, Matt, because it's like, well, that has to do a little bit of that, too.  Although we figured by now you have minions who will be actually looking at the spam as opposed to doing it for colleagues.  But yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're commenting on your sunny disposition in the face of the underbelly of the Internet, even as in the abstract, even if you're not deleting child porn manually yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, and I just have so much admiration for, for example, last year there was a real effort on child porn because of some stuff that happened in the United Kingdom.  And a lot of people chipped in and that is not an easy job at all.  And so, you know, it really you have to think hard about how you're going to tackle those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I bet. So you're kind of a polymath, but you've been in the same department. What are the things interesting that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are the things that? Oh, man, I was computer graphics and actually, you know, inertial trackers and accelerometers in grad school.  Really? And at one point I said, oh, yeah, I said, you know, you could use commodity hardware.  But as a grad student, you don't have the access to influence anybody's mind.  So why don't I just go do something else for 10 years and somebody else will come up with all these sensors.  And sure enough, you've got Kinect, you know, the Wii, you know, the iPhone.  Now everybody's got a computer in their pocket that can do 3D sensing as long as you write the computer programs well.  So there's there's all kinds of interesting stuff you could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Andy Rubin has left Google.  Of course, he was the guy who brought Android created Android, brought it to Google and ran Android for some time last year.  He left and went to robotics in the we think it was in the Google products stuff.  And now he's going off to do something probably robotics lady related on his own.  I think it's not unusual. In fact, I think the commentary when he left was this is normal.  This is what happens in some ways. We hope this is what happens is that people kind of grow and and and move on maybe to other things and then kind of extend the Google connections out into the rest of the world.  You won't leave Google, though.  Well, I want to put them on the spot.  Oh, I want to put them on the spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always have a connection and a soft spot for Google.  I think that's the idea, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That these people this day, the Google diaspora.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's fun to watch like a twig or two ago.  You know, I listen while running to this week in Google and and it's really fun to hear how you guys interpret various things in the, you know, the criminology of trying to, you know, reverse engineer why this person's doing that or something is really fun.  And it's it's definitely the case like this interview with Larry Page in the Financial Times.  Right. You know, it's it's it's neat to have that perspective of like maybe a little bit better guess about what Larry was thinking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was actually a great interview and I think is probably timed around Sundar Pichai's promotion and the idea that Larry will have fewer direct reports and be able to think more about the high level stuff.  Freeing himself up to think big is how the Financial Times.  My favorite part of this was saying Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't imagine a bigger mission statement than Google's.  Yet he wants a bigger mission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  The original mission was what to organize all the world's information and make it accessible, universally accessible and useful.  That's pretty big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a function of cash flow.  I mean, I mean, I actually, you know, I love Google.  Obviously, I do the show and I think the intentions are good.  But I think, you know, it's like Google has a great business with lots of money in the bank.  Right. So which gives them the opportunity to look at those big at those big challenges.  And I'm so glad that they are.  But, you know, I mean, there are very few companies, I think, that can make that leap.  And make those kinds of investments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's kind of exactly what Larry said when they the Times FT asked him what the new mission statement would be.  He said, well, we were still trying to work that out.  We have sixty two billion dollars in cash.  We're in a bit of uncharted territory.  We're trying to figure it out.  How do we use all these resources and have a more positive impact on the world?  Boy, that'd be a fun company to be at.  I think Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's filed on their good problems to have.  Yeah. If you trust Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, I have to say I'm reading a book, which is a great book called Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, which is a fun book.  Yeah. Have you read it?  I'm reading it right now.  It's kind of like I don't know the the end of it, so I can't spoil it for you.  But it's a novel about a company, actually a consortium of the biggest data companies in the world who just basically say,  Forget the NSA.  We're going to collect everything about everybody and store it.  And it's one of those.  It's like the worst paranoid fantasy.  So if you're a privacy buff or privacy advocate, this is what you fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But as opposed to other dystopian novels of the current time, this one had a wry touch and it was fun.  Oh, I love it.  That attitude drives me nuts.  But I enjoyed the book a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it is it is I mean, I think it's pretty clear that the the evil person in the book is kind of a Bill Gates type working in a Google type company would be my play on it.  But it does. These are the fears I think some people have.  Yes.  And that Google might be have an overarching ambition that goes beyond what we're comfortable with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I read another one recently, which was the opposite.  Well, I can't remember the title right now in which the opposite happens that everything gets controlled and we don't get the freedom to share and dystopia can cut any dystopia as its alternate number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And there's always the extreme.  I'm not going to ask Matt this because this would put him on the spot.  But and obviously you trust Google because you work there and you more than many are inside Google and understand kind of a little more what the motivations are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting, too, because like I think a lot of people view Google as a monolith and I tend to view it more like almost like separate silos.  You know, there's search, there's Chrome, there's Android, there's social, there's Google Plus, there's YouTube.  And each silo or department, whatever you want to call it within the company is good at certain things and not as good at other things.  And so search is fantastic at artificial intelligence, machine learning, as it relates to search, at least, and handling things really, really fast.  Whereas two or three generations ago when you went to go order your Nexus four, maybe the store couldn't have the load or something like that.  But then there's other parts of Google are good at are good at other things.  And so I think at least I can only speak for core search.  But one of the things that core search has always believed in is trying to have a level playing field and things like takeout so that if you don't like Google, you can leave, which forces us to compete honestly.  And so I totally understand why some people are like, OK, I'm worried about ambition or disruption.  But as long as you eat a company has to earn your loyalty, right?  There's not lock in.  That's to me the big promise that makes it such that you don't have to work at Google for 14 years to know that it's trustworthy because you can go anywhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, because I know you and I trust you, I do trust Google.  But I have to say, when you say when your mission goes from we just want to be great search and organize the world's information, something that everybody can kind of get behind to.  Well, now we've got a lot of money, so let's get more ambitious.  It starts to raise a little bit of a red flag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's the opposite.  I read the opposite, Leo.  I thought that it was saying now we have a responsibility to give back and to use science and engineering to solve problems and do neat things and help.  But who decides?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, who decides what government does it?  I don't know either.  But but who decides what what is altruistic and for a societal benefit?  The guy with the money, the guys writing the check.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's one thing that I do love about Larry is he wants to make a big difference.  You know, maybe not just one dent in the universe, but multiple dents in the universe.  And his mode of thinking, you know, from the outside, from what I can tell, seems to be OK.  Well, what are what's causing the biggest suffering?  What do people die of?  What is causing the most harm?  And if and it may be and he's he did a pretty good job of enunciating that in his Financial Times interview and he's done that those interviews with Ted.  And if those are the kinds of motives, then you can understand, OK, self-driving cars, you know, a lot of people die because of accidents, you know, or calico trying to tackle disease or these new nanoparticles that could go around and spot diseases much, much earlier.  And it just seems like there's so many moonshots or 10 times thing, 10 times improvements that everybody would be like, yes, healthier people.  And then you can certainly argue over the relative priorities of some stuff.  But there's there's still a lot of not low hanging fruit, but seemingly mission impossible things that that are have yet to really be tackled the way that they could be tackled.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would hope that he has good advisors and is is doing this.  Well, here's I'll give you an example.  So they worried me a little bit in the FT article.  He says, given the chance to give up work, nine out of 10 people, quote, wouldn't want to be doing what they're doing today.  And that's yes, but then 10 people are out of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He wants he predicts radical deflation.  I asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, frozen, Jeff.  Andry.  No, I'm glad it's not just me.  No, it's Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You asked Mark Andreessen what Larry also talked about radical deflation.  Yeah, prices will come down because of greater efficiency.  Well, well, that could bring some really disruptive forces into society and may not be all good.  But he saw it as a positive saying that things will get cheaper.  People have more time now that this this people have more time.  TROPE has been predicted often.  I don't know whether it's true or not, but I do agree that as you've heard me say, a show of technology leads to efficiency overgrowth.  And I think that's part of what he's saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and Jeff, you had a really good piece from 2011 called the jobless future.  I think that basically talks about how technology leads to all kinds of improvements, but not automatically to more jobs.  And, you know, Eric Schmidt gets kind of this reputation for saying things that are true, but maybe not as polite or something like that.  And, you know, you've got government saying we're going to create as many jobs as possible.  And I think a lot of technologists are like, is the objective to create jobs or is the objective to do, you know, the best possible thing that you can do?  And yes, there's absolutely some tension inherent there.  And I think Leo, you're right to put your thumb on it and say, wait a second, what if you're in that?  What if you're a telephone operator or a truck driver and suddenly switching is automatic or in 50 years or whatever, you know, computers can drive cars more effectively.  He also says he defends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And he says you can't wish these things away because they're going to happen.  Yeah.  You're going to have some very amazing capabilities in the economy when we have computers that could do more and more jobs.  It's going to change how we think about work.  There's no way around it.  You can't wish it away.  And those are the right words.  And then I would hope that he would start to think about, well, what happens?  He says, I mean, I don't think the answer is, oh, this is fine, because everything's going to get so cheap that you don't need a job.  He's not an answer that I think a lot of people want to hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And I personally agree with you.  I think saying that there's disruption coming in the future and that is a two-edged sword.  And disruption helps in a lot of ways.  And disruption hurts a lot of incumbents and hurts a lot of industries and can hurt people if they don't prepare for it.  And then maybe the next part of that could be, and how do we all talk about or begin the conversation of how to prepare for that together?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And I agree.  I think that's the you have my friends in publishing, especially German publishing, who go after Google as if that was our money.  You took it away from us.  You owe us something.  I couldn't disagree with that more.  But I would agree that having had a disruptive impact on, for example, news and the media industry, I think Google has some more, if not more,  that an ethical responsibility and opportunity to help rethink the future.  And so you have Larry Page having tremendous gifts, gifts of intellect, gifts of his fields of science and now gifts of cash.  And I'm not saying he should go give it to Axel Springer or they should give it to, oh, I don't know, CUNY.  It's not like a Bill Gates thing.  But I would argue that what we need in these industries is the best of Silicon Valley's innovation and investment to rethink what they what they ought to be,  what they can be, not the current players, not the legacy players.  There's no no right that they should continue in their old power.  But for Google to tackle big questions like how do we solve disease?  How do we stop people from dying in cars?  How do we have a more informed society?  Things like that I think is now a kind of get back.  And you can do it the Bill Gates way where you say I got a big bucketload of money and I'm going to put my sparts to use it that way.  Or you could do it when I think Larry is much younger is to say, well, while I'm still in this company, while I have this incredible powerhouse, how can we harness that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's right. And that's the difference.  It scares me a little bit.  So now I'm going to call on you, the historian, Jeff, because there have been plutocrats before there were there.  The robber barons.  There have been very, very wealthy men before.  And I think Bill Gates is one model where you make a pile of money, you put it in the bank and then you retire and you give it to charity.  And what he's doing is not to the to build a business around that, but just giving it all away.  What Larry's proposing is a little more scary to me.  And I wonder if there's a precedent for this where you have somebody like Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, these very extraordinary.  And I guess I don't know about Apple if there's a guy at Apple like that.  I guess not. But these extraordinary wealthy guys who instead of saying I'm just going to make this money, put it in the bank.  And then when I retire, give it away, who say I'm going to I'm going to rebuild society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Easy. Henry Ford, Thomas Edison.  And what happened?  Thomas Edison invented a whole bunch of cool stuff and got very wealthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then what do you do with the money?  Did he say now I'm going to change the world and I'm going to remake the world in a new in my own vision?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He kept doing what he did to improve the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He kept inventing. Yes.  Now, Henry Ford was more of the more of the megalomaniac style where I'm going to reinvent the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's got a sort of new utopia in Brazil. Didn't work out so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't work so well, did it? No.  So that's what worries me is that.  Look, Larry's obviously brilliant and I think Google is fantastic, but I worry that somebody now suddenly has a lot of power, influence and money.  And when you're giving money to charity, it's a little different because you're working within a system.  Now it's almost as if he wants to create his own system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's like that's that's that's still going to screw.  That's Bill Gates saying, OK, I'm done and now I'll take my cash lump.  And he don't forget Bill Gates is using his intelligence and trying to change the world in important ways with his money.  Right. But the charitable system in this country isn't all that great.  It's better. It's more developed and better than it is in other countries.  But it has its own problems of of of legacy and stick of the mud and bureaucracy and and entrenched interests and all kinds of things.  Charities aren't all wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and somebody's pointing out that, of course, the other thing Henry Ford did is he started the Foreign Foundation, which to this day is really a valuable asset in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I guess the only thing I'd add is is that Google has a couple of advantages in that you've got a critical mass of smart people and they have tried to have a culture of don't be evil.  And you can argue over individual incidents and whether this specific thing is evil or that specific thing is evil.  But Google as a whole, whenever I look at the DNA, the people try to do the right things.  And so if you've got Larry marching off in one direction and you've got, you know, the rest of the company saying, no, we disagree.  And they drag their heels and they create friction that that, in my opinion, helps to move things toward a consensus of maybe a middle ground, which works pretty well.  And then having that critical mass of smart people lets you say, oh, now I can do voice recognition better.  Now I can do image recognition better and I can unlock all kinds of good applications to improve the world that way.  Whereas if you just look at it and Larry said, so it's a tough call.  You know, it's like Gina says, it's a good problem to have, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like when you get on a unique system for the first time.  I mean, you know, the thing you see with great power comes great responsibility.  Google has root, I think, you know, and I think that the fear is like, you know, what are they going to do?  You know, are they going to be responsible?  And I like the idea that there's checks and balances and that there's, you know, critical mass of smart people.  I just you know, the evil thing is like, you know, technology, the thing that I've understood and I'm very pro technology.  The thing that I'm reminded of constantly is like technology itself isn't good or evil, right?  Like it just is. And it's what you do with it.  And like there's, you know, there's a lot of nuance around that.  And of course, I like that Google aspires to don't be evil.  But I think it really comes down to just folks feeling, you know, there's there's this weird like there's this weird fear of the powerful nerd thing, you know, that I read your email T-shirt.  And I think I think society, a culture is going to outgrow that to some degree, especially when these legacy institutions sort of die off and, you know, we move forward.  But I think some of the distrust is just kind of like, you know, there's there's a lot of opportunities here for one company to change to change the world.  And let's hope it's in, you know, in the best ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also from this Financial Times article, Page relates a frequent debate he said he had with Steve Jobs, who died three years ago.  Page said he would always tell me you're doing too much stuff to Google.  And Page would say, I'd be like, you're not doing enough stuff.  The argument he made to Jobs, it's unsatisfying to have all these people and we have all these billions we should be investing to make people's lives better.  If we just do the same things we did before and don't do something new, it seems like a crime to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's important. There's another model here, Leo, which is Bell Labs.  Bell Labs did fund a good deal of pure research that led to some, you know, astronomy had nothing to do with Bell Labs, but they but they had astronomers there.  They had amazing scientists there. Google has phenomenal scientists and engineers there.  And to unleash their problem solving power on the problems they find and to support them while doing that, some of those problems will solve the problems that Google has like cheaper power.  Cheaper power is good for everybody. It's darn good for Google.  The transistor was good for everybody and it was good for AT&T.  The network was good for everybody and AT&T didn't realize how good it would have been for them.  But we don't have a Bell Labs now.  And another way to look at it is what if Google started beyond Project X, a pure research arm the size of Bell Labs? That'd be something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Still a lot of trust. Larry Page is not an elected official. Not necessarily that makes it more trustworthy.  Well, if Matt Kotz doesn't go back to Google, all bets are off.  I sense a distrust of the pace of politics and the pace of government in all of Silicon Valley.  Hey, no, why are you taking so long? We're just going to go and launch it and do it.  Elon Musk, same thing.  Are they wrong?  Yes. There's a reason. I believe there's a reason why government moves so slowly and deliberately.  As slow as ours right now?  Yeah, I think that it's better to move slowly than it is to move too quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In theory, yes, but now we're at complete competition.  Well, I think it's also better to reach consensus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think the problem you have when you have these very powerful plutocrats is they don't need to reach consensus.  This is not an indictment of Google or Larry Page. It's just a general fear that you've got a lot of power.  And just saying don't be evil, it's a good start.  But it really has to be in your DNA. And what is evil and what isn't evil?  And ultimately, as a publicly held company, your fiduciary responsibility is to your stakeholders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm missing right now there's the Foursquare conference going on in New York, which is not Foursquare, what we know, but Foursquare from Lazard.  And I'm missing right now Rupert Murdoch talking there.  And I think there's another example of using his money.  Too much power.  What he thinks is right, but I think is often important.  And yeah, it can go both ways.  Or Bloomberg used his money to become an incredible technocrat in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did he win his proposition to tax SOTA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it got overturned by a court, didn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but now there was an initiative.  He said, well, I don't care. I'm going to do it an initiative.  That's a good example of a guy who for some reason has really decided that SOTA pop is the enemy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's some health data that says that.  There's something to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is. There's good supporting data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems like the saving grace for me for Google is just that for the most part, if you don't like it, no one forces you to come to your house and use Google.  We have to compete on the merits and people would use other options on Gmail and Google Docs and all this stuff.  You have to compete well.  Whereas if you're stuck with network effects, suppose you wanted to leave Facebook or Twitter, it doesn't matter how nice Facebook or Twitter is.  If all the people are there, it's a little harder to leave on that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bloomberg's one cent tax on SOTA in Berkeley was passed.  Measure D. It was in Berkeley, by the way, not New York.  But he put the money into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're better to pick the past.  Start with Berkeley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The American Beverage Association says.  Why do we pass sprouts?  It's interesting that Bloomberg put the money into that Measure D because I guess he figured, well, we'll get it passed here and then slowly stretch it across the country.  Yeah, I don't want to put you in an awkward position.  This is a great article with Larry Page.  And I think you're absolutely right, Matt, that it's nice to see into what he's thinking.  And I hope that he remains this public, engages the public in the conversation.  And because I think this is something that no one person should have too much power in.  I mean, of course, he's got the company.  He says he wants to build a bigger company than has ever been built before, in a sense.  And there are limits on how big companies can get.  The biggest companies, quote, are all within an order of magnitude of the same size, certainly in market cap.  So he says these are the limits against which his company is pushing.  You say we're going to take over all these important things.  There's no example of a company doing that.  But I feel like he wants to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if you want to have impact, then you would be the next problem to solve.  And it feels like there's another interesting way to look at it.  I'll stop soon.  But there's forward-looking and backward-looking.  Like forward-looking would be, I'm going to scan all the books and hope that people see the value to society by the time the case is done, which they did.  And then there's backwards-looking, which is, hey, let's fix money in politics or campaign finance reform.  And to me, that's a helpful lens to look at, whether it's Elon Musk or Peter Diamandis or Larry or Bill Gates or whoever is forward-looking versus trying to fix the things that are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Larry Lessig has spent a lot of energy trying to fix the campaign finance system.  And I think that's a worthy effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't know.  It just makes me nervous when somebody has too much power.  That's why. I mean, that's why our government is designed the way it is. It's designed to be hobbled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's also innovation is power, right? Intelligence is power. Science is power.  I just finished listening to Walter Isaacson's book, which is good.  But for you, Leo, it'll be a my weekly reader version of what you live through.  And I had another reaction to it. I'll talk about it in a second.  But what strikes you is the serendipity of really smart people solving problems and creating amazing things out of that.  That's where the essence of the power is far more than the capital.  If somebody has a killer idea, there's plenty of capital. They'll go find capital.  Capital is not the limiter. It's innovation and problem solving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess I'm apostate because I have for the last 30 years said technology is great.  It's the way to go. It's going to change everything. It's going to fix everything.  I do like Larry have said, it's inevitable. So we've got to figure out what we do, not say stop it because you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So anyway, Matt, it's a devil's advocate with you.  No, I appreciate it. I think I think monoculture is bad.  Competition is good. Like we've got Microsoft. If you have subscribed to Office 365, we'll give you unlimited storage.  Amazon just announced unlimited photo storage. Like that's competition in the cloud space. That's great.  I love seeing that. Yes. Yeah. And as a search guy, like I wish there were more search engines.  You know, Yahoo bought up a whole bunch and then Microsoft partnered with Yahoo.  And so we had like seven or ten search engines in the early days and we don't have the competition.  There's plenty of vibrant competition, but I would love to see more.  You know, so I can absolutely channel where you're coming from on that. I would. I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think that's important as well. You're not going to see competition in search, though.  That's the irony of this. I think you have now you're there's no way anybody could compete at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see things that are coming from a different angle, like Siri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that's what's that's what's going to happen is that the kind of search and the kind of search at Google does are.  And I think this is what Larry really sees as the cycle is ending.  And and now we have to think of what's next. And here is serious an example of social search, whatever, whatever it's going to be.  It's changing. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yes, but we have to be mindful.  I think everybody at Google should be mindful of the impact of their actions.  And, you know, you know, I think about Webmasters and, you know, if Google changes an algorithm that can absolutely have a large impact on, you know, a site publisher.  And we try to think about that when we evaluate our algorithms.  Yeah, good. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a hard thing to do. And as you get more power, even as even the slight as you know, the slightest turn of the knob can make a huge impact.  You've got the butterfly effect.  Well, we it's so nice to have you on here, Matt.  We know we have to let you go back.  And I didn't mean to get you into this discussion here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, you know, I love talking about Google and search and all this stuff.  And I think it's really cool because while I was on official three month leave, you know, Jason Chad, nobody reached out.  But I'm like, oh, I enjoy being on Twig. So thanks for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll have you back more anytime you want. You could this could be your new job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we wanted to give you some space for sure.  And I shouldn't have brought I shouldn't have brought this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought, you know, a because everybody loves and trusts Matt cuts.  So and I know you are not a spokesman for Google, but I feel like having you there reassures me.  And so I wanted to hear from you reassurance that that, you know, the process is there.  The collegiality, the consideration, the don't be evil.  All of that stuff is still there and still in effect.  And that's what that's why we love talking to Matt. Yeah, because we trust you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So much. Sorry, I have to step off. No, come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I promise. I promise not to bring up Google next time you're here.  Cats, cats, cats, cats, cats and Halloween costumes.  Sounds good. Thanks. Take care. Take care.  That's the great. So actually, we didn't put him on the spot as to when he'd be going back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  2015 is all we've heard. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's when the Apple Watch will come out as well.  Coincidence? I think not. I think not.  No, Matt, that's one of the things that's great about Matt.  Unlike I think almost anybody, everybody at Google is great.  Everybody ever talked to and you talk to more people than I have.  Jeff and Gina, but everybody you talk to you even, you know, like Sundar Pichai,  the conversation we had and I'll never forget it about Chromebooks was so thoughtful,  not defensive, well put. I just everybody I've met there is very impressive, very smart.  And and I do trust them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's another question, Leo. I really love to hear you answer this question, Gina.  Let's say that you were an employee at Google.  Well, first question is, would you be an employee at Google?  I would just all say that we would work at Google.  What would Google do that would make you quit?  I'll give you one example.  I think that if we found out that Google had been willingly spying on citizens,  Yes.  voluntarily for the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the example. Or not even for the government, for their own benefit.  If you open a door to a conference room and there on the screen are personal Skype conversations  or hangouts conversations that went over the Google network and were extensively private  and I'm seeing them that I would leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like the Geeks and the Good Wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Or maybe you wouldn't leave. Maybe you'd say maybe you'd be a whistleblower.  But that's it.  Right. I like to think that I'd pull this note in in that situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As a technologist, Gina, what's there's got to be some description, I think,  of companies you would work for and companies you wouldn't work for and why?  I certainly have that in journalism.  Can you express that in your world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, for me, I'm just I'm a bad employee.  I mean, this is just something I've learned about myself.  I don't want to do my own thing.  I'm just a bad employee.  So even a company like Google, where I feel like I would have, you know, I'd be able to do so much  just dealing with like the politics and the meetings and the layers of managers.  I mean, this would happen in any sort of big organization.  Like just thinking about it makes me kind of tired.  And I just I work well on my own and on small teams.  I prefer small teams.  So that's just me personally.  But yeah, I mean, look, for me to, you know, to choose a company to work for or work with,  you know, it's a matter of like alignment with my values.  Right. Like, you know, is this company doing something or not?  You know, something I get behind, something that's making the world better,  was it put my talents to best use or the right people there?  I mean, it's you know, it's a whole the whole list of things.  And Google certainly falls under those those, you know, umbrellas.  But again, I like just my style.  I like to do something kind of small and Indian on my own, which arguably means I don't have as big an impact,  which is something I definitely struggle with, you know, but I'm sure there's tons of projects at Google  that never see the light of day either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But see, that is kind of I have that.  And that's the same thing that is driving me to distrust large companies in general.  I have a more kind of tribal communal notion of how things should happen.  And admittedly, you're never going to have a Google at that scale.  Right. But I don't trust I don't trust big companies.  And the bigger company gets, I think the less trustworthy it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, that's where I. I don't think it's an impossibility to have a big company you can trust.  There haven't been many examples.  There haven't. No, there is. It's hard, but it's not impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always thought I was an optimist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff, you don't like when people automatically assume a company is evil based solely on its bottom line or size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Right. Give me the evidence.  I mean, I don't assume somebody is evil and awful just because they're in government.  And I often criticize government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there are far more examples of people who act altruistically in government  than there are people who act altruistically in business. Far more.  Yeah. Most people. Most people.  I admit government corrupts and so forth.  But and but most and there are lots of examples, counter examples.  But most people get into public service, get into public service because they want to serve the public.  And go south from there. And from there, it's all downhill.  Our show today. I'm not a cynic.  Is that weird? Maybe I should be living in Europe because I believe in government, but not in corporations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that your business is extremely European.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Our show today brought to you by a very nice company.  Citrix GoToMeeting. Everybody I know has used GoToMeeting.  I hope you've used GoToMeeting for a meeting. It's all we ever do.  We love GoToMeeting.  The people we work with, whether it's clients or vendors or coworkers, are almost always out of Petaluma.  So we have to be able to meet with them without, you know, having them in our studio.  And for us to travel to them is expensive and time consuming.  Sometimes we do phone conference calls. I don't like them.  I like GoToMeeting. Millions of professionals back me on this in business, large and small.  GoToMeeting is the best way to meet from the convenience of your computer, of your smartphone, of your tablet.  It's so great. You pay once a month, hold as many meetings as you need with anyone,  anywhere in one virtual space. You will share screens. That's great.  But you also could turn on the webcam so you see each other with high definition video conferencing.  It allows you to engage and connect just like you're in the same room.  I want you to try it. It's free right now. If you visit GoToMeeting, click the Try It Free button.  Your next month of calls, of video conferences are absolutely free.  Try it and try it on your next meeting and let me know.  I think you will see that GoToMeeting is a remarkable way to get work done.  GoToMeeting.com, click the Try It Free button for your 30 day trial.  And we thank GoToMeeting for their support of this week in Google.  This was a call Devorak always made. Microsoft's gotten too big.  It needs to be split into three different companies.  But that was more because it was unmanageable at its size. Not that it was dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, some of the Europeans thought it was evil and taking over the world.  And it got too big for its own good.  The real question for Google is, can it find the next...  I mean, so far it's found the next thing. It's in the phone business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But none of them are businesses yet, right?  I mean, they're in these businesses and clearly planning for the future.  But really, how do they make their money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the big question. Is advertising forever?  Because Google is an advertising company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not that kind of advertising, not display ads.  No.  Or I don't know, but I think Larry is smart.  Larry Page is smart not to assume that this business is going to continue this way forever.  And that's why they have so many projects.  From a purely business point of view.  But Google could fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, cover all your bases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See what works.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think Matt will go back? He was cagey.  You let him off the hook.  I let him off the hook. See, I didn't want to be mean.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think he's made a... I generally don't think he's made a decision yet.  But I do think it's a very good possibility that he won't go back.  And I think that's okay.  If I were Google, I would say to Matt...  I would love to see what Matt would do outside of Google.  Wouldn't that be interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is he a startup kind of guy?  I mean, Matt, he's been there 15 years. That's difficult.  Here we are speculating about Matt without him being here.  I know, poor Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's because I didn't want to have this conversation in front of him.  I don't want to put him on the spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The question for me is if you're Google and you have a talent like Matt,  and Matt is talented in so many ways, not just technologically,  but also in... trust is a talent of Matt's.  Oh, huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even if he's just their spokesman.  Whatever.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right? Or an advisor.  So, you know, what I would hope for Google is I would hope that some top manager would go to Matt,  take him out to lunch and say,  challenge yourself. What do you want to do?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then how would Matt take a go to that?  I guarantee you they're going to do that.  And Google has a well-known history of writing very large checks,  saying, look, don't leave. Here's $15 million.  $1 million for every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, man. I hope that happens for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Gina, you who are unemployable,  is there a number that somebody could write you a check and you would say,  all right, I don't want to work for you, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I mean, look, you know, I would love to see you say that no one could afford me.  But the truth is everyone has a price.  Right.  I mean, you know, right? Like I'm not a wealthy person. I'm a working person.  Would I love to have, you know, a few kind of money? Of course. Like who wouldn't, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, keep your purity. It's a bad idea. You want to be poor.  You want to have to work hard. Trust me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll let you know when I have this option.  It is not just a thought exercise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did they put that thing on Ozzie's head or did you?  Come here. Bring Ozzie here. Ozzie's come back from his groomers.  Did the groomer do that?  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're a masculator, Ozzie. Poor Ozzie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there. That's better. That's adorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's better. Ozzie turned into a babushka.  So I was sitting this morning.  Google has now said if you go to drive.google.com, I'm sorry, play.google.com Google Store and you click on devices, they say come back every Wednesday because we'll have five more.  I don't know what we'll have more Nexus sixes for sale and nothing.  Well, no. Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to get mad. I was mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I sat there. I had read this.  It says we're getting more Nexus six devices in stock as soon as possible to make things simpler for you.  We will work to make more devices available each Wednesday and encourage you to visit the site.  What day is today? Wednesday.  So this morning I got up at eight and did this.  You know this, Jason. The dance.  The dance. Refresh.  Refresh.  Refresh.  And it said we're out of inventory.  We're out of inventory.  And then I don't know why, but all of a sudden on a black 32 gigabyte, it said ships in one to two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What cracks me up about this is not only is it difficult to get any, but once you get through on one configuration, it might not be the one you intended.  Doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did. I don't want a 32 gig black. I wanted a 64 gig white.  Exactly.  But I ordered it and guess what? Delivery November 21st.  So the day first. Same as yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Looking like that's just the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So just a tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice.  All right. So they didn't really get any more in stock.  I don't know what.  Jason ordered a week ago and you have the exact same delivery date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Scam.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  They were looking in the cracks of the couch and they...  What do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I found a couple of Nexus 6's down here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's there?  I don't trust Google anymore. Can't buy their phone. I don't trust them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It did make me mad.  So instead of...  Because I thought, oh, I'm not going to get a Nexus 6.  I do not want to add up how much I've spent on phones in the last two months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, man, Leo, your phone budget must be. And the plans.  Oh. Oh. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I feel like I kind of have to.  And you can get these devices sometimes from the carrier.  So they're always carrier devices.  And for a week or two. And you have to send it back.  So you really don't commit to it.  I don't feel like it's a good way to review it.  And yet, I now have, like, you should see my desk.  It's littered.  iPhone 6, 6 Plus, Moto X 2014.  You call the phone company every time to change the IMEI?  OnePlus One. Well, I do a lot of, when I can, SIM card swapping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I know that. But when you change the SIM card in a new phone, it has a new IMEI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you don't have to do that most of the time.  So I got this as the Droid Turbo, which is a Moto X on steroids.  It actually looks a little swollen because they put a much bigger battery in here.  And my complaint on the 2014 Moto X was that it didn't get through the day.  It got about 12 hours battery life. So I'm hoping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it only a Verizon phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, which is a bummer because it's a Droid.  Although the rumor is they'll be selling it as the Droid Max internationally.  It is identical to a Moto X. Here's the good news.  In terms of software, almost all the Moto X features made it over to the Droid Turbo, except for,  and I don't know how important this is, Miriam Jouar was talking about this yesterday,  it doesn't have the aluminum band with the carefully tuned antenna thing.  The two antenna, and it only has one antenna, so you can't talk and data at the same time.  That's also a disadvantage.  I don't care about that.  I mean, it's a bummer to some.  But it has a 21 megapixel camera, which doesn't look any better.  I haven't really done a full testing, but it's like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The megapixels don't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they matter. It's the same camera, same Moto X camera thing.  I have some pictures. I'll show you the...  Some I don't know. You know, in good light, if you hold it really carefully steady, it looks pretty good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The pictures I took of you guys didn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we don't...  Well, we did selfies.  We don't take very good pictures, just to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it was a front-facing selfie, right?  Yeah.  This is a good example in daylight.  It is obviously high-res, 6.2 megabytes as a JPEG, 5248 by 2952.  The detail on the Christmas is quite good.  And of course, Google enhanced it, quote.  This is low light, and...  A little fuzzy there.  It's a little grainy. You can see that grain, can't you?  Yeah.  This is F2 ISO 1600, 1.15 of a second exposure.  So it did the best it could. This was at night.  That's not a great picture.  Yeah, a little fuzzy.  But that's a selfie, remember? So that's the front-facing camera.  So it's not quite as good. In fact, that's only a megabyte in size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you can blame us a little bit for breaking the sensor in the camera.  1920 by 1080. That's just bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go. This is from the front. That looks pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a pretty good picture, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, color's excellent. There you are, Gina.  This is all about Android last night.  I think it's a good camera.  I still think the Note 4 is a better camera.  Unfortunately, you have to use the Samsung stuff, which is not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been looking at the Galaxy 2 camera, or Galaxy Camera 2.  It's the Android camera.  Oh, right.  And I'm actually a little bit tempted by it.  The software on it for changing settings and aperture and all that is actually kind of neat.  I'm surprised Samsung hasn't brought it into more of what they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's like jelly bean or something, isn't it? It's pretty old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it is. It's jelly bean. But you're not using it as anything other than camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and the main reason I wanted to get this Nexus 6...  Isn't that silly? It's a camera with an Android phone on it in the back.  Yeah.  Built into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It beats that Sony thing that I thought was going to be so cool. It was so awesome.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's so weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it'd be a good camera, I guess.  You know, if you really want a camera, get a camera. Don't worry about the Android.  Just get a good camera. There are good cameras out there.  The reason I wanted the Nexus 6 is I wanted Lollipop.  Now, I have a Nexus 7. I suppose some people buy a Nexus 9, the new tablet to get Lollipop.  Are the Nexus 9s arriving? They are.  They are.  So some people... Lollipop is out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mine was supposed to get here yesterday.  It did not arrive.  Waiting for it to arrive today. You know, hard knock life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a hard knock life.  Yeah, we're complaining about having too many things.  I know. And getting them a day late.  Oh, shucks.  First world problem.  You're going to have to wait until tomorrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a hard knock life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Miriam had one, but it was a review unit, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think review units have gone out of both the Nexus 6 and 9.  And the player.  But the rumor is, and I don't think Google has said,  we were hoping to get updates on the Nexus devices like the 5 and the 7 and the 10 to Lollipop like yesterday.  And the rumor is it will be now a week from today, November 12th, due to bugginess in Lollipop.  Oh.  Maybe.  Oh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Don't know.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to have to wait.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I want to see Lollipop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't want to wait. We're important people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And one argument for a Motorola phone, even though now this has been, it's now Lenovo,  but is that Motorola has promised that the Xs and the Turbo and all of this will be updated to Lollipop as soon as they can.  Now, did not, Gina, did they not release the source code of the AOSP on Monday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They did. They did.  It's out to AOSP, which is great news for everybody.  What does that mean? Tell us why that's great news.  It means that anyone who does any sort of mods can get, can start rebasing their work on top of AOSP.  So like Cyanogen mod or, you know, all the big manufacturers can start porting their skins and doodads and apps over to Lollipop,  making sure that it works, you know, custom ROMs, all that stuff.  Developers can hop on, get that code and start working on it.  Good.  So it just means that we're going to, and it means that, you know, on the OnePlus One, we're going to get Lollipop, I think they said 90 days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, gee. Whoa, that takes a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  90 days from the latest from the AOSP drop. So 90 days from Monday. Not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's because it's a Cyanogen mod, a CM11. And so Cyanogen gets the source code like they're working on it right now.  Right. Exactly.  But they have to modify it. And it's a pretty heavily modified, isn't it?  Yeah. Big difference.  I still like the OnePlus. I think the OnePlus in many respects is the phone to get, especially for the price is the phone to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I love it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some interesting similarities right now between the OnePlus approach to selling their device and the same type of scarcity slash contest for the Nexus 6 right now.  It's almost like they're playing from the same playbook.  I don't know if that's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you, Jeff, you did you went to the site and you were refreshing it. You did that, didn't you?  Well, I was all morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just feel like I should put ads on there just just to make more revenue on people refreshing the darn page.  I feel like I won the lottery.  Yeah. Let me ask you this. The Apple stores I walked by was at the Cube on Fifth Avenue today and my mall.  There's lines out of the mall. Is this ongoing demand for the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, we were talking about this on Sunday that there are still lines at Apple stores to get the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that because it's slow to do the process? Is that because they didn't have the phones? What's causing that kind of scarcity behavior?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know in this case, but generally it's because each store gets us gets us shipment of 100 in the morning.  So people line up so they can get those get those phones.  One plus says, according to our chat room, run with scissors says one plus says they've sold half a million units.  I haven't read that. That's pretty good. Yeah.  Given the scarcity and how hard it is to get one.  Half a million phones sold to date, according to Lily Putin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I thought my OnePlus was busted last night.  This was typical Jeff story. So the night before last I'm driving home and every time I'm trying to call the Italian restaurant to order some chicken parm on the way home.  It's my sad life. And one ring terminates. Two rings terminates. One ring terminates.  The guy would come on and start to say hello and I say, ah, terminate.  So I thought it was his phone. Right. So it was a poor guy. I'm calling like 25 times.  He's sitting there saying, who's this schmuck calling me every 30 seconds?  And so that's a lot. Try another number. Same thing.  Oh, so I get home and I pull up the Nexus five and I put the SIM in there and I say, okay, I'm sick with the Nexus five works like twice.  And then same thing. Oh, terminate. So it's your carrier.  It's the carriers. AT&T does a very nice woman behind AT&T cares named Jory.  He was trying to help me. I still don't have help.  Somebody else, another AT&T executive was nice enough to put it in escalation.  Is it always the same locale? It's across 40 miles of New Jersey as well as Manhattan.  Must be something that they thought they were doing an upgrade to something.  And they don't worry about that. So we haven't figured it out yet.  The point is, but I was ready to throw the one plus one out the window and pull a Jeff rant.  And thank goodness I didn't because it was not the one plus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this comes from Ewan Spence in Forbes.  He was at the Dublin Web Summit talked to one plus founder and director Carl Pay.  And Carl said that they have passed half a million handsets.  There's a push to reach a stretch goal of one million before the end of the year.  It's going to be hard said pay, but I think it's possible.  The advertising budget, three hundred dollars.  Wow. Well, that's what's not million, not billion hundred.  All of that money was spent experimenting on different types of Facebook ads. Social media.  Oh, interesting. We found that we've now reached a critical mass of users.  We don't have to buy any more ads. Is that a typo? Three hundred dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. So the price was the marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah. And you know what? It worked.  And I think everybody who has the phone, which includes you and Gina and Father Robert, has my one plus and Jason has a one plus.  We all agree it's really for the three hundred fifty dollars.  That is a heck of a great phone. It really is. Good camera shoots camera raw.  Cyanogen Mod is really a nice version of Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, a three hundred dollar marketing budget would account for the stupid contest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. How many times in all about Android have we discussed about how the marketing team was practically asleep when they're planning these things?  Apparently it's because the marketing team doesn't actually exist.  They were clearly high school student interns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. That's fine, though. It worked. And I think this is nice. It shows that you could do something.  There's a lot of companies be very happy with sales of a half a million three hundred dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially for a start, an upstart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, right. Reportedly, right.  Yeah, right. Right. Right.  I had a Jarvisian moments.  A friend of mine called me and said that someone else picked up and that like and that and that, you know, she asked like, who is this?  Did you just get your number? And this person said, yeah, I just got this number.  And and so my friends said, you know, did you did your number change?  And I said, no, that's a little weird. Hmm.  And then I realized I went to my Google voice settings with my Google voice number and realized they were like there are two phones that I no longer have, which I had forgotten to turn it off.  To stop ringing. So I've been ringing two strangers phones, all my calls for a while.  So I wonder, Leo, you you swim, you sim swap.  How do you keep track of all the phones? Because you use these voice still use Google Voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So you can only have five phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know you are like you are edge case. You are pushing the limits of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have at all times five phones on my Google voice number.  But I I spend probably I go in there at least several times a week to update to like deactivate one and turn on another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But even you know, it's great is even Verizon.  Now you can put the SIM card on this one is so weird.  You actually have to pull out the volume rocker.  You can use a little drawer underneath the volume rocker and you just pull it out and I and you just swap the SIM card even with Verizon.  Now I don't I don't do sprint for that reason because CDMA you have to call and all that stuff.  But with AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, it's just it's a musical SIM cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's not carrier locked. You don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just Verizon. I haven't yet tried that with this phone, but I was able to put a T-Mobile and AT&T SIM into my Verizon iPhone.  And I think somebody told me people have told me in Twitter and so forth that that's because they have a consent degree with FCC that says this goes back to the Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't get me started. This is all back to the Nexus seven.  If you use the using the LTE spectrum, they bought the condition that spectrum as required by Google when it was in that auction is open is openness to devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep. So Verizon is actually against their will.  A really good choice.  So you could now I don't don't quote me yet.  I will go home and put a T-Mobile SIM in this and an AT&T and SIM in this.  I'm going to it's a nano SIM.  You don't think it'll work.  I already swapped SIMs with another with the iPhone and change the phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I thought it was through that whole new SIM thing and all that stuff. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But not on the iPhone, just on the iPad.  So this is a CDMA phone. But because everything's LTE now, they use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. It failed. It fails down to a CDMA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what it fails down to.  I don't know. It fails down. Yeah, I guess at some point it would go to what is it?  One RTT. I think that's a CDMA technology.  You'd have to feel down pretty good, though.  Anyway, that's phone talk.  We really should reserve that for all about Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody yelled at us on Twitter last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's supposed to be about Google, not about phones.  Well, Android is Google. Gosh, did you get it? Darn it.  I'm sorry. I'm going to yell.  Google has leased a New York cookie factory.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  In Chelsea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More space for this company that's growing too big.  They need more space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? You have no fears of Google becoming kind of the Borg?  The Borg?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.  I'm about to sound like one. I think the market will take care of them if they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was kind of what Matt was saying was as long as there's competition, you don't have to worry.  But there isn't Google is not. Google's a monopoly. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right? Not in search. Not only is it is in advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's where all the money comes from. Yeah.  They signed a lease for one hundred eighty thousand square foot Nabisco cookie factory right next to the high line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you'll be able to think of a cookie joke and I couldn't come up with one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Nabisco.  Nabisco had to move to New Jersey. So Google's moving in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the economy right there in a nutshell.  Move over Nabisco. Move over. Here comes Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I visited the New York office once and they're definitely busted out of this.  You know, it's busted at the seams. They've been looking for space in New York, I think, for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is nearby. So they have the Chelsea. They have the big old port.  If you haven't been to New York and seen this, the Port Authority building is a complete city block and you just don't see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just gigantic. That's where they put all the bums, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's where Google is. Plus a couple of other companies. No, no, no, not that. Not the bus thing.  Not the Port Authority bus terminal. Oh, OK.  The old Port Authority like office thing. And across from that is the Chelsea Market, which they also took over much of that.  And tomorrow night I'm going to the opening of the YouTube New York studio there.  And then nearby is the cookie factory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this a new studio? By the way, it smells really good in the Google offices.  Smells like Nilla vanilla wafers. Too late for gingerbread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There we are. There's our cookie joke. There's the cookie joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is the YouTube facility in New York new?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, new. They have one of the studio was L.A. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they're opening one in New York. I'm surprised. I thought that was a to me in my mind that was a failed initiative.  A lot of money. It's the same thing when Google spent 100 million dollars to get big brand names to make YouTube videos for nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Susan Jusky stole. She's a new sheriff in town trying to figure out a new way. So I presume she approved this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, what what benefit has accrued to Google from the L.A. studio besides goodwill with which is probably a real benefit, but goodwill with the YouTube video folks?  I mean, I don't see suddenly, you know, the hot videos on YouTube aren't suddenly great production value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, and in a way, I don't want YouTube videos to come. No, much value. I want them to be fresh and weird and different.  Yeah, it's a video of the people. Yeah.  But they'll have swag. So I'll go. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now she's apparently considering Susan Jusky considering some sort of subscription model, but they already have a subscription model.  This is something she's talking about. Recode mobile. What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We couldn't get rid of the ads. Oh, an ad free YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She made some reference in there to me. What if you don't want the ads? I don't want the ads. I'll pay for an ad for YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I would too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because because we had a story, I think last week that the amount of money that YouTube has, I forget, you know, a billion dollars, whatever, some ridiculously high amount of money that they have now sent to copyright holders.  Right. Who rather than demanding to take their stuff down and said, OK, leave it up and just share the ad revenue with us. They distributed a lot of money.  Right. Is there is there a music streaming ad free music streaming model for video now where they can just split the revenue with copyright holders?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much would it have to cost, though? I can't imagine that YouTube makes more than five bucks, ten bucks a month on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, I was I was just at this conference where it's all off the records. I don't really talk about it.  But but but the heads of the guy who's responsible for breaking bad and all the shows we like from from AMC and Peter Churn and and and executive from AMC.  We're all up there and I won't quote them by name, but the discussion was.  What is they call it? L. L. V.O.D. I think it's called or S.V.O.D. S.V.O.D.  All these services, are there more Netflix to come?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what's obvious is V.O.D. is subscription video on demand. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's either huge things like Netflix or Amazon, or there's tiny things like it was a crunch roll anime.  And it both can succeed.  And so I think there will be a lot of opportunities for the top.  And of course, the end of what the industry is buzzing about is what HBO and CBS said they were going to leave.  Right. You know, they were going to offer over the top subscriptions to their content.  You didn't have to have a cable search. And we'll see how that works.  And we'll see if that works and how many subscriptions people are willing to do.  And can you succeed without having an operation?  But if Fred Wilson wrote a piece about podcasts this last week inspired by New York magazine cover on it,  and he put the last paragraph he put in there, the thing that I've been arguing for years that Howard Stern should go to the Internet and go to YouTube,  which is where I introduced them to Google five years ago.  And I would pay every month for that.  I would pay every month for the CBS thing because I think if I could conveniently get Good Wife, which I'm now addicted to a little higher scale than your Kardashian addiction, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, Good Wife is awesome. I love the Good Wife.  Isn't it great? One of my favorite shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I've been bidding. I would pay for HBO on my own.  So I think there could be things that you would pay for.  The question is, is it an omnibus YouTube subscription like Prime or is it sets of subscriptions?  I have no idea what they plan. But I think there's something interesting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It cracks me up that mainstream media has discovered podcasts and says we're in a renaissance.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, what?  Wait, what?  I think it was the Washington Post wrote that article like three weeks ago and that New York magazine.  New York magazine just did it.  Kevin Ruiz just wrote the same article.  Have you listened to Alex Bloomberg's show?  By the way, that's why this happened because Alex Bloomberg, who was a producer at This American Life, which all of the media elite listened to.  Exactly.  Did a podcast about starting a podcast, which is the kind of thing that happened when podcasting started.  We were all talking about podcasting all the time.  Welcome to the 21st century, Alex.  But apparently because everybody listens to that, they suddenly said, oh, podcasts are back making money.  By the way, Alex only makes money because he had a Kickstarter.  I mean, he's not making any money on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he has ads on it. He has a MailChimp on it.  We have MailChimp.  The reason I really like the podcast is because it's exactly what all my students go through starting a company.  They think this, they learn that. They think this, they learn that.  And it's what Alex is going through very transparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm so glad to hear there's a renaissance and that finally we can make some money.  Oh, bitter.  Well, here's the good news.  I've read all my life, people.  There have been all these articles and nobody ever asked me because what I tell them, what are you talking about renaissance?  We've been growing at a steady clip since 2005.  What are you talking about?  I don't think people think you're a podcast company, Leo.  Yeah, well, they're wrong.  I mean, I'm not. I don't use the word podcast.  But what are they talking about if they're not talking about what I do?  There will be a piece on us on Marketplace tomorrow, I'm told.  Oh, that's awesome.  NPR is doing a piece on the podcast renaissance and I think they're going to quote me because the reporter John Kalish interviewed me.  So I hope they have a piece of me saying, what are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have a little bit of experience here.  I think maybe you are a good person to talk to, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A little bit about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know a little bit about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, this has always been the problem kind of with what we do.  And here we're going to get self-referential, so I won't do it for too long, but just for a second.  But what is this that we do?  What is this that we do?  I don't know. It's just I don't know.  It's shows, it's discussions.  It's internet shows, which is what I've always said.  I said, don't call it podcast because that implies it's on a iPod.  It's a dumb name and that's not what we do.  I mean, where some of us, some people are watching live.  That's like TV.  Some people listen in their car.  That's like a podcast, but it's not the only thing we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're talking right now to us and that's like nothing we've seen before.  Yeah, it's true.  I mean, I'm explaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I say like I do a show and people say you do a show.  And it's like, yeah, it's a show.  I mean, it's on the web.  It's video.  It's live, but also recorded.  I mean, it's hard to explain.  Right. People get the idea of a podcast where it's like, you know, a few friends are hanging out or Skyping and record it.  Right. And then put it.  But this is more than much more than that.  But it has that component.  And you never use the word podcast, which I think maybe makes you makes you sort of defy categorization, Leo,  which is maybe why you're not like the go to person for these conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I don't care if they quote me, but it's just it is ironic that they think that there's some sort of Renaissance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're reinventing TV.  Well, I don't know. I still say this is television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's more like TV than a podcast.  Whatever our show today brought to you by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't I mean, no, I like to take my ball and go home.  It just cracks me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like, what do you mean?  Renaissance there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, now, because somebody from the media establishment is doing a podcast, it must be a Renaissance.  That's what actually that's what bothers me is that whatever it is that we do has no credibility unless it comes from the media establishment.  And then, oh, now it's serious.  But go tell that to Mark Maron.  Go tell that to Adam Carolla.  Go tell that.  There's so many people have been doing this, whatever it's called, successfully for 10 years, Omar.  We're going to celebrate our 10th anniversary next year in April.  That's amazing.  But there's a Renaissance.  It's TV with buffering.  Thank you, Keith.  You still haven't answered the question.  Have you listened to Alex's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Podcasts drive you crazy.  Oh, no, I should listen to it, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't listen.  I think I did a good job.  I think you'll enjoy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't listen to a lot of podcasts because I like I have my audio books and but I listen to a few.  I listen to This American Life is a great is one of the great radio shows of all time.  It's not a podcast.  And it's just a radio show that they also offer online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  They distribute as such.  They distribute as a podcast.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, I don't know what it is.  Kevin Smith.  There's another one's been doing this for a long time.  Our show today brought to you by.  But this is what's exciting about the Internet.  They're reinventing kind of traditional businesses and Prosper is a good example.  They're reinventing the loan, the bank loan.  You don't have to go into a bank to get a loan from Prosper.  Prosper bring is a marketplace.  It brings together people who have money to lend with people who have want to borrow money.  And it's very successful.  They have now more than a billion dollars in loans funded.  Two million members, lenders and borrowers alike.  I mean, it's pretty amazing.  The other thing is it's friction free.  I mean, that's what's great about the Internet.  Imagine without ever walking into a bank, if you could have in the next three days 35 grand to cover your needs, what would you do?  Would you pay off high rate credit cards or maybe do a little home improvement, build a podcast network?  All you got to do is fill out an easy online application just like you see it on the screen.  If you're watching a video, this will not affect your credit score.  Very minimal amount of personal information and you will get your rate almost instantly online.  Prosper offers low fixed rates.  These are unsecured personal loans, so there's no collateral.  They do have multi-year terms.  It really is an awesome way to borrow money.  No outrageous fees, no rising interest rates and no bank.  Prosper.com slash twit.  That's what you need to know.  You don't even put on your pants.  Prosper is offering twit viewers for a limited time a $50 visa prepaid card.  When you get a loan, go to the website, Prosper.com slash twit.  Get that loan and the $50 visa prepaid card right now.  Internet does see that in some ways I feel guilty because we do look a little kind of like old media.  In fact, our model is very old media like.  So maybe maybe what twit does is not really significant.  It's just the only thing different is it's oh, no, no, no, no, it's very significant.  It's just oh, thank you.  I kind of was fishing for that one.  Wasn't I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We wouldn't be here.  It's significant in a couple of ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Internet distribution of television is what supposedly was going to happen 10 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's not just it's not that you've also reinvented as the forum and you've reinvented the relationship with the audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is kind of like the McLaughlin group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But McLaughlin wouldn't have tolerated a chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I would like to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You raging idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're wrong.  You're wrong.  All of you are wrong.  Let's do the Google changelog, shall we?  The Google changelog.  Gina Trapani has the latest from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the good news about lollipop drop in the soon is that we're seeing overhauls of all of Google's proprietary all their Google apps for Android.  We've got three of them today.  Maps, Gmail and Calendar.  I'll get in the material design lollipop love.  So Google Maps update is rolling out now.  New material design layouts focusing on bright colors and real world surfaces and shadows.  They added a couple of new features to dinner reservations from Open Table.  You can make right in Maps.  That's US only and better looking information cards with photos and reviews of popular attractions near your location.  And actually, sorry, this is set to roll out over the next the next few days.  Google Maps also support for Uber pickup times and fares only if you have the Uber app installed.  Gmail Gmail's material design upgrade is also is also rolling out.  I've been waiting. I haven't side loaded this yet.  You can sideload the APK.  The production signed Google version is out.  You can find that in Android police.  It should be going out over the air through the Play Store soon.  It's the material design makeover of Gmail with exchange and pop and I'm app support so you can get all your email in the native Gmail app.  And from what I hear, it's very, very similar to inbox.  Google Calendar is also getting the big material design overhaul with a few new features.  It's getting events from Gmail.  So now email you can turn emails into calendar events automatically.  So if you get an invitation to something that'll show up right on your calendar, something I think they're calling in Google Calendar assists.  These are suggestions that save you time.  So calendar can suggest titles, peoples and places as you type.  So if you if you often say go running with a friend, you know, friend named Jason and Central Park, calendar will suggest that entire event to you if you just type runs.  So it learns as you use it.  And then it's got this new schedule view that's very in line with the material design focus of big images.  It includes photos and maps of places you're going and cityscapes and illustrations of everyday events like coffee, yoga, that kind of thing.  The new calendar is available right now on all devices running lollipop.  And the update will that will you'll be able to download it.  Other other devices from Google Play in the coming weeks.  And this this update is actually also going to go out to iOS.  Nice. So those are those are the three big lollipop slash material design updates.  Couple other news things.  Google Drive now lets you open files in compatible Mac and PC apps with a new Chrome extension.  So this new Chrome extension is called Application Launcher for Drive.  You can search for that in the Chrome Web Store and it allows users to open files directly from its Google Drive service in compatible apps and a Mac PC.  So so basically this the extension adds an open with option that will let you launch a file so that you're looking at and drive in apps like OS 10's preview app or third party editing apps like Adobe or Microsoft.  So yeah, you can see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's the Jane stop this crazy thing?  So it's just met.  It's just met.  I wanted to round it around the cloud and the desktop.  Yeah, we had it.  We had a looping animated gift there.  Just playing how that works.  Let's see what else.  Oh, I haven't used a Roku in a while, but the Roku just got a new Google Play movies and TV.  Awesome.  Yeah, pretty, pretty cool.  I think this is the first time we're seeing Google Play movies and TV somewhere other than on Android.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah.  So it's making its debut in the Roku channel store.  Google Play movies and TV, of course, which is the app that lets you buy and rent videos.  Pretty standard, you know, video focused application.  One of the one feature that play TV and movies has, which is pretty cool, is that those info cards related to content that you're watching.  So if you press pause on an actor and a scene, you can see who it is and get get get information about that person.  So really, really neat, neat feature.  You'll get that in Roku as well.  Finally, Google has quietly launched the stars interface for Google Bookmarks.  So we've seen a couple of rumors about this, which I think we talked about a couple of times from screenshots leaked of this new bookmarking feature called stars.  Well, that's gone live.  Google didn't really make a big deal or announcement about it, but it's in the Chrome Web Store now.  It's called it's called the Chrome Bookmark manager.  And the next web reports that this new extension completely replaces Chrome's old bookmarks interface.  And the idea of stars is to make saving bookmarks really easy, organizing them very, very quickly and automatically.  If you know, it's smart, smart enough actually to go through all of your bookmarks and organize them into automatically generated categories based on what you've gotten there.  So if you one of those people who just collects bookmarks and I have been that person over the years, it sounds like this is worth worth taking a look at.  And that's the Chrome Bookmark manager in the Chrome Web Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Search for a confounded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I installed it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me see.  Let's see if the check crunch article has the direct link.  And let me make sure that it's just called Bookmark manager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And my thing.  Yeah.  Here it is.  It says Bookmark manager from Google.  It's a Google search tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Huh?  It's extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's an extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's in the Chrome Web Store.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I still don't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's it's it is so amazing when they they have a new Android app or a new extension and you search for it in the store and it doesn't come up.  It sometimes takes time for to show up in search results, which is so so ironic.  It's kind of Pinteresty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Pinterest is your bookmarks.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I haven't had a whole I haven't had a whole lot of time with it myself.  But yeah, you like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's now I haven't done it on this machine.  So you can see it's churning on my bookmarks.  It's going to make a organ.  It's going to reorganize them for me.  Churn churn churn churn churn.  There's nothing to see here.  Just a dot.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chat room solves my problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's gm l l l b g h n f k p f e l e m i h a j a k b a p o j o p f j i k.  That's that.  That's not that.  I think don't type that in kids because I think I got some of the letters wrong.  Yeah.  So that's all I got.  The change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that is the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do we think of lollipop?  I mean, there's material.  And so all of these new materialized apps and I realize inbox is a material app as well.  Yeah, I like the look, but that's just a new look.  Or is it or does it really change how you use stuff?  I think it's more the interactions.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So I haven't played with lollipop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't load into the early builds.  I want to just be totally surprised.  I didn't.  Yeah.  Yeah, I want to get the whole first impression.  But from what I've seen, it seems like it's even just more of a like interaction, like  smoother interactions, things slide and bounce and spring, you know, are spring loaded and  I'm very responsive.  And I think that there's that that is more than just, you know, a visual refresh.  I think it's just it's a feel thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I also think it's very interesting what calendars doing and I guess bookmarks too are  doing and of course inbox is doing this idea of it's too much trouble for you to organize  your stuff.  So we'll do it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  It feels like this like Google Now is kind of infiltrating, you know, like inbox has  these kind of Google Now smarts about, you know, remind me later and group these things  together.  And now we're seeing calendar adding things to your calendar from Gmail.  It's this it's this, you know, this integration of all these things and like, hey, we'll just  do it for you because we know best, which at first is which is going to freak some people  out at first.  But once you sort of surrender and let it happen, you see that it actually you know  what?  I don't want to waste my time transcribing an event from my Gmail to my calendar like  that.  It makes no sense.  Right.  So like the efficiencies we were talking about earlier.  So it's it's it's it's a really it's really neat to see all this land to see like the  now stuff with the where stuff with the material design stuff, lollipop stuff, all sort of  land at the same time.  This is a really neat, interesting time.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, I didn't correct something from last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Last week, I said that the new drive didn't have a store offline and I got corrected on  on Google Plus right away.  It's very something very helpful.  And in fact, it does it even better.  You don't have to remember to do it.  You just go into the preferences, say store offline.  You never have to do it before you get on the plane.  Nice.  We start offline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, good.  Great.  So it's a good opportunity for Chromebook users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but anyone with sense.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With sense.  So what you said in the cloud, like I do, any intelligent person doesn't have a person

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  who would trust you choose Leo and who believes in the future and technology and is OK with  a benevolent company that brings it to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  See, that's the thing.  I mean, there is going to be a point at which everybody's different.  Everybody's different.  Jeff will never feel like it's creepy.  But there is a point for everyone at which it goes, well, do I really want them to know  who I run with all the time?  Well, there's creepy.  There's creepy lines for everybody.  So, I mean, yes, it's nicely convenient that I could type run and it'll know that means  you're going to go out with Kevin four o'clock this afternoon to run Central Park.  I understand the value of that, but it's kind of don't you think that's a little creepy  that it would do that?  That knows that?  Let's keep track of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  You know exactly why.  The creepiness comes from not knowing why from the mystery of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Creepiness comes from also probably an anthropomorphization of it.  That it's a human doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Like if I left for work at eight thirty every morning and one morning my neighbor showed  up at my gate with a cup of coffee and handed it to me and said, you know, I noticed you  go to work at this exact time every day and that you stop for coffee.  But I thought, here, I just bring it to you.  I would be grateful and yet weirded out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, like, you know, if he looked at you like that.  I brought you some coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You want some coffee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I put too splendid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just like that.  Have a good day, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that wouldn't be good.  I'm a little too good at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, but then this past week it was like, hey, Google now let me know.  I have to change my clocks.  Now let me know where my local polling place was like, you know, I was like, OK, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just told me who got elected as my representative.  That's kind of cool.  It tells me what PG&E bill is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I've gotten that one, too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's good for me because I always forget to pay it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you're crazy.  You forget you used to forget to pay him.  So Google's helping you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, it'd be nice if Google would just pay it.  Google, could you?  It's only seven dollars.  Just pay it.  Just pay it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, just pay it.  It'll be like pay with wallets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll be like when you go to the toll booth and the toll guy says, hey, the guy ahead of you just paid.  Just every once in a while, Google, just pay a bill for me, would you?  Just once in a while.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  A little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be a great PR thing for them to do.  It'd be funny.  Hey, if you were...  We pay the bill for each of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you were a Canadian woman and you'd like more people to see your boobs, what...  Probably the best thing to do is to sue Google for showing your boobs in Street View.  Yeah.  I know.  Every story that's reported, it showed the photo.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  wasn't naked.  She just had a low cut thing on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to be in the street.  I'm going to be in the street.  I'm going to be in the street.  I'm going to be in the street.  I'm going to be in the street.  I'm going to be in the street.  It was a maybe an angle that she wouldn't have.  Yeah.  It's the angle of the dangle.  That's really the problem.  So two years...  Now they blurred her face because they always do, but they didn't blur her boobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not even her boobs.  Her cleavage.  Two years later, she sues Google to blur the rest of her boobs.  And then they have to show her on the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's like, oh, my God, I'm going to be in the street.  I'm going to be on the street.  I'm going to be on the street.  I'm going to be on the street.  I'm going to be on the street.  I'm going to be on the street.  They have to show her a picture of her face.  Not even her boobs.  Her cleavage.  Two years later, she sues Google to blur the rest of her, as well as her license plate  and address.  Now, I guess I kind of understand that if she's getting, hey, you want some coffee?  She demanded $50,000, $45,000 for emotional damage, including depression and mockery from  her coworkers at a quote, well-known bank quote, where she worked.  What's the problem with that is all those ass...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true.  ...ages.  Co-workers, not Google.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google agreed to blur out more of the image.  In fact, they blurred not only her, but like the whole house now.  She's like Blerminey.  She lives in Blerminey.  But they said, hey, you're in a public place.  We don't have to give you any money.  The judge said that the Street View incident, while causing a shock for Grillo, did not  appear to be directly connected to the mental conditions she claimed.  He also wondered why she waited two years to sue.  But this, and this may be more important, the judge rejected Google's public place defense  and said...  Which is really scary.  ...people do not forfeit their privacy rights simply by being in a location others can see

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  them.  That's just so wrong.  That is a shiv to the heart of journalism.  You're in public.  You're in public.  If we now degrade what we define as public, then we steal that from the public.  Right.  Somebody had never wrote a book about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought you might have something to say about this.  I mean, there's a Streisand effect, which is that now everybody has seen them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But isn't it the public bathroom expectation of privacy issue?  That's public.  If you're sitting on your front steps in a bikini top?  No?  That's not quite a public bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're on your front steps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  I'd say it's different if you're in the backyard in a fence and the drone comes over and takes  a picture of her.  That's different.  That's wrong.  That's private.  She's sitting in front of a public building.  Anyone can walk by and take a picture of that building, and it can take whatever notoriety  it gets.  But granted, I was going to say, being on the internet is...  We said John Streetview.  No, I'm sorry.  I've got to hold tight to defending what's public is public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would say that I think she has the right to go to Google and say, blur that out, would  you?  And they did.  She did win an award, a few thousand dollars, not all the money she asked for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like two grand, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you see what this leads to?  A pianist now wants a bad review taken down under the right...  He wants it.  He didn't get it taken down.  ...to be forgotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is the image that Boing Boing chose there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's a crying baby.  Yep.  Dejan Lajic got a mildly critical review in 2010 in the Washington Post, and he doesn't  want anybody to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He didn't, but he didn't go to Google, which was actually smarter.  He went to the source and tried to argue this was a right, and then have the Washington  Post take it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which of course they laughed at.  Right?  Right.  So is he going to go on to Google now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If this gets forgotten, extends too far, it becomes that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd love it if I get all the bad reviews of our shows taken down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just want to take away the computers of a few trolls, and then life is fine.  Then life would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't stop trolls, but you can get a bad review taken down.  So did the Post take it, did not take it down?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leichshund zu Schreckt, you want to give us an update on the status of the German...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, real, real quick.  So when last we met this soap opera, a couple things had happened.  Basically the publishers seemed to lose, but actual Springer, who was leading the war against  Google, decided to keep a couple of its brands out of snippets.  Two weeks later, they come along and they say, oh, no, we surrender.  We've lost so much business.  We too want you to take the snippets, Google.  Of course, I don't think it's as simple as it seems.  I suspect that it's Springer arguing that, see, Google is too powerful.  It hurt our business, unless we had the snippets.  Though in the article I linked to in DeedSight, the commenters pointed out what this also does  is it shows the value that Google is bringing to the publishers and for free.  So one could argue that Google is the one who should be charging the publishers for  the traffic it sends, but of course it doesn't do that.  So this soap opera goes on.  At the same time, we have Ittinger, the new EU head of digital stuff, who's talking about  having his own similar law across all the EU.  And since last we spoke, Spain did indeed pass the link tax, which is incredibly dangerous.  They did.  Yes, and you cannot opt out of it.  So you can't say, oh, never mind, don't pay me for the links.  Nope, nope, nope, can't do that.  It even affects academics.  It is abhorrent in so many ways.  I can't believe that it will in the long run be sustained by EU rules, but who knows?  And it's a law in the books and it's an incredibly stupid and dangerous law.  And Spain...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So tell me, tell me exactly what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Link tax?  Yeah.  If you link, aggregators, curators, etc., if they link to, for the links, they have  to pay in basically per link to a fund, but then somehow or another, it's uncertain, will  be distributed to the copyright holders who are so harmed by being set this traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's really pretty much a tax on Google, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, it's a Google tax, but it's also a tax on links, so it affects others.  So I was at an event last night speaking to foreign CEOs and stuff, and there was a guy,  the guy who spoke before me was from Buzzfeed.  And I'm talking about this and he was saying, oh, I said, watch out, fella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I get taxed by Spain if I link on a show note on twit.tv to a Spanish source?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know how this goes.  And again, the other thing is it's like the right to be forgotten, or it's like the presumption  of privacy in public.  Once you've dealt with this as a principle, then you have no idea how it's going to be  extended.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I was in Spain, I got a lot of, I got some press attention in Spain.  You did.  You were on the front page.  No, no, no.  I was in El Mundo.  I was in, what's this one called?  Expansion.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't read it, but.  I like the picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did they take that or is that a file photo?  They took that.  That's nice.  You look angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  While I'm doing this terrible legal thing, I did make the front page in Korea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You look very authoritative.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does it say about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have no idea.  I did worry about the headlines on the airport when I saw it.  I said, oh, oh, gee.  I pulled out the Google app and you can just mark the text you want to translate.  And it did translate.  It was pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does it say?  You remember?  I forget.  The professor explains how Internet works to rapt students.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm writing that one.  Let's get that in 18 point type on the back of the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's more danger in Europe, folks.  It's not good.  And my argument to Europe, I wrote a 3,000 word essay about this that I've so far not  been able to place in German media about the German problem.  If any of you are watching and have some help for me, let me know.  A certain major publication that starts with F and ends with Z and has an A in the middle  should have run it because they've run 8,000 word attacks on me and they wouldn't run it.  But my argument is to Europeans is watch out.  You are now being seen very clearly as an environment that is hostile to technology,  innovation and investment.  You don't want that.  Nope.  Nope.  And if I were investing in the company, if I were starting a company, will I do it in  Europe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely not right now.  Let's take a break.  We'll be right back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is literally just for people who are watching now or hear this in the next hour.  It's Inbox Happy Hour starting in nine minutes at 3 p.m. Pacific time.  If you let's see, what do you have to do?  You want an Inbox invite?  You have to send an email to inbox at google.com between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. Pacific time today  and you will get your invite by 5 p.m.  Send it from your Gmail account.  Can you do the same thing with phones?  Yeah, that's what they need to do with phones.  Yeah, yeah, everything you do with phones, exactly.  So sorry folks who are chime shifting.  This is only good for the next, starting in nine minutes for an hour.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chris is running over.  Everybody's, anybody on my staff is running over.  You got to wait, you got to wait eight minutes before you send that email.  Yes, as Gina says, use your Gmail email address because that's the one that'll get the invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Do we love Inbox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two thumbs up.  Jeff's thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I just don't, I don't use it enough.  One odd thing is the alerts on my watch from Inbox aren't as useful as the Gmail alerts.  Gmail alerts, I can actually read most of the email.  The Inbox alerts just say, oh, you got mail.  Well, no, yeah, of course I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just love how it rends.  I mean, this is lollipop, right?  It's material design, even on the web.  That's one nice thing, by the way, Android, iOS and web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Love that.  And it has got, I've been Inbox Zero ever since it came out.  Oh, shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Between that and your two minute commute, I just hate you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And my 18 smartphones.  Wow.  Anyway, great, really great.  So you have one hour, they will accept all the emails that come in and they'll send you  an invite by 5pm.  So Inbox, for those of you who don't know, it's still Gmail.  It's a new interface to Gmail that's free.  Of course, if you don't use Gmail, it's no use to you.  But it's Google's attempt to really reinvent how you process email.  And it does a great job.  And all the changes, everything you do in Inbox is reflected in your Gmail so you can  go back and forth fluidly and easily.  You're not abandoning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you use email elsewhere, you can pop it into Gmail and start using it.  If you have company email, don't worry, you can still use company email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, create a Gmail account, just forward the mail or pick up the mail in Gmail and  then you'll be able to use it.  You get Gmail's great email filtering.  There's so many benefits.  And what they've done, which I really like, is they...  And I need to find out what the markup is for this because you will get calendar invites,  actionable calendar invites in the preview.  I mean, you'll...  Live video.  Oh yeah, there's a markup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They published the markup for that.  It's pretty cool.  Really nice.  Yeah, there are like action buttons and like invitation.  Yeah, it's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just makes it so much easier.  All right, Jeff.  What's your number of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I saw an uh-oh headline.  I saw the Wall Street Journal wonder when we hit peak Android.  And I said, uh-oh.  But what they said was that shipments...  Android represented 84% of shipments in the last quarter, down 1%, 85%.  And it probably won't get any bigger than 85%.  But there's plenty of market to go, so I'm not concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this in the US?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You had to ask me a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  84% of all devices shipped last quarter were Android devices.  You can't get...  I mean, I guess you could get to 100%, but no.  Globally.  Globally.  Globally.  Wow.  So it's different in the US.  It's probably not more than 50% in the US.  But 84% of all smartphones shipped globally in Q3 were Android...  Actually, that's down.  It was 85% in the quarter in Q2.  Yeah, so it was 1%.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's down, so they're saying, oh, who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple, globally again, 12%.  Windows Phone, 3%.  Blackberry, 1%.  Oh, poor Blackberry.  They've owned the world once.  That's pretty amazing.  And Nokia?  Well, Nokia is.  That's Microsoft.  Yeah, that's what I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The days when those brands ruled the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dominant.  Yeah, Sony Ericsson.  Remember them?  Yeah.  I guess I'll have to give you more detail to come, but I think I have to say the Turbo,  the Droid Turbo, if you're a Verizon customer, is going to be my tool of the week because  it really is, I think, a very nice phone.  I love this metallic glass back with Kevlar reinforced.  So go ahead, shoot at me.  It's a bulletproof phone.  And the battery life, again, I can't give you the exact because I've only had it for  a day, but it seems to be much better than even my Note 4, which is a ginormous battery.  And I love it that it's pretty much pure.  It's the Motorola experience, and I like it.  Here, let me try and shoot at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it okay?  Is it okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It killed my phone, but I'm okay.  It's Kevlar, which is the same material they use for bulletproof stuff.  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you, Gina.  I think we got you out of here in time.
