Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google. We're just coming off the big Apple announcement. We'll talk a little bit about that.  We'll also talk about privacy issues with the Google self-driving cars, what the former First Lady of Germany thinks about autocomplete,  and why Google thinks I'm a douche. It's all coming up next on Twig.  This is Twig.  Bandwidth for This Week in Google is provided by Cashfly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y dot com.  This is Twig This Week in Google, episode 163, recorded September 12, 2012. Jeff in a dress.  This Week in Google is brought to you by Ford. Ford invites tech geeks to join the conversation, submit ideas, and grab a tech geek badge at social.ford.com.  It's time for Twig This Week in Google. And we will Google-ize with our regular googly eyes, starting with on my left, Ms. Jeanne Trapani of SmarterWear.org, founding editor of Life Hacker, and a hacker herself.  Good to see you, Jeanne.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good to see you too. I'm sorry that we started late, but it gave me enough time to download the Xcode Gold Master.  Oh, yes. The iOS 6 Gold Master is out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.  So do you put it on something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do I put it on? I just install it on my Mac.  Yeah, you don't, you don't.  Do I like burn it to the disk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but you don't put it on your iPhone or iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't yet. I haven't yet. I didn't install the iOS 6 beta, but now I will because I want to test my app on iOS 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and you'll be ahead of all the other cool kids who don't get theirs till Thursday or whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah. Also with us, cool kid himself, Jeff Jarvis of BuzzMachine.com, professor of journalism at City University of New York. Hello, Jeff Jarvis, JJ, author of Public Parts. And what would Google do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So are you completely appled out, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am so appled out, but I will allow you both rebuttal, a minute of rebuttal. Are you excited?  So Apple today, if you're just tuning in, if you've been in the woods, announced the new iPhone, iPhone 5.  You know, it's funny, I walked around amongst normal people before the announcement and I did not detect a heightened sense of liveliness, awareness and excitement.  I don't think most people know that this announcement is going on. Apple fans know that it's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was one of their incremental updates, right?  But it's not supposed to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's not supposed to be.  Because it's TikTok, right? So iPhone 4 was big, going from the 3GS to the 4, huge. Looks different. iPhone 4S looks exactly the same, just software stuff. So that was supposedly the talk. Now we need a TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, OK, yeah, you're right. So this was supposed to be a big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's big. I mean, the screen is a row of icons taller, 9 millimeters taller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, 4 inches, right?  Yeah, it's a 4-inch screen.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Metal back. Bezel is drilled by diamonds. It's an 8-megapixel camera still, but it's now got a sapphire lens, movable insides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple can now exploit African miners as well as Asian factory workers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't want to talk about this on the Apple event, because I don't want to be... I hate to be the turd in the punch bowl, if for one of a better...  Or you get a cold one if you say anything.  I don't want to be the guy who brings everybody down, but did you see the article in the Shanghai Evening Post?  They got a reporter into the Foxconn factory. Now, remember, we talked a lot about Mike...  Daisy.  Yeah, Daisy. And unfortunately, he tarnished what he was saying by making up facts.  But the story was substantively accurate, which was that the workers at Foxconn, the people who are making not just this gadget, but every one of these gadgets in our little life, not just Apple, but everybody, they're all made in China by labor that is not enjoying the best conditions.  So this was a Chinese reporter for a Chinese news agency who went undercover. This is good reporting, Jeff. I think you'll agree to the Foxconn factory.  He pretended to be a new worker on the iPhone 5. He worked there for 10 days. He did a diary.  Back in March, the factory needed 20,000 more workers to work on the iPhone 5. So they started this in March. They do 57 million phones a year for Apple. He could only take it for 10 days.  He talked about the recruitment. Pretty straightforward. He was asked 30 questions for his mental health, yes or no questions. One of them, have you gotten to a state of mental trance recently?  Remember, they had a problem with suicides there. This is pictures of the dormitory. Not too beautiful, not too elegant. He said, the whole dormitory smells like garbage when I walked in. It's a mixture of overnight garbage smell plus dirty sweat and foam. I don't know what that smells like.  Outside every room, fully piled up with uncleared trash, cockroaches in the cupboard, the bedsheets are full of dirt and ashes. Then he's asked to sign a contract to say that, and he's encouraged by managers to tick no before he even goes in to say that he didn't hear any noise pollution or toxic pollution before he even goes in.  His job was to put oil dots on the back. If you read this, you might have some second thoughts about buying not just your iPhone but your gadget of any kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bookend that with what happens to them when you throw them out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this is where we want to see Apple innovate, right? I mean, I love the Johnny Ive video against the white background where he says, Aluminium, and we get to see like beautiful corners. Sounds clean, doesn't it? It's amazing, right? But I would love to see Apple start to innovate here. How do we manufacture these things without recruiting students out of universities? That was another story. I think that was also Shanghai Daily.  And make these conditions better. And, you know, I would just like to see them talk about that in there. You know, they've made a lot of great strides environmentally, right? I would like to see them sort of address this kind of thing in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This guy had to mark four points with paint on an iPhone back. This is all he did. He had to do five a minute. He worked 10 hours, 3000 iPhone 5 backplates. There are four production lines doing just that. 12 workers in every line producing 36,000 iPhone backplates in half a day. I mean, mind numbing work. And by the way, he did two extra hours of overtime for $4.  So just I mean, look, I'm not I'm probably going to continue to buy the gadgets I buy, but it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, there's responsibility. There's you know, we've seen this this movement with food. One of my students, the woman named Jenny Avens has something called Closetour where she looks at the same considerations with fashion and the story behind what you get. And certainly getting the story behind the technology is important as well. And Mike Daisy did poison that well, but but it's a well, you know, that needs attention.  And I think you're right. You are. I hope you're right. And I hope that people would care enough if it becomes a differentiator, especially since you're paying a premium for Apple, by the way, and a rather considerable premium that you can get that because I really think my takeaway from today was just that that smart phones are now as boring as phones became.  And so there's not a lot new to be done. There'll be some new features, there'll be some new stuff. That's fine. But it reminds me of the old days when we used to be excited when GM announced its new line of cars. And now who cares? Or when NBC announced its new shows now cares. Oh, so Apple announces a new phone. Who cares? It's become commodity. And, and I think, you know, that's, that's the interesting thing to me. And so so can you differentiate your phone in part by the way you use it?  In part by its virtue? We'll see if everybody tries to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd love it if so if Apple. Well, you know who did Google did remember they made a big deal about the queue. Yeah, that's the queue, which was just an unfortunate product to make the point with. But it was made in the US.  I mean, wouldn't you love to see an Apple keynote where they said and these were all made in the USA? I mean, I would I would intentionally I would turn I would not make the choice based on features or benefits. I would take the Samsung Galaxy S3 put it aside and buy only iPhones if they did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I'm gonna scream or scream because I think I think we go a little too far with that. You know, USA jingoism and and you know, I don't want to unemployed a whole bunch of people in China. I just want them to be employed decently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, maybe that's the solution is to say, OK, we're going to continue making China. But see, this is what Apple says they're doing. And that's the problem is they say, but we're going to have standards. We're going to we're going to really insist on them. We're going to go out there. We're going to step forward. And again, I'm not picking on Apple because I every product we buy from any company that's made in China is probably made in conditions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyone can complain about their jobs exactly right. Leo or probably conditions that are worse. I would bet there are conditions that are worse than Apple. Yeah. And so, you know, is that relativism work or not? And certainly we saw stories people complaining about their jobs at Amazon warehouses, which are not pleasant places. And I certainly have a more pleasant job. Look at what my surroundings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, jobs can be difficult, and I think we have to realize that realize a little bit of the context. Nonetheless, I think Gina's point is to make better conditions, a goal and a differentiator and a marketing position would be a wonderful thing. Yes, huge opportunity. And by the way, the studies have shown it doesn't add significantly to the cost of the device. I'm talking forty dollars to an iPhone. I know people are very price sensitive, but I pay forty dollars more to know that the workers were well taken care of.  Moving on. Germany. I just I just going to just say this because it's just going to make Jeff so happy. What have they done now? Germany's first lady, former first lady. But Tina Wolf, I guess there were lots of rumors about Ms. Wolf having a different career before she married former German President Christian Wolf. A career of longstanding, one might call it. Yes.  One of one of the oldest professions. So when you auto complete, when you do a search for and you type auto complete terms like escort and prostitute come out and she's mad at Google for that and she's suing them for defamation. Right. Right. Because people are writing about this. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. And so that's the data which which I'm ready to go, you know, make fun of it for and and and defend Google and then Google turned around and there's another story in there. I think it's in there that they have.  They're not so quick to auto complete for pirated sites now. Right. Yes. So if Google does change for one reason and then doesn't change for the other, it violates its what algorithmic purity here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they've been sued in Italy and Japan and lost in both cases and had to change how auto complete works. It's just a shame because you and I and everybody listening to this show knows that auto complete has nothing to do with Google. It's because that's what people are typing in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the people. Well, you know, this whole story about I'm going to forget who said it suddenly. I'll add a tech sock. Zainab said this that that we in America don't see that the absolute freedom of speech is not something shared around the world.  And she's not saying that judgmentally at all. She's from Turkey. And what she's trying to explain to people is that in other countries, hate speech, negative speech is regulated, is forbidden, is punished.  And so when it isn't here, this in the context of the of the horribly cheesy, ridiculous video that supposedly caused what happened in Egypt, Libya.  So when that's not controlled here, there's a presumption in other countries or the ability to paint it as if it's approved speech.  And I think that that that's a little bit of a cultural shift to explain. I still will defend absolute free speech and sell absolute free speech to anyone.  And I'm not justifying anything that's come out of that. But I think that that comes in some of this legislation that happens as well. This is not good. So clearly you should stop this. It shouldn't go through you.  Well, there's there's there's implications of that that we should we should know better.  Well, yeah. And that's the you know, I mean, of course, the first thing that comes to my mind is they just don't understand how it's working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, and maybe if somebody explained, well, this is automatic, Ms. Wolf. This is not Google's not doing this. This is part of autocomplete.  But I don't get the sense that she would understand. Maybe she does understand that she still wants him to stop. Yeah.  And what does Google do? You know, Google's in it's I'll go back to the video again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google blocked that infamous video in Egypt and Libya. It defended the video being online, said the video, which if anybody has watched it, it is the cheesiest, cheesiest, most ridiculously, obviously stupid thing you could ever imagine horribly done, done to piss people off, done intentionally to provoke.  Yeah, they did. And just just just, you know, I would say laughably ridiculous, but nothing's laughable about the situation now.  It's tragic. But Google said this meets our standards. It's staying on YouTube, but it blocked it in Egypt and Libya. And meanwhile, Afghanistan blocked YouTube in total.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so, you know, I don't know whether I don't know if there's an easier. I don't know what the easy answer is.  What do you do about Egypt and Libya if you're Google?  I don't know. I mean, when we talked about China, early in the early days of this week in Google, I think we agreed that a company has to if you're going to do business in a country, you have to abide by the country's laws.  And Yahoo and Google don't have Nazi memorabilia. eBay doesn't have Nazi memorabilia in Germany for sale.  They follow the local law. They follow the law of the land that they are in.  And so either and Google made the right choice, which is say, well, then that would case we're not going to do business in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you can censor us, but we will not censor ourselves. Right.  They said in China, however, it is a bit hypocritical, given what they they do. They do censor in Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But then they open up all these problems by when I type the pirate bay into autocomplete, I get the pirate movie, the Pirates of Penzance.  I don't get pirate bay.  E-bag. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they demote sites that they've deemed the primary purpose is to modify autocomplete.  Right. They modify autocomplete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they're saying we can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, if in Germany it's true that, you know, saying that this woman was a prostitute at some point is illegal, that's not protected speech.  Is that what you're saying, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, what I'm saying is culturally what Zeynep says is that just culturally there, the presumption is that because hate speech is regulated, if you haven't regulated it, you're approving it.  Whereas in America, of course, is no, no, no, all speech, including noxious speech is protected.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So because this autocomplete suggestion comes up in Germany, it seems as if Google is approving or publishing this information, which is inaccurate.  So she feels so she's saying this is inaccurate.  You shouldn't show it.  It's on you to take it down.  Yeah, I mean, it's tough.  It's tough.  I do agree that if you're going to do business in a country, you should sort of abide by their laws.  And if this is defamation, I mean, I don't know if German law considers this defamation, then then Google probably who's doing the defaming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's autocomplete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the problem.  It's yes, it's the crowd.  And if something goes through you.  So should every newsstand be arrested for something that's carry every bookstore that's be arrested for carrying something?  Haven't we been there before?  Well, that's a little different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What if hate speech goes on on a telephone?  Do you blame the phone company?  Exactly.  No, that's what point.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  The story is a little more complicated because this ex president got into a whole kerfuffle and tried to call and did call left a message for the guy I know, Kai Diekman, who's the editor of built the biggest paper in Europe.  And it became a whole big hoo ha basically ruined his career.  So that's been going on and he's kind of kind of tender.  And then meanwhile, this is happening to see there's a little cultural background there.  We miss the way just as an aside, Kai is the editor of this largest paper.  It's very tabloid II and he in the top two top two executives, two of the top executives from actual Springer, a huge publisher in Germany, just moved to Palo Alto for six months to a year to get out of Germany to to get into the land of innovation.  Oh, OK.  They're going to get their jobs and just and just soak in innovation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Google is not admitting to changing its autocomplete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that just be because if they downgraded the sites in search, would that also potentially automatically affect autocomplete, you think?  I mean, it should. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it should. Right. And that's what's that's what's presumably going on with Pirate Bay.  Right. The Pirate Bay is not showing up high in search results because they're they're they're waiting it because it's they've deemed it a site that's there to provide according to Torrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  According to Torrent Freak as recently as January 2011, if you typed the T H E space P into Google, you'd immediately get the Pirate Bay.  Not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so if you complete the search, it does the Pirate Bay come up in?  No. In the results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question. Let's see. Let's go to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that autocomplete suggests what you're probably going to get.  No, I'm wrong. The Pirate Bay. If I search for the Pirate Bay, that is the first the first site that I get back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm getting stories about the Pirate Bay.  Yeah, no, you're right. There it is.  So it's still number one result for the Pirate Bay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So they're not but they're not suggesting that you go there.  Yes. This is interesting. It's not an easy answer.  It really isn't an easy answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's a risk, though, as soon as you do start censoring, then you're saying not only can we, but we are no longer a carrier.  We don't have that safe harbor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Well, back to the bay.  I mean, you've got to have a rule set that you live by.  It's very difficult. Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know what Google does. I really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm trying to remember when they first launched this quick suggest, wasn't it was a arena slutsky slutsky.  Yeah, yeah, arena slutsky. Yeah.  Yeah. She said, hey, I just tried it and it's not suggesting anything for my name because that was one of the words.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  So, I mean, there are there's definitely some editorial going on here.  There's some filtering going on.  But how far do you take it? And for what reasons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, so difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't mean to go. You started on a little late German story and we went all off.  No, I knew we would. That's why I baited you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I completely knew we would. That's why I brought it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  While we got crazy things in Europe, what was the other story from from the Netherlands where a court said that if you a site that had linked to a Playboy photo of a naked celebrity, just by linking to that, this big site kind of, I think, grudge like, violated both companies.  Violated both copyright and privacy.  Pick one.  Right.  We get to that point where you cannot even link to something where everyone becomes responsible for the legality of what they link to just think about it for two seconds.  But this is this is an architectural issue people don't know what to do with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I keep thinking it's just that they don't understand the technology, but maybe it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, maybe, maybe not. It's just kind of this is the way the world should work. We want to work this way.  And I keep on coming back to this idea of standing on principles. You've got to have principles.  And this is going to sound terribly American exceptionalism, and I don't mean it this way.  But I think part of it is not just that we have this view here of free speech is an absolute.  I think that the Bill of Rights as an architecture, the idea of having principle in the Constitution, obviously, having principles and that you constantly check back to those principles rather than having what many nations do have, which is a constantly evolving life.  You know, a breathing set of laws that become the nation's legal view.  Maybe that's part of the difference, too. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should Google tell this former first lady what articles are so high ranking that mention prostitute and her name in them?  Should they reveal that to her so that she can go after those individual websites?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there you're in the Twitter land, aren't you? Where Twitter gets is being told by the judge that it has to hand over the tweets of users.  So Twitter, Google, in that case would be handing over data that isn't necessarily public.  Dime in those sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, she could probably just do the search and see the search.  She could see the sites that are coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So complete is not reflecting what people are searching for.  It's reflecting what your results will be when you do that search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's both. I think it's probably both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, the other problem with this is what if let's say it's not her.  What if someone else, a politician, you come up with, you know, Joe Schmo, thief.  And in fact, the guy is a thief.  It's not up to Google to adjudicate the truth or falsity of accusations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Right. So accused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're being expected to censor.  But then to have to adjudicate on top of that so they can judge whether to censor and possibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And Leo's point was it was a good one.  People are issuing this query.  Even if there are no articles, it still could show up in the autocomplete as well.  You know, one of the first autocomplete suggestion when you search for my name is divorce.  And I'm not divorced.  And I think that's because I think I posted a Flickr photo and said something about divorce in the title.  So it's just it's funny.  It doesn't bother me because, you know, whatever.  Who cares? But, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, I always thought it was more what people were searching for than results.  But I don't know, because when I type Leo Laporte is a I get jerk, douche, idiot, gay.  I don't think there's a lot of sites with jerk, douche, idiot, gay.  Maybe there are.  I get.  OK, so you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know where that comes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to sue Google.  Gosh, darn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You said if you say is right, if I say Jeff Jarvis, I get Twitter, CUNY, bio.  No, no, no, no, no.  It's only if you say is right.  So that sentences that have is in them.  Is it idiot is a twit is wrong is a moron.  Ah, I think douche wins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait a minute, though.  Let me let me let me just see.  I'll click that link because that's going to show me all the results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was up with Michael Arrington?  That's good.  Yeah, I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's I don't know.  I'm not sure, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you do it in quotes, you'll see the I'll see the actual results.  That's well, you see the pages that have exactly that sentence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, that probably narrows it down because it could it could call.  Right.  Michael Arrington a douche.  But you got I don't think I use that.  I don't like that word.  I don't think I use that.  Oh, I don't think I want either.  No, it's mostly people calling me a douche, actually.  Hey, moving on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We haven't Googled ourselves in a while on the show.  It's a tradition.  It's a tradition on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a tradition.  Consumer Watchdogger, just Governor Brown's California's Governor Brown to veto Googlers Google's driverless car bill because of privacy protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We got our dumb legislators to.  They're all in California.  No, they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, Consumer Watchdog privacy project director John Simpson said the Senate Bill 1298 is completely insufficient.  It gives the user no control over what data will be gathered and how much information will be used.  This is the law regulating autonomous vehicles.  And he says this law must provide that driverless cars gather only the data necessary to operate the vehicle and retain that data only as long as necessary for the vehicle's operation.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's everything that has technology associated with becomes cooties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was a story.  Oh, that's what it is.  It's because it's technology.  So it must be stealing our information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Whereas there was a story in the Times last week in New York about restaurants and all the things they know about you want to know about you.  So that when Mr. Leporte comes in, we want to seat him at this kind of table.  He likes his gin with the white cubes.  Right.  And if you get that foie gras on the stove right away, if you replace the word Google for restaurant in it, oh my God, there'd be laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the consumer watchdog says there's two reasons why Google won't endorse privacy protections for itself driving cars.  First, Google's entire business model is based on building digital dossiers about our behavior and using them to sell the most advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's OK.  That's a good business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You are not Google's customer.  You are its product, the one that sells to corporations willing to pay any price to reach you.  Will the driverless technology just be about getting us from point to point or about tracking how we got there and what we did along the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's going to imprison you in your car and it's going to drive you to Wal-Mart and it's not going to let you leave until it buys what Google wants you to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or maybe you say drive me to Target and it drives you to Wal-Mart instead because they paid more.  Right.  Second, computer engineers who believe that more data is always better are in charge at Google.  They may not know what they use the data for today, but they think they may someday find a use for it and they don't want any restrictions on them.  Now, actually, neither of those are strictly speaking false.  They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to play devil's advocate.  OK, because somebody has to say it.  The point is the point that they're making, there's no way to opt out out of marketing, advertisements or sharing data as you drive and that the consumer should have the opportunity to opt out if they wanted to.  Now, I understand that the deal is that you use this technology like in return for using this technology, for getting this great convenience, you're giving your data.  Right. We've had this conversation.  It's just like club cards and all the other things.  But it would be nice.  Some people would say if you could opt out and say I'll pay for not sharing my data, I'll pay with money instead of paying with my data.  Does that seem unreasonable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, A, I don't think I've seen any business plans that actually have Google using marketing in this.  Though you're right, I can well see them doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's kind of what they're saying is they may not know now, but they'll just save it just in case because they'll find.  They may.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But B, you're going to know what the deal is.  And you could opt out of having a self-driving car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is the amendment that the author of the legislation proposed.  The manufacturer of the autonomous technology installed in a vehicle should provide a written disclosure to the purchaser of an autonomous vehicle that describes what information is collected by the autonomous technology equipped on the vehicle.  Consumer Watchdog said that is completely inadequate.  I think that's a perfectly good rule all around.  Now, what they're saying though, and I do support this, is they have a concept of privacy by design.  It means privacy issues are considered from the very beginning and the solutions are baked in.  The point being that if you try to catch up after a new technology is widely adopted, it's kind of a done deal.  And maybe that's what we've seen on the Internet.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, to an extent.  I sat in a meeting at the whatever the name of the group I'm supposedly a member of about privacy, and they talked about this.  And the problem is they just think about privacy.  They don't think about the actual use of it first.  So it's not designed by design, right?  It's let's make sure that at every possible stop, we're going to put in a stop here.  We're going to put a box you tick off.  We're going to put all this other stuff.  And we're not going to sit down and say, well, why does somebody want this?  And it's my favorite example of this is that Google priority inbox.  Google is reading your mail and it's OK with you and you know what the trade off is and it's fine.  If the same attitude came to that every time you open an email would say, is it OK if I read this?  Is it OK if I read that?  No, it's just OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess if your if your job title is privacy watchdog, this is what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is and this is exactly this was Howard Stern's point always about the people went after him.  There are these organizations that anoint themselves are protectors with probably two members and a big mailing list and a nice bank account.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But don't you think the EFF would say something similar, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think they'd be this stupid.  Well, I don't think they'd be this.  Now, let me put it this way.  I think they would be more nuanced in trying to investigate and try to do what you just did, Gina, which is to say, well, you know, how could this be used?  Let's think that through.  And if there's any dangers, let's warn of them.  Instead, this is a blanket.  If you have any data on me, you're clearly going to use it for bad and horrible purposes.  There's been not a word of Google using self-driving cars in a marketing sense or what this data might go to.  And so they're allowing them to be on the road so that Google can test them and regulate their safety.  But they're not even for sale.  So there's no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not unreasonable, though, to think that that's Google's business model that they might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're an advertising company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, if we regulate every potential behavior, every potential behavior, we'll tie ourselves in knots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. It kills innovation if you're constantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google could also use it as a taxi service and could rip off people.  And there are laws about how taxis operate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, they could be using it for escorts and prostitution.  Let's put that in there.  Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And pick up.  No, sorry.  Try to tie it.  Stop.  I'll stop.  I'll stop.  I'm going to meet a German.  My book's on sale right now, so I want to say nice things.  Yeah, so trying to regulate to potential uses is the problem.  We always get to this problem.  What they're doing is trying to regulate the technology versus the behavior.  Right.  What the privacy laws are already there that if you use data in bad ways, no matter how you got it, whether it was from Facebook or from a car, the laws are there to establish it.  Let's do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's have good privacy laws that don't talk about any specific application, but just let's do that.  That's not I could go for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what it should be.  That's what it is.  We already have privacy laws.  We already have copyright laws.  We already have these laws.  We don't need a whole mess of new laws for technology except from showboating associations that want to raise money and legislators that also want to raise money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does feel like a lot of it's scare tactics like, oh, here they go again.  They're going to steal our information.  In fact, they do in this press release.  I was reading their press release.  They do bring up they call it the Y spy incident.  The Google cars, the Google Street View cars that were accidentally gathering Wi-Fi, the Y spy and as if Google had some nefarious plan.  Actually, they do have a nefarious plan.  Sergey Brin and Diane Von Furstenberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fashion Week is their nefarious plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is how you get people to wear Google glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is nefarious plan is trying to convince you that those glasses do not look weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They look weird.  I don't care if Diane Von Furstenberg is wearing them or her models are where they look weird.  Here she is with Sergey Brin at Fashion Week and they both look like complete dorks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're going to make a video out of the product of the glasses next week.  Oh, really?  Which also occurred to be Leo.  Come the next Apple event.  People happen to be just wearing their Google glasses.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple is going to throw them out.  They're going to say turn off your glasses.  That could be interesting.  And you won't be allowed to wear them into a dressing room or a bathroom or a gym.  I don't think this makes these look good.  I don't understand even what Diane Von Furstenberg is up to here.  The glasses, by the way, match the outfit.  Notice it does look pretty silly.  It looks so dorky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks weird.  I wonder if Apple is going to make glass jammers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of them did a dialogue to the model.  Walk 25 steps, stop, turn right, turn around, walk 25 steps, reach your destination.  Turn left, turn right.  It said that it looked like Sergey had a cocktail straw sticking out of his head.  It does.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't make that look not dorky, but it's fine.  Oh, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  Sarah Jessica Parker.  Oh, that's perfect.  Oh, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, Carrie.  Either way, I did not know that Diane Von Furstenberg was married to Barry Diller.  Yeah.  Now it's all coming together.  He's the guy who's putting the little tiny antennas, the Areo antennas out.  Google is going to...  That's good.  It's good.  No, let's see.  High fashion.  Look better now.  Attractive women wearing...  No, that's the picture right there.  That is the picture right there.  A beautiful woman in an interesting couture gown.  What does that pair of glasses say to you?  Google schmutz's beauty.  I am a borg.  I'm a cyber.  I'm ready for my close-up in Battlestar Galactica.  It makes one eye look weird and broken.  It's glowing.  Yes, because the light is shining there.  See, that's the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This so has to be in Big Bang Theory this season.  Please, please.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they should do a whole episode just on glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sheldon making his own Google glasses.  He can't get them, so he makes his own.  And they're a little bit larger, a little bit less stylish.  Google is making this...  Look for Boingo.  I almost said Oingo Boingo.  Look for Boingo Wi-Fi hotspots free across the US this month.  Unless?  Unless you're using iOS or Windows Phone.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I could have sworn that I was in a New York City subway stop  that has this free Wi-Fi hotspot with my iPhone, and it worked fine.  Did I imagine that?  Maybe I had my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a new deal.  This is a new announcement.  Yes, that was open to all at that time.  This is a new thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is for Android only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm dying to know what the experience is.  So if you have your iPhone, you connect to the Wi-Fi network.  What does it say?  Sorry, get an Android?  What does it say?  Anything?  Does it just say not available?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't encountered it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Somebody tweet me with an image.  If you have one, give me a screenshot and we'll show and tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's sponsored by Google Play.  So the idea is get you to buy stuff on Google Play.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you're not going to use it to surf or anything.  You should use it to buy stuff from us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are there Google Play specials or discounts?  I don't know.  That would be a good idea, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, stop by this area to get a free app or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it was the whole idea that the Times had a big story about Google competing with  Amazon.  And you said it earlier, Leo, I think in the coverage that how many credit card numbers  you have and thus how many transactions you pay.  That's the next game.  What was the number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Apple had something like 153 million.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  iTunes accounts with one click purchases.  That's the power right there.  This is Boingo says anyone accessing the Wi-Fi hotspot will also have access to some free

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  content, although it doesn't specify what that is.  YouTube ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  YouTube ads.  Free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, it could be like watch an episode of your favorite show while you wait  for the train.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That'd be great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's see here.  I thought it was interesting that Google gave an exclusive to Alexis Madrigal in the Atlantic  about how it builds its maps because, of course, one of the announcements Apple made today  is the emergence of iOS 6 soon.  I think the 14th, right?  And that will no longer have Google Maps built in.  Apple's doing its own map thing.  So Alexis Madrigal of the Atlantic gets to see the insides of Ground Truth, the secret  program to build the world's most accurate maps by Google.  And I think what they're showing is this was absolutely aimed at Apple.  It's not just the data, which everybody could buy.  It's how we massage the data.  It's how we make it work.  They started with data from the US Census Bureau.  On first inspection, this data looks great.  The roads look like they're all there.  And you've got the freeways differentiated.  This is a good map to the untrained eye or Apple computer.  But let's look closer.  No, I added that.  There are issues about where the digital data does not match the physical world, etc., etc.  And so they're talking about how they have this whole building where Google engineers  are massaging it, that Google is driving around with custom cameras.  Literally, Google has five million miles driven for mapping, not just Street View, but the  cars are actually driving around to see if there's a road there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amazing the investment, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was struck by a couple of things.  One is that, this goes back to the Apple announcement, is that what's happened with me is that I'm  so addicted to Google services that led me to the hardware.  Whereas before, I liked the hardware and it led me to Apple services.  And I've switched that.  That's a very good point.  Apple's not really that good at services.  Let's be honest, we haven't been down for a day before the announcement, by the way, doesn't help.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think you're right.  I think that it's no longer about hardware.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so that's the funny thing about Amazon as well.  Amazon is going to such lengths to de-Googleify the Kindle Fire and Android on it.  And that's why I'm not going to buy it.  Because a lot of the reason that I like Android is because of the services that I get.  So the services lead me to the hardware.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And lead me to other things.  And I think, you know, I keep on wondering about Marissa, and Marissa understands that too.  And I keep on thinking that there's probably going to be something around services and better services  with Yahoo too, because that creates a relationship.  That creates data about you.  That creates value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's interesting because Bezos said, we want to make money when you use our products, not when you buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Zuckerberg said to Arrington, you know, I am not making a phone, Michael, which was hilarious stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely hilarious.  That's the rumor that just will not die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Michael keeps on.  I actually miss Arrington.  I have to say that after watching him do his interviews and watching him with Zuckerberg.  I thought it was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is it that he does that you like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's just blunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And he doesn't really care.  He's not kissing up to Mark Zuckerberg or anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, and Zuckerberg still in his natural state is also direct.  Right.  And put the two together.  And I enjoyed the conversation.  What did you think of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  It was a headline after headline.  Yeah.  It's the most it's the most forthright I've ever seen Zuckerberg more so than it all things.  I mean, he really he said a lot of stuff.  He said we made a huge mistake betting on HTML5.  Yeah.  Do you agree with that, by the way?  Well, yeah.  I mean, everybody agrees that the HTML5 based app on the iPhone was terrible.  And the new app is so much better.  He also said, no, we think most of our business is going to come from mobile and we are we know how to, you know, we're going to be able to monetize it.  I have to say I did start seeing ads in the in the in the iPhone app.  I think I did on on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The stock is up seven point seven percent today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, he did a good job, didn't he?  I moved the stock.  He sold himself.  He was disappointed by the stock price.  Who wouldn't be?  But he says it's not going to hurt his employing people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He likes being underestimated, which certainly is the case now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You always want to fly under the radar, don't you?  Yeah.  Never good to be the guy in front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it was also interesting to me that this attitude toward hardware and software and service and so on and so forth.  The difference, right?  Apple is selling hardware.  And I don't know what that really does to them strategically in the long run, especially when they can't surprise you as they couldn't today.  Right.  Google is going to addict you to its services.  Amazon is going to give you good deals on stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Amazon's got an ecosystem, but so does Apple.  So does Apple.  But Apple has always said, and I don't know if this is still true, but for a long time they said, oh, we don't make money on iTunes.  It's all about selling hardware.  I don't know if they were if that was true or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think at the point of the ninety nine cent songs, and that was pretty much all.  Yeah, I would probably was true, but now they're selling so much other stuff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Amazon read a great article.  I can't find it.  And I don't think it's in our links where the guy said the reason Amazon is not so big internationally is Amazon's only interest because they don't make money on the hardware.  They only make money on the store.  Their only interest is to get Amazon hardware into the hands of the people who use Amazon the most.  Those are what those are the people are going to make the most of.  If you use it for a browser, your waste, you know, your cost to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's another dynamic in Germany and France.  But for all I know, all of the EU, I don't know, but at least those two countries, you cannot discount books.  Oh, really?  Yes, it's to support the book.  Wow.  This is a regulation.  Right.  And so that's how Amazon makes its hey is by giving you great prices by using its efficiency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Speaking of Facebook, I love this article.  The New Yorker has a Facebook page in which they posted.  OK, brace yourself.  If you're watching this at home, this could be nipple edge.  They posted this on Facebook and it got pulled down because there were nipples.  It's a cartoon.  Adam and Eve sitting under a tree.  And Eve says to Adam, well, it was original.  And apparently they redrew the cartoon with clothes on, but it just really didn't work.  It turns out that the dots are the offensive part.  Now, Facebook does not block male nipples, only female nipples.  So the nipples on top, well, they're not nipples.  They're just black dots because it's a cartoon after all.  Those are OK.  No, I'm sorry.  These are the illegal nipples.  Those are the OK nipples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And for those of you listening, it's just two sets of dots.  It's two black dots.  It's all it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like, where's Waldo?  But for nipples.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They didn't really put clothes on.  Bob had to make clear at the end of the post that no, no, no, no, no, we did that as a joke.  It's a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And, you know, I'm trying to make this show family friendly.  I don't find this offensive in the least.  No.  But now, by the way, it was reinstated after they complained.  But somebody at Facebook said, no, no, no, no, you can't have that.  OK, not OK.  Just to be clear.  Not OK.  OK.  Anyway, I don't know.  I just thought that was funny.  It's not really a big deal.  I did think this was maybe not so funny.  It turns out that this Google fiber, by the way, I think that what was it?  Ninety eight percent of Kansas City neighborhoods have now amassed sufficient interest to get Google fiber.  It's like pretty much everybody who could get it's going to get it.  But it turns out that even though Fred Campbell, a former FCC official, portrayed the Google fiber project in Kansas City as a triumph for free markets, once government gets out of the way, deregulation promotes private investment.  That, in fact, the Google fiber is getting all sorts of government support, including tax breaks, expedited permitting.  City officials actually assigned staff to help Google.  One county offered to allow Google to hang wires on its utility poles for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All of which I would eagerly support.  Absolutely.  Just do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Free rights of way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Central office space.  Power.  Power.  Marketing and direct mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is the microcosm of Obama.  Yeah, you didn't make it by yourself.  No.  You always make it in concert.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's good for everybody, including citizens.  Business.  And business.  Ninety percent of the eligible neighborhoods, though.  I'm so jealous.  Oh, man.  And Google was so smart.  They did the thing where you get, you know, get your neighbors to.  So out of the 202 possible neighborhoods, 180 have amassed sufficient interest for Google to install.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There were campaigns in poorer neighborhoods to make sure that people signed up.  So that's a great way to get awareness of benefits.  That's great.  It was wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, Google did a little bit of a push.  There were a couple of neighborhoods that looked like they wouldn't get it.  And Google, Google, like I guess, said volunteers in to canvass like an election.  It's really cool.  I'm so jealous.  I want my Google fiber.  Yeah.  Oh, and by the way, they will.  Now, I should have mentioned this.  We were talking about the HTML5 and the lousy Facebook app is still HTML5 on Android.  But Zuckerberg, among other things, did say, no, no, we're working on a full bore Android app as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He didn't say when.  Yeah, someday.  And then Zuckerberg says, you know, when it's ready.  And I thought, well, that's not the way Facebook operates.  It's that often, but some things where they're not ready.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ship it before it's done.  That's OK.  It's really OK.  Let's take a break.  We'll come back with more.  Gina Trippani, Jeff Jarvis this week in Google.  Coming up shortly, we're a little bit delayed because of the Apple announcement.  Our triangulation show could be could be good.  Interesting show. Hans Peter Braunmo is our guest.  He is an entrepreneur who was hired.  Actually, his company was purchased by Nokia a few years ago, and he's been charged with keeping an entrepreneurial spirit alive inside of Nokia.  And we'll talk about Nokia's new phones.  It's Windows 8 phones, the future of Nokia coming up in our triangulation show.  But first, this episode of this week in Google brought to you by our friends at Ford and their new site, social.Ford.com.  A great place to go to get your tech geek badge, to learn about Ford vehicles, to share your ideas.  I think this is kind of the best modern 21st century suggestion box.  Lots of ideas here. You can read the ideas, vote on them.  In fact, we could sort by popularity. We could see what the most popular ideas are and the least popular ideas are.  Oh, this is a great idea. Have a 110 volt AC outlet in your car.  Actually, the Ford Flex has that. But wouldn't it be good in all vehicles? Have an AC outlet?  Forget the USB thing. Let's do it. So you like that idea? So do 18 other people. Just go on over and vote.  Ford's paying attention. I got to tell you, they really want to know what you think.  There's also articles there. I've got one I wrote, just a brief one, talking about my conversation with Ford technologist Jim Butchkowski about what's new in sync, what's coming in autonomous vehicles and so forth.  There's articles by Bill Ford in there. I credit Alan Mullally a lot with the CEO of Ford with transforming the company.  But a lot of credit. Oops, I get a badge. 1902 Ford 999. Ooh, 93 miles an hour in 1902. Wow.  Bill Ford really has led in some interesting ways the company in terms of its environmental initiatives and so forth. So there's some good stuff in here.  I like this site, social.ford.com. Take a visit. Grab a badge. There's a tech geek badge just for you right over here.  And and share your interest in Ford with others. And by the way, don't forget to drive a Ford vehicle, your Ford dealer near you. You might be pleasantly surprised.  Some amazing stuff coming from Ford, including that 2012 all electric focus next year, the 2013 energy plug-in hybrid, the fusion. It's gonna be awesome.  Social.ford.com. We thank them for their support.  Let's see. Variety magazine. This is so sad.  I just so sad. So Variety, which is like that was the Hollywood magazine. Right. Oh, it was it. It was it. It's got to be worth a ton. Right. Yeah. It's for sale.  The price. It's a fire sale. Read Elsevier can't get anybody to buy Variety. The price is now down to 30 million dollars. That's less than AOL paid for TechCrunch.  No. Ouch. It's not that it's not that Variety's got beaten by some other publication. It's that nobody's reading print anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And online they went behind a paywall when there's tons and tons of competitors. Yeah, there's there's, you know, Perez Hilton.  Yeah, it's all you need to say. They it's amazing how quickly a new brand can come along. When I when I worked at Cunninghast, I believe or not had to work on bridal a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's great. It is. It is. You look good in white. I think it's good. I want a picture of you with a with a veil. Jeff, somebody has to Photoshop that please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whenever I'd go to a bridal meeting, everyone would laugh at me. So so when I was there, we bought we the own brides. We bought modern bride. We bought elegant bride.  We thought, oh, we got bridal. Right. And then did some market research and found out the number one brand in bridal was the knot. The knot. Right. And so out of nowhere.  And we built what we did and made it a lot better and so on. But it's possible now for you to leapfrog with new brands. And that's really kind of an interesting thing. Great.  And it happened in print. And I think it's next going to happen potentially in mobile. Pew just came out with some more numbers. I don't have them up on the on the site with continuing.  This this goes on unabated that African Americans and Hispanics index a lot higher than the white population and total population in smartphones leapfrog opportunity. Right.  There's a chance to come in behind and suddenly a new brand can take over a space because the old one is protecting its own space. And that's what happened variety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think it has to happen at a when a new media arises that it's not just going to happen in general because we're all into technology and things are moving faster. It's because there was a new medium.  There's an opportunity. That's that's what poses the opportunity. Now first you have desktop browsing on the Internet. Tablets probably are kind of in addition to smartphones. Another new opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I think mobile apps will mobile space will allow a new brand built well for that world leapfrog. You know because somebody if if if Facebook didn't get us act together on mobile can somebody create a new social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's the opportunity. Yeah. Yeah there is. Yeah. Do you think that the iPad is mobile. Do you think this. I mean Zuckerberg did not. It's an interesting debate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Though I carry around my Nexus 7 right really dorkily in my back pocket to me but mobile means mobile phone not tablet.  Though my my my stock tweet ready line is that mobile equals local and local equals around me.  So whatever's around me is mobile is mobile. Yeah because it doesn't matter. Yeah. The huge proportion of tablet usage is in the home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. Makes sense. I think of tablets as a PC replacement really. Yes. And I think of smartphones is truly mobile like you're out and about. Yeah. Your phone's always in your pocket.  The tablet for me is the living room kitchen computer. Another computer. Yeah. Yeah. So Zuckerberg was right when he said the iPad's not a mobile device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He also said something about TV being closer to mobile being closer to TV than it is to computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't I don't know that I totally got that. He said that because the ads on TV are much more immersive that because you can't have ads on the right hand column in mobile that the ads probably ought to be more inclusive to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. You can't just have the ads just is there. You probably have to take over the experience with the app. Is that it maybe. Or did he mean inserting ads kind of into the stream the way that ads are. Yeah. They're interstitial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't get away from them. It is it is the fact that the banner ads and kind of you know little things at the bottom of the screen probably don't do much. You want to get you want to take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Right. You're surrounding the content versus I don't know if it was interstitial versus in stream ads. You know like it looks like just part of my new stream and I can you know scroll past it just the way I can.  But that's that's kind of what I have to trick people. Well I don't know that they they're a trick. I don't know that they have to take over your whole phone screen and I don't I think they can show up in your news feed and say like hey you're right near Chipotle like free burrito you know and have it be clearly marked as an ad but have it be part of your new stream.  I like Chipotle. They've got a free burrito thing. I'm right near one. I see it. My name is the key. I like Chipotle is where the real value is. Yes. But knowledge of you is real. I kept on thinking about our conversation last week about the American Express stuff and how you guys were using that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. That is really a powerful powerful new way to market. That's not about ads. It's about value to you and knowledge about you. Right. And if I if I like Chipotle on you know I've likely on Facebook when when I keep seeing ads about the you know the glee premiere I'm like yeah I'm still going to be on my new stream.  Yeah. I'm stoked you know that's that's that's advertising I'm much more open to and I understand why I got a demographic. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter. This is interesting because this is not this is not a search warrant or not a subpoena. Twitter has been ordered to release information deleted tweets and I think that's a very good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so forth about a protester in the Occupy Wall Street movement or be fined by the court. This is a 27 0 3. I think that's a very good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter. This is interesting because this is not this is not a search warrant or not a subpoena. Twitter has been ordered to release information deleted tweets and so forth about a protester in the Occupy Wall Street movement or be fined by the court.  This is a 27 0 3 order which is a request for information but allows prosecutors to get information without a warrant. It's well it's more powerful than a subpoena but not as strong as a search warrant.  The order is supposed to be issued when prosecutors provide a judge with specific and articulable facts that show the information is relevant material to a criminal investigation.  Twitter says they moved to quash. They said we're not they're not going to give you the information. Judge Shia Reno ordered Twitter to release the tweets and account information ruling that the defendant had no expectation of privacy when he published tweets.  Quote if you post a tweet just like if you scream it out the window there's no reasonable expectation of privacy. There's no proprietary interest in your tweets. You have now gifted them to the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To that extent I think that's true. But what I learned about this case is that there are things that they're asking for that are not public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they didn't ask for direct messages and the judge said no those would require a warrant based on probable cause.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They asked for data like time and place and things that wouldn't necessarily be public. And yeah I could shout out the window but if no one heard me and it goes off in the ether then that's my good luck.  Right. So if I kill the tweet and no one else recorded it except Twitter is Twitter required to dime its users.  And let's remember Yahoo and a man just got out of prison after a full decade he spent in prison in China. But that was his mail. That was. But this is communication. Yeah this communication.  So I agree with the judge that when something is public is public because anybody can hear that anybody can record that anybody can pass that on. And that's what you did and that's what it is.  But what Twitter I think is saying here and trying to trying to you know save itself as a platform for us is that they're asking for the next layer there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. The court ordered Twitter to release the data or hand over its confidential earnings statements for the last two quarters so they could determine how much of a fine levy against Twitter they have till September 14th.  Twitter said Twitter users own their tweets and should have the right to fight invalid government requests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's the key and that's where a Mac you know I have my problems lately with Twitter but that's that's really important doctrine and good for them.  We need protection of our communication not just the US mail. That's it. That's a principle that should be carried to the new world and figure out how we enforce it there.  But as I said I'm not totally against the ruling on what the public part but there is a line we got to we got to figure out what that line is and it's not what the judge is saying.  I don't think I mean Gina you. So let's say that Twitter changed its its retention policy and erased the tweets right when I was on online sites we try to retain data as as briefly as possible just because we don't get subpoenaed all the time.  So let's say that Twitter decided off screw it let's let's erase it but you of course are a retention vehicle and so the judge comes to you.  Don't tell anybody. Hand it over lady. What do you do? What do you say? What's your principle? What's your argument?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well so this is the reason why we built ThinkUp which captures tweets as a decentralized app that you install on your own service.  I'm not I'm not retaining everyone's tweets you installed on your own server you got your own copy just the way that you you know you off on your Twitter client on your phone.  I mean there's a cash copy of your tweets on your phone as well every device that you look at your tweets on there's a cash copy somewhere on that device.  But this is one of the main reasons why ThinkUp is a decentralized app. You thought about it already. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think we'd all agree the tweets are public but remember that the government's asking for any information Twitter had about the owner of the account the user name email address IP addresses used to access the account to post the tweets.  So it's more than just the public stuff. Yeah and that's and that's not anything that ThinkUp or any other app can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know you can't get IP addresses or email addresses.  So I would I'm not sure if Twitter which part Twitter is fighting if they're saying hey we're not going to give you the private stuff we'll give you but it seems to me that the tweets are public there there were they were shouted from the rooftops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I don't think they are.  I mean they could be in Google's cash.  I don't think they're protected.  No I don't think so either.  But I do admire Twitter for fighting the good fight.  Speaking of which I guess Forbes had a profile of of Williams and Biz Stone the creators of Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are the Twitter founders up to now not so obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a little play on the fact that the name of the company is obvious.  Actually it's actually obvious.  So Biz Stone stepped down from Twitter.  And started obvious backup.  Interesting.  Right. That was the name of their company back in the day.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They did.  ODO.  And then pivoted to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then they just launched medium.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Medium.  That's what it is.  I was trying to know what they're doing.  That's what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got a little little squib on medium.  Is it medium dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.  And you're on that right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You auth through Twitter.  Oh but you have to get an invite.  It's beta.  You do.  But that will get you in.  No.  It won't do anything for me.  He's just another person I've pissed off.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to ask.  No I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't piss him off.  He just never calls.  He never writes.  He never writes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He doesn't.  I think that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't see anything else that we should talk about.  Oh we have Jeff and a veil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have Jeff and a veil already.

Transcript:  Let us get your tip of the week Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We actually didn't talk about the YouTube, the new YouTube app for iOS.  That's going to be my tool.  Oh sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I won't talk about that.  The new Google Drive.  I should write that in.  Google Drive has a new update for both Android and iOS.  On iOS, the Google Drive app, you can now edit documents on your iPhone or iPad.  And the Android app I think got a comment.  So it's a small incremental update.  But nice updates.  We needed it.  We're seeing a few Google apps landing on iOS with iOS 6 coming out on September 19th,  which is next week.  And also I have a quick shameless plug.  Speaking of Think Up, we got a new URL.  Just ThinkUp.com.  Really easy to remember.  Did you have to buy that?  We did.  We did.  It was not cheap.  Somebody had it.  And a brand new release this week version 1.1.  Now supports Foursquare.  So we have Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare and Google Plus support.  So you can capture your posts and visualize them and map them.  And the Foursquare plugin is really cool.  One of our contributors, Aaron, wrote it.  Maps your tweets, sees your check-ins over time, sees time machine, check-ins from past  years.  So check it out.  ThinkUp.com.  Can I ask you a question?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Talk to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So in the open source, I don't know if I can pause this image.  Is that an octopus cat?  What is that?  That's Octocat.  Octocat is GitHub's mascot.  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Octocat.  So it's a cat with a human face and a wet tail with suckers on it.  That was just confusing me.  Exactly.  It's an octopus with a cat face.  It's GitHub's logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

If you don't have your own web server.  Good.  I want to do this because I want to add Foursquare and Google Plus and Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Awesome.  They just will collect everything.  So I'm going to go ahead and click on that.  I'm going to click on that.  I'm going to click on that.  That's amazing.  So what is the business model?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For ThinkUp?  Yeah.  Well, you know, we're working on it at the moment.  But you know, there's like there's opportunities for affiliate fees from cloud providers.  There's we're working on our 2.0 release right now, which will be we're going to have the  beta channel in the next few weeks, which is going to be less Google Analytics charts  and more of kind of an insight stream of things going on with your tweets that are interesting.  And there's some there's some opportunities for discovering interesting content across  networks that way.  So there could be, you know, there could be premium service that you that you buy to install.  It could be advertising.  We're still still working it out.  Right now, just focusing on making a really good product that's compelling.  And we're right now it's more like an Google Analytics dashboard.  You know, you set it up, you look at it, you're like cool charts and then you don't look at  it again.  We're working on kind of an insight stream.  That's going to be a lot more compelling and interesting kind of day to day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So just for people who want to know what it looks like, here's my think up stream and  here's the activity and followers by day.  Whoops.  I hate that feature of Chrome where you accidentally scroll to a previous page.  Anyway, that just did that.  And you get tweets, you get followers.  Oh, this is fun.  Who you follow is good and get more information about them.  Yeah, I got updated.  Right.  I got updated.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's really cool.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure.  Your number of the week, Mr.  Travis.  Well, so we know that Google was predicting flu by the end of the year.  So we know that you're going to be able to get flu by the end of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we know that you're going to be able to get flu by the end of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so we know that Google was predicting flu by being able to look at the search results  or search requests that people made.  And that's been the case for a while to the point that Google executives and founders  have used that as the reason to argue to governments they shouldn't be forced to erase data that  looking at the changes and deltas and data can make a difference.  Well, now, obviously, I'm surprised I haven't seen more of this.  A researcher at University of Rochester, Adams Sedelek, analyzed 4.4 million tweets and  found that he could predict up to eight days in advance with 90 percent accuracy when healthy  people would start getting sick.  But how does he know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is it?  Somebody says, oh, my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they probably use the word flu and he is doing geographic analysis of that.  So how would he know ahead of time?  Because they're not sick yet.  But it spreads.  It's going from one place to the next.  So he's looking at the, what do you call it?  Yeah.  Vectors.  Vectors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Vectors.  Wow.  That is that is really cool.  That is really cool.  There's and there's also a web application called found dot I.N.  That gives you health insights in real time.  Analyze health at scale through A.I.  Wow.  Wow, that's really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's value in all of our data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Big data, baby.  My app.  Yes, you already know is the new YouTube for I.O.S.  Google needed to do this because Apple pulled the YouTube app from I.O.S.  six.  I think it's a lot better, frankly.  And, you know, it needed to be updated.  I've logged in.  So this is this is from my account.  So it's showing stuff that are in my feeds and people I follow and so forth.  That's kind of handy, too, because, you know, I follow Jerry Ellsworth.  So I've subscribed to her and we're going to start taking advantage of this, by the way.  We're going to have our own Twig channel.  We're never own channel for all of which shows so that people can follow Twig.  And then if you're using the YouTube app, it'll show up right here inside your channels that you're following.  And there's also, you know, from YouTube, the popular channel.  So you can see Demi Lovato gets owned by Next Factory Steams.  Brittany Spears learns.  Oh, this should be good.  Oh, boy.  Britney Spears learns how to dance Gangnam style.  I haven't watched that while.  Anyway, that's the new YouTube app.  This is actually an iPhone app, which we're demonstrating on an iPad.  But, you know, it blows up fine on the iPad as well.  Let me just jump ahead and see if she's going to learn how to dance Gangnam style.  Oh, my gosh, it's Si.  Oh, there he is.  Wow. You know, you miss one day of Ellen and you miss so much.  Thank goodness for YouTube.  We'll just save that for an exercise for later.  Father Robert Balliser now on Ellen.  How do I stop it?  Stop.  Because I know everybody's now rushing to YouTube and they've forgotten about this show.  Thank you, Gina Trippani.  Congratulations.  Think up.com, the new website.  Thank you very much.  Blogs at SmarterWear.org.  And it's always good.  Always good to have you on the show.  We appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I loved watching your coverage as it went.  Thank you.  Did you like the puppet show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was really good.  Jury was out on the puppet show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've got to have Sarah Puppet.  Sarah Puppet and Cook Puppet have to play.  Sarah was so unhappy.  The Cook Puppet was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to side with Sarah on everything else, but the Cook Puppet was great.  The Cook Puppet was OK.  OK, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you've got to do a Sarah Puppet now.  You have to have a war of puppets.
