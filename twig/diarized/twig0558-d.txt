Jeff Jarvis, Leonard Taub Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  You like my mask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're going to regret that that song recorded now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You feel like it looked like Hannibal Lecter in Silence and the Lambs?  That's what I said, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think Stacey beat me with a better...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Stacey Higginbotham of Stacey on IOT.com and the Stacey IOT newsletter and the IOT podcast with Kevin Toffle.  And Stacey thought I was wearing my tighty whities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does. It looks like tighty whities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is an Etsy mask.  This is not, I cannot take credit for this mask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You wouldn't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it's, you know what?  It squishes you.  I'm working on a new design that doesn't squish your nose so much  and combines the electrostatic properties of silk with the filtering properties of high thread count cotton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you're doing this on your own?  Or are you going to a site to design it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, no, you get patterns.  But you can get a variety of patterns and then modify them.  For instance, the pattern I was using had a third layer for filter.  But I'm now increasingly of the belief that if I have the high thread count cotton and the silk,  I don't need a filter layer.  And that really complicates not only the manufacture,  but the breathing and the washing.  So the whole thing, it's better just to, if we can just get it to work.  But anyway, hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Welcome back, Stacey.  We missed you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Glad to be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feels like there's less and less to talk about.  Maybe it's not that there's less to talk about.  I'm less and less interested.  It's like, it feels like I'm looking at the tech world to the wrong side of the binoculars.  It's receding in its importance.  But it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's becoming more a part of our lives in every way.  And today, Governor Cuomo, America's governor,  appointed Eric Schmidt to a blue ribbon panel.  That's so bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it is and it isn't.  Last week, there was a story about how Eric Schmidt was becoming  the primary liaison between the Department of Defense and Silicon Valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, this rehabilitation or repositioning of Eric Schmidt is decidedly weird.  I agree.  Is he going to run for president in like 10 years?  Because that's what this feels like, the toe into public service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to see Schmidt versus Zuckerberg.  That'll be an interesting race.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eric Schmidt, for those who don't know, but I'm sure you all do,  he was the adult supervision brought in by the founders of Google,  Larry Page and Sergey...  What's his name?  Brynn.  Brynn.  See, it's receding, I'm telling you.  And was the CEO of Google for a long time until Larry Page took the job back a few years ago  saying we don't need adult supervision anymore.  And then, of course, shortly after that, Larry Page said, oh, screw it.  And he's gone.  But Eric has been looking for stuff to do ever since.  He is a technical advisor to Alphabet, which sounds to me like just a stipend.  Just keep the money coming.  Yeah.  And chair of the US Department of Defense's Defense Innovation Advisory Board.  But he's now, he's got a job along with Bill Gates to help New York rebuild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rebuild.  He was controversial a few years ago because he was brought in to advise on education  and people were scared of, oh my God, technology, computers and education.  Well, that changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There they are touring a school, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He also, he said, Schmidt said today, I respect Eric.  I think Eric's very smart.  And, you know, he knows his stuff.  And he's going to talk about telehealth and education and government services.  And, you know, what I want to see, because I want to happen in New Jersey too,  I want to become Estonia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He wants the digital citizenship and digital passports and all of the services they offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you don't have to be an Estonian to get that, actually.  You can get that anywhere.  Yeah, you can in Estonia.  I was glad I didn't because they had a bug which caused them to have to reissue all million,  all whatever, three million of them.  Oh, no, really?  Yeah, that was a couple of years ago.  There was a security flaw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was almost going to apply for it myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the point?  It doesn't get you the health care, unfortunately.  It gets you everything but the good stuff.  So, here's where I think it's a good idea.  I don't know if Schmidt's the right guy or Bill Gates is the right guy.  I think it is a good idea during this pause to really think about what we could do better.  And if you're New York State, absolutely, it's an opportunity to,  and this is what he's supposed to do, rethink education, health care,  the economy and the school system.  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  With technology.  Yeah, well, the presumption is with technology because it's Eric Schmidt.  Bill Gates Foundation, chosen to revolutionize online learning for the fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's controversial because the Gates Foundation loves one view of education  in Common Core curriculum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they've been funding stuff that not everybody agrees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of Common Core and some people don't like Common Core and it's very controversial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every teacher I talk to hates Common Core.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Part of that is because we don't give, I think it'd be fine if Common Core was like the base,  but they don't have the time and the resources to go beyond that  and Common Core really constrains them in the environment.  Like if they had half the kids in the class and they had maybe more time in the classroom.  Fund it better, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Bill Gates in his annual letter earlier this year wrote,  when it comes to US education, we're not seeing yet seeing the kind of bottom line impact we expected.  This is why you do not want a businessman to be planning your education.  You want an educator to do it.  Excuse me, pardon me.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, if the goal of education is to, but okay, he's not saying he's using bottom line,  but is he actually talking about profit and loss or is he saying, look, our metric is to create citizens?  I mean, because education is to create well-rounded critical thinkers who can participate in democracy, right?  That's the old school version, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And somewhat to prepare them for the job market and life ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and I think the ability to think critically is probably more important now  and the ability to make decisions is more important.  And right now our education doesn't really reflect that.  And that's probably a big problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the other problem, speaking to somebody in the lectern at a school,  is there should be an opportunity for us to rethink our classes.  What is done outside the class?  What is done in the classroom virtual or real?  How do we offer support and kind of genius bars, which I've wanted to create for years?  How do we do pre-learning, pre-classroom and all that?  The problem right now is every teacher is saying, the train's left the station.  I got to figure it out right now and all they're going to do is replicate.  So you do need something considered from the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does more technology help education?  I've always felt like they're orthogonal.  I mean, obviously with remote learning, you got to have technology,  but it's not going to be that way forever.  And I would hate to see what we're doing now be written in stone  because, oh, well, as we got to do remote education, let's just make that the permanent future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but it's probably there is definitely value in saying  and taking a look at what's happening in education right now with remote learning  saying this works, this doesn't work.  This is where we've had challenges and this is how we can add it to.  I think we're going to have to have some sort of remote learning  not just because of currently being quarantined,  but also because we might not be able to travel as well.  So being able to communicate over a screen is going to become important.  Being comfortable with this.  Oh, go on, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was agreeing with you.  That's all.  I just said, good point.  What just happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jasmine Gripper, Executive Director of the Public Education Advocacy  Organization Alliance for Quality Education,  released a statement in response.  At present, where available, technology is serving an essential purpose  in providing some educational access for children to safely learn during this crisis.  But we cannot allow online education to supplant efforts  to get them back into schools with teachers once the crisis passes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but the teachers, how at risk do you want to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, once the crisis passes.  Okay, so two years from now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That could be a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that could literally be two years.  It would be so sad to me if that's, I mean, I think that that is substandard education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It depends.  I mean, I think it's a different experience,  and I think you would have to augment that type of education in different ways.  So if you're always doing this, then you have to think about,  okay, what are the outside experiences that you need to build for kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a little experience with this because our son has been on an online high school for the last year.  It's called Connections Academy.  It's a public school.  It's funded by the California State because it's a charter school.  His teachers are all online.  We have intentionally, Lisa has intentionally supplemented it with in-person tutors,  obviously until recently,  and other social activities trying to make it a more well-rounded experience.  But I'll give you an example that happened today.  Michael wrote, I thought, a great paper about being a teenager during the COVID crisis.  It was really good.  He did it with a tutor that he's been going to for a long time.  They have a good relationship with.  They worked together on it.  He submitted it to the online school,  and the teacher said, F, zero, you uploaded it wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's just, well, I get the same thing.  You didn't follow the grid.  He did, by the way.  He did, right.  That has nothing to do with technology.  It doesn't matter.  It's an a-hole teacher, period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but it just gives a-holes a better opportunity to be an a-hole.  No, it doesn't.  She'd find ways to ding a mother in real life, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I will say, I'm not a fan of this,  but it does teach you a lot about life and general unfairness.  That's what Lisa did with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you're very right.  It was a teaching moment, right?  Lisa said, you're going to have bosses and other teachers  who are going to be like this.  This is how people are sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or just filing your taxes.  This is why you don't wait till the last minute to file your taxes.  Because what if the website's down?  It's not like you can call the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He did do it, right.  We verified it.  It was her, whatever her issue was.  Well, and then he gets the chance to go and argue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's, I need your help on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's an educational issue we have with my school.  Talking with the dean just yesterday, who you met.  So she's trying to figure out how to do distancing in the space.  Everybody has, everybody who has any kind of space is doing that.  And what's acceptable and what's not.  And she said, the thing that hits me is the bathrooms.  And one issue is, can people be in at the same time or not?  We have, in the men's we have two urinals and two stalls.  Should you be that close or not?  That's one issue.  How do we have a signaling system?  But the second is cleaning the surfaces.  So when I was in Davos years ago, I think I showed this video on the,  I can't find my video, but I showed a version of this video on the show.  At the bottom of other where it belongs is video of a self-cleaning toilet seat.  Now we need this and I can't figure out, I can't see anybody else doing the same thing.  Are you going to get in trouble for that video?  It has no sound.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have them in San Francisco, but the whole room seals off.  It's a French toilet.  The whole room seals off and the whole thing is disinfected.  Alright, I mean, look, this is trivial.  The more important thing is, are we going to let this crisis change education?  Jasmine Gripper also said, Hurricane Katrina spelled the end of public schools in New Orleans,  which never reopened after the storm.  That's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well that was because of physical destruction of them.  It's different.  We have a neutron bomb that's come through here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Up-to-date technology is an essential classroom tool,  but it will never replace the face-to-face interactions and relationships  with caring teachers that form the bedrock of a child's education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No one is trying to say that it won't.  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bill Gates and Eric Schmidt might well be.  No, what they're trying to say is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you make better use of the tools available  and we're still acting like it's 1540 sitting in a classroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was advisor to my kid's high school.  I was on the board of trustees  and it was a one-to-one high school where they gave laptops to every entering freshman.  But most of the good teachers said,  laptops closed when you entered the door.  And it was about an interaction.  And they thought I would be all promoting all this new technology.  I said, no, no, no, there's nothing to replace.  They don't know you're contrarian self.  Well, there's just nothing to replace a teacher.  No one's saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, yeah, we're not saying that.  And I will say, so no one's replacing a teacher.  No one's saying that all remote learning is the best learning.  I don't think anyone really wants to do that.  But given the exigencies, exigencies?  Sure.  Of the current time.  You're just showing how educated you are.  Showing off my erudite high-end?  No.  Given what's going on,  you have got kids they have to access remotely.  And how, one,  how can they do that in a way that allows them to have an interaction?  And I think my daughter's school has really done actually a very good job.  They have the kids come on for like a 15-minute lesson.  They break them up into groups on Zoom.  And the kids work together on projects.  And they meet again.  And the time is still allocated.  So they have to be working on their, you know, inside the Google Docs.  So people can talk to them and see them.  But it doesn't,  there's no getting rid of a teacher.  And eventually they will hopefully go back to the teacher.  They may go back at weird times.  They may not all be in the same place at the same time because of social distancing.  But no one's saying like an AI is going to teach your kids via...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but I would say we should be really cautious at this moment  when you get somebody like Bill Gates and Eric Schmidt  reforming you on what the future of education should look like.  That it is not going to be a hands-on experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not true.  No, the Google guys, Eric Schmidt may not have been,  but it's Sergey and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's not on the board.  Sergey and Larry are not on the board.  But they are not yet into Sory trained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they really push that at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but no, Eric, no.  So Leo, let me give you an example.  So we waste classroom time,  and this is a graduate school,  but we waste classroom time right now saying  this is how you use Final Cut.  Pick a tool, right?  And then hit this button, then hit that button,  then do this, then do that.  It would be far better taught, number one, on video.  And there's tons of great things like Linda out there that teach that.  Number two, when I was toying with Dean Shipps some years ago,  I wanted to create Genius Bars.  Where the student can pick their means of learning.  Here's the outcome.  Here's what you need to learn.  Pick your means of learning.  Get help whenever you get stuck.  When you hit the outcome, then you can move ahead.  And then classroom time can be used at a much higher level.  I've taught these tools where you have 20 students in a class,  15 students in a classroom.  One person has a problem.  Nobody else has that problem.  Everybody else waits while you deal with one student's problem.  Which you've got to do, but it means it's incredibly inefficient learning.  And the classroom lecture structure is not right for that.  So my point is, hybrid learning,  some things are better taught at your own speed,  in your own way, with your own help.  Other things are best taught together.  And we've got to learn how to separate those things.  And this is an opportunity.  We're going to lose this opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All I'm saying is I would far prefer to see educators in this conversation  than tech executives.  They'll scream their way into it.  They better.  Because I don't think tech executives are very well equipped to talk about education.  I think educators should be consulted on this, not tech executives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's the other issue.  So we said going into the fall, I hope I'm not revealing anything,  I'm on a committee about justice at my school.  And I have long cursed at Blackboard,  and I won't use Blackboard, nobody in our faculty will use Blackboard.  But some teachers, now if you're distant,  you need to have some standard structure to say,  here are the assignments, here's where you put it,  here's how you get the grade if you graded,  da da da da da, right?  Here's the syllabus.  So we kind of agreed, we've got to pick one.  And there's lots of good options out there.  We had no time, the school already has a contract,  so okay, it's Blackboard.  I would far prefer to have had some resource  to say here are the goals for a classroom learning management system,  and to have smart people say here are some options for us.  But we didn't have any options because we just basically had one in the end.  It's the default.  So if they do their job well, they can present tools.  Now if all they do is sell us windows, that's not too bad.  I'm just sick of the fetishizing of billionaires

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thinking that they somehow have some magic key to the way the world works.  And well, we've got to get the billionaires.  They've got Michael Bloomberg in there,  they've got Eric Schmidt in there,  they've got Bill Gates in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bloomberg has been the mayor of New York,  so he's dealt with the teachers unions very notoriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bloomberg's going to be doing contact tracing.  I don't know if he has a whole lot of experience with contact tracing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, but Bill Gates has proven himself to be intellectually curious  about far more than technology.  I agree.  He funds a lot of education.  So I think the key, and I think this going forward just in general,  is people need to value creativity, curiosity,  in a spirit of inquiry in a way that historically we haven't.  And we have to do this because the world is going to change very quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. This is a huge opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And these are people who successfully mastered those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think billionaires are warped personalities  and should not be allowed in any public capacity.  Oh, you just sound like, what's his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't live in the real world.  They don't live in a normal world.  They have no experience with the normal world.  And if they did, it was many years ago,  and it does not somehow give them qualifications.  They just know how to make a lot of money.  That is, to me, the worst qualification for any of this.  Well, welcome to my world.  Well, I understand.  That's a massive flaw.  And then you get Jeffrey Epstein funding MIT.  But the alternative is to tax the hell out of them,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which sounds good, but then it goes into government,  and I don't want Donald Trump making these decisions.  Sorry, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I was going to say people also listen when they call.  And I would say that both Bill Gates and Eric Schmidt  and Mike Bloomberg even,  are very comfortable calling on people  who are smarter than them and listening to them.  They respect knowledge.  And I think we're seeing right now  how detrimental it is when you don't have people  in positions of authority or power  who don't respect knowledge.  Is that a low bar?  100% it is.  But even if they've made a lot of money,  they still have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just would like to see people with expertise in these areas  be the leaders of these groups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are terrible leaders.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the president's son-in-law  and the stories in the Washington Post today and yesterday  exactly proved your point.  Take a bunch of well-meaning amateurs.  I'm a growth hacker.  I know how to do this.  And they screwed up the process royally.  So that's where you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel like it's a lesson we've learned.  There's such an opportunity here  to really, it won't happen, I know,  to address all of the fractures in our society  that this COVID has brought to the fore.  Income inequality, underfunding of healthcare,  underfunding of education.  There's all sorts of things that are coming up  because this has put a spotlight on them.  To bring in billionaires to solve it  seems like to bring a firebug in to put out a fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So don't look at them as billionaires.  Look at them as business people.  And I think there is a value  in someone having to make hard decisions.  Because every good CEO, not the crabby ones,  but they have to take conflicting goals and priorities  and figure out which direction to go.  So your experiences in listening to people  who know what they're talking about,  who are advocating for their side,  and then coming up with either a compromise  or saying, nope, we're definitely doing this.  And when you think about governments  and you look at things like historical revolutions,  what you've seen are people who maybe make it all the way  and then can't do that.  They can't abandon maybe some of their goals  to actually function in society.  So in some ways, a successful businessman,  or woman, let's just throw that out there,  business person, is able to evaluate  and make those tough choices,  which is a skillset that we don't,  we as an electorate, as people, as individuals,  hate to make tough choices.  But it's hard.  And that's kind of one reason we're here.  Because we hate it so much that we'll just,  instead of thinking about the nuances,  we're like, ah, this tribe or this tribe.  And then we get nowhere.  Anyway.  And here's another piece too, Stacey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on the business piece, but I think you're right,  then we're fetishizing, to use Leo's word right now,  opening up, getting back to normal.  Getting back to normal.  It's gonna kill people.  What we should be doing is figuring out  how to do as much business as possible  given the circumstances we have now.  And there's a lot of things we could be doing.  One.  Point two is we also need to be looking  at what the future is gonna be like after this.  On this Gallup call today,  they said they talked to one major insurance company  that is gonna tell every employee  who absolutely does not have to be in the office  to not come back to the office until 2021.  They've already stretched out there.  You're gonna see a lot of companies that are saying  I'm reconsidering real estate.  In the short term, I've gotta have fewer people  in the space.  In the long term, I don't need all this space.  I know of one major company,  I won't say which one,  but one we talk about sometimes,  that has been surveying employees  to say, hmm, if you didn't have to come  to the office all the time, where would you live?  Right.  And so we're gonna change things pretty radically.  And for some people, it's not a bad thing.  I live out here in the Sylvan Woods.  Maybe I stay out here most days.  I was a stupid professor who went in every day.  Maybe that was dumb.  I don't know.  It could affect people's lives for the better  in the long run, but there will be tools needed.  There will be structures needed.  And right now what we're doing is just saying  this will all end pretty soon, we don't know when.  And then everything's gonna be back the way it was.  False, wrong, not gonna happen.  Life has changed for at least a decade.  And then by the time you change it that much,  you're not gonna go back.  So I think we need advice.  Now, should the business people be the head  of the committee?  That's interesting.  Should it be instead a scientist?  Should it instead be somebody else?  I don't know.  But should they be there?  I agree with Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do wonder if work from home is gonna become  the status quo.  Why didn't we do that sooner?  We had the capability.  And it would save money on gas, travel,  real estate, control?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Control.  Companies didn't want to end.  I mean, it is a risky thing to say  don't come into the office.  Not everybody.  And again, like, what is it?  60% of people so far are like, I love it.  And there are still 40% of people who are like,  I miss people.  Well, a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think you do both, right?  You might love it.  You might love the freedom,  but it's hard to concentrate on that.  You know how to do it.  We're the wrong people to ask  because we're introverts.  We work from home, most of us.  We're the wrong people to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's also, some jobs can't be done remotely.  And that's worth talking about  or thinking about.  And I also think as we go back,  we've got some really interesting issues  that are gonna come up about  who is responsible for enforcing things  like social distancing or wearing masks in the office  because we're gonna have to set up these policies  and people being people are gonna violate them  unwillingly or unknowingly.  And historically, we've had pretty weak HR representation  for people who are kind of problematic.  Haven't we though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most big offices have a safety person,  a designated safety person who's responsible.  That's just to get you to the stairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's just a person who will report to someone.  Is it HR?  Does your HR department...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but their job is also to get you to the stairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the poor schlub who forgot to run away  when they went around looking for volunteers.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that guy has a job now  for not only getting you to the stairs

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but getting you to wear your mask.  That person is gonna be the bathroom monitor  and literally make sure that there aren't too many people  in the bathroom  and literally make sure it's cleaned up  and who's gonna do that?  Do you have somebody go in after every use?  What does this mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, Jeff.  There's stuff right now.  So what happens is...  Jeff is over concerned about the cleanliness

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of the bathroom.  It is an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you said that, I was like, crap.  Because you remember how...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the one place we all come together.  Well, not at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We all end up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other place that's equally problematic  maybe more so is our company kitchen.  We told everybody there's no food there.  Take it all home if you want any of it.  But you're no longer to use the company kitchen  because that's another place people congregate  and leave germs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're gonna have to have bigger break rooms  where people can sit six feet apart.  Well, how do you do a meeting?  That was the weirdest thing  when I went to the doctor's office.  The elevators...  I hadn't thought about this  but elevators, they have little...  Only four people could get on an elevator at a time.  Face the other way.  Face the corner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they had little signs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  telling you to face this way.  You would stand at a corner and do this.  But yeah, it was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our stairways, we're on the third and fourth floor  of our building.  Our stairways, we can't use.  And the dean's gonna fight hard  for us to be able to use them again  because otherwise...  Right now, we wait forever for the elevators.  We cram in them.  If you were gonna do this right,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you'd rethink a lot of things.  Everything should be up in the air  because A, the elevator is gonna be up in the air  A, this is probably gonna happen again in our lifetime  and B, this is an opportunity to do it a little bit better.  Do it right to start over.  Yes.  Not that that's gonna happen  but it is an opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have talked to people about Madame A in elevators.  So you say, Madame A...  Don't touch a button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I bought those silly things on Instagram.  I haven't got it yet.  The brass...  The knuckles?  You did buy it.  Yeah, I bought two of them.  One for me, one for Lisa.  So you press the elevator button  and it's a little brass thingy you keep on your keychain  or actually what I'm gonna do is keep it on my belt  with one of those things that Snyder used to have.  The new definition of nerd, yeah.  You can open doors with it.  You can push buttons with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can wear it around your neck with your employee ID.  No, I don't want to because it's dirty.  It's filthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  Right, okay.  Gotta keep it away from my face.  Yeah, I mean, you know, the hopeful thing is  here's a chance to rethink everything.  Remember when Marissa Meyer took over as CEO at Yahoo,  what's the first thing she did?  All you guys working from home, you're coming in.  Right, right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that is very much a control thing.  You do have to learn how to work remotely  and some jobs are better suited for it.  Like I would have probably failed  if I didn't have to turn in a story every two hours, right?  Right.  So that got me...  I mean, people on really long-term projects,  you know, you're going to end up with people,  the people who actually did their term papers  over time as opposed to the night before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're one of them.  You would do your homework.  I'm not, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a journalist core all the way.  Like I don't work until the deadline is like...  Me too, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never always do my best work on deadline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then your editor is like,  hey, what about that story?  It's due in an hour.  And you're like, I'm just tweaking it for you,  which means I'm starting it right now.  I'm writing it now.  Right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I learned how to be,  pardon me for the sexism of this title,  rewrite man on newspapers way back when we had that.  You'd take, you had the headset phone on,  you'd get all the notes for the reporters in the field,  and then you'd write.  Is that how you started?  Yeah.  That's so cool.  And so then we wrote on half books.  That's so front page of you.  Oh, it's very front page.  So we wrote on half books.  I've described this to you before.  It was a half sheet of paper.  And so you could put one paragraph on.  And you had like the whole bunch of carbons,  carbon paper children's,  we made copies.  And you'd type with an ice pick to get it out.  And then you tear it out on the typewriter  and you'd scream, copy!  I love that.  I just love that.  And some kid who's six months younger than me  would come and try to roll around  and take the thing around, right?  Those were the days, man.  The first paragraph was being typeset  as I'm writing the sixth paragraph.  We'll go through the process.  So I learned how to write fast.  There is a discipline to that, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it was very much discipline.  Mistake-free, right?  You can't make a mistake.  So my first use of a computer,  I was the only person in the Chicago Tribune

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  who used them, was 1973.  That's how old I am, 1974.  And they had computers in the early 70s?  They had computers in the early 70s?  We did, we did.  We were the only first.  I didn't know it was a scab system.  I taught the entire newsroom what a cursor was.  But it changed how I wrote.  My point finally, finally,  is my rewrite me said, write it all through  and then take every minute you have to edit it.  Right.  So it completely changed the way I thought and operated.  So yes, Stacey, I'm still tweaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still think that's a better way to do it, though.  Write it all through and then go back.  It is, it is.  Yeah.  Now I'm trying to do it with a book.  You can't get stuck on paragraph one for hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you can't get stuck on paragraph one  if you're writing news.  Paragraph one writes itself.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who, what, when, where, why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm like, unless you're doing a feature,  which is a totally different style of writing.  I could spend hours on the lead alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just like writing on leads.  Oh my God.  I wrote a lead just the other day.  You don't have a lead, you don't have a story.  You don't have a story.  I used it.  You don't have a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.  I used to have a journalism professor  who would tell us that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wrote a lead the other day  that had three cliches in one sentence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trying to set a record.  All unrelated, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it hurt me, but I had to cut them out.  Let's take a little break, come back.  There's lots more.  I am, I am honestly,  something has happened to me over the last few days  where I've lost the will to live.  So I don't really care about any of this stuff.  So I'm going to let you guys  pick the stories you want to talk about.  Because I'm just, I'm fading away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacy is looking quite shocked and worried right now.  I'm fading away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What can we do for you?  Maybe Jeff, you can help me.  Was there ever a point in your life where you just went,  oh, I just turned old?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I went straight from wunderkind to old fart.  With nothing in between.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That happened on Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe you're depressed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and you should take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm definitely depressed.  I can't take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aunt can come and host the show where Jason for a little bit.  Take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I have to come and do my show.  This is what I was made to do.  I'm going to die in this chair.  Fortunately, I have nice big wings for my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, the problem is you're saying you're angry and depressed,  but you have happy voice broadcast.  That's my job.  I should always sound happy and smiley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You write the whole article before editing.  I smile the whole way through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a good time to take a break, even just for a week.  You can't fight through this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to Germany in two weeks for the Oberammerkauf Festival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That might have something to do with it.  That's off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't focus on that.  Go find something to look forward to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a big deal.  The only issue is I look at these stories and I go,  oh, who cares?  It's less important than it used to be.  I'm looking through the wrong end of the binoculars.  It's like, oh, Google Australia.  Do you really care?  Do you really care about the revised publisher code process in Australia?  We should talk about it, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you don't care, then people are not going to listen to your show.  We have to find things that matter to all of us.  They don't care either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're just as depressed as I am.  He didn't care about the toilet either.  I thought he'd get into the toilet.  He didn't care.  He just dismissed it.  He flicked it off.  I care about cleaning toilets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I care about Pixel Buds.  Oh, we're talking about that, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look, you got them already.  How'd you get them so fast?  Oh, we're talking about that.  How'd you get them so fast?  We're talking about that.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I'm excited.  Something very shiny to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Toys.  All right.  See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stay tuned for toys.  We have something to talk about.  Oh, wait, and we haven't shared my news.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, and Stacey has.  Is that a tease or does that?  No, no, save it.  That's a tease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's got some very good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm trying to help Leo out since he's lost the will to live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have lost the will to live, but Stacey is bringing a new life into the world.  So that's very exciting for all of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, God.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's not the news.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Next.  Next.  Turn the page.  As Paul Harvey would say, page two.  Page two.  Our show today brought to you by LastPass.  I do love my LastPass.  I love me some LastPass.  I've been setting up new computers recently and I note at new phones, the first thing  I do, I install LastPass because that is going to facilitate everything else I do in setting  up the computer.  LastPass is more than just my personal password manager, though.  In fact, we use LastPass Enterprise at Twitter and I am so glad we do because we have a lot  of employees at home, almost all of them.  That's your remote workforce is now a big part of your business.  The minute they go remote, they become a security risk.  They're no longer in the office.  They're no longer protected by the office network.  Fortunately, with LastPass, the transition from in-office to in-home has been easy.  LastPass lets our IT team still be the gatekeeper.  IT is in complete control over which employees are accessing which resources.  That's important.  Employees have the keys to the kingdom.  They have the bank accounts.  They have the databases, the websites.  Everything we do, the employees have passwords and access to, but LastPass keeps control.  We know who is doing what with what.  We've got unified visibility over both access and authentication.  We don't use a lot of SSO apps.  I wish we did because I love single sign-on.  LastPass has 1,200 plus single sign-on apps.  They're better than passwords because it's just a click on the phone.  The employees love it and you'll love it because it's more secure.  I want to use more of them, but we use so many custom apps we just don't have them.  If you have that opportunity, man, that's great.  There's Amazon, there's Salesforce.  It's just so much easier.  They're also, of course, the best password management in the world.  In fact, the vault is so secure, decrypted only at device level that I put everything  in it.  LastPass doesn't have the keys.  LastPass can't see it.  Only I can see it.  So I put my passports.  Not that I'll ever need them again.  My social security number, I might be needing that.  Driver's license.  Everything's in LastPass.  I love LastPass.  Because your employees are going home, they may not have the same high quality bandwidth  they have at work.  LastPass even offers an offline mode.  Both for password management and multi-factor authentication.  So even if their spotty Wi-Fi is getting in the way, they'll still have authentication.  They'll have access to their passwords and all the data in there.  And as I said, we're putting so much valuable data in there besides just passwords.  It's important.  Those secure notes are fantastic.  Makes it easy for your team to collaborate.  We're all doing Zoom calls.  We're all collaborating.  We're working online.  LastPass lets remote employees securely share passwords across teams so they can stay on  top of critical projects.  The average business, I just read this on the LastPass blog, has 185 shared folders.  That's crazy.  Businesses really need to consider implementing policies and tracking reports on shared password  activity to make sure employees are operating securely.  And you can do that with LastPass.  The IT department does not give up control.  You get seamless collaboration with coworkers.  It's easy for the workers, the employees, but you still have that security that you  need.  And with all these phishing attacks, you'll be very glad to know LastPass never auto fills  passwords on suspicious websites.  And if you've got employees using VPNs, as we do, LastPass adds an additional layer of  security directly to your VPN through biometric multi-factor authentication.  We're going to do an event with LastPass just a couple of weeks, May 14th, not even two  A week from Thursday, a week from tomorrow, 1pm Pacific.  It's a presentation.  We were going to do this in person.  Obviously, we'll be streaming, but that means you all get to see it.  Cybersecurity and identity trends unlocked.  I'll be moderating a panel, including Steve Gibson, the great Andrew Kean.  He is a hoot.  And Gerald Buchelt, the CISO from LogMeIn.  It's Thursday, May 14th, 1pm Pacific.  You can watch our live panel at twit.tv slash live, but it will also put it on our Twitter  events feed so you can watch later.  We're going to talk about this changing universe that we're in and how that's going to impact  digital identity for businesses, for individuals.  It's going to be fascinating.  May 14th, a week from Thursday, twit.tv slash live.  LastPass, thank you, LastPass, for supporting everything we do here.  You'll get simple security access across every access point with LastPass.  If you're not using it quick, go to lastpass.com slash twit and find out how LastPass can help  your business employees stay productive and secure.  Lastpass.com slash twit.  Thank you, LastPass.  Here we are in the twit LastPass.  Yay, LastPass.  I'm setting up a studio at home, but I'm going to bring a LastPass Studio sign.  I'm going to have the LastPass remote studios in my house.  Do you think you might start doing it from home?  It's a backup.  But I have all ... You know what's funny?  What do we spend, John?  Probably almost a million dollars on gear, on cameras, on Tricasters.  I don't know, a ton of ... More than that?  Yeah, a lot of money.  I'm sorry, it's Jeff behind that.  But it's expensive.  Nowadays, $300, I got an ATEM Mini.  I mean, it's so cheap.  I have a switcher, a hardware switcher.  I've got multiple cameras.  I'm going to bring some lights home.  And I've got an effect ... By the way, the switcher, the ATEM Mini, I just found out  has some of the best keying.  It has ultimate keying built into it.  So I could set up a green screen.  And you wouldn't know, I might be there right now.  What room are you going to do it in?  My den, my office, my home office is perfect for it.  I took out some of the furniture.  I've ordered a work table that looks kind of steampunky.  It's going to be great.  I'm looking forward to it.  Got a real fireplace in there as opposed to ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want Cooking with Leo.  I want you to use your ... I want you to make Stacey jealous using the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see what we did on our after hours on Friday?  I wasn't involved because I thought it was too dangerous.  We did an Iron Chef cooking competition with Micah and Ant and Jason.  Andy Anoco and Mary Jo Foley were the judges.  But it was all virtual.  If you haven't seen it, go to youtube.com slash twit and see it.  It was hysterical.  So Anthony Nielsen, who produces a lot of our most creative stuff, gave them three secret  ingredients in a paper bag.  You ready for this?  Snails, nopalitos, what is that?  Pickled cactus.  It's prickly pear cactus.  In a jar.  And dragon fruit.  And then there was inside that a surprise fourth ingredient.  Dried beef.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've got to get at least two of the ingredients to work well together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were having fun.  It was actually ... They got one hour and then Anthony, who is also a sadistic son of a gun,  took 20 minutes out just in the middle saying, we're going to be done soon.  But everybody worked so hard.  Aunt was great.  Aunt had pork chops and his secret ingredient was butter.  And he was like, it was so great.  It was so cool.  What liquor did they all serve during this?  Aunt was doing whiskey.  Mary Jo Foley was drinking a really interesting mango sour.  She likes the beer.  I think Jason might have had some wine.  He had his two daughters, two young daughters helping him.  So maybe there wasn't any.  And I can't remember what Micah was drinking.  But Micah set up a crane cam and a table camera.  It was so fun.  This week, Friday at 4 PM Pacific, 7 PM Eastern time, we're going to do the match game.  It turns out Dick DiBartolo, who we love and has been with us since the beginning, almost 15 years.  But he's also been with Mad Magazine for more than 50 years.  But way back when Mark Goodson and Bill Todman had a game show called the match game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, have you ever heard of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jean Rayburn.  What you don't know is that the show was within inches of being canceled  because it was terrible.  It wasn't interesting at all.  The idea of the match game is you have a panel of famous...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think it was...  Did I have to get you to say the words?  That was password.  It was password.  No, no, no.  Match game was a Jean Rayburn with a long microphone.  You'd answer a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There'd be blanks.  Dumb Dora was so dumb.  That's right.  How dumb was she?  She thought a brick was...  Anyway.  And so...  But the reason it was almost canceled is because the questions weren't that interesting.  They were terrible.  They were just with a blank.  I had blank for breakfast today.  Dick said, look, let me write these questions.  I can make it funny.  Here's the story.  It's really incredible.  He saved the match game by creating dumb Dora and all of those sexy innuendo blank questions.  Dumb Donald?  He was even pressured.  He knew about Dumb Donald.  Dick saved that.  He still has original match game questions.  He still is the best writer of match games.  We are going to let Dick be the Jean Rayburn of our match game on Friday.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern.  Jeff, you've been on our after hours, but I don't think you have, Stacey.  Have you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're during FICA Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  We talked about that last two weeks ago.  FICA Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did do an AMA that was not during FICA Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've moved it to a bad time for you.  I'm sorry.  Anyway, it's going to be a lot of fun.  That's great.  See, I got excited about that.  Now, how did you get those Pixel Buds so fast?  They just came.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just came.  I ordered them as soon as they came up.  Only white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The first Pixel Buds.  That's really inactive fates because the first Pixel Buds were god awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And I'm wanting something like this.  I still use wired ones.  So, want the report?  Yeah.  So, they're small.  These are Bluetooth headphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're kind of like Apple's AirPods.  They don't have that string anymore connecting them.  And they go in a battery charging case, but they're bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They actually, they're bigger and they go in.  So, there's the usual three rubber thingies at the end.  I needed the big ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually like that.  The AirPods Pro do that now.  That makes a big difference.  It stays in the ear well.  And the base is better when they seal like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why is it?  What?  It was starting to play.  So, I can walk with them.  I can do things with them.  They didn't fall out because my ears do not work with.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, the Google voice assistant is in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you hold down your finger, I'm getting a Fiona Apple, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I love the new album.  Do you love it?  The new album?  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's great.  Killer.  What's it?  Better bring the bolt cutters.  Bolt cutters.  Break out of the closet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love Fiona Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, there's the good news.  They feel good.  They fit well.  They sound good.  So, and I put in the thing.  There's a huge Reddit thread.  If I'm sitting here using them, work fine.  Go outside.  Start walking.  For some strange reason, the sound will cut out.  In each one.  No sense.  It's not a Bluetooth issue, I'll bet.  There's something in it about how it's detecting in the ear.  I had the small rubber things at first.  I replaced them with the big so they'd seat firmly.  And I can walk for 10 minutes and it's fine.  Then suddenly it starts going crazy.  It's not where the phone is.  I can move the phone anywhere.  It doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  126 people on Reddit complaining of the same exact problem.  Now, here's the weird thing.  It's not a Bluetooth thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think so.  Might be ear detection.  No.  It's when you move.  I think it's ear detection.  When I had the smaller rubber thing, it was worse.  Since it's gotten awful.  So they had me.  I went on Twitter and I'm very nice about it.  They're being very nice.  I told them I was on the show today.  I said if you can get me a solution before the show,  it would be good.  But they haven't.  So yeah, I think it was something about the fitting.  And if you walk, it's not jostling or anything,  but it just gets whacked out.  Here's the other weird thing.  I think it probably has nothing to do with it.  But if I cup my hand over the ear,  I'm not touching it.  Just cupping it over, the sound will go off.  Move it away, sound goes back on.  Sound goes off.  So it's ear detection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or you could be blocking Bluetooth.  Do you have a metal hand?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is my portable Faraday cage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, Stacey, even the hand might be enough to...  Because that's probably separate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's probably nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, because when I mean, I have my jobbers in.  There are Bluetooth and that doesn't...  If I cup my hands over my ears, it doesn't do anything.  It doesn't do that?  I have to say...  Because when I'm walking outside, sometimes I'm like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really resent the tech companies pushed us to wireless headphones.  Google just as bad as Apple now.  You have to have a Bluetooth headphone for your Pixel 4.  Because I don't think Bluetooth is that good.  It's getting better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they updated the protocol just this last year to be better at audio codecs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they have new high quality...  Besides aptX, there's something else new, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so I...  What are my options here?  Hold on a second.  One second.  If you could come up with something...  So there's adaptive sound, which was off.  It adapts based on the...  So there's a little microphone here, obviously for the phone.  So it would use that.  Maybe that's off already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, the original Google Buds were terrible.  They were so awful.  Everybody had a problem.  Then there's in-ear detection.  And they never fixed it, by the way.  So there's in-ear detection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they just abandoned it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. That's one way to fix it.  That's right.  Screw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I turned that off. I haven't gone back out.  The problem is I have to go out for a walk to find out whether they work or not.  Like last night I went out after I resided.  I'm doing that every day.  It's good for you.  But I already did my walk. It's going to rain.  I'm too depressed to walk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I just go to bed early and get up late.  Oh, that's a drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't we schedule a walk or something and we'll get you out there?  Oh, you're so cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's very thoughtful of you.  It's okay. It's not your cross to bear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. But man, you know, you're in my friend orbit.  I've got to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. You think of me as a friend?  Now I'm really touched.  I really thought you hated my guts.  I don't hate your guts.  I just hate the part of me, but not all of me.  No, I'm very touched that you care enough to say snap out of it, LePorte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not trying to say snap out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm trying to say that you are an important person who should not feel this way.  And let's try to get you out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  LePorte depending on you.  Well, that's why I show up.  I show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Honestly, I think if I could just get a haircut, I think I feel so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So are you thinking?  I'm thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a question for you.  Isn't it getting to some people in the chairman saying the same thing?  I feel like it's starting to get to us.  We are now in our sixth week of a shutdown.  More than that, seventh week of shutdown in the Bay Area.  It's starting to get to me, but I don't want at the same time.  I don't want to go out there either.  So you're terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, here's what's terrifying is that I honestly believe it's a year and a half more of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with you.  And there's no evidence there will be a vaccine.  There's no vaccine for HIV.  There's no vaccine for the common cold.  There's no vaccine for SARS or MERS.  So there's no evidence that there'll be a vaccine.  But I don't want to depress anybody.  So maybe there will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if there is no vaccine, people are resilient.  We will come up with ways to do something.  It may not go completely back to normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some of us will move underground and the rest of you can get sick.  That's my plan.  I'm hanging with the billionaires.  I figured they've already started drilling.  By the way, what do you think of Elon Musk these days?  Speaking of...  Oh, yeah.  Are we only going to become that crazy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do you say his child's name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't.  No one has yet said.  Grimes published an exegesis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The baby formerly known as.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know what?  I'm not going to hold them to the fire on this because it's very likely.  Certainly, I have friends, celebrity friends who would never reveal their kids' names  because that's a bad thing to do.  So they tweeted that the baby's name was X in elitid AE, A-12.  They also tweeted a post of the baby with face tats.  Those aren't real.  Don't worry.  Grimes has broken it down.  I love it that Elon had a baby and Grimes had a baby.  Together they had a baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Elon has a lot of kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is his fourth, I think.  He has twins.  Sixth.  Sixth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought he had five children.  How many mates for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the first were just with his first wife.  Or maybe it was the same.  It was with a long-term wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Long-term wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's a picture of Grimes just to give you some idea where this comes from.  When she tweeted, she says X, the first initial, is the unknown variable.  Thank you.  AE, she says, is her elven spelling of AI, love and or artificial intelligence.  AI is love in Chinese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is his seventh child.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, seven.  That seems like a lot.  But he doesn't have to raise any of them, so it's different for him.  Some people pointed out this elitist A in E, or sometimes called an ash.  An ash.  I never knew what that was called.  Maybe the kid's name is really Ash.  And this is just a joke.  Because when they get to A-12, she says that's the precursor to the SR.  She wrote 17, which she meant 71, which of course is the Blackbird stealth fighter.  She says, our favorite aircraft, no weapons, no defenses, just speed.  Great in battle, but nonviolent.  And A as a secondary value, Archangel, my favorite song.  And X is metal rat, I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, Elon, his first child died.  Of SIDS at 10 weeks old.  And they were all with his first wife.  Oh, that's so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's terrible.  And he has five other sons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twins and a set of triplets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  Triplets and twins.  That's right.  Yeah.  He also managed to cut $3 billion out of his personal fortune by tweeting,  my stock's worth too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was just, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, that's fine.  I don't care.  You know what?  He's a billionaire.  He can do whatever he wants.  Would you go to Mars with this man?  I wouldn't even buy his car anymore.  This was actually a factor in my deciding not to own a new Tesla.  Yeah.  I just don't know if I could trust that company.  There seems so strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you don't trust any company these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or billionaires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to buy a Ford.  I trust Ford.  Ford is a real company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you decided what to buy next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, do I ever need another car?  Yeah, it's the Mustang Mach-E, the electric Mustang.  I have a deposit down on that.  But I also have a deposit down on a Model 3.  They keep calling me saying, you want it?  You want it?  You want to buy it?  You want to buy it?  We will any day now see the Apple Google Coronavirus API on our phones.  Apple's already got it out in the beta of iOS 13.5.  Some people are already sharing pictures of it and so forth.  They've released sample code.  Bruce Schneier wrote an interesting...  I don't know if you...  Do you guys know who Bruce Schneier is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Security expert.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of all the people in the world, besides Steve Gibson,  I really respect and trust Bruce Schneier.  He says, doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter.  He says, this is his post.  Me on COVID-19 contact tracing apps.  My problem with contact tracing apps is they have absolutely no value.  I'm not even talking about the privacy concerns.  I mean the efficacy.  Does anybody think this will do something useful?  It's just something governments want to do for the hell of it.  To me, it's just techies doing techie things because they don't know what else to do.  He says, there are two big problems, false positives and false negatives.  The end result...  I won't go into the details, but he does a pretty good job of saying why this is senseless.  The end result is an app that doesn't work.  People will post their bad experiences on social media.  People will read those posts, realize the app is not to be trusted.  The loss of trust is even worse than having no app at all.  The idea that contact tracing can be done with an app  and not human health professionals is just plain dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No one's saying it would be done without human health professionals.  Everyone says you must have the human health professionals in Legion.  The question is, does finding out you were...  Depends on what you were doing.  If you were in the store and you found out you were near somebody who had it,  it's meaningless to you.  But if you went to...  You know, a friend of mine has to go to a funeral.  If you find out two weeks later that the people there have it,  then yeah, that's going to be useful to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not the information you're going to get from the tracing app, by the way.  The only information you're going to get,  because of the way Google and Apple have figured this out,  is you'll get a notification saying,  at some point you were near somebody who had it,  you now need to quarantine for two weeks.  As Schneier points out, because of the Bluetooth technology,  you don't know if you were on the other side of the wall from that person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every New Yorker is going to be getting a message all the time.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so after a while, people are going to say,  look, I've been told to quarantine for the rest of my life.  I'm not going to do it because this isn't useful.  They're actually not going to tell you anybody's name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I said this like four weeks ago.  You were right.  You were right.  I talked about false positives and signal strength and how you won't know  how long you've been around someone.  Anyway.  You did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we kind of deferred it to perhaps that Apple had thought about this  and come up with some way of measuring the strength.  You were talking about strength of the signal and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But apparently Apple hasn't.  It's not.  It's not going to be.  It's a very typical.  This is kind of what I was talking about with Eric Schmidt.  Silicon Valley solution.  But doesn't come from a real world point of view.  In Silicon Valley, we think that technology can solve everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there is value for some of this in some places.  New York, maybe not.  More remote kind of areas, maybe.  Yeah, you're right.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, here it might be useful.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Again, it's technology.  When you understand how a tool works, you can design something that fits that tool.  So it's possible that you could algorithmically try to figure out time  and signal strength and variability.  But yeah, I'm just going to say that I am glad that this is now happening a couple of weeks later.  I want to be somebody who people listen to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were on, ladies and gentlemen, forget I mentioned Bruce Schneier.  Stacey's been saying this for weeks.  Now confirmed by Bruce Schneier and the Brookings Institution,  all of whom have raised exactly the issues you raised right from day one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the intercepted us.  Yeah, they talked to the founders of Bluetooth who all said the same thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because of the privacy fetishism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is not fetishism to want privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait till I finish.  Wait till I finish.  As a result, there's going to be no effort to have aggregated data.  And so that might be useful, at least at an aggregate level,  for government to know who's behaving and who's not,  where hotspots open up and that kind of stuff.  But they're not going to have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of governments.  Well, Australia wrote a similar app not using the Google Apple API  because they wanted the information.  But their app has to run in the foreground, kills your battery,  and you have to enter your location.  So the whole thing.  The problem is the same thing with the Singapore app, 25% adoption rate.  Nobody...  So you need humans.  You need contact tracers going out and doing that.  Yeah, absolutely.  Are we hiring a lot of them?  Is this in process?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's 100,000 people who have applied in New York.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Washington, DC is hiring them too.  But I was going to say you also need trust in the agencies implementing this  and gathering the information.  So right now, do I want to give Donald Trump's administration,  my as a journalist, my location all the time?  No.  You'd fall out of a window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The point I was trying to make is that that's the way it would be useful,  but nobody's going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then the same people don't have trust in Apple and Google.  So again, I'm going to go all the way back, back and say,  this is why we need to think privacy issues ahead of time when we connect things to the internet  and start touting all of this.  And we also need to build regulations that make sense and that people can trust in.  Else we can't do any of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's it.  Speaking of Australia...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is when I get depressed and I say, I don't care.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Australia has decided that Google is making money by putting snippets  from Australian news publishers in Google search and news.google.com.  And they're going to have to start ponying up or stop doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is very Murdoch and it means that Google will pull Google news out of Australia, I predict.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google said it's like charging the news agency for putting the broadsheet up in the window  as you walk by so you can say, oh, I should buy that paper.  That's an interesting... I want to read that story.  That's all they're doing.  They say in their blog post, they drive huge amounts of traffic to news sites.  24 billion times a month.  Globally, publishers want to be found by new users.  They want the traffic.  But we don't have ads on Google news and we don't think we should pay them any money  for access to this.  You're right.  So in the bottom of the official Google Australia blog, Next Steps,  the government's response to the digital platforms inquiry acknowledged the substantial  two-way value exchange between news media businesses and digital platforms.  We've worked closely and constructively with news media businesses,  the ACCC and the government.  No, they haven't.  And we'll continue to do so to ensure we can continue to support publishers.  This is meaningless.  This is anodyne boilerplate, if I ever saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you have France is screaming that they're going to...  Yeah, we don't care.  We're just giving up on life.  Australia did it.  It was over the edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm laughing at the idea of an anodyne boilerplate now.  Oh, what color is anodyne?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the name of my new band, my new punk rock band, the anodyne boilerplates.  Google is like a poster in the news agent windows for publishers.  This is from The Guardian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it does sound like Jeff.  Jeff's the only person who knows what a news agent is.  Actually, in England, they do know that.  They don't exist anymore.  In England, yeah, they used to.  But you remember...  Kiosks in Europe.  Kiosks, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't have newsstand type magazines, things on New York streets anymore?  Oh, it's all gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not anymore.  No, it's all gone.  In fact, Stacey, here's the amazing thing.  They do have newsstands.  Who the F designed them is beyond me.  The only place you can put the newspapers is on a shelf, right?  Where it's got a shelf on top of it and no one can read the headlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rupert Murdoch designed that to protect his intellectual property.  It's about there.  It's about there.  They used to have, in fact, even with the mechanical newspaper boxes,  they put the front page...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You cannot see the front page.  I never see the front page of the Daily News or the New York Post at all anymore.  Never, never.  And if you try to go out and buy a newspaper,  a lot of those newsstands have stopped selling newspapers.  So do you think Google will pull out of Australia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, is that really what they're saying?  They pulled out of Spain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They threatened to pull out of all of Europe.  Yeah, but that's not inside information.  Not that many people in Australia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's Australia's population?  It's just Google News.  Yeah, it's 30 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know something like that.  It's Google News.  It's fine to have.  The other one is not just Google News.  So Google News will pull out.  The other thing they would do is in search.  Fine, we won't do your snippet.  We'll tell you this paper has something and you're probably going to get a paywall when you get it.  So click at your own risk, sucker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah, there's 25 million people in Australia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Half of them are on the beach at any given time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I did.  I asked my nifty little Google, my G assistant that is right next to me.  How many people are in Australia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  24.99 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Oh, you Googled it too.  Yes, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, PewDiePie, how many millions of dollars did PewDiePie get?  Speaking of things to be sick of.  To sign an exclusive YouTube live streaming deal.  Felix Kjellberg, the prankster and video game blogger,  better known to fans as PewDiePie, has amassed more than 104 million subscribers  and generated over 25 billion views to date.  He apparently was making noise about going somewhere else, I guess.  Remember, YouTube ended his reign, their business deals three years ago over anti-Semitic jokes  and Nazi imagery.  He apologized.  He gave money to the Anti-Defamation League and then said, that was a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This does not speak well of YouTube's character.  Yeah, well, he is.  Keep coming back to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Last year, he was the most viewed YouTube creator, 4 billion video views.  So this is them acting in concert with their financial interest.  I know, I know.  What do you think though?  I probably gave him millions of dollars, right?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they probably gave him a guarantee.  Google does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's still like, yeah, it's like engagement.  They're like, hey, people sit and spend time with this, even though we think it's,  I assume they think it's crap.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't love this person.  Well, and Jeff, you've always been at pains to say we shouldn't judge  what people want to watch.  The content of YouTube is apparently very popular with certain people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just think that he's, do you want to put your brand right next to him?  Interlocking arms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some people do.  I will say with young people, maybe they'd mature and they'll mature relatively quickly.  I mean, I do try to give people who are young the benefit of the doubt because  we do stupid things when we're young.  We do stupid things when we're old too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, we keep doing them.  Yeah, we keep doing them.  Right, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now old people, we wasted it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  104 million subscribers.  You want to watch some PewDiePie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, let's not.  This is not worth getting our stream taken down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There he is, PewDiePie.  I won't play the sound.  He says, don't ever call me a Karen.  So Karen, apparently, I didn't know this until recently is what  some people call white women.  Is Karen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's white middle-aged women who are unaware of their privilege and demand and wave it  everywhere.  So let me speak to your manager is the quintessential Karen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the woman in front of you at the Botox doctor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  However, I will say it can be used to police women because the meme is so insidious and  they'll be like, oh, you're a Karen.  And I'm like, no, I am not a Karen.  That's what he's saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's saying the Karen meme has gone too far.  Stop it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the woke PewDiePie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think PewDiePie just, I mean, clearly-  I haven't watched him in years.  He doesn't care anymore.  He's sitting in pajamas on the floor.  This was put up yesterday.  No, today.  And it's already got 643,000 views.  Look, I read Mad Magazine when I was a kid and probably the same old farts that I am today  then said, oh, it's going to rot your brain.  You shouldn't eat Mad Magazine.  And I admit my entire cultural foundation came from Mad Magazine.  My understanding of humor and the world and all of that came from Mad Magazine.  Absolutely true.  And so I imagine there's a whole generation, including our son Michael, who's 17.  And I asked him the other day, you still watch PewDiePie?  I said, yes, sometimes.  He watches a YouTube video almost nonstop.  Even when he's gaming, he's got YouTube going in the background.  So it's always on.  And I'm sure that his cultural understanding of society and everything comes from YouTube.  And so I think-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, are you watching this?  Oh, sorry.  I was kidding.  Are y'all watching SGN?  Steven Krasinski or John Krasinski?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't he awesome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He got a couple of billionaires to surprise graduates with sage advice.  Oprah, Steven Spielberg.  Because graduates aren't getting a graduation, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Poor graduates.  Oh, no, everybody's trying to do this.  YouTube's doing it.  Facebook's doing it.  John's doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Before the episode prior, he got all of these.  He asked for recipes from people who watched the show.  And he got Momofogo, David Chang, Guy Fieri, and someone else to cook.  Wow.  To make the recipes.  And then he donated $3 million to Guy Fieri's, or he had Pepsi rather,  donate $3 million to Guy Fieri's fund for workers.  And it was very touching.  I mean, I don't love Guy Fieri, you know,  but watching him get that news and just reacting and just people being nice to each other.  We don't have enough of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was a parent at my kid's high school, and I really don't love Guy Fieri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's a story I shall keep to myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know what?  He's beloved on TV.  He's a great TV host.  And he makes that hamburger look good every single time he bites into it.  No, I like what I don't understand exactly what's going on with some good news.  Like this could own, this is YouTube, right?  He's got multi-million followers in just a few weeks.  It's very entertaining.  It looks low production.  It's obviously very, very high production.  I don't know.  They're putting, I'm sure, tons of money into it.  It's my guess that, I said this before, his management team has decided  it's time to really put John Krasinski in front of the American public  because he needs a late night show.  And the Jack Ryan thing is only iffy.  So it's my guess that this is really a career play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's a good thing.  What is Twitter?  It's a career play too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's definitely doing something for the world.  It's really good.  I'm not saying that.  Do the kids watch it?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My daughter and I watch it together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, my daughter is not like, I mean, I don't, she watches on her own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When she watches it, does it make sense to her?  Because I feel like it's aimed more at you than it is your daughter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, she, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it that she likes it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just, she understands English.  It's not a high concept show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is in English.  Yeah, she gets it.  Can't say that for PewDiePie.  This is the one that came out five days ago.  Almost 2 million views already.  It's huge.  He's got 2.6, 2.26 million subscribers.  No ads.  Well, maybe, oh, I don't know though, because I'm on YouTube premium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because he does have, there's no ads, but he does have like PepsiCo did the 3 million dollars.  He has, he calls people.  He's got clout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  He's got clout.  There's no question.  For people who don't know who John Krasinski is, you might better know him as Jim Halpert  from The Office or Jack Ryan, which you probably don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or the director of The Quiet Place.  The Quiet Place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, very talented guy.  And as I said before, he's the next, in my opinion, Tom Hanks.  We always have to have a Gregory Peck or a Tom Hanks or Gary Cooper,  a star who's just like a good person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, question for you.  Is he handsome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sometimes.  I mean, I think all movie stars can be handsome with the red lighting, if that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think he's handsome with his beard, but he was always cute on The Office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought he looked terrible on The Office.  He obviously looks better than Jack Ryan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Big nose and kind of an odd looking guy.  Yeah.  But he was relatable.  His personality is very appealing.

Transcript:  You can tell it's starting to curl in on itself in this little pompadour thing.  Just like mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've only had wax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, we need to get Stacey.  So if we find out what the thread thing is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey fell off.  You'll have to ask her.  She's our expert on female grooming.  I'll bet Karsten knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Karsten also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go, Stacey.  Stacey, I got a question.  I got another woman question for you.  The thread thing with the eyebrows.  How does that work?  I can't figure that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do they do in the mall?  I actually have never had them threaded.  Don't they just wrap it around your little hairs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just like a tweezer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't you just use a tweezer?  Wouldn't that be...  How do you wrap a thread around your hair to pull it out?  Dude, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not everybody had tweezers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think he's an alien?  I wish he would invest in...  He's clearly had someone help him,  but he should invest in some additional assistance.  What would you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The cases are referred to them by Facebook, by the way.  Facebook or users.  Oh, really?  Users can also go in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or the board members can decide on their own.  Good.  Okay, good.  And it's both Facebook and Instagram, which I think is moderately new.  WhatsApp, obviously, because you can't really see the content on WhatsApp.  So the money that Facebook $130 million trust, irrevocable trust given over from that,  they'll be paid.  I'm told they're paid a good amount.  Well, you'd have to be 18 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A month.  If you pay them $25 an hour, that's going to add up to some real money there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  You could buy a Tesla after five years.  So, interestingly, they're setting them up with hardware.  And I said in the question time, I said hardware.  So I guess it's security so they can use the same system that is used to monitor things  by the content checkers and Facebook.  So they'll have access to stuff.  Interesting.  It's interesting.  Yeah.  They were going to have them together for an orientation in person.  That's not going to happen now.  They'll get orientated to how Facebook does things and what the rules are and blah, blah,  blah, blah.

Then there are four co-chairs and the four co-chairs worked with Hydrokin Struggles,  the head hunter and Facebook to pick the rest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's his sport of choice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He is a Saint.  He's from St. Louis.  So he's a St. Louis Blues fan and a St. Louis Cardinals fan.  Hockey.  So hockey first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had no idea what sports those were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Neither did most of our audience.  So you're in good company.  But you do, I bet know who Tim Bray is.  I've known Tim Bray for years.  He's legendary.  I didn't realize I'd kind of lost track of him.  I didn't realize he was, he's been a VP at Amazon  and distinguished engineer at Amazon Web Services for the last five years.  Quit.  In a huff.  I would say.  In a huff.  I quit in dismay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A proper righteous huff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say, let's not call it a huff.  I think this was a principled stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A huff can be a great thing.  Principled.  No, no, no, no.  This is a huff for a good cause.  It's a principled huff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  I quit in dismay.  He writes, at Amazon firing whistleblowers who are making noise about warehouse employees,  frightened of COVID-19.  By the way, that warehouse where they fired the guy for organizing  had its first COVID-19 death this week.  What with big tech salaries and share vestings, this will probably cost me,  Tim writes, over a million pre-tax dollars.  Not to mention the best job I've ever had working with awfully good people.  So I'm pretty blue.  But I have to say, I really respect the principle.  You too.  Of course, I'm going to still shop Amazon because it's too much trouble to shop anywhere else.  But I'm glad Tim cares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've got to get their act together.  They can't keep this up.  This is terrible.  They can't keep doing this to people.  They've got to have a new policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish there was something as easy to use as Amazon out there.  I would use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Target online is easy.  Walmart is easy.  If you can stomach Walmart and they don't,  the nice thing is about Walmart online, you don't actually have to go into Walmart,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I try to find the same things I get on Amazon at Walmart and I can't.  I can't.  They don't have the same sewing supplies.  Amazon comes to my door every day of the week, pretty much now.  There's always a package or two and I'm feeling really guilty about it.  I really am.  And Tim, God bless you.  We'll stop feeling guilty and do something.  Well, I need to have something else.  The problem is I need supplies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Amazon is not even delivering things as quickly anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still order them and then I get them a few days later and it's fine.  The problem is I'd have to go to a dozen other places to find whatever things I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not if you order online.  Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're ordering online.  It's a lot easier just to go straight to Amazon and get it.  Anyway, you're right.  Do I go again?  You're right.  You're right.  I can't say you're wrong.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Last night I made the only order that matters.  Wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will endeavor to do better.  I am going to start shopping Walmart and Target for my sewing supplies.  What is going on?  Why is Stacey hanging up on me?  Does she hate me?  She hates me, doesn't she, Jeff?  She says she cares about me, but I don't think she does.  That's really why I'm depressed.  I'm depressed because Stacey Higabotham thinks I'm an ass.  No, I'm not.  And I think she's got some technical issue that she's addressing.  Oh, look, she's now on the Internet of Things.  What are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So my backdrop keeps coming back.  Only when y'all call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Why have you been hanging up?  Just so people don't think it's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's...  My connection keeps going away, but it doesn't...  I don't find that credible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like you're smiling.  No, you're laughing.  You say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're saying that, Stacey.  You got him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but I'm still on the chat.  I don't understand.  Skype just keeps hanging up on me.  Let me fix this.  Hold on.  That's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you could be on the Internet...  You know what?  Plug away.  I don't mind if you have the Internet of Things black-round up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, I hate those because then you get this weird...  Plus, you can't see my flowers.  Everyone look at my flowers.  They're so pretty.  Where'd you get those?  Is that for your birthday?  Yeah, it's a belated birthday gift  because they started delivering flowers again.  Anyway, they're so fancy.  I need a fancier house.  They're really pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're very...  And they smell delicious.  Did you get them elsewhere in the house too?  Is it just one bouquet or did you get a bunch of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's just one bouquet.  It's from my godmother who still sends me flowers even though I'm 42.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How's she doing with your religious education?  Is she really keeping you up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She brought me...  She actually started me studying science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the kind of godmother you got to...  That's a good godmother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She brought me my first microscope and brought me into her office  to show me an electron microscope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my god, that's fantastic.  Did she say something like, you want to see God?  Look through an electron microscope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She was an OB-GYN.  I think she wanted me to become a doctor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, how's she doing?  Is she working extra hours in Texas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, she is retired now.  Oh, thank goodness.  She's older, but she is also dealing with cancer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so sorry.  Yeah.  So it is sorry.  And on that note...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, no.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were doing a warm-up for Cinco de Mayo, which was yesterday.  So on the first, Lisa said,  we got to warm up because we haven't been drinking lately.  I'm going to make margaritas.  So she made margaritas.  I had one.  You pre-gamed Cinco de Mayo.  I was pre-gaming.  I had one.  I was asleep on the couch at 8.30.  It was not good.  I felt terrible the rest of the day.  It was awful.  It was awful.  So no, no drinking for me.  It doesn't make me, it doesn't cheer me up.  In fact, it could be really the precursor to all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What else?  Okay, so I will say I stopped drinking.  Yes, drinking is terrible.  This is Stacey's COVID-19 sanity tips.  And I will tell you, I am in the midst of tapering off my antidepressants,  which as my husband pointed out, it was a really terrible time to do so.  No, I think not.  No, you can get depressed with me.  It's something I've been trying to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's get depressed together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But no, I'm feeling happier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, isn't that interesting?  But I should point out that's when you're at the highest risk of suicide  is when you taper off the antidepressants.  So be careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am aware.  You're killing me right now.  I'm telling you.  You're really causing...  But point me.  I am such a beam of sunshine.  Every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get outside.  I agree.  You know what I have been doing?  And if you can't do that?  Every day.  I'm doing the same thing every day.  I've been bicycling to work and back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  An hour a day.  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then notice.  And then here's my big two pro tips.  Don't drink.  And then two every night.  Write three things you're grateful for.  That's good.  I like that.  It's so simple and so cliche, but it really does help.  And yeah, you can still drink if you want to drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did stop watching TV at night.  Yeah, that's cool too.  That was not good.  We were watching Ozark and I finally said to Lisa,  you know, this is too violent.  I don't like this.  It's dark.  I don't want to watch this.  I'm not going to watch it.  And so I just I've been, you know, reading and listening  to music and stuff like that.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good.  Or watch something like Parks and Rec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  I don't know.  I think my brain, I feel my brain turn into jelly.  I, uh, have you watched Billions yet this season?  I did watch the first episode of Billions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How was I watched it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I've been saving.  So that's what we're trying to decide what to do with killing.  Eve, for instance, we're saving it up because I want to watch the whole season at once.  But Billions, we cannot bring ourselves not to watch it because it's such a good.  I think I'm going to do it.  It'll be the same way with Succession when that comes back,  if it's going to ever come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I never got into Succession.  Billions was way better.  But I will tell you, I've been watching office comedies because I miss.  You miss the office.  I didn't even go to.  Yeah, but you miss having the camaraderie of an office.  So which office comedies do you like?  I like Parks and Rec.  I know they're old, but I like.  Did you watch the reunion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't get to see it.  What did they do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It made me feel all the singing about the horse, Sebastian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I mean, was it awesome television?  No.  Did it make you feel good and bring you back to like Parks and Rec?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're all superstars now, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah, actually someone said in the chat, they've been rewatching the Golden Girls.  That actually I was watching the Golden Girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jesus, I don't know if I can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can do that.

Transcript:  I never saw that.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, Brooklyn.  I mean, it's just late.  I've been watching Letter Kenny just because it's hilarious and wrong.  And Community.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Community.  That's good.  I started watching that and then I couldn't take it.  So I stopped.  Is it too annoying?  It's a little annoying.  I watched a couple of episodes and I thought this is I get it.  I understand it.  It's funny, talented, a little frenetic.  I didn't like the style.  There's something about the style, the way that they're delivering the one liners  beat and then another one liner and beat.  There was something about it.  It bugged me.  What are you talking?  Which show?  Community.  And then I did start watching Dave, which is weird.  That's on Amazon Prime, I think.  Anyway.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  What we do in the shadows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good show.  If you like vampires, it's a vampire comedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Andrew hates vampires, but he likes that show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's better.  It's good for people who don't like vampires.  I don't like zombies either.  I'm done with zombies.  No more zombies.  I've never liked zombies.  Well, now that we're all in zombie land where the actual zombie apocalypse is happening.  Yes.  I can.  Yay.  Has finally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you want Andrew?  Because he knows this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does he have an opinion on this?  I remember that the public interest registry or dot org was sold, was sold to a company,  a for-profit company.  And the concern, the deep concern was that they would raise the prices.  This was probably fueled by the fact that I can, right before they did it,  lifted the lid on pricing on dot org registry.  Coincidence?  I don't know.  So ethos capital, which was going to acquire the public interest registry and all of its assets  from ISOC, the internet society for I'm imagining a significant amount of money,  has been told by I can, no, no, you can't have, you can't do it.  We can't have a for-profit organization owning the dot org nonprofit registry.  So good.  Now, I don't know what that means.  Does I saw continue to hold it?  Maybe Andrew knows, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can go check.  That's all right.  I don't care that much.  I don't know.  We don't talk about domains very often.  I'll be honest.  That's Andrew's business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I know, but no, I know, you know, I'm telling you, hey, you know what, Stacy?  I hear Andrew's in the domain business.  I know, you know, yes, I'm aware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, not a terrible wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does my husband do for a living?  Oh, this is shocking.  This is shocking.  For many young people, being a paid content creator on social media is the gym,  the dream job, but it's not as easy as it may look.

Transcript:  What?  Are you going to talk about the Sonos stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, Wink is about to move to a subscription model.  Oh, that's not good.  What though?  What?  That's not good.  They don't deserve my money.  They sucked for like the last six months.  I'm disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're going to.  And Sonos also in the IOT sphere announced new stuff, a new sound bar, the Arc.  You're going to keep doing this?  No, I'm never buying another Sonos piece of crap again.  But if you wanted to, you could.  No, I've learned my lesson with Sonos.  I already have two, not one, but two Sonos sound bars.  Eight hundred dollars for this thing.  Eight hundred schmackers.  Dolby Atmos, which means it must have upfiring speakers.  Look how nice it looks on your wall, underneath your TV.  Where's the picture?  It disappeared.  Immerse yourself in the music, blah, blah, blah.  I don't know.  I have a hard time getting to it.  Yeah.  See the upfiring speakers.  That's so it can make sound come from above and custom woofers.  Precisely angled tweeters.  Eight hundred schmackers.  There's a lot of speakers in the.  You know what?  I have to admit my Sonos sound bars do sound pretty good.  This is the new one.  Whatever.  Yeah.  What else did they announce?  They announced some other stuff.  New products from Sonos.  Next generation Sonos sub and the Sonos 5 speaker.  I have all of these in their predecessors.  The sub is seven hundred.  Sonos 5 is five hundred.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sonos is for people who don't really care how good it sounds,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but they just like the convenience of it because it doesn't sound bad,  but it's really pricey.  Those fives looked pretty good, don't they?  I like how they look.  Not going to do it.  Not going to do it.  Don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't do it.  Dr.  Strangelove.  So why is Wink charging a subscription fee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey Higginbotham, star of Stacey on IOT.com.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hold on.  I'm still.  Hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  While you do that, I want to scare Jeff with a wobbly bridge.  Don't look, Jeff.  Up here.  Don't look, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's wobbling.  This is why I put it up here.  It's this.  I'm not crazy.  This is why I.  It's undulating because of the wind.  I'm not crazy.  The whole metal thing is.  Yeah, no, no, no.  Were you pre traumatized?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know the trauma really comes from 9-11, but were you pre traumatized by the 60th  anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge and all those people getting on it and it's starting to buckle?  Did that help?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't help.  Didn't help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it was like this.  A suspension bridge is, if you think of it, just a roadway suspended by cables.  It's just floating in the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You mentioned being in that traffic jam as that's happening.  Yeah, it's going up and down.  Insane people.  Bridges are not meant to be.  But it's not going to come down in most cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Most cases, just when I'm on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, they fixed the Genoa Bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my gosh.  Okay.  Oh my gosh.  I can answer your question.  Oh my gosh.  Go ahead.  Sorry, that was a little North Dakota.  That was good.  I like it.  It was.  It was.  Oh, you betcha.  Go ahead there, Stacey.  Sorry.  So Wink is going.  So short too.  They've been having troubles for a while.  They haven't been updating their software.  They hadn't been paying their employees.  We all thought it was...  I put mine away.  I was like, it no longer works.  But they want us to know that they're still there.  They really want to provide us with services,  but they can't because they want to keep your data private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They had a bad financial model.  Now they're going to charge it.  I think that's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now they want to charge you starting though, next week,  five bucks a month, $4.99 a month.  That's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You pay that much for Nest's cam storage and stuff like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if you don't sign up for a subscription,  you will no longer be able to access your Wink devices from the app  with voice control or through the API,  and your automations will be disabled on May 13th.  Do you think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That sounds about as bad as Sonos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there a risk that people are going to kind of start rejecting IoT  because it's shenanigans like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just wrote about that last week because automatic shut down.  And I think if you're going to...  Yes, I do think this is a problem for the community.  I think people are going to be like...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  By the way, Stacey lives near this bridge, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Why did I watch that?  It was terrifying.  Is the bridge still there?  I've gone over the Tacoma Narrows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gallop and Gertie.  See?  Not doing it.  Not doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody's...  There's two bridges there now.  I don't know if both of them are new or what though.  Maybe one of them didn't make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not doing it.  It's a suspension bridge.  That's how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bob.  That's how it works.  As long as the cables don't break, you're okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The reaction my body is giving me right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  It's really mean of me to be showing this.  Jeff, close your eyes.  Don't look, Jeff.  It's okay.  You're not on a bridge now.  Can I look again?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not showing it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you started it with your damn wobbly bridge post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I put it up there.  I wanted demonstration of my lack of insanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why did your city shut down its subway system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To clean it.  Really?  There was a daily news story about what a mess it was and filthy.  In my knowledge, it's never ever been cleaned.  It's better than that.  That's how it smells.  But no, it's better than that now.  But now every night it's going to shut down and they're going to go in  and clean all the surfaces, which is, which is Herculean.  Nobody's riding it now because...  Is it empty?  Are people not riding it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, 95% ridership done.  Of course, some people have to and that's the real issue is there are people who must go to work  despite the dangers.  They must ride mass transit despite the dangers.  And it's for those people we want to keep this clean and disinfected.  And thank you for you're all my heroes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  New York's a wonderful place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just, it just pains me so much to see New York hurt again.  I know.  I know it is terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're all hurting though, Jeff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We are.  We are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fortunately, Twitter is going to warn you before you send a vulgar tweet from no one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw my European friends screaming about about the the  puritanical Americans join this BS.  Really?  Clearly, they've never been trolled by it on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not going to stop you.  It just says, maybe you want to think about it before you post that vulgar.  I haven't tried it yet.  You tried it?  No, I should though, shouldn't I?  Should I do it right now?  Send a vulgar tweet?  What does it mean to be?  I'll send it to you, Jeff, because you won't take that personally.  Let me see.  What do you think?  I think it's a good idea.  I'll take that personally.  Let me see.  What is vulgar?  What would be considered vulgar?  The F word will work.  Okay.  Let me tweet.  At Jeff Jarvis.  F you.  F you.  I never liked you.  And the bridge you wrote in.  You came in on.  Yeah.  I'm now going to tweet that and people are going to say, why did you say that?  It did not stop me.  It didn't stop you.  Okay.  Now I have to tweet.  Oh, I am so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was just testing Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was a test of the Jesus Christ.  Oops.  Can't say that either.  I bet I can't say that.  My first Instagram tweet.  Or post, I think had a vulgarity in it because I didn't think anybody was watching.  And a teacher scolded me saying there are kids on here.  I was like, okay, sorry.  There are a lot of kids on Instagram.  Yeah, but this was like in the first week of Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There were a lot of kids the first week of Instagram.  Yeah, maybe even then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I apologize already.  I try to avoid vulgarity.  Should we mention the new earn it act?  There's a new earn it act?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're going to try to do it.  Ron Wyden has created the Invest in Child Safety Act to counter the Earn It Act,  which of course we believe is really just a covert way of trying to suppress encryption.  It seeks to establish a new office under the direction of the White House to better  streamline the government's efforts at identifying and prosecuting online predators.  Five billion dollars allocated for it.  Without threatening to withdraw Section 230.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is why Wyden was a co-author of 230.  So this is him trying to protect the internet.  God bless you, Senator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Matthew Green, who we highly respect cryptologist at Johns Hopkins says,  quote, unlike other recent proposals, which use Silicon Valley as a scapegoat,  while failing to fund law enforcement agencies,  this bill is a serious attempt to provide resources to the front line agencies that  do this essential work.  All right.  Right on, right on, right on.  So the Earn It Act is still out there.  I don't know what its status is because nobody's in town.  But good.  Now you can credibly say, I support online safety for young people without supporting  the Earn It Act.  Invest in Child Safety Act.  Write your congress critter and say, hey, instead of that stupid Earn It Act,  why don't we actually fund the people doing the work?  This might work better.  Why are Elon Musk and Tom Cruise doing a movie in space?  And who's paying for it?  NASA confirms Tom Cruise will make a movie aboard the International Space Station.  Is he going to go up there?  Yeah, they're going to shoot an action film in space.  NASA is tweets is excited.  This is Jim Bridenstine, the administrator, is excited to work with Tom Cruise on a film  aboard the space station.  We need popular media to inspire a new generation of engineers and scientists.  There's no way they're letting Tom Cruise go up there.  It's not a mission.  This is not an Onion article.  Deadline says it's not a Mission Impossible film.  No studio is in the mix.  It would be the first narrative film feature shot in outer space.  I'm thinking Tom's going to narrate it.  She hung up on me again.  Elon tweeted saying should be a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We NASA supposedly has confirmed this.  I just have trouble believing this.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, if I would do it, if they'd let me, but I don't have, you know, Tom Cruise's sex appeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know, Esther Dyson story with the shuttle?  No, when they sent up a couple of rich people.  Yeah, there was a Russian who paid the money, but you had to have an alternative.  And so Esther was his alternative.  She did all the training.  She did absolutely everything to be able to go up.  But then he still went up and so she didn't get to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there are tourists up there.  So I guess Tom could say I'll give you a billion dollars or whatever.  And NASA likes this.  It's good.  It's good publicity.  NASA is very, very sophisticated when it comes to PR.  So all right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's I'm just I'm just feeling there's a Scientology angle here too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, God.  No, no.  Are there things in space?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that's right.  See, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to see Zinoo.  Is he and he's going to get Elon Musk and Scientology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, we're all staring at you, Stacey.  We're all staring at you.  Let's wrap this up.  So your friend, your family can get on that Zoom call.  They've been waiting to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't I don't think they are.  They know better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's okay.  By the way, what was your good news?  Stacey Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was wondering because if anyone thinks I'm pregnant, we're in trouble.  I have found a place to live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought it might be that.  Do you like it?  Are you buying it?  Potential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're buying.  We should close at the end of the month and we are eligible for up to two gigabit Comcast  Internet, which is really applicable here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fantastic.  Will you stay on the on the island?  Are you going to have to drive the bridge?  What happened?  What happened?  Do you not want to say?  Do you not want to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I will stay on that.  No, I froze again.  I will stay on the island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, good.  You said at the last time we talked, there were only a few houses.  Did a new one come available or you just lower your standards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We found a house.  I think we had to raise our standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And money.  That's good.  That's good, Stace.  I'm so happy for you.  Do you like it?  Tell us about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do like it.  It has this great view.  There's a bald eagle that lives outside.  I'll have my own office that will be like super podcasty and nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll be great.  I'm so happy for you.  That's great.  I know that was a cause of real anxiety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a huge anxiety problem.  When do I move?  The end of June because we're going to buy it and then we have to replace the roof.  It's on a well.  So we have to like...  Oh, you're going to love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm there too.  I'm there too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll all be on wells.  Stacey, does it have a whole house generator?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It will by the time we get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because when the power goes out or a big battery with the solar panels would work even better.  That's right.  If you're a Tesla person, you could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could replace the roof with solar.  Yeah, and get a power.  In Seattle, there's never sun.  Well, there's enough sun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You generate some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because the well pump goes down when the power goes out?  No electricity means no water.  Which means you can't even flush the toilet.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Buckets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not fun.  Are you on septic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We are on septic.  But I've been on septic before.  So that's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's not bad if it's a good well.  It's not bad at all.  In fact, we get the best water in the world.  Of course, we got a lot of filtering and stuff so that it is the best water in the world.  But here's the question for you.  No chlorine in it.  I can use it for my sourdough starter, which is nice.  It's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I disagree with my wife.  She wants to do the water softening.  My parents used to have water softening.  It always felt oily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little slippery.  So I love having soft water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it for my clothes.  Your clothes, the hard water is worse on them.  Your coffee tastes better, I think.  You don't rinse as well with soft water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just don't feel clean at the end of a shower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you learn how to use less soap.  And some soaps work better with softer water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have a modern Culligan water softener plus a UV light that kills anything in the water.  Plus then for the refrigerator and the coffee sink, we have additional reverse osmosis and  charcoal filtering.  That water is so good.  Even the water without the extra filtering is so delicious and so pure.  I'm very, very happy with it.  I think it's better for you, honestly.  I really do.  And I don't feel slippery.  So I think maybe a modern water softener, you wouldn't have that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll see.  There's also an ionizing thing that keeps the minerals in the water so it doesn't deposit  in pipes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just have all the solids taken out because we don't want solids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So does the house need anything else?  Any bathrooms you have to redo or anything, Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's kitchen stuff.  It is not the $10 million house on Bainbridge Island.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you believe how quickly they jumped on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Geez.  I was a little worried about that.  I'll be honest.  I was like, should I tell them or should I just wait?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very rare that people come to your house.  It's only happened a few times to us.  This would be a nice place though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a former army barrack.  It kind of looks like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, US Navy is the operational command center.  It's fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this is nice.  And a mere $10 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is not my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a mere $10 million.  I couldn't afford the closet.  That is my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should show up there and walk a swimming in the indoor pool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Nice.  Nice, everybody.  Look at Stacy's new place.  That's beautiful.  That's beautiful.  Really, really sweet.  Congratulations.  I couldn't be happier for you.  Can you believe it?  $10 million and you only get four bedrooms?  What the hell?  I know.  Wow.  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many bathrooms though?  That's seven.  It's got like seven bathrooms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I guess it's really more of a public place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  The indoor pool takes up a lot of space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Indoor pool, baby.  Bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the hotel-esque bar.  And one of the rooms looks like a closet, like a full-on closet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you ever wish you could live in a place like that?  Yeah, look at that.  No.  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right now, our housekeeper can't come, so we're having to clean our house,  but we're still paying her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, just think about that.  Yeah.  Good point.  I'm like, seven bathrooms, don't think.  No, thank you.  You'd have to have a rotation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Stacy, how much stuff was in storage that you just haven't missed?  And you're going to look at it and say, why did we even move this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I mean, we have, I think, two rugs rolled up, but we don't have anything in storage.  We don't have a lot of stuff.  Oh, I thought you had a separate truck of storage stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh.  Oh no.  Oh no, so you, okay, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I have a, there's a curtain over here in my study with an alcove with some boxes with like,  paintings and all this nice stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I thought you meant like you loved it in a storage place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, someone was talking about, oh no, that was a different person.  Okay.  No, there's nothing in storage.  I thought you said that at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, that was the other Stacy, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you, when you moved temporarily in Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, we were in an apartment for like six or seven months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hence the sentiment.  See, I'm not crazy.  I'm not crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not crazy.  I understand that.  Let us, let us wrap things up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're not going to do a, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to do a change log.  I'm sick of it.  That's fine.  I'm tired of it.  There's nothing interesting in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't want to put you over the edge.  We're not going to put you over the edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is exciting though.  This is a neural net that generates music.  Jeff, you're going to, not you, Jeff, my Jeff, you're going to be in trouble.  He's a drummer.  He's a musician.  I thought I was your Jeff.  You're my Jeff, but not the Jeff who's the drummer and the musician.  Are you ready to hear what it sounds like when the open AI jukebox starts a rocking?  What's cool is he can do it in different styles.  Now, some of these are pretty good.  Like here's the Elvis Presley style.  Lyrics also by the AI.  You ready?  Sounds like Elvis, but I don't think Elvis would have sung from dirt  to lipid to cell to heart with my toe, sis, with my o, sis, with time.  That sounds like something an AI might make up.  Do you know who Alan Jackson is?  You country fans do.  This is a song for me, a cheer up song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  He did.  Don't rock the jukebox.  I think AI has the country really, really down, really down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Country is like the second most formulaic thing ever.  He did do tall, tall trees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tall, tall trees.  I like Joe Jackson.  I mean, Alan Jackson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is Alan Jackson.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here though is pop music, which I would argue is fairly formulaic in the style of Katy Perry.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I feel like I'm in a bad dystopian dream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That wasn't Katy Perry.  That was like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It didn't sound like Katy Perry at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what it sounded like?  It sounded.  Did you ever see that movie from like the late 90s?  The commitments.  It was about Irish people doing soul music.  It sounded like their songs or Bonnie Raitt.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Open AI's jukebox is at jukebox.openai.com.  Forget paying for Spotify, Apple Music.  You can get your own for free.  Here's a little Celine Dion and Ella Fitzgerald together at last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's actually kind of.  God, it sounds like Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's weird, but in a way it's kind of interesting.  I mean, like they then some of these, some of these, by the way, the lyrics are helped out  by the open AI researchers and some of them are not.  And they get really weird.  Here's a banana Rama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just to stop this because it's painful.  I'll give you another.  Have you all talked about this meme does not exist?  Google it because it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This meme does not exist.  Oh, I do remember this.  This is these are generative AIs, right?  Oh, OK.  Yeah, I do remember this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And built memes.  Yeah, I was like, I think I was gone last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we didn't talk about last week, but I think we've talked about a while ago.  So these are generated by artificial intelligence is using GAN.  They're not very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't even make any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some of them are really fantastically accurate, though.  I will say.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's here's Leonardo DiCaprio.  Thank you for the world cold.  OK, here's the most interesting man in the world.  What do you think he's going to say?  No one knows.  Never mind.  Never mind.  I can't say that one out loud.  Let's see what the doge has to say.  Who let the doge out?  I'm very lesbian.  OK, I can't read these on the air, so I won't.  But there you have it.  How about little Yoda?  Is it going to be backwards memes?  I am memes.  That is meme.  That is.  Oh, that one.  That's OK.  Yeah, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The one I just got is the forces with you then not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because you can you can have them do more.  You know, it's not.  Yeah.  Refresh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Prediction.  So Leo, yeah, yeah.  The responses to your tweet.  Yeah.  Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you kidding me?  Oh, God, I can never go on Twitter again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They want to delete that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I could delete it, couldn't I?  Anyone have context about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I just put a second tweet saying I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, I missed something, says Ryan Wakefield.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, God, now people are going to believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jim, what has Jeff Sharpe done now?  You can't that guy.  You can't take him anywhere.  Michael Martinez.  I usually listen the next day.  I guess I'll find out what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  Well, you know what?  This might have been good for ratings, so I'm not taking it down.  What?  Wait, what?  You know, it's not easy having half a million followers on Twitter,  but somebody's got to do it.  All right.  That was my lousy pick.  What do you got, Stacey?  I usually let Stacey start, but she's frozen.  So why don't you do a number, Jeffrey?  Oh, OK.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  OK.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got a bunch.  So yeah, I got what I like here, which is so Lufthansa has a travel and mobility tech  newsletter.  It's actually pretty good.  A little depressing for them right now, but they looked at the entire  market capitalization of Air France, KLM, United, Lufthansa, American Airlines,  Delta Airlines.  Yeah.  It's less than Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's depressing.  That's really depressing.  So if you add them all up, all the airlines, they're worth $35 billion.  Zoom is worth $37 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the five airlines revenue in 2019 came to $205 billion.  Zoom's 2019 revenue was $622 million.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, this is the revenue in 2019.  This isn't even the COVID revenue.  No, no, no, no, no.  So that's just how much Zoom is doing.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  Should have bought that Zoom stock when I had the chance.  Should I have.  I actually sold all my stock when this started.  I said, I'm getting out of the market.  I don't know what the hell is going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this is when you buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm on a way to like crashes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like really crashes.  You can't just try to buy it.  Just buy periodically.  It's not as exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you talking about dollar cost averaging?  That's what I'm talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because that's the savviest easiest way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I took everything out because I'm an old man, Stacey.  And I won't have a chance like you young people to recover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So did you take it out before or after the crash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I lost about 10% on the value.  It had been.  Okay.  So early on.  Yeah.  And actually, I give a lot of credit to Lisa,  who is somehow some sort of magical financial wizard.  We had a huge retirement fund,  a defined what they call a defined benefits plan,  a pension fund that the whole company was using.  And for some reason, she I don't really understand.  In January, she said, yeah, let's take that out of equities  and we're going to put it all in money market.  In January, she saved that fund more than a million dollars.  And the way these things work is if you lose money,  you have to the owners have to make it up  because we have a responsibility for the pension to all the employees.  So everybody should thank Lisa Laporte  because your pensions are safe thanks to her financial wizardry.  Wow.  Yeah, I know.  Isn't that incredible?  It was a fairly substantial chunk.  And her financial advisors really tried to talk her out of it.  They said, oh, no, this is the time to get in.  This is a bear market, a bull market.  We're we couldn't.  This is a 10 year bull market.  No one knows the sky's the limit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  My promise is stuff I would have gotten.  I would sell, but my capital gains would have been killing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I don't want to look at my tax bill.  Yeah, because I will have some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But maybe your business will lose money and you can offset it.  Oh, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, hey, we're supposed to cheer him up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.  I'm sorry.  That was my bad angel speaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're scaring me out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your left shoulder.  I did get I left shoulder.  I got out of everything.  Got out of it all.  It's all retirement money.  So there's no tax liability until I retire, which could happen about five minutes from now, actually.  Did you?  Oh, that was the number.  Zoom.  Oh, you gave your number.  I'm so sorry.  Because you froze up.  You froze.  And so now it's your turn, Stacey, for your thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, next week I have some really good things, but this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was curious if you've tried this because I saw the news about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I have not tried it yet, but it is now for sale.  So that's why I put it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we have a deadbolt in our door, our front door, as most people do when hopes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is nice because it doesn't look like a smart deadbolt.  It looks like your existing deadbolt.  It fits in.  I install these types of deadbolts all the time.  The way this looks from an installation video perspective looks exactly like what I've installed.  It takes maybe six to ten minutes.  You do have to get the right size, though, for this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, because you already have a hole in your door for the existing deadbolt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You basically unscrew like it's roughly four or five screws  and everything kind of like falls out of your hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This makes me a little nervous.  It uses a C cell.  How long is that going to last?  And can you get in your house when it dies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They usually die in a way that is very aggressive in the app that tells you that it's about to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks like there is a key.  Or is there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know yet.  Is it only Bluetooth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, there's usually some sort of manual way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very cool looking.  I really like how it looks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And pay attention to these C cells because you're going to see them in more places.  Really?  Just so you know.  Because you can make things smaller and as more companies put out products that use them,  people are going to stock more of them in their home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is why a C cell?  I've never understood this.  Some of my things want AAA, AA, C, D.  I have a clock that has four D cells in it.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's basically a size for performance.  So that gets you the equivalent of roughly four AA batteries.  Maybe three AA batteries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's more compact than the AA's would be and certainly easier to change.  Yes, those are words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those are the good words.  Those are words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see shells by the seashore.  Somebody says that's not a seashell.  I don't know what they're thinking.  It looks like a C cell.  Seashell.  No, I can't say it.  Looks like one of them.  Okay.  But is Level a good company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a new company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  New.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I don't know how we feel after Automatic, Petnet, apparently Wink,  and other companies have been shutting down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be depressing to not be able to get in your house because the company shut down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey, which length is best for my door?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are two common backset lengths, standard and long.  You just measure it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was like, I can't tell you now.  I have to see your door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think, honestly, Lisa being the smart person in the family would not let me get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you have a Bluetooth deadbolt?  I have a Wi-Fi one right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you like it?  The nice thing is you can open the door for people, like the kids or whatever.  They say, I can't get in.  I forgot my keys.  Whatever.  You can open it from work, which you never go to.  But if you did, what else?  What are the other benefits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have one with a keypad and I like the keypad even without the cell phone connectivity  because you don't have to carry keys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This does not have a keypad, so I don't know exactly.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you have to have your phone, which I don't always take...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can give a code to your cleaning person?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because this doesn't have a keypad.  She can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not this one, the keypad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you can credential people via the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, but then they have to put the app on their phone.  Do you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the downside there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have a Schlage in August?  Which one do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have both.  And I used to have a Kwikset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kwikset 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I used to have a lot of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like IoT and I do have a doorbell camera,  but I just get nervous about the lock being an IoT device.  Not that locks do anything except they're just really recommendations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People always ask me that.  I'm like, look, I have a Kwikset lock that you could open with a screwdriver.  I mean, it's way easier to open my door lock than it is to actually hack into the...  It's just symbolic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like, please don't come in here.  Although I have to say we have bars on our door and everything.  I mean, you'd have to really...  You'd have to brand battering it down, batter it down,  but I guess people could do that.  Works with iOS and Android.  It is $230, the level lock from level.co.  And it's HomeKit certified.  That's the other thing.  Oh!  Well, then I trust it more because Apple's in the mix.  What do you do on Android if you're...  You just do not HomeKit then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have iPads and everyone else in my family is on an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is built to ANSI grade one stroke A standards  and protected by the best in class data encryption.  Open from anywhere with Apple HomeKit.  Just ask Siri.  Open the door.  I was wrong.  It says it has a CR2 battery.  That's one of those little dime batteries.  But it looked like it had a bigger battery.  So I don't know.  I don't know.  Install seamlessly inside your current dead...  Inside?  Yeah, you don't change out your deadbolt.  Oh, so I still have a deadbolt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you look...  Yeah, it looks...  Well, you always still have a deadbolt,  but it looks like from the outside, no one can tell you have a smart lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the key doesn't do anything anymore.  Right?  You can't stick the key in the lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, this is where now I have to...  It's unclear.  Ask me this next week.  Yeah. Are you getting it?  Are you getting it?  Are you getting it?  I'm definitely getting a demo of it.  I don't know if I'm getting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got more locks than Carter has little liver pills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have more locks than I have doors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's awesome.  Put this on your desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cool.  They actually send you those if you ask for them.  They'll send you a little faux door.  A little tiny door?  A little tiny door that you unlock the lock.  I want a little tiny door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you just put it in the wall, you kind of think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then Stacy can slam it on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People would think, what do you have?  A turtle that can open the door?  What is that door for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want a little tiny door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should have shown you something different.  Okay. Next week.  Save it.  No, next week I have something better.  The week after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have a backlog.  Now we've got a problem.  Somebody is trying to keep you going, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chat room trying to make you sure you come back.  That's adorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, chicken head.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.  You made my day today.  Stacey Higginbotham, thank you for being...  Pretending at least to care.  She is in charge at stacey on iot.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, can I plug something?  Yes, please.  Hey, you guys.  I'm doing an event on why IoT did not predict COVID-19  and how we can build up an infrastructure  that can give us warning and detection for this  and other pandemics.  Oh, this sounds great.  It is going to feature the CEO of Kinza,  the smart thermometer maker,  an epidemiologist from Scripps,  and Dina Mendelson, who is director of health policy  at a company called Electra Labs that does validation  of consumer wearables.  So this is how to make it like medically certified basically.  So we're going to talk about like...  Why didn't Kinza tell us this was happening?  Exactly.  Why didn't we know?  The simple answer is we weren't looking for it.  But we're going to get into that and talk about what's happening  and what we need to do going forward.  And it'll be May 20th at 11 a.m. PT.  Yes, 11 a.m. PT.  And you can go to stacey on iot.com slash COVID  if you would like to sign up and it's totally free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm going to definitely attend.  That sounds great.  Why didn't I...  You might be recording a show.  What day of the week is that?  May 20th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll be on the air with Windows Weekly.  They don't need me.  I can watch and do the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it'll be archived too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice.  Oh, you're producing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is your thing.  That's awesome.  Oh, yay.  Congratulations, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yes, and then in June I'm doing another one.  Yeah.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what's cool is you don't have to have a venue.  So this makes it a lot easier, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm hopeful.  I mean, this is my first one.  But I was really excited.  I literally woke up one night.  Someone actually tweeted me.  It was a doctor who listens to the show.  He's like, I don't understand why we didn't have this.  We should have known.  That's a great question.  I know.  I could have asked.  Well, tell Linda...  We should do it for everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get up every morning and I do my Kinza thermometer,  make sure I'm not dead yet.  And although my temperature seems low  and then I wear an Aura ring,  which also shows me temperature fluctuation and other things,  I think this quantified self is kind of useful during all this.  So I'm very interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you part of the DETECT study?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  And the Aura ring study.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the Aura ring is doing with UCSF a study.  Apparently they're going to send me an antibody test.  But I did just take one on Monday.  So I don't know if I'll need another one.  But I guess a second opinion is always appreciated.  Well, considering the Aura ring, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or you just store it until you...  After you feel sick again.  Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what are you going to do anyway, right?  If I said, oh, yeah, you got the antibodies,  does that mean I run out and frolic in the park naked?  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Dr. Neil Ferguson,  who was one of the primary people of setting policy in the UK,  he's part of the SAGE committee, the secretive committee.  And so he just had to quit.  This is very British because you're off with your heads, Charles I.  Because his girlfriend came over to his house.  Yeah, except...  Now mind you, Dr. Ferguson has had the disease.  So if there are antibodies, he has them.  There were two missing points in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One is he's already had it.  Two is they said, oh, and his married girlfriend,  she's in an open relationship.  So firing him seems a little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was so British.  The British just loved it.  Literally lop off your head.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that could have a negative consequence.  So everybody go to staceyoniot.com, sign up for the newsletter,  then go to staceyoniot.com slash COVID and register for that event.  Is there a limited number of people who can attend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll find out what Zoom can do.  Why was it to say?  I'll let you know.  Yeah.  I think you're going to get hundreds of people.  That is really an interesting topic.  I really...  And you've got excellent people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're really smart.  I've talked to all of them and they're all just the cats meow.  Jennifer Radin actually created the Detect program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  Okay.  Thank you, Stacey.  We're doing our own event on Identity.  Did I mention that?  I did mention that.  No.  The last pass event?  Yes, next week.  Yeah, next week.  Oh, the last pass event.  Yeah, next Thursday.  So that's going to be fun too.  That's also streaming.  Honestly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't you repeat what time it's on, Leo?  It'll be Thursday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what time it's on.  Sorry.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  11 a.m.?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't keep track of these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the part of the show where we pitch poorly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what they do at the end of Stern.  Everybody has their plug, right?  But it's already 9, 30 or 10 in the morning.  Everybody's at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where are you going, joke man?  The event is not on the Twitch schedule.  That needs to be rectified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, we'll fix that right now.  That is an oversight.  It should be on the Twitch Live schedule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Karsten says it's at 4 p.m.  4 p.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have to show the ad copy.  That's like looking behind the curtain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pay no attention to that ad copy.  I make it up as I go along.  Jeff Jarvis.  It's from his heart.  He is the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism  at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the QD.  The QD, the City University of New York,  and a much esteemed colleague and former TV guy.  And a friend.  And he at least is a friend.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know I just like to tease you, Stacey.  It's so brutal here.  I'm so sorry.  Of course you're a friend.  We're all friends here.  We are.  Thank you.  It does, honestly, it always cheers me up to do this show.  I really enjoy it because you people are...  You and Jeff are smart, interesting,  and it's a really...  That's one of my favorite shows to do every week.  One of my top 10 shows every week.  The highlight of the week for me too.
