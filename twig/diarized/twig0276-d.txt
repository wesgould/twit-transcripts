She's also the host of All About Android.  Oh yeah. Tuesday night. We make her work right in the middle of the week.  Jeff Jarvis is back home. Where the snow has it come up to the windows yet Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not in Buffalo, thank goodness. The East Coast is not all the same.  Yes it is. I think Gina should put her hoodie over her head since she's freezing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Both of you I think. It is freezing here. This is why I have my fuzzy, muzzy hoodie on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow, that's cute. Is that a Uniqlo hoodie? It's cold. You look so adorable in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think this was like a Sam's Club special. My mother-in-law gave it to me. It's great. It's so warm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You really understand when you're walking around in sub-freezing weather why warm weather gear is so important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. I'm being re-reminded. I was kind of in denial about the winter because I moved back last winter.  I was like, oh this is a weird freak thing. Now I'm like, oh we committed to this. This is going to be a seasonal thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's really February that you really start hating it. November, this is nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was like, it's not even December yet. That's what I was saying to a friend. It's not even December. What is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's wrong. Stay inside, stay warm, be toasty. It's going to be 65 this weekend. Oh good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I now feel like my parents talking about the weather. I know. Let's instead talk about Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  At first I wasn't going to but now I feel like I have to. Let's do it. Let's do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's phenomenal. Jesus what a story. It's kind of depressing to me that it's only become a huge story once it affected journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, typical isn't it? It's like Gamergate. As soon as you attack the journalists, now we've got a story.  So Uber has always been pretty aggressive and I think in some regard this is just kind of a peek inside the startup culture  which can tend to be not only a boys club but an agro boys club. Really obnoxious.  And little bits leak through the brogrammer and all of that stuff. But really, and I'm not familiar with it because I don't hang out with VCs or with startups or anything.  Maybe Jeff, I think you do a little bit more. Gina, you're in a startup. Is this kind of aggressive culture that we're seeing here with Uber kind of typical?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's well you know Uber is just like the darling of the valley and there is this whole sort of like undercurrent of growth hacking and hustle.  And this sort of, I don't know, this idea that you just stop at nothing to succeed. And the Uberization of everything.  I mean Uber has become this weird cinnamon for me. I feel like it's a cinnamon for either like the future of technology and convenience or complete, you know, or a company that treats its drivers terribly and resorts to unethical tactics to acquire customers.  I mean it's like it's this very weird split, you know, double thing, double edged sword with Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uber has raised more money probably than any startup in current Silicon Valley startup. It's $1.5 billion in six rounds from 32 investors including several hundred million dollars from Google Ventures.  Founded by Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp. We should explain for those who don't know, although I imagine most of our audience does. It's a cab service in effect.  Originally it was a black car service. The thing that made it different was instead of phoning them up and saying pick me up, I'm ready to go, you'd have an app on your phone and it was actually a very lovely experience.  The app would already have your credit card information. You'd tap it, say I want to ride. You could see how far away the car was. You could see as it approached on a map, you'd see a picture of your driver.  Your driver would see a picture of you and where to pick you up. You'd get in the car, you'd go where you wanted to and then you'd get out of the car.  That would be it. The tip and the payment all handled by Uber. It was a very nice friction free transaction. The early Uber cars were all nice black cars.  Then they had UberX which was somewhat of a lower cost service. I think they maybe even go lower than that. There's a variety of cars that might be.  Uber bike.  Then of course they got a lot of heat in Washington DC, in New York City, in Toronto. I think Toronto is about to make Uber illegal because the taxi services said this is essentially an unlicensed taxi service and you make us buy medallions and go through a huge regulatory hoops and you're not doing that to Uber.  I don't know whether it's lobbying from the taxi services or the taxi commission. It's kind of like the Airbnb problems with the hotel commissions. It's a new way of doing things and there maybe are some concerns.  An Uber car hit an immigrant family in San Francisco a few months ago and killed a six year old. There have been reports of alleged sexual attacks in Uber cars by Uber drivers.  But really the issue that's surfacing now is the aggressive promotion of Uber. First a couple of months ago we heard that Uber was going after Lyft by actually getting in Lyft cars and trying to solicit their drivers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Well Lyft is one of their competitors and they would have, supposedly they had Uber employees calling in Lyft rides, getting the Lyft drivers to go to pick them up and then canceling.  Basically taking away their fares or getting into these cars and pitching Lyft drivers to move over to Uber about all the reasons why Uber was better for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what's interesting? The name Uber, which sounds, at the beginning it sounded like they're better, they're good. And now it's starting to sound like Deutschland Uber Alles. It's like the connotations are not as good.  So the latest kerfuffle came from a private event that Uber had in which one of their senior vice presidents for business said some things that were pretty appalling.  Yeah, ironically they think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To go after journalists. Nobody would know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well and we should explain this. So what happened was this was an off the record event. Ed Norton, the actor was there. Ariana Huffington was there. And Michael Wolfe.  Yeah, it was a nice event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're trying to make nice. They know that they're having PR problems. So they set up these fancy dinners with all these heavy hitters to make nice and clean glasses and get buddy buddy because they know they're having PR problems as a company. So this is why they're setting up these dinners.  So that's just the irony of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I don't know the Waverly Inn in New York but I'm guessing it's a pretty nice...  It's hip and nice.  Yeah, yeah.  So they asked Michael Wolfe of USA Today to go and he in turn invited a date, Ben Smith happens to be editor in chief of BuzzFeed to come along with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now just a little moment here. Michael Wolfe, just his background, tries to be as nasty as he can be all the time. And he went to the Foursquare conference having nothing to do with our app Foursquare but Foursquare from now Lehman Brothers.  And it's all off the record. They make this absolutely clear. And Wolfe revealed absolutely everything from the event and created a book called Twilight of the Moguls. So Wolfe is no friend of off the record. Wolfe invites...  It is an off the record event though. And he says...  But the argument is unless the journalist agrees it ain't off the record. And Ben Smith whom I trust on this never heard that it was off the record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Wolfe is writing in USA Today says I had understood the Uber dinner like other such media meet and greets was off the record. I neglected however to tell Smith this.  He says while I might have fairly assumed Smith knew the context this was my oversight though surely not Uber's. You know what? It's everybody's oversight because as you say nothing's off the record until it's agreed that it's off the record by both parties.  So off the record doesn't mean what you think it means. I might have thought too that as my date he would have asked if there was an understanding. Oh Wolfe throwing Smith under the bus here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah he really is. And again this is Michael Wolfe who himself has absolutely flaunted off the record rules. Who wrote an entire book out of the Foursquare event which is clearly off the record. Everyone knows it's off the record. He knew it was off the record. And now he's acting holier than now? BS Michael. BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Ed Norton was there. He's a friend of the founder. Shawna Robertson his wife a movie producer. Mort Zuckerman. Now the Daily News.  It's interesting that Wolfe is naming names at an off the record event. Bob Pitman the CEO of Clear Channel. Ariana Huffington. Chris Hughes the owner of the New Republic and former Facebooker. Chris might even still be a Facebooker. No I think he left Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He was one of the founders. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he says a long table about 40 feet or more. Smiths was seated at the far end with Emile Michael who was Uber's senior vice president for business. Now Wolfe says I was at the other end of the table so I didn't hear this conversation. But apparently. So this is actually additional detail that we haven't read before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Smith. Ariana Huffington just tweeted that she was also at the other end of the table. I didn't hear anything darling. I wasn't there. I don't know what they're talking about darling and I'm going to take an Uber right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know why she sounds like Jaja but she kind of does. She never says darling. She makes a point of never saying darling. I know. But she should say darling. If you're going to talk like that you should say darling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I knew her when she was Ariana stuff and not Stassenopolis. OK I'm just saying Smith apparently engaged Michael in a discussion of Uber's frequent bad press and came away with a set of quotes or snippets of quotes which had Michael saying that Uber if it wanted to could investigate journalists including their personal lives.  As Smith represented Michael's conversation and this was a BuzzFeed posting. Michael's Michael is the executive at Uber. Michael's angle was directed at Sarah Lacey the founder and editor of Pando Daily and Lacey has been critical of Uber and its aggressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's aggressive tactics and so forth. A couple of sexist promos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I should mention that in the BuzzFeed article this is the quote over dinner. He outlined the notion of spending quote a million dollars and quote to hire four top opposition researchers and four journalists that team could he said help Uber fight back against the press.  They'd look into quote your personal lives your families and quote and give the media a taste of its own medicine. Michael was particularly focused. This again is the is is Ben the BuzzFeed editor in chief.  Michael was particularly focused on one journalist Sarah Lacey the editor of Pando Daily sometimes combative voice inside the industry Lacey Lacey recently accused Uber of sexism and misogyny.  She wrote that she was deleting her Uber app after BuzzFeed reported that Uber appeared to be working with a French escort service. She said I don't know how many more signals we need the company simply doesn't respect us or prioritize our safety.  At dinner Michael expressed outrage at Lacey's column and said that women are far more likely to get assaulted by taxi drivers and Uber drivers. This is this is to me the sentence that was the most outrageous.  He said that he thought Lacey should be held personally responsible for any woman who follows her lead in deleting Uber and is then sexually assaulted.  He said also they could in particular if they went after her prove a particular and very specific claim about her personal life. By the way I don't know and Ben does not report what that is and we don't need to talk about that.  I don't think that's an issue. He at no point suggested that Uber has actually hired opposition researchers or plans to he cast as something that would make sense.  The company would be justified for doing now Michael did not deny it. He actually issued a statement a statement that said the remarks attributed me at a private dinner born out of frustration during an informal debate over what I feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company.  I'm proud to work for do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company's views or approach. They're wrong no matter the circumstance and I regret them.  There was a Twitter.  Callen Callen I had a Twitter storm about 17 tweets in which he apologized at no point did anybody mention whether Michael would be reprimanded or punished or even fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This you know did for a 14 tweet stream saying that what he said had no representation in the company we're very sorry blah blah blah. This is not our company but but but there's just been too many signals now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well and then there's this other issue of them God view the God view. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you want to talk about that. Yeah I mean so I mean this is when we talk about trust and particularly around Google because it's a show about Google like this is this is what this is what I was talking about when I say Google has roots to culture right.  So Uber has this thing called God view purportedly allegedly which means that certain employees of the company not drivers who are contractors but employees of the company particularly executives have this live map of cars and Uber cars and people who are in them.  And they can pretty much track anybody who's going somewhere at any given time. And so there was a there was a medium piece by someone whose name I didn't recognize. I think maybe he's a VC or he's someone of some importance who said that you know someone that he knew also in the industry was texting him saying hey are you in a car on the street in this street asking him about his location.  He said yeah you know how do you know where I am and she said well I'm at this Uber party here in Chicago and they've got the God view up on the you know or they've got this you know you the view of where your car is up on the up on the wall.  And you should be proud you've been selected.  You should be so you know you should be delighted that they're showing off this amazing technology where they get to watch you in real time drive around the city in a car which is like you know and this person said I never gave him any permission to broadcast my location real time.  I you know this is so there's this like you know there's this so there's this accusation out there that people have access to your private information and you know where you're going and who you're with and you know what time of day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it possible that I mean I think you start there seems to be a pattern but maybe the pattern is being remember Uber has been really fought fish you know hard against by the taxi commissions.  Lift has been complained a lot about over there of course a direct competitor and some of their complaints turn out to be kind of maybe not you know it doesn't anyway there's there seems to be more to this story than meets the eye.  Let's not forget that BuzzFeed is heavily invested in by Andreessen Horowitz which also is a lift one of the major lift investors.  It seems like there's more to this story than worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's what I think I think Andreessen somebody said that to Andreessen and he said oh come on really and I agree with him like there's some conspiracies don't really happen folks.  The world's not that well organized and I don't believe for a second that the investors behind lift said let's go and let's let's let's let's make sure we get BuzzFeed Ben invited to this dinner so they can feed Pando more bad stuff so that it just doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah and BuzzFeed bad guys here are Uber.  Uber has not denied that Michael said those things right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean all you gotta do is give this guy half a bottle of wine.  I mean it doesn't take much right.  I mean really I don't mean to.  So are you okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So let me ask you see it's not an issue for me because I can't use Uber in Petaluma.  John Hodgman whom we respect a lot said I'm going to delete my Uber app.  Are you going to delete your Uber app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My Uber app is deleted.  I have emailed help and asked them to delete my account because just deleting the app from your phone does not actually close your account and there's no way to close your account on the Uber website.  You actually have to email them and a human being from Uber wrote back and said she'd be happy to delete my account but she wanted to know why first.  So I responded and said that I do not trust Uber with my data and could she please close my account.  I have yet to hear from her this.  I did this about about 24 hours ago.  So I'm already annoyed that there isn't a self-service just close my account.  I feel very strongly that that is like you know giving giving a customer an exit route is you know responsibility zero for a service like this.  You know they do store my credit card.  I should be able to say hey delete my stuff.  But you know I've that's so that's where I'm at with it.  I'm waiting for them to get back and say I'm deleting your account.  I live in New York City.  We're getting a car service.  I mean when you live in Brooklyn you there aren't like yellow taxi cabs that drive the streets of Brooklyn.  But I grew up you know even as a teenager there's cars there's car service which are these little you know storefront deals where you call.  Yes I have to make a voice call which is inconvenient but you call and then they come and get you and it's a cost a few bucks and it's like not it's not that big a deal.  So I plan to use you know car service and public transportation and yellow taxi cabs for now because I just I wasn't really a big Uber user to begin with.  I know it's a big deal in the San Francisco area because getting a taxi is apparently very difficult.  But you know the app experience is nice but there's a service here called Carmel which has an app that's not as nice as Uber but is close and that you can hail hail a car that way.  So I do that from the airport.  So yeah I'm done.  I'm done with Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I downloaded Lyft today and I will probably not use Uber and I think that what they've done is really disgusting.  Yeah they're all up.  They also went after investors in Lyft and it's just the culture.  My favorite favorite line of the whole thing came from a response to a tweet of mine.  Richard Dunham said Google is changing its motto to don't be Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gosh you point out that Google is a little bit in bed with Uber because the Google Maps app.  They invested.  They invest not only they invest hundreds of millions of dollars the Google Maps app.  If you have Uber installed on your phone will as one of the give you a chance to call a cat call an Uber.  And I think I think all the major investors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No that made me super uncomfortable when they did that.  I remember doing on the change log and feeling like way well.  I felt kind of icky about Uber.  Even then.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean you know it's an interesting thing to me like what responsibility and you know look we've we've had our outrage moments on this show.  About a lot of different things.  There are times when apologies work and I accept them and I move on and there are times they don't.  To me Travis is Kalanick's apology.  It just didn't didn't work for me.  The apology that would have worked was would have been emails fired.  I mean you know immediately for what happened.  Case closed.  They didn't do that.  And I feel like all these things you know put together just indicate this like really horrible you know company culture and I just I just can't support it.  So look I believe that people make mistakes and can and can change.  I've made mistakes and I've apologized.  But in this case just wasn't enough.  So yeah that's why that's why I'm done with Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think now we have to look to to Matt Kohler Bill Gurley.  The investors.  These are people who are on the board.  So they are the CEO's boss and are they going to hold the CEO accountable here.  Let's let's list their names Ted Mizal Matt Kohler Steve Jang I guess Bill Gurley Timothy Ferris Paul Brighill.  Steven Steve Russell and Oscar Salazar.  That's the board of Uber.  Those are the real ultimate bosses.  And one way or the other they've I was on the board of a company when we had some issues and at the end of the day it's up to the board to say what's what.  And we've got to see how they do.  You know there's another story here too which is the is the journalistic story.  I just finished reading you know Wolf throwing Michael Wolf of all people throwing BuzzFeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He really throws them under the bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah really really does.  And we have another story that was like this recently when when the Guardian went and and went with a business meeting with whisper and found out that whisper was not really keeping things as private as seemed to seem to be playing with people's privacy and identity in a lot of ways and reported that.  And some journalists in that case as in this case kind of got mad so you're ruining the game you're ruining the rules you off the record.  My response to that is as a journalist your first responsibility full stop is to the public you serve and access journalism is corrupting and gee you won't get that invited back for the Waverly dinner or gee you won't get invited by the Silicon Valley company to do a deal with them.  Well fine fine it's your job to protect the public and if you know something bad is going on even though people who are at the dinner knowing it was off the record.  I think that there are some level at which it becomes over the top and to say I'm telling you this off the record but I feel I feel a need to tell people about this and I certainly as hell would have called Sarah Lacey and told her what was going on.  This was shameful and I'm ashamed of people in my business that they don't keep their priorities straight in both these stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There is this pattern of stories it just goes on and on and on and as Sarah Lacey points out Uber's strategies you let the news cycle fade and then you move on and you don't change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I mean I think Sarah Lacey's piece was a bit over the top but I understand why it was because they're you know they're they're they're you know talking about going after her personally and the way that nobody will know it's us and attacking her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She points out they ran a promotion in France that promises to pair Uber riders with hot chicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah that was that was the piece on this piece on sexism misogyny that she wrote that Michael was apparently complaining about at that dinner.  So that's what kind of pissed him off right and so then she wrote her so Ben called Lacey for comment before he published his story and yeah her and she wrote a piece about that and she seemed I look I don't know what like we're not going to discuss whatever thing it is that.  Michael was saying he knew and was going to reveal about her I have no idea but she was clearly shaken up and afraid for her kids.  Her young kids and and and so yes her piece was was clearly she was there was a clearly yeah she she felt threatened she felt vulnerable and you could tell what is going on we are in the middle of the worst bro culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well well let's let's go to Bill Cosby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's been a long but that's gone on for decades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well Ta-Nehisi Coates, who by the way is on the faculty at CUNY is an honored colleague of mine wrote a really really good essay today in the Atlantic which is redundant in his case because all his essays are really good.  But saying that he covered Cosby he followed him for two years as he was doing kind of the shaming of lesser cultural acts back in the day and he knew this stuff was going on back then but he chose not to deal with it because then I'd have to deal with that whole thing and and so on and so forth.  Mark Whitaker wrote about her if he chose not to touch it at all and Ta-Nehisi said today that he's had few regrets in his careers but this is one because in the end of the day you had to believe one person over 13 people and and he says I should have dealt with it and it was it was eloquent.  I think that yes you get you get Gian Gomeshi at CBC that's a somebody I knew and that was a fan of.  You get all these BBC men who've been accused of doing bad things with their public position.  There's there's yeah it's a it's a big bad bro problem here for us men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I it's really sad I thought we were making such great strides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I go back and forth about this you know on one hand I'm like yeah wow you know like we're making no progress this is terrible right but then it's like well maybe I just know about it more because of the internet and maybe the system's working.  I mean what did what did what was his name the comedian that did the Hannah was it Hannah the comedian that did the bit about Cosme.  He calls him out during his bit which is you know which is the thing that kind of got the momentum but what did he say during his but he said go home and Google Cosby rape you'll see I'm right.  Like that's how he backed up his claim you know that these 13 women had or I think like 15 now had accused him so on one hand when I'm more depressed moments I think yes we have this huge sexism problem nothing is changing this is just you know getting worse and worse.  And then other times I think you know what the system's working people are getting called out you know transparency we're learning more we're talking more we're having this conversation we're identifying patterns because we have you know a lot more information and a lot more conversation about it and that's how we make progress so I don't know I try to be trying to be an optimist about it.  I love his show got canceled.  Right.  Both shows the Netflix special and the NBC show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know in all seriousness this is why you need don't be evil.  You need to empower your employees to say call you out on it and and and and be licensed to say should we do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What about the fact the chairman's bringing this up that the system also allows a lot of false accusations allegations that gain the power of truth just because they've been published on the internet or on Twitter.  Yeah, but don't we have a system for really being you know really determining what's true and what's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think over the long run we kind of do I think I think that's the point is that is that is that the truth will out.  Generally, can people be be as we've talked about the show many many times people be attacked, impersonated, hounded.  Yeah, all kinds of bad things can happen.  But I think Gene is right we have a better system for more checks now for more truth to come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And from and we and we have tools that empower more people to do that vetting to do that checking than we ever have before.  And it was kind of saying a couple weeks ago, you know, technology isn't you know is inherently good or evil.  It just is right.  I mean, it's just it's just tools.  But yeah, I mean, I have to believe that the truth will come out if people care enough, you know, eventually.  I mean, look, I was outraged that there are that many calls.  I had no idea that these accusations were or against Cosby until you know until this this this guy did this bit right.  I'm thrilled that he that he spoke out about it and and and use his platform and that it and then it gained steam and this is what's going on.  I mean, look, I you know, I don't want to crucify anybody, but this is this this is what happened.  This is why I'm Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're doing the work of the angels because we need I think what we need is journalists who are really high integrity.  Journalists who will dig who will try to I mean, isn't that what the originally what this whole point of maybe actually isn't what originally journalism was about.  But at some point, you know, in the modern era, journalism started to become about people trying to find the objective facts, objective truth and giving that information to people so they could make judgments.  We've we've fallen far from that lofty goal.  I don't know.  What do you think, Mr.  Professor of Journalism?  Isn't that what it's what good journal?  See, I mean, originally, journalism was yellow journalism, right?  It was it was always until very recently journalism was about arguing a well, Matt, mass journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, back before 1605, pardon me for this Gutenberg moment, journalism was was private information with made public.  Well, not made public paid for.  Right.  And and then it took from 1605 until the steam press in the 19th century before it became mass.  Once it became mass, I the idea I keep playing around with lately and I had lunch with my my old editor, Dan, maybe start thinking about this again, is I want to play with the idea of the end of mass and that and that I gave a talk at something called news  Geist and Phoenix this weekend, which was a great unconference for my business.  And I think that the root of a lot of the problems that we have now in media is the reliance on mass, not just I don't say that as a snob.  I say that because it's a business problem.  It's corrupting.  You go after page views, you go after traffic, you go after a volume and a volume based business.  Journalism is a volume based business is inherently corrupted.  But I think the journalism as a service based business isn't and we see some hope there.  We see Chartbeat is working with the FT now to sell attention minutes and and Tony Hale, the CEO of Trump, is somebody we ought to have on at some point is quite eloquent on this on how attention can be a better measure of quality.  That's what medium and that Williams going after they're selling TTR total time read.  They believe in that it's not the only way to get us to just time spent is not necessarily.  A great measure, but there are some efforts to flee to quality here.  And I think that as we flee away from mass media economics, we may get better.  But as long as we stay with mass media economics, it's just stays pure volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In other words, promotes click bait and sensationalism.  And and and what we what we would somehow like to I would somehow like to promote is maybe they used to call it investigative journalistic class of people who who feel like who have kind of a calling a higher calling to ferreting out the truth.  You know, the Woodward and Bernstein.  And because that's this is the problem.  We don't these allegations fly back and forth.  You can get a feeling.  I mean, we all have a feeling about Uber that doesn't feel good.  It feels like there's something wrong, but we don't really know.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But do we trust the press to get it for us? Right.  So we don't anymore.  I mean, BuzzFeed is the press.  Then I trust Ben Smith.  Do you watch out for us?  You know, you probably know him, right?  Well, yeah, madam.  And I think was BuzzFeed.  I'm very critical of BuzzFeed as a last vestige of mass clickbait.  But the journalism at the same time, BuzzFeed does very good journalism and Ben Smith does as well.  And you know, cats are the new classifieds that subsidize what the good journalists at BuzzFeed do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just I'm going to have a hard time trusting BuzzFeed as a journalistic source.  I generally any of these other so-called journalistic sources that are driven by cats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I generally absolutely agree.  And I think that's that's a corrupting problem.  And that's what I said in my book.  But but then again, I think Smith himself is a good journalist and and in advice to both BuzzFeed and do some good journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's intermingled with crap.  And I have a hard time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually think less so.  Vice I think less.  So I think vice and by the way, full disclosure is on December 1st at CUNY where we are giving the Knight Innovation Award in journalism to Shane Smith advice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there you go.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I think vice is really maybe vice has reinvented itself.  You know, I think it's very it's a different device of today is very different than the vice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The vice of today is doing some really amazing reporting and proving that young people care about their.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's clearly what they're doing is they're trying to bring young people to real journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, David Carr smashed them.  Then then did a mea culpa and said no, vice is actually OK.  Yeah.  BuzzFeed, I generally agree with you, though.  There is some good stuff there.  Of Vox, which I think is wonderful, where I think it goes astray is that it's it's still going after some volume page views where it should be trying to explain things.  But the business model isn't there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, isn't that kind of the basic problem that there is no money in the kind of journalism that I'm asking for?  Or is there is there a way to do true investigative, you know, high integrity journalism and make a living?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there is.  But not in the way that it was done before.  You know, you had Piero Minriar.  His first reflex was to say, well, I need a sports section to get audience to my investigative journalism.  No, no, that's the wrong old model.  And he's not doing that now.  He's trying to figure out how to do this.  And there's and we're not there in the business models yet at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But no, I definitely think it's possible.  I just I think I'm I'm I'm just old fashioned because I mean, I you know, if you go to the top of VICE's page, really great, deep investigative and important stories.  And and then as you scroll down, they they've got a lot of sugar in here to to get you again, the young people particularly to to read it.  And it's like broccoli wrapped in cotton candy and swimming dolphins with dolphins really cure your meth addiction.  Why do Swedish students love yelling so much?  You know, put your hands in the air for World Toilet Day.  In my day, you wouldn't see this mixed in with good journalism, but maybe I just have to get over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. Well, the other one, the one that bothers me most actually, which starts with very good motives, but ends up being very cynical as up worthy, highly manipulative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'm not going to read up worthy for news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're trying to get young people to do just that because they're trying to, you know, this will change your life.  And once you know, it doesn't change your life, you don't believe them anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, Vice has an article, all the reasons why Uber is the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a list to go linking to all the critical journalism that others have done elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right next to the human billboards of New York City.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But OK, I mean, you know, this is this is interesting.  I mean, part of it is the rise of kind of social media, the fact that people go to Facebook, their Facebook note newsfeed and their Twitter timeline to get their news.  So they cop from thing to thing.  I think Twitter is so interesting to me, Leo, because you do you do long shows that do in depth discussions like the one that we're having now.  I mean, because it's you know, I think your audience is primarily the the audio listeners right from from downloading the podcast.  They're typically commuters or folks in the gym, you know, people who aren't in a position where they can hop from one list go to another one.  Upworthy Curiosity Gap headline from another on their newsfeed.  Right. But you kind of get this in-depth content.  I mean, I love that you are sort of you're living your values by doing the shows the way that you do them.  But I know that, you know, you when we've had this discussion, you know, how does video or podcast go viral?  They don't. Right. There's there's a lot.  There's there isn't a virality that can happen in this sort of medium.  There's an indefinist that can happen.  And I don't really know what the answer is.  I mean, if you're an advertising based business by its nature has to go after as many eyeballs as possible in order to support itself.  Right. So it has to be free and it has to get it has to it has to involve getting listicles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If really it has to it has to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, does it? I you know, I just I you know, I often think it's just a matter of time before I'm going to have to retire because I've the world has left me behind.  And maybe I'm just too old for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't mean for it to go there.  I was I was congratulating you on doing the job.  I only retire. I need big listicles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what we need. Big listicles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kitten listicle listicles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you did this weekend, cats, you would get two weeks traffic and then everyone would yell at you and abandon you.  And the point is you have a relationship of trust with your audience.  They're more of an audience than an audience.  They're your friends or your community.  That's the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you have a super engaged audience.  I mean, look, I can't keep up with the chat room while we while we talk.  I mean, this is like live audience.  It's amazing. It's amazing what goes on here.  When I explain this to people who don't who don't watch live, they're like, oh, that's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room saying I didn't realize there was video.  This is the first time I've ever seen video of Twig.  And it doesn't Jean look adorable in her furred hoodie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's cold here, you guys.  It's cold and I'm frightened and scared because Leo's retiring.

I wear the incredibly light.  They have an unbelievably light fleece.  Is that the heat tech?  No, that's different.  That's supposedly as you sweat warms you up.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Old.  OK, I got it.  I got. Yeah, I got to go check this out.  I've seen it. There's one thing.  They have a really nice fuzzy hoodie there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, like I said, I'm not I'm not.  I'm only written over twice.  It was in Paris the second time I was cheated by the driver who said, I don't know.  The application has crashed.  I don't know how much you owe me.  I said, well, what should I pay you?  Oh, 50 euros.  I was ripped off by.  So that's the last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, don't you just doesn't just charge you.  It was just charging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the app had crashed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And what am I going to do?  I'm not I can't.  Well, I'm not going to pay you.  I didn't want to do it.  So I just got through 50 euros at him and ran.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In France, I can see if it was it was a language issue, which there would be for me.  I could see how using an app would be a lot easier.  The money has just come to Paris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This was at the Web.  And then we don't have Uber up here, although I think Jennifer uses Uber a lot.  I think there are I know people who use Uber a lot, I guess, when they go to San Francisco.  Do you use it, Jason?  And in San Francisco?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I've never used Uber, although I will say we had Phil Nickinson and Matteo Doni on all that Android a couple of weeks ago.  And they came and went back using Uber.  They were able to get Uber here in Sonoma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you can you can press the button and says, well, there'll be an Uber car there in an hour and a half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they waited 10 minutes.  It was pretty fast.  Oh, maybe it's here now.  Well, I know.  But I don't I don't want to take Lyft either.  That looks weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that mustache thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want a pink mustache on my car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not really my vibe.  I like yellow cabs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just like a yellow cab.  That's all I want.  Just a yellow cab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although at some point they installed screens that in yellow cabs here.  And they talk at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is Michael Bloomberg and welcome.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's the worst touch screen ever.  And you have to like jab at it to turn it off a million times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a great episode of The Good Wife from like a season ago.  I'm catching up on when when our de Blasio wouldn't shut up in the cab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I remember that one.  I remember that one.  And in fact, Uber was just on the last episode without giving anything away.  I know you're watching it now.  But there was an Uber mention on the last episode of The Good Wife, which is a fantastic,  fantastic show just in terms of technology references.  But yeah, there was a moment where they were like, did you take a cab?  He said, yeah, I took an Uber and they were like, give me your phone.  We want to see the route you took.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. So I was like, oh, The Good Wife seems to be really up on all of the latest issues of privacy and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's a it's a great show.  I mean, there's a fake Google chum hum is the name of the search engine in the in the show.  And there's this ongoing case of like chum hum, you know, whatever using being a monopoly,  basically using their powers to rank results in the search engine unfairly.  Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah.  I mean, oh, they're ripped.  They rip, you know, the situations directly from the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tony Wang is just season was the last season before like his last season was the the NSA snoops.  Yes. Oh, yeah.  Would you watch it, Leo?  No, I've never seen it.  I have I have I thought that I gave up on it because I missed like the first six episodes.  I thought, well, I'll never catch up.  I'm now binge watching last season to this season and then from the beginning, I'm going to watch the whole damn thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I intentionally miss episodes because I want to binge watch everything.  I don't want to. It's great.  I highly recommend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And one of the NSA snoops was is the guy who plays Jared and Silicon Valley on HBO.  Yeah. Yes, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He is also one of the voices in Big Hero Six.  Is it Jared? It's the it's the guy with the funny weird beard.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was the was the business manager guy, the guy that got stuck out on the barge.  Love him. Love him.  Yeah, the barge. Yeah, he's great.  He's also in in that in the loop, that wonderful movie based on in the thick of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway, I'm sorry. Where are we going here?  We're going to take a break so Jeff can go answer the door.  He has been told his Nexus six is on the truck.  I keep on refreshing.  It's like it's like refreshing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do I have a new operator?  Refreshing. Do I have a new phone?  And thanks to Tony Wang, I'm going to have a tool of the week this week that comes from Uniclo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I like that.  How do you like them apples?  That's a little later on.  Yeah, you know, it's weird because Jason Howell, a host of All About Android and our producer today,  was the guy who was refreshing like right and left, right and right, left on the day that the Nexus six went online and available and was got in in the first 30 seconds and bought one.  So you got it sooner than anybody else.  I some weeks later learned that every Wednesday they put a few more on sale and I was able to snag one on the Play Store.  But Jeff, where did you get yours?  Motorola.  Motorola.  Two twig fans on Twitter alert.  God bless you both.  Alerted me.  I went on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I seem to have bought it at the very end.  Oh, that item in your check in your in your in your.  What do you call it?  Cart is no longer for sale.  So I just refreshed and I had to I try to delete the right one and boom, I had it and it's on a truck.  It's in New Jersey.  And I had to delete it.  I had to delete it.  I had to delete it.  I had to delete it.  I had to delete it.  I had to delete it.  It's on a truck.  It's on it's in New Jersey in New Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So of all, it's odd because Jeff ordered it the most recently and he's going to get his.  He's going to get his.  You're going to get mine on its way.  Yours is ordered a week after mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was I was there at the front gates and I got in and I'm waiting.  It hasn't even shipped.  I'm just saying there's no rhyme or reason here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And mine ship from China.  Mine ship from Lexington, Kentucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, oddly enough, it's a good they're all coming on UPS, right?  No, yours is FedEx.  No FedEx.  Mine's UPS.  And Jason's ships on Thursday.  I'm convinced mine's never coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mine's just never going to come.  So weird.  Mine came from Shenzhen.  Apparently T-Mobile has it now as well.  Yes, everybody has it.  Well, don't worry.  Everybody has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm starting to you know, we had Kevin Toffle on last week.  He had his.  I'm starting to hear that the battery life like on all these QHD displays, these quad HD displays,  is not the greatest.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stick with your one plus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This one plus one battery life really is.  It's unbelievable.  It is just phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we have a clear winner in battery life and it's one plus one.  Oh boy do we.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sets the standard for battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's because it's a 1080p screen.  If any of these big screen guys were 1080p, it'd be fine.  But they decided, well, we got more battery.  Let's throw more pixels at it.  More power.  More power.  And I'm curious if Lollipop is going to make that better or not.  I mean theory Lollipop does, but I'm curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of Lollipop, did either of you get it on your Nexus 7?  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nope.  I dug up my Nexus 7, which is the original Nexus 7.  So I hadn't looked at it in a while.  That thing is just slow.  Like it's just slow.  It had a ton of updates to get through, but it's stuttery and slow.  You know what I did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I put mine in my briefcase next to a magnet.  Yeah.  And it drew pixels.  No.  Oh no.  And I love this thing so much.  I ordered another one before they go out of stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have my second generation here.  I brought it in, keeping it charged on wireless.  I love Qi charging, by the way.  You got to love that.  And so just sitting on the dock there.  And every once in a while I check.  We know now though, thanks to a post on Reddit by a Google engineer,  the story of the updates.  And I will tell you the story of the updates when we come back.  Why you are getting an update, but you aren't.  And so forth and so on.  Yeah.  We now know the truth about all of this.  But first a word from our friends at SmartThings.  SmartThings was a wonderful Kickstarter project to create a hub  for your smart home that would understand everything you have in the smart home  and allow you to set up a smart automated system  without a lot of muss and fuss to give you home security,  to allow you to control things like your lights and your music.  SmartThings is so cool.  Get a notification if someone you don't know tries to enter your house  or get an alert to prevent a small leak from becoming a major flood.  Yes, they have moisture sensors.  Control and automate your lights and your small appliances wherever you go.  Stay connected to your family by getting notifications of when people come and go  and protect valuable items and secure areas that are off limits.  SmartThings is so cool.  And of course you control it all with a mobile app on your iPhone or your Android device.  They have a huge number of sensors, but it all starts with the hub, the SmartThings hub.  In fact, a great way to start is to work with the kits that they offer.  They have a variety of kits available.  Security kits, but also kits designed to get things done,  like the water detection kit I mentioned, which has the sensors that will detect moisture.  You can get instant push or text notifications whenever moisture is found in a particular area,  basement, a stairwell, a laundry room.  You can monitor temperatures if you're worried about the pipes freezing in your cabin or your Brooklyn home.  You can have notifications there.  And this is the nicest thing about SmartThings.  If you've got a Nest thermostat or a Honeywell or an Eon, it talks to those too.  So you can use the SmartThings hub and the SmartThings units,  but you can also use DropCam, Sonos, the Philips Hue, Logitech, and of course your Nest thermostat.  Furthermore, if you're a developer, you can also create new ways to use SmartThings  and publish them for everyone else to use. It works with If Then, Then That.  I can just go on and on. It works with your Schlage locks, your Kwikset locks,  your Trane heating system, your Sonos, your Foscam, your Belkin, with your WhyThings.  Now we've got solution kits starting at $170 for Twit fans, home security kits starting at $350.  Each of them, of course, starts with the hub and then has the devices you need to add additional capabilities.  You'll be getting a smart home in less than 15 minutes plus free shipping within the US.  SmartThings.com slash Twit.  And the deal is use the offer code TWIT10 at checkout to get 10% off any home security or solution kit.  TWIT10, T-W-I-T-1-0, at checkout, SmartThings.com slash Twit.  It's such a good solution.  Did you get your Kickstarter reward yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Didn't you buy it on Kickstarter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did. I backed the Kickstarter. It was a while ago. It was like 2012.  Oh, so you got it by then.  Yeah. So I got my kit a long time ago. And in fact, I'm pretty sure the version that I got is out of date at this point in the one they're shipping.  It was an early prototype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it's so much improved. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's awesome. I love SmartThings from the get-go.  I had it hooked up. I think I told you I had it hooked up to my mailbox, my postal mailbox outside.  So when the mail got dropped in, I got a push notification on my phone, which was awesome.  So awesome.  Yeah, it's a great product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or when the FedEx guy throws your Nexus 6 over the fence.  Exactly.  Yeah, then you'll know it's here.  Katie has just arrived home from school. This is so cool.  So she has in her backpack the little thing that's a presence sensor.  And you'll get a text message when your kids arrive back from school, that kind of thing. It's just so neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I had one on at a stroller, so I knew it was in that box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really the coolest thing ever. I don't know what this guy's doing, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  SmartThings.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  slash twit

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so a good posting by a Google engineer on Reddit kind of cleared up a little bit.  You know, so many people, and it's still happening now, were so anxious to get Android 5.0 Lollipop on their  Nexus 5, their Nexus 4, their Nexus 7, their Motorola X, that they were downloading the, you know, the jar files and trying to install them.  And he posted, PSA, do not clear data for Google service framework.  So a lot of people are doing this, apparently, and it just screws everything up.  But furthermore explained that here's how these rollouts work. Did I explain this last week?  No.  I explained it on twit.  Yeah, yeah, on twit.  I'm sorry if I'm repeating myself. I'm getting old.  So what he said is one percent. So here's how it works.  They've got the new Lollipop 5. It has been tested. The releases are out. They've even released the, you know, the full APK, or I guess it's a jar file for each of the phones.  So if you really, you know, wanted to, you can install it, but don't. What they do first, they roll it out to one percent randomly.  And he said, it doesn't matter how much you press refresh.  Remember, we were wondering last week if actually pressing refresh could screw it up, you know, asking too many times, can I have the update?  He said, doesn't matter. He said, you're either in the on the bus or you're off the bus. If you're on the bus, you're in the one percent, you'll get it.  If not, you can refresh as many times you want. You're not going to get it.  And it's not going to make it any worse because if there are no big massive bugs, we've heard a couple, but I don't think there are any massive bugs in the next week.  And this is the next week now, I think 25 percent will get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's a big jump. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So now 26 percent of all owners of Moto X's or Nexus 5's or Nexus 4's probably should have Lollipop or we'll get it in the next day or so.  The next jump is another 25 percent and then the final 25 percent.  So it takes it's three or four weeks to roll out the whole thing.  And there's nothing you can do. You can't force the update. You could sideload it.  But it seems to me sideloading causes some issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, yeah, I mean, I guess one percent is actually quite a few users and it makes sense that they would stage the rollout.  And honestly, you know, maybe you don't want to be in the one percent, you know, the canary in the coal mine.  The people, you know, right.  Because with software, you really you can test and test and test.  This is a lesson I have to learn over and over again.  You never see you don't see the bug or the bug doesn't happen until actual users get it.  And then and then you want to jump off a cliff.  So it makes sense that they do one percent.  Although we were saying last night on all about Android or at least I was saying, you know, I wish that I wish that Google could just detect the people who are manually tapping check now.  Because those are the people who really care and really want it.  And they can just win so many hearts by putting those people in the one percent.  You know what I'm saying? Or the first 25 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There ought to be like a fan's club that that you know, you're a loyal user.  You get you get early, early take on it.  If I've bought every damn Nexus product there, I have.  And I have. And if you happen to have written a kiss ass book about the company and I have, you know, at least you get the stuff early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, some sort of opt in. Yeah. Super fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But well, and this is all companies do this.  You can be a super fan, you know, if you get in the beta program or whatever.  But understand you're also you're you're also, you know, cannon fodder.  You're the first one over the hill. Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Right. And maybe they don't want us, you know, want a superfans platform to be talking about the buggy.  Exactly. Don't upgrade to Lollipop.  It's really buggy. You know, that's it's dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This one is from Jeff Jarvis. I'm guessing it to Google.  Google now joins dumb TV news reports on what we've long known.  Thanksgiving holiday traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are they going to have somebody standing? What's it called?  A standout or a stand in?  Oh, right. Stand up.  Stand up. A stand up. Somebody say I'm standing in front of I five and it's a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. It was like this magnificent data and they tell us, guess what?  Wednesday has a lot of traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you got to admit the infographic on the day after Thanksgiving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't you tell me that the infographic is well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. But in interestingly, Boston is Tuesday.  Honolulu is Saturday.  Providence is Saturday and San Francisco is Saturday.  So there are exceptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you must leave on Wednesday, skip the rush.  This is just an infographic exercise.  Yeah, that's all it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We actually had fun on Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you get a chance to watch triangulation, I interviewed Gareth Cook,  who's the author of The Best Infographics of 2014.  And there's some really good ones.  We talked about bad infographics, clickbait infographics and all of that.  But there's some really nice, it can be done well.  Good news for local travelers.  Thanksgiving Day traffic is a breeze.  They have a turkey in a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the turkey's trying to get away from the table.  Run, run!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Get me out of here.  It says Thanksgiving Day traffic is a breeze.  It usually has the least traffic of the entire week.  For traffic gurus looking to best, even the lightest traffic days,  make sure you stay off the road between noon and two on Thanksgiving Day.  That's not clear.  I don't understand what they're saying.  Even the lightest...  Traffic...  Actually, that's crappy.  Whatever they wrote there, because I don't understand what I'm supposed to do.  Stay off the road between noon and two.  It's the best day for good traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me read this again.  Thanksgiving Day traffic is a breeze.  It usually has the least traffic in the entire week.  Semicolon.  For the traffic gurus looking to best, even the lightest traffic days,  make sure you stay off the road between noon and two on Thanksgiving Day.  So they're saying on the best day, the worst at two hours,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and between 12 and two.  Thank you for translating.  Right? That's what it sounds like.  See, this is the intelligence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The intelligence that you bring to think up.  Trying to parse what the hell these people are saying in 140 characters.  I don't understand.  Basically, my entire full-time job is trying to come up with a sentence

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that someone would say, maybe a conversation,  expressing what a piece of data means.  And it's not easy.  You're doing a deal, by the way.  We should mention this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's the website I should go to?  Thank you.  It's goodwebbundle.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're doing a holiday promotion.  Think Up got together with four of our favorite sites.  Milkshake, Metafilter, The Toast, and Newsblur.  And we're offering something similar to Humble Bundle,  not affiliated with Humble Bundle, but similar to Humble Bundle,  in that you can buy a one-year membership to all of these sites  in one shot for $96, which sounds like a lot of money,  but if you pay for them at normal price outside of the bundle,  it would be almost $200, so it's about 50% off.  And these are just a bunch of sites, you know,  given the Uber story and the sort of model of startup that's like super-funded  and just trying to take over the world using all these crazy tactics.  I think there are still a lot of small businesses on the web  that are run through donations and through subscriptions,  and I count my company as one of those.  So this is one way to support sites like that.  And hopefully, you know, one of these sites you've never heard of before,  you'll discover something good.  And if you buy the bundle, you get a coupon code,  you can use it all five sites.  And if you already have a membership, you can give it away to a friend.  It's a great gift for your online hero.  And yeah, so it's goodwebbundle.com.  It's a one-time deal, a year's membership to five really great sites.  And yeah, thanks, Leo. Thanks for letting me plug it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's the update on Metafilter?  Wasn't Matt going to retire it or something?  I mean, what happened with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Metafilter had actually just redesigned.  Look how beautiful it looks. It looks amazing.  Oh, so nice. It needed this a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It hadn't changed much in years.  It did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, Metafilter is a really interesting story  of how Google ranking really affects a business.  I mean, Metafilter was running, was actually,  they were a case study for Google Adsense.  Google made them a case study, and there was a page on Google  describing how great Metafilter did in terms of running Google Ads.  And they made some changes to their algorithm.  They started to derank older pages.  So Ask Metafilter, for example, is a fantastic resource,  but there were threads that were old that were certainly content  that was perfectly good, but the pages were just older,  had been updated in a while, and they got deranked,  and their revenue took a big hit.  So Matt had to do, you know, had to size down his staff,  and he did a donation push earlier this year,  and they got back on their feet, and they did this beautiful redesign,  which you can see, and I think they even launched a new TV-centric Metafilter site.  This is great.  It's doing well. It's on stable ground right now, and really, yeah, fanfare.  That's the new Metafilter site. All the Metafilter sites are great.  I mean, this is a site that's been around.  I mean, Matt was running Metafilter on a single box, like, underneath his desk,  back when he was working on Blogger, like, in 1999.  Like, this is an old school, he's always run it independently  with a staff of moderators.  All these sites, you know, do read the comments.  You know, none of these sites tolerate abusive behavior.  There's fantastic conversations going on here.  I just love Metafilter. It's been so good for so many years.  It's such a great, well-moderated, fairly moderated,  and ardently moderated community. It's fantastic.  So, we're really happy that they're in the bundle with us,  and they're a fantastic site to support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, you'll be basically buying a supporting membership, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly, right. So, on Metafilter, each site, you get a little something different.  On Metafilter, you get a little, you know, I'm a supporting member badge on your account,  so people can see that you help fund the site.  And, yeah, but through the bundle, you can get that at half  the normal suggested donation amount for a year.  Yeah.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is awesome. And the random thing is fun,  because it's their entire life of Metafilter.  So, there's stuff from year 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's crazy. It's been around, yeah, 14 years. Geez.  More than that, I think.  Metafilter is an amazing, is really sort of an amazing case study  of like what, you know, a dude who started a first group blog, you know,  could do, built an entire career and business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'll be back earlier days, you know, he had existential crises  at various points in the life of Metafilter, and has kept going on with value added.  It really is a great story, as you say, about how you can adapt to these changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. He really, Matt, Matt has, it's been,  he really has reckoned with some of the hardest, you know, moments.  I mean, I think there are a few moments of being shut down.  He had offers, you know, to get, you know, to be bought, which he never did.  I mean, he is the guru on great community, you know, moderation.  And he struggled with ads, and he struggled with dealing with, you know,  what a change to Google's algorithm can do to his business.  And he's really come out on top. It's an amazing community.  It's really old school, amazing community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And, you know, I can tell how much I like Metafilter,  because unfortunately I'm starting to read the article.  It's like, oh, wait, I got to read that. Oh, yeah, well, that's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right. Anyway, that's, so if you want to support a lot of really great stuff,  the Good Web Bundle would be a great holiday gift.  And if you already have a ThinkUp subscription, as I do,  you can give that offer code to somebody else.  You can unbundle the bundle for 90 cents bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, exactly. If you only want two of the sites, you take the two you want,  and you can give the other two away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's nice. And you're supporting some really great sites.  I was looking at Milkshake before the show. That's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Milkshake is really fun.  Milkshake is one of those undersung heroes.  I've not heard of them.  Yeah, yeah, you haven't heard about it. Right.  It's made by a husband and wife team, Andre and Amber.  It's just got so much personality and fun.  So awesome.  Yeah, it's really well designed.  And actually, Andre's at Slack now.  Oh, neat.  Yeah, there's some great content there.  And so we're really happy to team up with them as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh-oh, we're losing Leona at Milkshake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love Milkshake. So Milkshake is like people put images up and share them.  It's kind of like Pinterest for images, but it's got a kind of wicked sense of humor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, you create a shake, and it's a stream of images,  and the community attracted just happens to be really big on animated gifs  and really kind of funny, quirky humorous images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to buy this bundle because already that's three sites now I love.  I got it. This is awesome. And a great site for discovery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So our show today brought to you by Prosper.com.  It actually is a great...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And now it's time for the Google Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's Gina Trapani with the latest from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is something I'm really excited about.  I love Google Keep, a fantastic note taking app with a fantastic widget.  Works on Android and the web.  Well, one of the most requested features that they get for Keep just rolled out.  You can now share notes and collaborate in real time on Keep Notes.  This is really awesome, you guys.  If you need to share a grocery list with your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Broke this, exactly what I want to use this for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it checks it off as you're in the store buying stuff.  Lisa will see that I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly, exactly.  Very, very cool stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Way, way back in the day, I worked with a German company that was going to do that on the web.  This is going back to 1999.  And it was always a great idea.  Now it's finally done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, it's like I make a to do app and there's tons of apps out there that let you collaborate.  There's note taking apps and there's list apps.  I have to say I love Keep because it's tied to your Google account.  It's really lightweight.  I actually use Evernote and Keep.  But it's great just for collaborating without asking somebody.  I mean, I guess you do have to download the Keep app.  But you don't have to sign up.  It's just really, really simple and easy and lightweight.  You can add check boxes, remove check boxes.  So the sharing collaboration is really, really nice.  You can also filter your notes by color because you can change the notes to your color,  whether or not they have images or audio, whether or not they're shared.  So it's easier for you to sort out your notes and see the ones that you're sharing with your, you know,  business co-workers or better half or whatever.  So really nice.  And it's got that reminder built in.  Love Keep.  Love Keep.  I feel like Keep is one of Google's most undersung products actually.  Right.  You're right.  A couple of other little nice upgrades.  Google's search results on mobile now let you know if the site is mobile friendly.  Okay.  So if you do search and you get your search results on your phone, on your mobile device,  you'll see a little label that says mobile friendly if the site that it's linking to is mobile friendly.  It looks good on your small screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does that mean it's a mobile site or it's just if mobile responsive, would that count?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that responsive would count.  And I would love to know the story behind how they're automatically detecting this actually.  So yeah, it doesn't appear to be just sites that have like an M, you know, mobile dot whatever dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because that's kind of not the modern web anymore.  That is the modern web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  The modern web is sites that are responsive and just change the screen.  It does not appear to be that.  So really nice way to kind of choose choose what what sites you go through based on whether or not they're going to look good on your phone.  Similar change.  Weather is now in Google Maps.  So I tried this out with a couple of places and got mixed results.  I searched for London, England, like in the screenshot there, and I didn't see the weather.  But then I searched for Brooklyn, New York, and I did get the weather.  Anyway, it's a little Google now style card right below the place you search for.  That'll tell you what the weather is there.  So I can look at places in California and be jealous of how sunny and gorgeous it is in there while I while I shiver here in Brooklyn.  I think it was last week that I talked about or two weeks ago.  I talked about how you have Google search on mobile now has you can flip a coin.  OK, Google, flip a coin.  I'll flip a coin for you.  There's a couple of other ones there.  It didn't work.  I think when we tried it live on the show, we hadn't gotten the update yet.  It does work for me now.  Leo probably still does for you does for you as well.  Good.  There's also roll a die.  So Google will roll a six sided die for you.  Oh, they will. Oh, good.  They will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, not a 20 sided, though.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder.  I didn't try roll a 20 sided die.  We should maybe maybe try that.  OK, Google, by default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me see if we can roll a 20 sided die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hello.  It activated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Roll a 20.  OK, Google.  Oh, shut up.  I just my timing is everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Roll a 20 sided die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So close.  I was so sure that roll die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I'm using a Galaxy Note.  Maybe that Google's just not up to date.  I don't know what's going on now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's translating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thinking, thinking, working.  Can't reach Google at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Whoa.  I hate it when that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Roll a die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't like to say no, it didn't work.  You must have gotten the update.  Sorry about that.  I did the same thing I did to you last week.  The other thing that you could do.  Game of Thrones fans.  Just Google Hoder.  It'll talk back to you.  I love that order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it working this week?  We tried last week.  It didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It did.  It worked for me this time around.  Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, see now my watch is listening.  So confusing.  Help me Obi-Wan.  And then the phone gets kind of snarky and says,  you shouldn't be talking to me while your watch is listening.  Huh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hodor, Hodor, Hodor, Hodor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hodor, Hodor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Love Hodor.  And then the, Hodor.  Anyway, so I, you know, I'm a sucker for these Easter eggs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These are ways to impress your friends and family at Thanksgiving, folks.  So there you go.  Google tricks.  Google tricks for turkey day.  Who's Hodor?  What's Hodor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you talking about, Hodor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's the Google change log.  Hodor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's gonna, you know, I think that the, that Hodor thing,  people aren't going to know what that means in a few years.  Yeah, it's probably a fleeting thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a fleeting, do they still have the Klingon?  I think they probably still have Google and Klingon.  That's another one that's just kind of a nerdy fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Hodor, for those who don't know, is a character in Game of Thrones  that can say but one thing, and that thing is Hodor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's also his name.  Yeah, they should do it for Groot.  Groot, same thing.  I am Groot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am Groot.  That's all he can say.  But he says it in such expressive way, you know what he's talking about.  By the way, Ingress is two years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Whoa, time flies.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Remember we were all like, I want to get an invite, I want to play Ingress.  Several of our staffers play Ingress and log miles, miles playing the thing.  It's crazy.  In fact, here's the infographic.  Hypothesis, Google GPS based game, cracking the code on healthier lifestyle,  urban exploration and discovery.  200 plus countries, 64 million resonators deployed.  That's part of the game is deploying resonators.  178 million portals visited.  Are the portals all geographic locations?  They must be, right?  52,000 event attendance, 127 million kilometers walked.  Ingress, as you play it, logs your distance traveled.  So that's pretty awesome.  Pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that is pretty great.  Good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why get it?  Three million portals created, 178 million visited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm even more overwhelmed by the thought of playing Ingress now  than I was two years ago when it was introduced.  It seems like a world that I just don't know that I'm willing to commit to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what happens.  If you got in at the beginning, it wouldn't be so.  But Jeff Needles plays it and he walks miles.  Padre.  Padre plays it.  It's really kind of...  At the whole time when we first saw this,  we surmised it was some sort of Google plan to gather location information.  In fact, I think it was a Google plan to get everybody walking.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or so they want us to think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who knows what they're up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was the net effect of the Niantic project?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We had crossed a threshold.  People's security could be at risk.  Ingress is not a game.  That was the mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Light this is not psychosis or some cognitive break.  But an actual...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Niantic Labs which created this is inside Google, right?  Is this a 20% project or is this an actual...  What? Is this a business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ...attracts people but attracts events.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's going on with my sound?  ...is to monitor the effects of mind hacking.  Obviously this will be done with the highest of security.  It's really a neat idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is. I found it a little too all-consuming to play but...  It is all-consuming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just got places to go.  I don't know.  Walking around...  You got a life.  I just couldn't...  It wasn't my thing but I totally get it.  And I love that people love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If I lived in a city like you do, I would really be more likely to use it.  The problem is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and in fact, I should revisit it now that I'm here in Brooklyn  because I found that being in San Diego, which is not nearly the area that I was in,  is not nearly as walkable as here.  It was not easy to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  .getglass in our chat room points out that Niantic is also the company or the group that did Field Trip.  Right, that's right.  Which is a similar idea but as Field Trip will give you narration as you wander your town  about sites of interest, which is also a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I had to turn off Field Trip in New York because it buzzed so much.  Every other block was something something had been filmed or was some sort of historical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there's about five in Petaluma that kept coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only port's here. The only port's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you know that Finding the Abbot was shot here in 1987?  Relative Wave...  They do a Mac app called Form, an interaction design and prototyping app.  It was just acquired by Google.  It's an $80 app design tool and Google is now going to give it away.  That's pretty very interesting news.  I haven't used Form. It's for designers and developers.  It doesn't make an app but it lets you design an app. Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, so the user interface.  So you can lay out your screens and put down your buttons and your drop downs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's certainly the first stage to making an app. It just doesn't let you put code in there.  It's IA, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's IA, right. And contrary to popular belief, that's the hardest part.  Getting that right is the hardest part. Writing the code is just filling in the blanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're doing it right now for our new Twitter website.  And it is fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you're doing all JavaScript APIs and Node and so the front end is going to be like a client that consumes the JSON?  It sounds amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, that's true. It just makes me cry to think of it.  So what we're doing, we are Drupal right now. If you go to twit.tv, it's a Drupal website.  We are not abandoning Drupal. What we're going to do is what they call Headless Drupal.  So the Drupal will maintain a MySQL database with all the information about shows and hosts and everything else.  But instead of being responsible for display on the screen as a traditional Drupal site is,  Drupal is a really robust, nice content management system, but its displays don't look super up to date.  It's a lot of work to get it to look really cool and neat.  So the company that we're working with in Austin, they're called Four Kitchens, they suggest,  and they've done this for a couple of other companies, the Tonight Show website has done this way for NBC.  It's Headless Drupal. So they still use Drupal, but Drupal is now an API.  And one of the consumers, but not the only consumer of the API, is a website that's written in Node.js.  So, yeah, just as you said, the website is actually just a JavaScript entity that is doing calls to the API saying,  OK, well, what's the name of the show? What's the picture? What's the video? Whatever.  And putting it up on the website. So it's kind of...  I approve.  I approve too. It feels modern. It feels very modern.  And the reason we did this is because we realized that the web is not so important as it used to be,  that really we see our consumers, most of the consumers of our content, doing it on mobile.  So what we want to do is have an API that can be consumed by a variety of things.  A website is just one. A mobile app would be another.  And we're going to make a public API so that if you'd like to write a little Ruby or Python or something,  you'll be able to write a little app if you want, because the API is public and freely available.  So you'll be able to query. Right now there is an API in effect to all podcasts.  It's the RSS feed, but this is going to go so much more beyond that.  Yeah, it's so limited, right? That's great. That's awesome, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Crazy.  Yeah, designing an API can be hard, but that's great.  I'm excited. And I'm really...  The fourkitchens guys are great. Gals and guys are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we're doing the Internet. So there's two phases of development.  There's the API development, the Drupal development, and then there's the UI for the web.  So we're in the middle of the information architecture, the IA for the website right now.  Right, because that's really going to define your API, right? You want to design from the outside in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a two-way street. So we also talk to app developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What would an API have? In fact, we consume it internally.  We have a program we use called Elroy that is the generator of the content and the feeds and stuff.  So the editor, when he finishes editing the show, he creates a mezzanine file, which is a high-quality file,  which he then gives Elroy. And he puts all the metadata in Elroy.  That's going to start moving to Drupal, but he then feeds that to Elroy.  And Elroy churns and makes all the different versions, uploads it to YouTube and the CDN.  It posts the feed, creates the feed and posts it. It does all this stuff automatically.  So Elroy will also be a consumer of the API.  Very nice. That's exciting.  It seems like the right way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds good to me. I'm sold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It seemed like a good idea at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You say if you're sold, we'll see if we're sold in a year.  It's definitely the right way to do it.  Modularity.  You know what it all came from is that the web moves so fast you can no longer,  you don't want to do a redesign every six months or a year. It's too expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It makes a lot of sense to separate the front end from the back end, right?  And have clients and yeah, it makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it makes sense in my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this a news flash? I just saw a tweet that Firefox is a renewal of Google as default worldwide search came up.  And in the US it's going to be Yahoo search, Russia yet next.  That's a huge story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  I'll tell you why that's a huge story because Mozilla, the nonprofit open source foundation that does Firefox, makes millions every year from Google.  Like tens of millions.  So how does this work? I wonder.  And the reason is because that's the default search in that little search window or actually it'll be in the awesome bar.  That's where you go. And those search results, Google gives a cut of money made from those search results to Mozilla.  And that's been what's kept the foundation going.  So that's a shocker.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Yahoo must be paying them as much, no? I mean for them to leave.  I guess that's where.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe more.  Well, the cash is going from them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe more. You know what? Firefox seems to be moving in the direction of being the privacy browser.  You know, just as Apple is distinguishing itself from Android by saying, well, we care about your privacy, Google doesn't.  Firefox lately seems to be doing the same.  And so that makes sense.  They might move away from Google, not that Yahoo is in any way going to protect your privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I kind of expected DuckDuckGo to announce something with Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, one of the things Firefox did do yesterday in the latest version is make DuckDuckGo an easy choice in their search.  It's one of the default searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes sense.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, wow. Yeah, that is a breaking story.  Big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other story I find fascinating, if I may, is the Google project that auto captions photos.  You see that one in the rundown?  How do they know?  It's like one of the photos is two dogs running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, this is the beginning. Isn't this the beginning of Skynet, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty amazing if they can start to interpret images.  Look at some of those examples.  Two hockey players fighting over the puck.  Well, that you can pretty much say on anybody who has a mask on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, can I get this or is this something internal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a project right now. It's a project.  But this is pretty phenomenal that this kind of recognition of images and translation into searchable, analyzable, findable text.  A herd of elephants walking across a dry grass field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's some smarts. I mean, so they're turning the Knowledge Graph inside out, right?  They're showing us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hat with a wide brim dog. Dog wearing hat with a wide brim would be the...wow.  That's pretty impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the one. The group of people shopping at an outdoor market.  There are many vegetables at the fruit stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you're like at a fourth, four-year-old level.  Yeah, but geez.  That's impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is...yeah. This is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a research paper. But wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not tapping this into Google Glass or something like that.  I could like accessibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For the first time in a year.  That's...yeah.  You know, I was thinking about the other day. I went to the Barnes and Noble and ended up going to the men's room.  I'm sure you're glad you know that.  I saw the braille on the door.  And I'm thinking, you know, how does one person find the damn door to do the braille?  And I'm thinking, well, there's no reason you couldn't have a map of the store and directions in the store and audio directions to say 20 steps forward, two to the right.  There's the men's room.  But you start to map out the world in these ways.  Phenomenal things can happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, or...Fourben. Colossus the Fourben Project.  It could go either way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like the examples that are completely wrong.  So there's a photo of a parking sign and it's a refrigerator filled with lots of food and drinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Close enough.  Close enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if the dog is catching the frisbee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The yellow school bus parked in a parking lot.  That's actually not too far off.  The refrigerator is the worst one here.  The other one is a dog catching the frisbee.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can see how it might make that mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The dog isn't even jumping in that picture.  For those of you listening on audio, we're just looking at really simple pictures and misinterpretations.  But it's still phenomenal.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to download this.  I can be an actor.  I can be a computer engineer for my Kindle right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that the Barb book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So Gizmodo published this yesterday and already that's what we were seeing on Milkshake.  I couldn't figure out why on Milkshake I was seeing all these Barbie images.  Apparently there's a book you can buy.  You can say it's on the run down.  Is it?  No, you got it.  That's a Gizmodo book.  Barbie, I can be a computer engineer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And God bless. God bless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's just take a look at breakfast one morning.  Barbie's already hard at work on our laptop.  What are you doing Barbie? asks Skipper.  I'm designing a game that shows kids how computer's work explains Barbie.  You can make a robot puppy do cute tricks by matching up colored blocks.  Okay.  Okay.  Not so bad.  Your robot puppy is sweet says Skipper.  Can I play your game?  Oh, I'm only creating the design ideas Barbie says laughing.  I'll need Stephen and Brian's help to turn it into a real game.  Oh, it gets worse.  Barbie tries to email her design to Stephen, but suddenly her screen starts blinking.  Is this real or is this the jokes?  This is real.  Oh no.  That's weird says Barbie.  Barbie and Skipper try to reboot the computer, but nothing happens.  Looks like you've got a virus big sister says Skipper.  Luckily I wear my flash drive and a necklace so I'll always remember to back up my work replies Barbie.  When Barbie Barbie puts her flash drive into skippers laptop, the screen starts blinking.  Oh no says Barbie.  The virus must be on the flash drive.  I forgot to back up my homework assignment cries Skipper and all my music files are lost too.  Fortunately, and by the way, then she hits playfully hits Barbie with a pillow because that's always fun when girls have pillow fights.  Barbie has a lot of fun with kids.  Barbie makes it to computer class just before the bell rings.  As soon as the class begins, Barbie raises her hand.  Yes Barbie asks Ms. Smith, the teacher.  If your computer gets a virus and crashes, how can you retrieve all the files you lost?  Ask Barbie and then Ms. Smith gives it a fairly good answer.  Not so bad.  Remove the hard drive.  But let's let's go.  Let's go talk to Stephen and Brian, the geeks.  Hi guys says Barbie.  I tried to send my designs but I ended up crashing my laptop and skippers too.  I need to get back the lost files and repair both of our laptops.  It'll go faster if Brian and I help offers Stephen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, you want to take a ride my Uber?  Great says Barbie.  Stephen, can you hook up skippers hard drive to the library computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sure says Stephen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The library computer has excellent security software to protect you from the virus.  The library computer has excellent security software to protect you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anyway, so that's the meme now is to take these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you go to the rundown, last thing under other, it's make your own Barbie computer.  Thank God for Brian and skipper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's all I can say because Barbie and Stephen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I actually I didn't read that story.  I saw it a few times.  I avoided it because I'm so worried that Barbie is like inevitably in my future.  Like like that I'm going to work with Barbie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To be fair, as bad as this is, it could be worse.  I mean, they are.  It would have been I mean, Ms. Smith is the female teacher is smart and computers and yeah, computer class Barbie presents the game she designed.  Mrs. Smith is so impressed that she gives Barbara extra credit.  Barbie's terrific computer skills have saved the day for both sisters.  I guess I can be a computer engineer, says Barbie happily.  So she she discovered it doesn't.  It's about what you'd expect.  The only thing that's really bad is when she says, I'm not designing the game.  I'm just I'm just drawing the designs.  I need Stephen and Brian's help to turn it into a real game.  That's where maybe you could have left that line out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, what was it?  I don't know.  It could be worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It could be worse.  Listen, I'm never going to look at look to Barbie for a progressive take on where you're going to be, Gina, where I used to go is American Girl.  I that is another aspect of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I love the American girl.  That was not too bad.  It was not too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the stories are actually very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, American Girl was fine.  And Abby and I went to Chicago to the American Girls Doll Museum and we had tea.  They have a little chair at the table for your doll and her tea.  And and the stories are, I think, pretty now I have to link.  Think back.  Pretty empowering.  They're all about young women in history going into a bunch of historic periods.  And it's I think they're all powerful and good.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pretty much. Yeah.  Yeah. No, they're OK, Gina.  Really, really.  The stories are here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's here's an example of the Internet's response to Barbie.  So Barbie sitting at the computer, Skippy skipper is boring instead of saying, oh, no, I'm just designing it.  I'm going to ask the boys to do the work.  She says, poor mine with an extra espresso shot says some scrub decide to link directly to Atlas instead of generic blast and Lopak.  So now I have to write patches to get this BS to link against Accelerate framework instead.  I am not about to pollute slash user slash local slash lib with a bunch of stupid dependencies.  This awful shared library model is why Linux can't have nice things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's my Barbie.  Awesome. That is awesome.  That's my Barbie.  That's what I'm going to do with that.  In these situations, I'm going to we're going to rewrite the story.  All right.  Let's take the panels and hack it.  How do you just get to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because she can't read yet.  So you just read it to her this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I you have no idea.  I change the words.  My wife laughs and laughs every line about the girl girl loving hot pink.  I'm like, oh, I really hate last night.  I changed the words.  I say, Mama and Mommy.  I mean, I just.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love to riff on on kids books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if you all of a sudden see a lot of Barbie and computers in your meme feed, that's where that's coming from.  That's what the response has been pretty darn excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to have her publish her own books.  That's what I'm going to go.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Give her a copy of vellum.  Let her let her have at it.  Get nuts.  The oral history of the poop emoji by Fast Company.  Nice reading.  Did you put this in here?  No, I did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry about that, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is this is important journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It said the word Google and I was like, OK, there's a Google story.  Yeah, there we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The poo emoji.  Poo emoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's good.  It's good for actually it's a history of emojis and et cetera, et cetera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you go up three, the compilation of videos about the Internet from the 80s and 90s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, we've played some of those on our show.  OK, they're great.  They're hysterical.  And I'm frankly, I'm guilty of I'm guilty for some of these because I, of course, did  a PBS show called The Internet exclamation mark, which I try to explain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other good video is the office is these are all from Andy Bio.  This is Andy Bio's channel on the end.  It's great.  Great list.  I want to see Steve Allen and Jane Meadows computer video from 1984.  What the what?  This is the VHS era Internet.  Which a lot of the graphics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Computability starring Steve Allen, which most of our heads never heard of and Jane Meadows

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  index home cassette has been indexed with a color code for your convenience.  The introduction.  I got to jump ahead a little bit.  Let's just see.  Let's just see some hacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's the guy who eats drinks and sleeps computers.  Now, a hacker would definitely own a modem.  This is a device that changes the electronic impulses in the computer into sounds that  can be carried over a telephone line.  Very useful for communicating with other computers, data banks, information services, et cetera.  As you'll see, tape drives, tape drives are much slower than the disk type because they  store the data sequentially.  I love her faux British accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Most of which you'll never need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'll pick up a lot of them the more you work with your kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kids actresses in the thirties and forties often affected British accents, even though  they were from the Bronx.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what's with the hair?  I guarantee in a few weeks you'll be using these terms as easily as counting from one  to ten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have no idea what any of them mean, but I'm reading the teleprompter well.  But you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have to say I love Steve Allen and Jane Meadows, so I'm going to watch this.  Look at his hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think his hair is higher than hers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is just what he's like at home.  But we're going to show you some multitude of things, a computer of reasonable...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Steve Allen invented The Tonight Show practically.  Many of the jokes that you see people like Letterman and even Fallon do now were started  by Steve Allen.  All right, let's do a commercial.  Unless you see one more story, if you find something you want, the poop emoji grabbed me.  I thought it might.  I thought it might, yeah.  This is good news.  We talked about this on Security Now.  WhatsApp is going to add end-to-end encryption from the open source text secure messaging  system.  That's from Open Whisper Systems.  That is a really strong encryption, strong solution.  Of course, as soon as it's within WhatsApp, maybe you don't know exactly how they implement  it, but I think this is really great news.  And it shows that Facebook, I think Facebook's kind of thinking, along with these other big  companies, Google and Apple and Microsoft, how can we get out from under the NSA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's not forget that the bill to restrict the NSA was defeated yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Failed.  Yep.  What it was is they, it's one of those weird votes.  They needed a super majority because it was a vote to debate.  And so they needed 60 votes.  They only got 50.  That's how your government works.  Or not.  That's the case, maybe.  All right, let's wrap this up.  I think we got all the big stories in here.  And we're going to get your tip and number and tool of the week in just a minute.  But first, a word from Squarespace.  That's my tip of the week.  Get your website, Hy-The over to Squarespace.com, the best website hosting and content management  system all in one.  We were talking about Google and the search results, letting you know whether a site is  mobile friendly.  All Squarespace sites are automatically mobile friendly because their templates are all mobile  responsive.  That means the design looks great no matter what size screen.  You don't even have to think about it.  Start with 25, actually more.  They keep adding new templates, beautiful templates.  Many of them designed for specific categories like musicians or artists or architects or  chefs.  That gives you a great starting point.  The band template, Horizon, for instance, has a tour dates page, a music player, and  a merchandise store.  In fact, all the Squarespace templates are e-commerce enabled, which is nice.  Even if you just want to do a wedding register, all cash reading registry or donations for  a school library.  Squarespace 7 is new and it really adds some nice features, including the ability to live  edit on a single screen so you don't have to go back and forth between preview and site  manager.  You can even preview designs in device mode so you'll see how your design will look on  a tablet or a mobile device.  You get instant access to professional stock photography from Getty, instant branded email  set up with Google Apps.  And the new developer platform is so sweet.  If you are a guru of web design, if you're a JavaScript or CSS or HTML user, you'll love  the dev platform with color coded syntax and all.  Easy to use, but if you need help, 24-7 support from their offices, live chat and email, 24-7  plus self-help articles, video workshops, and their newly redesigned help portal.  It's really great.  And all of this, $8 a month, that includes a free domain name when you sign up for a  year, but better than that, if you just visit squarespace.com and click the get started  button, you can just set up a site right now.  Play with all the tools, even import your existing content.  And you'll see how easy it is to change the template without changing the content.  It's just, it's exactly modern state of the art web design and hosting.  You're going to love it.  Start that free two week trial.  You don't need to give them a credit card.  If you decide to buy, all I ask is use our offer code twig, T-W-I-G, and that way you  get 10% off.  And you tell them you heard it on this week in Google.  If you are an existing Squarespace 7 customer, by the way, I'm sorry, if you're a Squarespace  6 customer, you can turn on seven.  If you go to the settings tab and click activate, that way you'll get all the new features.  Squarespace.com, click the get started button, use the offer code twig to save 10%.  We thank them so much.  They have been long term supporters of this show and all of our network.  And we're happy to say we'll be back with us as almost all of our sponsors will in 2015.  We're starting to sign up people for next year.  Lots of interest.  Glad to say.  Let us get your tip of the week, Gina Tripani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I must get asked a couple of times a week, it feels like, for advice from listeners from the shows or just online in general.  I want to learn how to program.  Where should I start?  What languages should I use?  Where do I start?  And that's a really hard question to answer, especially in a tweet.  But I suspect that a lot of young people, especially young people, but lots of people want a job at Google.  And Google has actually, Google for education anyway, has published a list of a guide for technical development.  A suggested list of courses and subjects for people for aspiring software engineers to teach themselves.  This doesn't, of course, guarantee a job at Google.  But these are really good recommendations, academic recommendations and non-academic recommendations.  So if you're a student in school and you want to teach yourself or not.  Some really good stuff here.  They're all links to third party courses, some from Coursera, some from the various universities on what Google thinks is worth learning.  So you got your introduction to a computer science course, programming in at least one object oriented programming language.  This is skewed very Google.  So Google uses Java and Python primarily.  So they, of course, recommend learning C++, Java or Python.  Then, of course, all the languages, the web, JavaScript, CSS, HTML.  But some really, really great stuff here on debugging and testing and artificial intelligence and building compilers and cryptography.  Awesome resource here.  So if you're really interested in learning and becoming a programmer or becoming a software engineer or starting a new career in that, I think this is actually a really good place to start.  It's Google's guide for technical development.  I'm sure that if you Google that, it'll be the first thing that comes up.  That's neat.  Yeah.  Yeah, I thought it was a helpful, helpful way.  I mean, there's so many resources out there to teach yourself, you know, some some sponsors of these shows and Code Academy and lots of different lots of different things.  It's hard to know where to start.  And I feel like this is a good a good starting point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Jeff, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think I'll take this one flurry owned by Yahoo has done an analysis to show that time spent on mobile devices now exceeds time spent on television.  Wow.  First screen.  That's a pretty big deal.  Wow.  So how much and how many hours a day?  Two hours and 57 minutes a day versus two hours and 48 minutes daily on TV, according to the US Department of Bureau of Labor Statistics or Labor Statistics, I guess, in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Labor Statistics does measures time on TV and mobile.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  With so many people unemployed these days, it's really important to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love this.  So if you click on the link to the to the BLS watching TV, two point hours a day, relaxing and thinking 18 minutes a day.  Oh, there you go.  That's the problem.  We only think along with relax 18 minutes a day.  There is the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How do you even measure that?  Who knows how much time do I spend thinking?  I think they don't mean thinking.  I think they mean on the can.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But that's just a thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Reading 19 minutes a day.  Oh, your computer, your reading, right?  Yeah, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Reading paper is separate than reading on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently, you know, that real reading, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's an interesting point, though.  We probably now read more than ever before.  Thanks.  I think so.  No doubt.  No doubt.  I read a lot of articles, a lot of stuff online.  I read probably a magazine's worth every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd opt to read a user interface of an app before talk to an actual human any day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, come to think of it.  Well, here's one more app that will keep you on your phone.  We were talking about Uniqlo.  Tony Wang messaged me and said, my favorite Uniqlo product is their Wake Me app.  Let me show you the website.  Yeah, look at this.  It's Uniqlo Wake Up.  I think the app is uniqlo.com slash wake up.  And it wakes you up with music appropriate to the day's weather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Today is a very Japanese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Super Japanese.  Yeah, a good way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right.  I'm going to set this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pull it out the window.  Good morning, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Today is a Uniqlo day.  They have other apps, by the way.  You can design a Uniqlo t-shirt on your phone and whatever.  This is for iOS and Android Uniqlo Wake Up.  It's called.  Let me set it up because I just downloaded it for the network error.  I'm having trouble with this phone.  It seems this is a Galaxy Note 4 and it seems to be confused about the network, the Wi-Fi.  Wow.  I see a network here.  I don't understand.  Maybe it's a male turn off the go to the mobile network.  Maybe that'll make it work better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Uniqlo Wake Up.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wake up with music that changes with the weather.  Share the start of your day.  Should I have it in English, Mandarin or none?  I'm going to have English Fahrenheit.  I don't think I'll share this with Renren or Weibo.  Maybe Facebook or Twitter.  You can tell it's a Chinese app.  And now I guess it's going to get the weather forecast.  How interesting.  The page brings you the latest Uniqlo Wake Up news.  Apparently there is none.  It's got a little clock.  I could set the alarm.  I should set an alarm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was kind of pretty music though.  Tony says he loves this.  It's free.  I like it.  Uniqlo Wake Up with music that changes the weather.  And then I guess you can share the start.  She's sleeping with her phone.  And she's looking out the window.  Maybe she's going to share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thanks so much, Tony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tony, are you wearing?  A Uniqlo shirt.  I bet he is.  Hey, Jeff, did anything come while we were doing the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you check the?  No, I've been checking the app.  I checked the doors for an earlier commercial break.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're both waiting for our Nexus 6.  It's a race.  Gina Tripani is at ThinkUp.  Don't forget, you can take advantage of a special bundle right now.  If you want to get ThinkUp along with some other great stuff.  What's the URL for that again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Goodwebbundle.com.  It's a good gift.  The Good Web Bundle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Goodwebbundle.com.  Thanks, Leah.  Thank you, Gina.  You're having fun today.  Yeah.  Oops.  I'm actually not on that site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm on a Google extension that shows beautiful land masses on my new tab.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love it.  I know.  I kept it online too.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't live without it.  I just absolutely love it.  And by the way, it changes all the time.  There's always fresh stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it also, it does recycle some.  Some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I see some repeats.  Well, yeah, but I think that that might be within a short period of time because I haven't  seen any of these before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I've seen some a couple of days before, but it still is magnificent.  It's really beautiful.  My problem is I'll open a new tab and go do something, and then I want to go, I want to  press that button to see what I just did.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me get that tab again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I get distracted like, oh, what was I doing?  Where is that place?  You know, like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We live in a beautiful planet, don't we?  We do.  It's a beautiful world.  Just a gorgeous world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder how they select these images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They probably have an algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sure that there's some bot who's like, this is visually interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is visually interesting.  Let us see if we should.  I bet you.  The number of there's an algorithm about the number of colors, the shapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is.  There's something.  This is pleasing to the human eye.  Here's a dog jumping for a ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My humans would enjoy this refrigerator full of food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, my human overlords would get distracted by this photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Calm them down as I take over their lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just a matter of time.  Skynet is coming.  Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  He's the best.  His new book is out, Geeks Bearing Gifts, Managing New Futures for News.  You can find that on Amazon.  It's pretty damn wonky, folks.  No, no, no.  This is exactly the question I was talking about earlier.  There it is.  We need to solve this problem so that we can know what's true.  I despair of that, but we'll see.  Thank you, everybody, for being here.  It is every Wednesday at 1 p.m. that we do this show.  Pacific Standard Time.  We do it at 4 p.m. Eastern Standard Time and 2100 UTC, live on Twitter.TV.  After the fact, you can get audio and video of the show from Twitter.TV slash twig  or from our YouTube.com slash this week in Google or from whatever podcast app you like.  There are a lot of them, including Stitcher and Instacast and Slackern,  the app named Podcast on your phone.  I use Dogcatcher on Android, like that a lot.  I'm still using that.  Yeah, it's really good.  Pocket Cast is good.  What do you use?  Pocket Cast.  Yeah, I switch to Pocket Cast.  Me too.  You switch too, huh?  Yeah.  Maybe I ought to switch.  I don't know.  Just anything that downloads a show that I can listen to or watch later.  Yeah, totally.  They all do that.  There's a Twit app.  I recommend that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Pocket Cast does the syncing across devices.  That's what I really like.  It remembers where you are and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a nice thing.  You know, it's interesting because that's one of the things we're talking about in the  API is the ability to save user state so that we know where you stopped watching or  listening to a show so that when you use something else, it'll say, would you like to start where  you left off?  Oh.  Non-trivial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Non-trivial at all.  That's some advanced stuff there, Leo.  Good for you, but watch out for scope creep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  Oh, and someday we'll talk about this.  FourKitchens is very agile.  I mean, like dogmatically agile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And so we use scrums.  We use that whole points technique to assign points.  We have a backlog.  We groom the backlog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm learning all these weird scrummy...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Burn-down charts.  Yeah, all of that stuff.  Storyboards.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  User stories.  We came up with hundreds of user stories.  You know what?  It would be a very interesting special to do sometimes.  So have you used this methodology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have.  I'm not a zealot, and I haven't used the more advanced stuff, but I do.  I'm a big fan of burn-down charts just as a way to assess how much work and estimating  and breaking down tasks and changing the burn and stand up.  So I'm sort of light.  I find these methodologies super, super interesting, and I learn...  I'm kind of a cafeteria Catholic.  I'm a cafeteria agile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we are working with the pope, let me tell you, of agile.  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm personally always a little wary of the folks that are like, one true way.  I must do it exactly.  But I think it does work.  If you have a development shop that's just committed to the methodology and that's the  language they speak and it works for everyone, that's great.  I've never been on a team where everyone was fully on board and fully committed, so it's  always been kind of piecemeal for me.  Yeah, no, this is pretty serious.  We have a certified scrum master.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Paul Benjamin is running this thing like clockwork.  You've got the scrum master.  Nice.  A scrum master.  We have stand ups every day.  Nice.  Yeah, we get spanked if we don't show up.  It's really good so far.  It is process heavy at the beginning, and so there's some debate over how much time we're  going to spend a lot of money on process right now.  But I think that this is what you have to do to make sure that we, as the project owners,  get our needs heard and that the developers understand the job that they need to do.  That's the hardest thing, I think, in software development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a lot of value, I think, to formalizing that, especially if you're working  with a third party.  I think that's great.  I would love to see that special.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When the four kitchens people come here, maybe we'll do it.  The making of.  The making of.  It's driving certain of us crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, now, okay, so I want to hear more about that.  That will have to be an offline conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  I understand how much geeks love process, and sometimes to the point where we love process  rather than doing anything.  So you ever use the getting things done methodology?  Many a geek has done 43 folders and set it all up just so, but never gets anything done,  but man, they have a system.  And so I always want to temper the love of the system with an actual desire to get work  done.  But I think it's getting done.  And I'll tell you what, we'll know at the end.  If you like the new Twitter site, then it will have worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We do use software that supports scrum.  We're using at Lassie and Jira, of course, one of our sponsors.  Actually, four kitchens has always used Jira.  So that was no problem.  We use hit.  We have our own hip chat chat channel at all times.  And it's really into Jira is amazing.  Jira really is all about, you know, the agile experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you're using a tool that's geared for a particular methodology, it's that's great.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A couple of people in the chat room are familiar with this.  One of them says all projects with scrum feel process heavy at first, but it pays off big  time in the end.  That's that's how that's what they always say.  That's that's what they always say, isn't it?  You're going to love the result.  Well, the proof is in the pudding.  We'll see.  Anyway, thank you for being here.  Thank you, Jeff.  Thank you, Gina.  We love you.  And thanks to you for being here.  We'll see you next time on this week in Google.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Bye.
