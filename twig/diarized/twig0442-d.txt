Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week at Google. Stacey Higginbotham is here. Jeff Jarvis is back from Davos.  We'll get a report from the World Economic Forum. We'll also talk, there's a lot of news,  about Amazon getting into the healthcare business, Google adding a new local news feature for some of us,  and what about all those fake followers on Twitter?  Do you think reporters should be punished for buying followers?  It's all coming up next on Twig.  This week on Google is brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.

It's time for Twig this week on Google,  where we cover the latest from the Google verse.  Stacey Higginbotham is here, of course, from Stacey on IoT.  She's an expert in all kinds of things, but IoT is her current beat.  She does a podcast with Kevin Toffle there and a subscribe to her free newsletter. It's great.  I read it every week. Hi, Stacey.  Hello.  Also with us, and be nice to Stacey because she's off caffeine this week.  So I won't tell you about the new espresso maker I got in the studio.  We could get grumpy on this.  Hey, speaking of grumps, he's back from Davos, ladies and gentlemen.  Jeff Jarvis, the Renter in Chief, BuzzMachine.com,  professor of journalism at the City University of New York, downtown Times Square.  Great to have you, Jeff. How was Davos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Davos was good. It's always a hoot.  I'd say that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is Davos, before you say how it was for people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  World Economic Forum is an organization that brings together leaders in yes, business, also government, also NGOs and academe,  and about, I think, 2,000 of them.  What's the goal?  The goal is world peace and prosperity and trying to just...  It's very good at... Seriously, it's good at convening people.  They call it multilateral discussions, but they convene people across constituencies.  And you know you're in the room at the same time and you have a little white badge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, let's see his Davos badge. This makes you one of the machers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is it. When you have the white badge, you're special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that means you're giving us a panel.  This is the white badge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so small.  Actually, you know what? This is the best badge on earth. It never flips around.  I like it. Yeah.  Yeah, it's very simple.  That's the Davos badge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like one of those credit card sized badges you use tap doors with to get in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You tap all the time for security.  Oh, that's why. It does that too.  Yeah, heavy security.  And anyway, so you know, Facebook builds its own temporary building.  Oh, jeez.  In Davos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, jeez. But that's probably why they have to because they probably bring half the company out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They bring a fair number of people. Google doesn't do that, but Google has some sessions here and there.  And all of the businesses in downtown... Davos is not a high level resort.  I mean, the fanciest hotel in town just about is the Hilton Garden Inn.  Oh, God.  A few better than that.  But all the businesses basically leave and companies take over their spaces.  Oh, that's cute.  So you can be like a Swiss clock shop.  There's a great coffee shop you can't... No, you're not.  They just empty everything out of it.  And suddenly it is, you know, Swiss Rees space or some such thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds like something I don't think Stacey and I would enjoy at all.  No, it's exhausting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would leave by six or six thirty in the morning and get back at...  This time I didn't do any parties.  And what do you go for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, besides the honor of being asked, what do you get from it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get to have meetings with a lot of people in one place.  I mean, it's really useful for that.  In this case, there were a lot with Facebook and Google, but also across journalism.  I'm a member of the International Media Council.  So we have sessions with media on our problems.  And so it's good for me to be there as a professional blatherer among them.  It's worthwhile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's reviled by some because kind of like the Bohemian Grove, it's, you know, one percent of the one percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So the funny thing was normally there's lounges.  There's the partner lounge where if you pay the full amount, you get this partner lounge and there's this food there that you can't believe.  I got to go one meeting in there and let me in.  And then there was another lounge where anybody could go in.  You can get a nice little glass of orange juice or a little tiny cheese sandwich.  Right. This year, I wasn't allowed in.  Oh, I'm not of the poloi.  So I felt like I was the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. You're too elite to get into the sandwich place.  No, I was not elite enough to get in the sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK. I'm the 99 percent of the one percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The poloi are the people.  Oh, yes.  Poloi.  Poloi means the people, not the fancy folk, just the people.  I wasn't. I wasn't.  You were neither. You were neither nor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many women were there this time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twenty some percent.  Not that goes up by bit, but not nearly enough.  It is not a diverse crowd.  They the way it works is the companies pay a fortune.  They pay five hundred thousand plus to go and the forum will require them to have women in their delegation.  But they shouldn't have to require it.  Number one, and it should be higher number than that.  Number two.  Wow.  Well, I'm back. I fell.  It was over over freezing the whole day.  Got a huge amount of snow and they don't really plow the streets there.  They just kind of rough up the ice.  So when I got there, the first I got there, it was raining on top of ice and I'm a clumsy guy.  And I had my new Uggs on.  Yes, I bought Uggs and I fell badly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't Crocs.  It sounds like Davos is like the bad side of Switzerland.  They rough up the ice there.  What? Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, well, that's it for my Davos report.  One interesting thing that was there of note, it always opens every year.  Now, the last 18 years with the Edelman Trust barometer.  And you probably saw some reports on this, but it was it's devastating news for institutions.  Media is the lowest trusted institution on earth.  Now, one half of the people, the 33,000 surveyed around the world in 28 countries do not even come to mainstream media at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not just in the US, but around the world.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's really surprising.  There was a fall in trust.  They surveyed trust in government, business, NGOs and media.  And I would add a fifth institution, which is people like me.  I don't mean like me.  I mean, people like us.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  People like you or you or you or you.  People who quote unquote like me.  And there's some rise in expertise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Looking at it right now, it does say the 2018 barometer has a five point rise for journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But but rise against platforms in that category.  Media was still rock bottom.  It was bad news for media all around.  Platforms was very bad.  So it's worse for Facebook than media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But in both cases, they're not doing great.  Yes, yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that led to kind of the tone of the whole week.  But then when Trump arrived, basically, you know, give him a tax tax cut and they'll let you shoot somebody on the promenade.  You know, it's it's it was a love fest for the press.  Well, I wouldn't go quite that far.  But yeah, in his talk, which I didn't I chose not to attend, he got booed once we did his fake news thing.  But yeah, the execs were there.  I went to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think that that he and the whole fake news thing are to blame for the for falling trust in journalism?  It sounds like it's been that way for a while, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Trust has been going down on journalism since the 70s.  But yeah, I think why is that?  I don't understand why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, more people should go see the post.  I think it's actually Fox News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, I think there's more.  My dad's had less.  He's had less faith in the mainstream media because Fox reports things truthfully in a way that so I think it's kind of the partisanship of news, if that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think yes, I think cable news in general has has lowered the esteem of news.  But gosh, that's so disappointing because I feel like.  That's bad, because if you want to be and I think we try to consider ourselves a trusted source for information, if you're trying to be a trusted source for information, it's very disappointing that people are not trusting you.  Where are you going to get your where are you going to get your information from if you don't trust?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They trust you and they want to, which is really distressing.  Like, you know, I have people who rely on me as an expert in things that I'm an expert in.  And then in that same area, if I report on something and this is something as silly as like a radio protocol, if all of a sudden I'm like, yeah, you know, guys, I'm not that sold on Bluetooth mesh.  I've had people tell me that, well, that's inaccurate.  Your reporting is all wrong.  You're very biased, biased for Wi-Fi.  I mean, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's just the presumption that everybody's got an axe to grind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. And if you don't agree with if they don't agree with you, you must be grinding your axe.  Yeah. If that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You recommended to me, Jeff, Kurt Anderson's book, Fantasyland, which I'm in the middle of.  Did I? Did you not?  I don't know. I think it was somebody else. I'm not yet.  Oh, it's quite good. It's basically about that.  But I think his premise is false.  I'm going to disagree with him because he says this fake.  First of all, he says fake news is 400 years old.  It's as old as America.  But in fact, if even if you read his book, you would come to the conclusion.  Well, actually, it long predates America.  Fake news is a human condition.  I mean, he talks about Protestantism being an important transition point,  and especially for Americans, because, of course, we were born as a Puritan Protestant nation,  because it for the first time ever said it's not the experts that tell you what to believe.  You get to decide. It's your faith that matters, not the pope.  Which, OK, but honestly, people who believe the pope are not any less engaged in, you know,  phantasmal thinking.  So his premise kind of defeats his own premise in the very first pages by describing this transition  as if it's somehow people went from being hard thinkers to serious to fantasy people.  No, it goes back a long way.  Oh, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's a very interesting thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, in other words, this fake news thing is not new.  There's certainly a real partisanship in the United States that we've never seen before.  Well, look at this pile of books. Is it in there?  It's a pile of books. Yeah, I'm researching again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Holy cow.  So I'm trying to figure out this notion of the death of the mass.  And so it leads you to think about how we saw information society.  And I'm reading Dewey and Lipman and all kinds of people on this.  Now, it is fascinating. It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do think there is a fundamental change.  You have to reject Berzon's propaganda, right? Isn't that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. Well, that's Bernays' propaganda.  And then it's LeBron's, the crowd.  Yeah.  So it's very much about elitism and the notion of the individual rising.  And no, it all fits in of a piece.  But I do think that we're in a markedly different time now because of the net.  Yeah.  And that's what I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although, as somebody in the chat room, RF2020 is saying,  the polarization that's occurring in political journalism doesn't seem to be happening in tech journalism.  Zacey, you're an example notwithstanding, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Except Apple fanboys versus the world.  Well, that's always been the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I guess you're right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You can be accused of being a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, okay, never mind.  It's the way it is in the world.  How about this? This is, I thought, one of the least underreported  and I thought most interesting stories of the week.  Amazon is partnering with Berkshire Hathaway and Chase to create their own health care.  Or I'm sorry, JP Morgan.  To create its own health care for...  It says for its employees, right?  There are going to be three corporate behemoths.  This is the New York Times, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, and JP Morgan Chase.  Announced on Tuesday they'd form an independent health care company for their employees in the US.  However, I have to think, I mean, I put myself in Jeff Bezos' shoes,  that he's going to use his employees as a test tube for a product,  which I shall call, for want of a better name, Amazon Health.  Prime of your life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Prime of your life, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've just created a whole marketing campaign.  $99 a year you get Amazon Prime and health care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And internal life. You can pay forever.  Sorry, Stacey.  No, no, that's okay. You guys get excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm done.  I'm too uncaffeinated to get too excited right now.  We've got a slow Stacey speed today.  I thought it was awesome in the sense like we're clearly hitting an intractable place with health care and pharma drugs.  And it actually reminded me of the story about four major US hospital systems creating their own drug company.  I don't know if you guys saw that a couple of weeks ago.  So I looked at this as an extension of, oh my God, our health care system is so screwed up.  How can we solve this problem?  Even if it's just for ourselves, I'm sure it will go beyond that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think what you're going to see is technologists and the arrogance of their ways saying the whole government in general is failing us and we're going to replace government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, in some ways they kind of have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we're already a good way down that road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, Stacey, the trust barometer thing says businesses are now more trusted than government in the world.  And Edelman was arguing the government should lead.  I had usually I'm the optimist here.  Right.  My first reaction was optimism.  My second reaction was a slight.  Oh, this could be a mondo cost cutting thing.  And what if the health care isn't very good and you're stuck with it?  That's the only option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think there's a lot of things to think about.  So I've I mean, tech companies have been wanting to get into health care since at least I remember being in the audience at like the the World Council on IT in 2004 or 2005.  And I think it was Paul O'Dellini, I think, was the CEO then of Intel getting up there and just talking about telehealth.  And it was going to be amazing.  And, you know, what are we 13 years later?  And we still telehealth programs exist, but they're still controversial.  They're still difficult to measure.  And even things like progress such as EHRs, electronic health records are a wretched mess because the software is proprietary.  You can't.  The epic, the companies that are part of this are hugely expensive.  There's so much waste in part because it's so highly regulated.  And these guys coming in are not going to change the fact that health care is still incredibly regulated.  So the question is, can they achieve efficiencies by going around, not going around the regulation, but working within those regulations and heck, if they can, got more power to them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think what happened in that era was a land grab because, well, it maybe didn't start in 2004, but Obama early on said we're going to move health records electronic.  And there was a big opportunity there.  I think many companies, Intel included, said, ah, and Google, Google was going to Google health.  Microsoft had Microsoft Health.  But I think that was a response to a market opportunity, which was, oh, we've got all these health providers and they need to all because it was a mandate.  They need to all move to electronic records.  And, yeah, it was a mess.  But I don't think it was.  I think this might be a little different.  I feel it goes in the pile of stories we have about Mark Zuckerberg running for president and Silicon Valley's arrogance.  I think it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or Silicon Valley's ability to improve the world.  Well, they certainly feel that that's their ability, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think that they're looking at government saying, all right, government's failing.  And I think health care, I mean, this is a lot of projection because it could just be Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan trying to cut health care costs by doing it themselves.  That's how Kaiser started, by the way.  Kaiser, which is our big HMO on the West Coast, was created by Kaiser Aluminum as a health care system for its employees.  It went public later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is the model for this thing, by the way.  That's actually, yeah.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this isn't a let's solve health care writ large.  I think this is let's solve health care for us and see what we can learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because it's a cost.  And we know that Bezos is really interested in reducing costs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is what gives me a little bit of concern about that.  But I think, yeah, I think it's too public and too trumpeted if they wanted to just do it to cut costs.  They might be different.  So I put in the rundown.  I put in four stories this week and I had a couple more that were related to Google and health.  They're starting to bubble up again.  The most sobering, I think, was that Google A.I. predicting hospital deaths.  Yeah.  And first that was sounds like, oh, the death panel.  I'm sorry, sir, but you're 95% of crank and so we're not doing crap for you.  But supposedly it's the opposite.  It's, oh, we can predict the deaths so we can forestall.  Yeah, this is A.I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is Google applying A.I. to every possible thing from potato, growing potatoes to killing people in hospitals.  You're going to see a lot of this.  I mean, this is going to be the trend for the next many decades is how do you apply big data and A.I.  And where do you have a lot of data?  Well, things like hospitals.  Hospitals.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And and you have the other important element to that is you have the results.  So you have all the incoming data and then you know what happened.  That's that's a big deal when you're working with data.  You know what, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So so I've had my two cancer surgeries and actually the hospital didn't find the results from me.  They didn't really ask.  They don't know what works and what doesn't work.  Yeah.  Which I find shocking.  We've got to fix that.  Whereas you're right in a hospital, you at least have the you know, did someone die, leave on foot or in box?  That's a that's a data point you can you can actually draw.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then so you have to combine government regulation like HIPAA particularly affected.  One of the things Amazon did that was a red flag was they hired a HIPAA expert.  So that's that's one.  But then there's so there's that.  But there's also FDA.  There's all I mean this is all very complicated.  And then there's the individuals concerned for privacy.  A lot of people.  I think one of the reasons Google Health failed was not because it wasn't a good idea, but because people were concerned about privacy.  Interestingly, Apple who's going to say Apple is doing their increasingly positioning itself as the privacy company.  Right.  So maybe you trust them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just did an update where they were adding more something to their health.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The health app is going to be able to import your electronic health record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is great.  Looking that up.  Isn't that a great idea?  It is.  Because then instead of so I'm on Kaiser.  So Kaiser has an app and I can look up my health record.  It's all it is available to me on my phone.  But for people who can't do that, having that in the and actually I would like to have it in Apple Health because then I can cross record.  I can cross reference it to other things Apple Health records.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So then there's also the story of somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People the question on this Apple thing is do people did Google's fail because it was Google.  And is Apple going to succeed because it's Apple and people trust Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's not just trust.  Here's the other thing that you should think about.  Health care is inordinately complicated.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, and Apple's notoriously bad at this stuff, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it does.  It does think about the overarching user experience in a way that Google.  My God.  Never seems to actually do.  So I think Apple.  How many messaging platforms are there?  How do I call you, Jeff?  Should I call you a duo?  Should I call you a hangout?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Apple can't help.  All right.  I mean, for all that, Apple is terrible at network services.  Terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are.  Their cloud is terrible.  But that's actually probably good in this case.  If they can create an experience around your health data and they're very clear to talk about it in reference in advertising market about it to you, it's not to your doctor.  They are doing the partnership with that.  But their advertising is all about giving you this information.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't want to be too cynical.  Think of Apple as a privacy focused company instead of advertising focused company.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a bug made into a feature.  Yeah, I don't know if it's true.  Apple chose not.  Apple failed with the ad business, thus can't use the data, thus decided that they turned that into a feature.  I don't know that Apple is so virtuous as this would make it seem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My instinct is that they are not.  But I don't have any evidence to prove otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there's also, I put up on the rundown, Google's Verily started a project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's their life sciences alphabet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this the Naked Mole Rats?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, this is not the Naked Mole Rats.  God bless the Naked Mole Rat.  Okay.  So this is fascinating.  So this is they're going to get 10,000 people.  It's like that project that was done years ago of tracking people's health.  So they're going to do 10,000 people over five years from young adult to in the box.  And they have their own watch to where to track you across all of these areas.  It's kind of thing that Leo and I would sign up for.  No, but he's going to not me.  No, no, even you would not sign up for this.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even I wouldn't trust this information to Google.  I wear an Apple watch, baby.  I trust Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although this is a specific health project.  Yeah.  If Apple does it, I'll do it.  It's like the Framingham study.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the Framingham study.  So the watch is not a consumer product.  It's a longitudinal study.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I understand.  It is a longitudinal study.  But why Google?  Why is Google doing this?  It's not really Google.  It's Verily.  You changed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A year ago, you would have jumped on this.  You would have said, where do I sign up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am much more cynical about Facebook and Google than I used to be.  Tell me about it.  I know you are.  I know.  I am a little on the fence on Apple.  But if I am going to choose one, I would choose Apple over.  Look at Microsoft.  This cracks me up.  Microsoft also did like Google, Microsoft Health.  And it's still alive, unlike Google.  They haven't killed it.  Except if you scroll down, they show the Windows Phone app and the Microsoft Band app, both  of which are dead products.  So now I am thinking maybe Microsoft Health isn't a primary focus.  I don't even know why this website is still up.  They don't make this stuff anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is the health vault still up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was saying a health vault might still be up.  I think they have deals.  Don't they have deals with some hospitals to put cancer data in the cloud?  I think they have a partnership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that goes back to the land grab when electronic health records became the mandate.  And I think all of these initiatives do.  I think that's different from what Amazon is doing.  My gut is Amazon...  By the way, the press release said they are forming an independent company that is free  from profit-making incentives and constraints.  That's interesting.  Not non-profit.  Just free from profit-making incentives and constraints.  Although that is part of the problem with the health...  Some people could argue that Amazon does that.  Yeah, right.  They are free from profit constraints.  There is a distinction, as Fortune points out, between free from the necessity to turn  a profit and non-profit.  I could absolutely see Amazon doing its own health thing.  How do you feel about your company knowing all...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  your employer knowing everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a separate company.  They are creating a separate company and your employer already pays for your health care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't know anything about our employees' health.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But remember Tim, what's his name?  AOL dude, can't think of his last name right now.  Who did on his earnings call...  Armstrong?  Our earnings were hit in part from health expenses.  Remember the baby?  One of our employees had a sick baby and everyone was like...  Yeah.  So they don't know details but they can piece together some things if you are an outlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My experience, and it may not be universal,  my experience is the insurer won't tell you why the rates went up.  You have to make that leap.  Yes.  But your rates are going up all the time anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It depends on whether you are self-insured.  No, I'm saying as an employer.  Even so, I know that you are not buying...  In one company I worked for, we weren't buying insurance.  We were paying the direct costs through an insurer.  The insurer wasn't really an insurer.  The insurer was just an accountant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, we don't do it that way.  We have health plans through Blue Shield and Kaiser and stuff.  Right.  And so we will know that our rates have gone up.  And you could say, well, it must be because he was sick.  But I'm sorry, Tim, you don't know that that's the fact.  It might just be your rates went up.  Yeah, the rates are going up for everybody.  Tim Armstrong.  Right.  Tim Armstrong.  Yeah.  Okay, contrast that big business taking over government  with the notion that government might take over the 5G network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, this is just such a stupid story.  I'm just going on the record.  The guy who...  This isn't even a trial balloon.  I think this came out because somebody in national security was like,  oh, this would be a great idea.  I don't really understand.  It is a great idea.  It is a terrible idea.  Oh, it's a terrible, terrible idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this was a PowerPoint presentation,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  not even a recent PowerPoint presentation apparently,  from national security officials who said,  you know, because of the threat of China spying on us,  the US government should build the 5G networks,  not let the telcos do it,  and then lease those lines to telcos so that we can make sure it's secure.  So here's my tweet about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's wrong with that?  To protect America from China, America builds a Chinese internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not a Chinese internet.  Almost everybody...  That's what I'm talking about.  Here's...  We had a great conversation about this before the story broke,  oddly enough, on Twitter on Sunday,  in which it was, I think, concluded that the correct solution  to preserving net neutrality in the United States would be,  just like the interstate highway system,  to allow the government to build the infrastructure,  whether it's local, state, or national,  probably it would have to be federal government,  build the infrastructure, and then maintain it,  and probably even make a profit on it,  leasing it to as many internet service providers as possible,  providing true competition.  That's how many utilities...  It's the way many utilities run.  It's the way the interstate highway system runs.  And it is the only way, because telcos are never...  It's not in their interest to preserve net neutrality.  So that's the right way to do it.  Unfortunately, we're stuck with landlines being the fiefdoms of telcos,  unless you're willing to do something politically very controversial,  which is assert eminent domain and say,  well, you made enough money on those lines, we want them now.  I don't think that's...  This administration isn't going to do it.  Well, any administration is not going to do it.  Isn't the British model the difference?  It happens in other countries because they don't have any...  Yes, just let me set it up, and then you knock it down.  Knock it down.  This is bowling for Leo.  So it happens in other...  It has happened in other countries because they don't have the same situation we do.  It was built here, and it was built piecemeal.  They had the chance to build it right.  It's too late to do it for landlines.  What about letting...  What about the government...  I think you can make the argument 5G is ultimately going to replace terrestrial internet.  If that's the case,  what's wrong with having government build the 5G networks,  provided there are, of course, restrictions on what governments can do to watch the network and so forth,  but the idea being, like the interstate highway system, they maintain it.  Okay, now you may knock it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wind up, wind up.  The port pitches to Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  The landlines, which I think you're just meaning like wireline broadband.  Wireline broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  So from that standpoint, ideally way back in the day, we would have done conduit,  and everyone could run their own networks through it.  That is the most fair, probably the most American way to do it,  unless you're going to be a socialized country, which I don't think we're ready for.  When a 5G and a wireless network, there's a couple things.  So are we talking about mobile 5G or fixed 5G?  If we're talking about fixed, which is what we would look at for replacing wireline broadband,  we would have to...  You have to figure out what layer you would give up control or how far up the government would build.  So in the case of 5G, a lot of that spectrum requires you to have line of sight  or a close tower network, basically.  So you're going to have to have fiber to it.  So you could say the government could control that, but then they're going to have to take that fiber.  Then you've got to say on people's rooftops, you're going to have to have a satellite  or some sort of distribution mechanism to cover an area.  And that becomes really questionable because if you're already like AT&T or Verizon,  you already have those existing relationships in people's houses or on people's houses  that you have access to, right?  If the government comes in and wants to put a 5G satellite dish on your house to build a secure network,  you're going to be like, what?  Also, are they going to use eminent domain to put these towers up?  And then for wireless spectrum, already they're starting to share some things.  But let's start on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know how making it private makes that any easier.  Government at least has rights of way.  If you're doing private industry, then they've got the same issue.  They've got to go and buy it from somebody's house.  So the government already owns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AT&T already has this stuff.  AT&T already has a satellite.  They have that. Oh, God, is it dish or is it direct?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let me divide the arguments.  There's two areas to argue.  And you're arguing on the technical issues.  There's also the argument that most people's reaction,  which I think was both of your reaction, is, oh, my God, don't let the government run the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, actually, no, that is not actually.  So let's be clear.  Running the internet is...  The government could do this.  They would just have to set up rules in a way to do it that's normal.  And the lack of technical expertise in this...  Well, so AT&T already gives your data over to the government if the government knocks on their door and gives them a rose.  So I'm not...  That's kind of a naive assumption.  The assumptions built into this presentation are just ludicrous.  They don't explain anything.  And to attack it at a technical level is where it needs to be attacked.  This isn't just technical.  This is also economic.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we did this with the Interstate Highway System.  Admittedly...  We did it when there was nothing.  Admittedly, there's no consensus for this.  In fact, all five FCC commissioners, Democrat and Republican, have outright rejected this.  So it's a non-starter.  However, I think it's a damn good idea.  And I think the technical issues can be solved.  And it's the only way to get to network neutrality.  Frankly, you're never going to have...  That's not true.  Well, how are you going to get Sprint, AT&T, Verizon and Comcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We regulate it.  That's how you're going to get...  We have given up the idea of a truly competitive broadband market.  That's the mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We need to bring back competition.  Yes.  Can I ask a question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go, Jeff.  It's a question.  So, one point of question.  So, isn't it a hybrid in the UK, as I understand it, where basically the government paid BT  to build the infrastructure, but then BT is required to enable anyone to use it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I also think BT was originally a governmental...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Originally, but I don't think by the time the internet was built, I don't think it was  anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's true.  That is true, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, is that a hybrid, Stacey, where you could...  Yeah, in a lot of countries, Australia has a hybrid situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do.  But then Korea is all government-run.  I think Scandinavian countries, I think for the most part, the government runs the infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On landlines, we actually used to have that sort of system where they could resell...  Not ONTs.  Resell T1s and other switches and stuff.  AT&T and Verizon had to provide cabinet space, and you put your equipment there and you could  run it over their lines.  And I can't remember the name for that.  We had it in Texas.  And it was kind of a...  It was a bit of a joke because AT&T would never go out and fix the gear for other people.  I can't remember what the model is called.  Anyway.  However, I don't think...  I don't think we should even be talking about it because it's a dumb idea.  If we want to talk about...  I'm serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's talk about naked bull rats.  I don't think it's a dumb idea.  I think it's a political non-starter because both the left and the right hate it.  I think it's a political and it's a technical non-starter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So right now to get fiber to all the places where we would need it to deliver this service,  the government, if they really wanted their own 5G network, they would have to build that fiber out.  So that's one.  And that's a multi-billion dollar thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, who's going to do that if not the government?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, Verizon and AT&T already have fiber out to these places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no incentive for them to increase bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To do 5G?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no incentive for them to increase bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is not true at all.  So a fixed 5G, which both AT&T and Verizon are deploying, is more economical to them than fiber.  So they are putting that out because it is cheaper to do fiber to a certain point to back all those wireless networks.  And they're also investing in like ethically huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But one of the reasons we have so much dark fiber in this country, you acknowledge it.  Is because they're not using it.  And you know why they don't use it?  Because they would prefer a scarcity.  I'm telling you that the real problem in this country is that the people who run the telecommunications infrastructure have no incentive to provide us with good internet.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's something that can be, again, regulated.  And it's also something that they're forced to do when innovations come along.  So remember when AT&T brought in the iPhone and everybody's network sucked for like forever and then they fixed it?  They just, Apple pushed them to do that.  We're pushing them to do that when we're putting cars on the road.  And I know they have the absolute wrong mindset.  I've written this story a million times.  I look at the carriers and I just want to bang my head against the wall.  Like you could make so much more money if you invested in this network and had people like become addicted to your product.  Instead, you're making it scarce and it's annoying.  None of that's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I would submit that we have evidence that they have much more capacity.  Yeah, but they're very tightly controlling that capacity to keep it from.  They are.  Yeah, they don't want as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The government doesn't have to come in and do this.  Other companies could come and do this.  There are definitely people who are looking.  And when I talk to like, especially in smaller areas, not necessarily in urban areas, but in rural areas, in suburbans, subrural, I don't know.  Ex-urban.  Ex-urban areas.  The local landline and broadband providers are concerned about upstarts coming in and doing 5G.  So that's going to happen, although not in Boston because Google just pulled out.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and Verizon stopped rolling out Fios.  I mean, all of the evidence is contrary to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Verizon is adding fiber in neighborhoods where it's planning to do 5G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  5G. Yes, in their interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but that's going to be your broadband service.  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why you need it to be done in society's interest, not in corporate interest, because they will not do what you think they're going to do.  They're going to tightly control it so that they can make it scarce because that makes more.  They're going to make more money on it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Susan Crawford insists the wireless will never replace wireline, that the demand is going to keep going up at a pace such that we'll need fiber.  That's also a possibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.  That's Shannon's law right there.  You could only cram so many bits per Hertz.  Right, right.  That may well be true.  OK, I mean, it's kind of an academic argument because there's no way in hell this is going to happen.  Although you can make, I think, some very good arguments that it should.  The security argument was the one put forward by this old PowerPoint presentation.  But there are, I think, good arguments in the public wheel that also support it.  But it's a non-starter.  The public wheel, that's fancy.  I know. I like that word.  That's nice.  No one knows what it means.  I like saying things no one knows what they mean.  Except Jeff, because he's a professor.  Did you see Patrick Delahanty, our engineer, tweeted this out?  I'm not sure, but I think Google's introducing a new search console based on the dozens of emails I've received.  And Patrick, just so you know, I got them all too.  Introducing the new search console.  Yeah, this is for companies with websites.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't know what it means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I kind of know what it means.  The search console is how you, as a company with a website, can control what Google can let Google know.  Hey, here's the site map.  Here's, you know, all that stuff.  It's a way for you to make your website work better.  But Google really wants everybody to know about it.  I'm just changing the subject because there's nothing more to say.  There's not going to happen.  So naked mole rats.  Naked mole rats.  What's the deal with naked?  What's the deal with naked mole rats?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Naked Rolmats and Google could make your life.  Not naked Rolmats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Naked mole rats.  Naked mole rats.  Naked mole rats.  And Google can make your life longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we know that naked mole rats are a wonderful thing to study.  The heteroscephalus globber, as it's known, or the sand puppy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, very good.  Wheel and that in the same five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a naked, sightless, disgusting animal.  But for some reason, scientists keep wanting to study it.  Is it their social organization?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They live a long time.  They don't feel pain.  Well, they don't actually live a long time because there's not eternal life.  But they have like a little cap that protects their DNA.  Oh, a DNA cap.  A DNA condom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they also, as you said, lack pain.  They don't have pain.  They have very low metabolic and respiratory rates.  You too could live like a naked mole rat.  I'm not sure if I'd want to live longer.  Their legs are thin and short.  They can move backward as fast as they can move forward.  Their large protruding teeth are used to dig.  And their lips are sealed just behind the teeth so that their mouth doesn't get full of dirt.  How do they eat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really don't.  So they can actually live in air that is only 5% oxygen for five hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they can hold their breath for 18 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can roll mats.  Naked mole rats on Mars.  Naked Mars rats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have a high resistance to tumors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically, it's the cap of their telomeres that we're excited about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we like their...  Because we know that longer telomeres are good for longevity.  Now, let's not get too excited.  They live as long as 32 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dude, there's a queen mole rat.  And they're guarded by worker rats.  I love this.  This you would love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll be your worker rat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to be the queen of the mole rats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey, you are our queen mole rat.  Your queen mole rat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is what they call...  All hail, Stacey, the queen mole rat.  It's the first mammal.  See, their ants and bees and stuff exhibit this eusociality.  But it's the first mammal that they've ever found that does that.  The queen and one to three males reproduce,  while the rest of the members of the colony just work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No sex for you.  Work.  Dig.  Dig.  Dig. Dig.  Workers are sterile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is it?  Telomeres?  They got a telomere cap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've got a cap.  So basically, the idea is that protects their DNA from mutations  and all kinds of other fun stuff.  So they're basically, Verily's like,  hey, look, these animals, which are creepy weird, have this cool feature.  So we're going to research that further.  And that's the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The fact that Google does it just makes it more fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We learned a lot about naked mole rats.  And I feel that that is always a worthwhile endeavor.  I take a supplement, a highly overpriced supplement,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to lengthen my telomeres.  Truly? Really?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I fell for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't know.  Was it a crowdfunding thing?  Probably.  It's called Elysium.  And...  Oh, yeah.  I almost called it that.  Yeah.  From Basis, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's...  It's not a scam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, it arrived.  I bought one.  It arrived.  And I said, no, I don't know.  The FDA has not approved this.  And it's not approved.  The FDA has not approved this.  And it's NAD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want to increase your NAD plus.  My NADs are plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Just stop right there.  Stop.  I'm pulling a punch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  NAD?  No.  No?  NAD is vital to how sales use energy, a key player in metabolism.  That's why I feel so good.  I spend $60 a month to take a supplement that nobody does even knows what it does.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Google Chrome lets you permanently mute annoying websites again.  Don't annoy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll be quiet.  You don't have to...  Don't mute us.  No, please, no.  Not you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't worry.  What is new about this?  I was confused by this.  I'll be honest.  Well, they had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember there was...  They had it, but I think they took it out.  And now it's there.  This replaces the previous mute tab feature that was only temporary.  So you right click the offending tab and mute the entire site, not just once, but forever.  So believe me, I'll be doing that.  Yeah.  Google's also adding HDR support to Chrome 64 for Windows users if you have the Fall  Creators Update and HDR-Compatible Monitor and Graphics card.  Also, this version of Chrome is patched to protect Windows and Mac users against meltdown  and Spectre.  So update your Chrome.  And I'm using Edge now because Chrome doesn't work on my Windows machine very well.  HTC deal's done.  The deal's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Deal's done.  Yeah.  This is bad news for Qualcomm, man.  Really?  Qualcomm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're going to not use Qualcomm chips anymore?  Well, no.  So their goal is to...  The speculated goal, or maybe the stated goal, is to create an SoC for mobile phones.  And currently, in all of my mobile phones that run Android, I have Qualcomm.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although Apple's famously using a much worse Intel chip.  Apple, though, is working very hard...  Well, no.  Apple built their own process.  Yeah, to replace their own.  And it's not yet in the phones, but it will be any day now, probably next generation phones.  But they had a split, half Qualcomm, half Intel.  In fact, Qualcomm sued them.  Oh, for the baseband.  For the baseband, yeah.  And Qualcomm.  Remember, Qualcomm sued them because they slowed down the Qualcoms because they were  so much faster than the Intels.  So, they just...  Apple just slowed them down.  So, HTC did not sell to Google.  They just, for $1.1 billion, gave them 2,000 employees, which is about half of their R&D  group, and about a fifth of its 10,000 employees.  But HTC says, that doesn't mean we're not making smartphones.  We're just going to make it with half as many people.  I find that deal so weird.  It's so weird.  It is weird.  It's very weird.  And how is the division done?  Did they just say, okay, everybody with last name, A to Z, you go with Rick Osterloh, A  to H?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get free lunch, you don't.  You get free lunch, you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it's the firmware people, if Google's doing their own chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It must be.  It must be divisions, right?  Apparently, these 2,000 HTC employees are the ones that made up the Pixel team inside  of HTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well then that's easy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, if you worked on the Pixel, so you're going to come with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gee, I was there one day.  I was in a meeting.  Can I come too?  Yeah.  HTC made the Pixel 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  LG made the Pixel 2 XL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I had the Pixel...  No, was it the Pixel 2?  It was the small...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the Pixel 2 and maybe even the...  It was the big one.  The original Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had the original...  No, the original Nexus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, yeah, yes, yes.  HTC made the original Nexus 2, yeah.  In fact, HTC made the very first Android phone, which was that one with the slide out  keyboard.  I was like, I had them.  Yeah.  I have that somewhere, Michael.  Of course you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Museum of...  So, speaking of which, speaking of which, Leo, any effort to always cost you more money?  Yeah.  Did you order a Google clip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't.  Now, I saw the story that said...  You were slow.  It's for sale now.  Oh.  And so I immediately went to store.google.com trying to buy a Google clip.  It's under accessories.  This is the really silly device that...  It saved you from yourself.  It saved me from myself that you...  Oh, it's not here.  Where is it?  Wow, it's all the way over.  Where's the clip?  Yeah, they know nobody wants it.  Maybe it's not in accessories.  Maybe it's in home and entertainment.  Maybe nobody wants it.  Maybe that's the problem.  They had 10 and they sold out.  They still had the Pixel Buds.  Maybe it didn't have very many because when I went there it said, the only option I had  was to cancel my reservation.  Oh, here it is, the Google clip.  So, see, leave wait list is all I have up here.  Did I not get there soon enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they just didn't want to give you one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't imagine that.  I think...  Your life is not interesting enough.  I think somebody at Android Central or whoever, 9to5 Google, got this invitation, but it wasn't  universal, would be my guess.  Anyway...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of invitations, guess what I got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  An invite to customize my Tesla for delivery in four weeks.  Your Model 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah.  That's another thing that was kind of...  Before the end of January.  Just kind of happened and I was told by a number of people, just log into your Tesla to see  Tesla account.  They called me.  You got called.  They also did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you order a three also, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I put deposit down, but my reservation number is in the high hundred millions.  So I don't think...  No, it really is.  Can I...  So what are your options, Stacey?  Can I show my...  What do you get to customize?  Yeah, let's do it.  Let's do it.  I'm going to sign in and see here real quickly.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, let me go and sign in to my Tesla so I can tell you accurately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because I don't get that option.  I'm jealous.  Let's make some choices.  When did they say...  When did you make your reservation?  Pretty early.  The day of.  Yeah.  See, I didn't do mine too much later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we had a car.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, you get priorities as a result, eh?  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do it in order.  And they told us it was going to be reservation holder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that means you could get...  When?  When could you get your Tesla?  Four weeks from now.  If I ordered it yesterday.  What?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Are you...  I don't know.  I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know...  My challenge here is...  Oh, God.  What if I ordered the Tesla?  No, I didn't.  I was like, oh my God.  It's not showing the options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Honey, it's coming.  Yeah.  My reservation number is 109,091,575.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so here are my options.  I only...  I only get the option...  Slow and down, roll the age, Leo.  ...of the long range battery, but we knew that.  And then the premium upgrades also come.  So you don't get a choice here.  Yeah, see, that's why I'm...  If you're trying this first...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And coming soon will be the base 35K model standard.  Oh, I see.  Or dual motor all wheel drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, see, I want dual motor and I want a bigger battery.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't mind waiting.  But when I put my money down, my thousand dollars down, it said 12 to 18 months.  But I don't want to be the first on my block to own a Model 3.  And I would suggest you don't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I probably don't.  So my options are colors.  So it's still...  They add price, you know, black.  I think black is included.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could use my referral link and you could get a unlimited supercharging.  Oh no, that's what the new Model S. Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like I have unlimited.  Okay, so any color except black is going to cost you a thousand bucks more.  What?  Black's okay then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get black.  Oh no, I want the blue.  It's amazing how he makes money, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then wheels.  You can have the 19 inch sports wheels.  That'll cost you an extra 1500.  Nope, don't get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't want that.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really, this is Elon's upsell is all about putting a little more money in the till for the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's why he's selling flamethrowers.  Yeah, they upsell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, why is he selling flamethrowers?  That's crazy.  Yeah, what is that?  California politician is outraged.  Outraged, I say, at Elon Musk's terribly insensitive flamethrower.  I thought it was the Elon Musk joke account.  You don't really want an insensitive flamethrower.  No.  So it isn't a joke and he sold quite a few.  But it's legal apparently because it only shoots a flame 10 feet.  10 feet.  If it's 10 feet or less.  That's three feet, I thought.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, that's the point.  If it's 10 feet or less.  That's plenty.  That seems plenty.  It's really a blowtorch, not a flamethrower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Flamethrowers are really hot, by the way.  You can go to ranches in Texas and play with them because that's what people in Texas do.  You can also drive tanks and shoot things.  But if you actually play with a flamethrower, it is an uncomfortable experience.  And I don't recommend it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TechCrunch says he's sold 15,000 flamethrowers in the first few days, netting $7.5 million for the boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Speaking of Silicon Valley hubris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that people are buying it.  I don't feel bad for him for that.  I mean, he sold all those hats for like what, a million bucks or 600?  I mean, sure, whatever.  But that's kind of the same thing with having a blue Model 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just a way of, I don't know.  That's what the politician says.  Pre-order, let's see.  Checkout.  That's it.  There's not much choice on there.  It comes and there you go.  Give us a credit card.  That's it.  500 bucks.  I'm not ordering one.  Thank you, Leo.  It seems like a very bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have found your limit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm not.  This is it.  Guaranteed to liven up any party.  World's safest flamethrower.  Fire extinguisher sold separately for exorbitant amounts of money.  This is on the boring company's page.  Taxes and shipping will be added at checkout.  Additional customs fee may apply for international orders because of laws.  International customers could receive a full refund if not happy with said fees.  Before shipping, aspiring flamethrower aficionados will be sent a terms and conditions rhyme for review and acceptance.  Start shipping in spring may not be used on boring company decorative lacquered hay bales or boring company doxide munition warehouses.  That's silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do offer a $30 fire extinguisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God.  It's so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they also offer a hat.  You know, it's a lot of people bought that.  I think really if you think that this is all a simulation, it really kind of raises the bar on things you can do.  Like, what's it matter?  It's just a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, people have made that argument about religion.  Why keep this earth nice if you die and go to heaven?  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  It's we atheists who are preserving the environment.  Just want you to know.  If you...  Hug an atheist today.  Hug an atheist.  Thank an atheist.  If that river is running clean next to you, thank an atheist.  Oh dear.  Let's see.  Did you...  I was very moved.  Did you watch the Grammys on Sunday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did not, but what you're about to show was moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they did a very long song.  Who was that that was singing that song?  Oh, it doesn't say so there.  Well, there's an ad.  No, but in the Grammy Awards ceremony itself, they had a song.  Oh.  Which was very...  It was interesting because it was...  Oh, I wish I could find that clip.  Let me see if I can find it.  It's probably illegal to play.  It was a hit.  We can help you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Logic is the name of the song.  Logic.  1-800-273-8255.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is the suicide hotline number.  Right.  And it's...  Oh.  During the...  Let me play a little bit of it.  Probably only a small amount to avoid copyright.  Oh, look.  Google's now working.  I can't play any video.  So it was really kind of beautiful.  Logic, who closed out his performance with a plea to call of,  you need to be not scared to use your voice,  especially in instances like those when you have an opportunity.  Stand and fight for those who are not weak,  and you have yet discovered the strength that the evil of this world has done its best to conceal.  So here he is.  And what's interesting is...  Oh, I'm sorry.  We have an ad.  Sorry.  Everybody's got to monetize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that it?  No.  That's the Wayfair ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, that is the ad.  Do Logic.  I Don't Want To Die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In any event, I was watching this, and I liked the song,  and I could tell that something was going on because they kept showing this number,  which is in the title of the song.  Here you go.  This is his acceptance.  Wait a minute.  No, this is Kendrick Lamar, isn't it?  Kendrick Lamar.  Thank you for nothing.  Thanks for nothing, Time Magazine.  Anyway, Logic.  Here's Logic on...  Here's a still of Logic.  So they all were wearing sweatshirts with the number.  It said, you know, don't be silent.  You are not alone.  It was really moving.  And then the Google ad right after the song ended,  they go to end the commercial, and then the Google ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's product placement to a good end.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was really beautiful.  Do you want me to show the Google ad?  Yeah, I will.  Unfortunately, Logic's comments had to be bleeped by CBS.  Black is beautiful, hate is ugly, women are as precious  as they are stronger than any man I've ever met.  And unto them I say, tall and crush all predators  under the weight of your heart that is full of the love  that will never take away from you.  To all the beautiful countries filled with culture,  diversity, and thousands of years of history,  you are not bleep holes.  It was really beautiful.  So, yeah, let me find the Google ad,  because then it made sense.  It's in the rundown.  No, it made sense because I didn't really understand.  I couldn't...  It says video on the right.  I kind of understood the idea that this was something.  There was a reason for that phone number,  but Google made it clear with the ad.  We'll do the really beautiful ad, I thought.  Yeah.  Which I can't play.  You're just a mess today.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This blocker is working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're just a mess today.  This blocker is working too dang well.  Here we go.  There's a donut.  This must be another ad.  There were donuts in the ad.  There were donuts in the ad?  Okay.  Sweet tooth from her dad.  Yeah, you got to back it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The following are real people captured with the Google Pixel 2.  So initially I see this, I think, oh,  this is an ad for the Google phone, the Pixel 2.  Sophia, the light of his life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the beautiful pictures.  This is Lauren.  And this is her new place,  which will soon be crammed with all her friends.  This is Steven.  This is where he schools his military buddies.

So it's really moving.  This is Mike.  This is his weekly barbecue club.  This is Alex with all the friends that will like her post from Friday night.  And this is the Lifeline all these people bravely call to find hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So these are all people call to suicide hotline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not every picture tells you.  It's really moving.  I mean.  Question your lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Suicide prevention lifeline.org.  It was, that was really.  So it came right after the Logic performance and it was really amazing.  I really.  That was the highlight of the Grammys as far as I was concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that song has been like in the top 10 for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  It's a huge hit.  I knew that's why I was puzzled because I knew the song.  And I said, what's with all the phone numbers?  And it's part of the title of the song.  The song is actually called phone number.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really.  While we're on such plugs.  I want to just mention.  So when I was in Munich before Davos, I got to spend.  Run into the hall.  Long conversation with Rose McGowan.  Who of course.  Fueled the me too movement.  Yes.  And Tuesday night she had a new special out on.  E and her book brave is out.  And I just wanted to plug both those things because I think she's doing amazing work about as she calls him the monster.  Yeah.  Very good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me do a break and then we can do more stuff.  You guys can pick your.  Your.  Your interests.  The stories we've been jumping all over the place.  But I thought that was that's a good place to take a break because.  That was a nice.  That was a nice moment.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And then we could talk about YouTube having.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Malware in its ads.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Now that we.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can bring it back to the real world.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  One of the best left.  They're kissing up to us geeks.  They're making themselves even more popular.  With Rocket Mortgage.  So Quicken Loans.  Number.  The number one in customer satisfaction for eight years running according to JD Power.  Eight consecutive years for 2010 through last year.  They'll get it again this year.  Four consecutive years for mortgage servicing too.  They're really a great company.  Revitalizing Detroit.  Dan Gilbert and his team are just great.  And then we have the.  The.  The.  The.  The.  Revitalizing Detroit.  Dan Gilbert and his team are just great.  And they.  I think they understood that the loan approval process was kind of out of date.  The idea of going to a bank and going to the attic and getting paperwork.  You know faxing stuff in.  I mean come on.  So they realized it needed to kind of a.  Technological revolution.  That's why they created Rocket Mortgage.  Rocket Mortgage can is so cool.  First of all no more going to the bank.

And we talked a little bit about this on SecurityNow.  This is ridiculous.  This is part of the problem in general with automated ad sales.  Even YouTube now has had some ads, they say they're pulling them down,  that have cryptocurrency miners built into the ad.  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All that brilliance to go to that ad end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People took to social media sites as of Tuesday to complain their anti-virus programs  were detecting this code when they visited YouTube.  A vast blocks crypto miners.  Others do.  So do many anti-ad blocking sites like UBlock Origin and so forth.  The ads on Trend Micro drive a threefold spike in web miner detections.  They came from Google's DoubleClick ad platform.  And they were being displayed to YouTube visitors in Japan, France, Taiwan, Italy and Spain.  This is a known thing that goes on.  JavaScript at mining.  And the reason it works is because, yeah, you're not devoting a huge amount of power to it.  But if they have millions of people doing it, there's a chance they're going to make some money in cryptocurrency.  So it's like SETI for your cryptocurrency.  Yeah.  But you don't get the money.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Unwitting SETI.  Unwitting SETI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, why isn't there a service that lets me in fact donate or not donate?  I mean, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  Unwitting SETI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why isn't there a service that lets me in fact donate or not donate but rent my capacity and earn some cryptocurrency?  Well, there is.  Well, there sort of is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  CoinHive was the one that came up with this.  And this was originally thought to be a system for monetizing websites, right?  So and it would have to be done with full disclosure.  You see now when I try to go to CoinHive, I'm by UBlock Origin, which is my ad blocker says this site is not secure.  Do not go there.  And that's what you want.  And I would get the same thing if I were to see these ads.  But I think the original way CoinHive positioned themselves was, oh, no, no, no, this is about monetizing websites legitimately.  It's not.  In fact, we're starting to see scripts that aren't just while you're on that site, but then install themselves and continue to run in the background using up to 80% of your CPU.  Not good.  Not cool.  Not cool.  Google's pulling them down, of course.  But this is the problem with automated stuff.  In fact, did you see that Android and the Android Play Store?  What was the number?  Google?  Seven to eight thousand?  Seven hundred?  Seven hundred thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was like there may have been more zeros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apps that they had to pull off of Android, the Android Store this past year due to malware.  It's that was that's crazy.  Let me see if I can find it.  Seven hundred thousand bad apps in 2017.  Seventy percent increase over 2016.  Not only did we remove bad apps, says Andrew on the product manager for Google Play, we're able to identify and act against them earlier.  Ninety nine percent of apps with abusive contents were identified and rejected before anyone could install them.  That's good news.  That's good news.  So they're using machine learning to identify PHAs, Fuzz, potentially potentially harmful applications.  Fuzz.  This is probably part of that Google Play Protect scanner.  Still kind of a shocking number.  I mean, that's a lot of people making malicious apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of I mean, there's a lot of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But a lot of it is automated.  They're making apps right on apps.  One session I moderated in Davos was Ben Gurion University on Crypto Security.  And what became apparent is it's going to be AI versus AI.  Yeah.  Right.  You have AI defenses to find all the vulnerabilities and all the patterns.  It's going to be the war of the robots.  It is.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that so that was I actually lit.  So silly me.  I was in 20 the beginning of 2017.  I put that on one of my trends because, you know, it's the beginning there.  You do your trend piece.  So I was like 27 or 20 17.  We're going to see bots fighting bots.  Right.  But it was too early.  We didn't really see anything big bubble up to the surface yet.  So I'm still waiting, though, because no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's exactly what's happening in this just happened.  700,000 apps were found by machine learning powered scanning in 2017.  So I guess you created I give you an A plus for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, you you win that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it is it is scary.  And it's it's interesting because eventually they're going to are they going to actually learn themselves actually.  So it's interesting because I think the quantum has a really interesting article about applying quantum computing to A.I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which if you just want to blow your mind, you should read that because, you know, there's we're also seeing how hard it is to really do quantum computing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, but we are getting better someday, maybe.  I wouldn't hold that.  I think it's coming.  I mean, we're you know, it's always hard at first.  And then suddenly you're like, well, bam, we've done it.  And then you iterate so much faster.  Oh, my God. I just said the word iterate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want to be proactive about that?  I love this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's the number one shared and it's not has anything to do with our conversation here today.  It's a peacock on planes.  No, it's the number one shared story on Washington Post right now.  I am thoroughly ashamed.  British Lord resigns after arriving late to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would be in so much trouble.  It took less than 60 seconds for Michael Bates to arrive late, apologize profusely, offer his resignation and then leave the House of Lords today.  I want to offer my sincere apologies to Baroness Lister for my discurrency and not being in my place to answer her question on a very important matter at the beginning of questions during the five years in which it's been my privilege to answer questions from this dispatcher box on behalf of the government.  I've always believed we should rise to the highest possible standards of courtesy and respect and responding on behalf of the Congress.  Sounds just like our Congress.  To the legitimate. Yes, just like our Congress.  I'm thoroughly ashamed of not being in my place and therefore I shall be offering my resignation to the prime minister with immediate effect.  I do apologize and then leaves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was the resignation accepted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Witnessing an apology turned into a resignation in a matter of seconds was simply too much for Bates's stunned peers.  In the dramatic video other politicians could be heard exclaiming no from their seats while some laughed in disbelief.  Other attempts to reach out and pull Bates back into the chamber.  The Baroness said an apology from Lord Bates is perfectly sufficient.  It was a minor discurrency which any of us can be guilty of on occasion.  This is so funny.  Oh my God, you want to hear the...  No, I already read it.  It can only be...  Let's see, let's compare accents.  I'm working on my poncy British accent.  While watching the Queen over and over.  I mean the Crown over and over.  And again, while you can't get autoplay video to stop, you can never get the video you want to play to start.  Now that needs an apology.  Sitting there spinning.  Anyway, you heard it.  You heard my interpretation.  I did an interpretive reading.  I love that the reason I was at the Washington Post is this story.  Facebook has a messenger for kids.  As you may know.  Designed for the under 13 set.  Although kids as young as preschoolers apparently are using it.  The campaign for a commercial free childhood has signed a letter to Mark Zuckerberg.  That said, you need to stop this program.  The signatories, which include public citizen and common sense media, expressed concerns over boosting the screen time of young children and said this would interfere with crucial developmental skills.  Such as reading human emotions, delaying gratification and engaging with the physical world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Books are terrible for young minds.  We have far too many books.  You think it's techno panic?  Well, if it's done badly, no.  But I remember my daughter when she was young was on a American girl social network.  Yes, I think they control.  Yes.  And when they killed it, it was horribly disappointing.  She lost friends.  They went up and smoke.  Yes.  And they were gone.  I think that there is a way to do it.  I understand all the issues.  Believe me, I understand the issues.  Believe me, I see the fears and they should be regulated up the yin yang for young children.  But I also see that in this world where we have play dates, you have to schedule and you don't just go out in the yard anymore.  We have more isolated children.  That's true.  I don't know that it's necessarily presumptively an awful thing.  It depends on how it's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacy, do you let your daughter wander down the street to the five and dime on her own?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She can wander down the street to her friend's house.  I mean, I've let her do that for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's nerve wracking though, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  I mean, the risks of someone kidnapping her are pretty low.  The risks of her falling and hurting herself are higher, but I'm sure people would help her.  I mean, I don't know.  I've never subscribed to that.  I will say I did let her.  I convinced the neighbor next door to let her son go with my daughter down the street to this common area that they would have common area to play in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, which we all did when we were kids.  Yeah, back then.  She was like, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm real nervous.  I'm like, it's really safe.  So she did it.  And then they were back late.  And then I sent Andrew down to find him.  It's like, oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I'm responsible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is all my fault.  We go down and they're picking up litter with their bare hands.  And Andrew's like, oh, they're beautiful, beautiful children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So do you know the book Free Range Kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  An old friend of mine from the Daily News way back when.  Do you subscribe to the thesis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do.  I was a latchkey kid.  And it's my daughter doesn't want to be as independent.  So I kind of push her gently.  But, you know, it's hard.  It's one thing if your kid really wants to be a free range kid.  And it's another thing if your kid's like, nope, I'm fine here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's partly because of all these screens and all of this stuff they can do without leaving the house.  That is that's the point really is that she has limited screen time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does she do?  I mean, she just plays with their dolls.  She stops around on the roof.  She's doing a Hamilton.  She writes. She writes stories.  So she spends a lot of time and she her desk is behind me and she works on stuff, scripts.  Nice.  She's a kid.  She's got her own world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, nice.  She's she's a free range kid.  She just chooses to use her range close to home.  Facebook says it's going to push more local news stories into your news feed based on the geography of the clicks.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What do you think of this, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is yet another change to.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Google.  So Facebook, when they when they basically what happened, I don't know if we talked about this, because I was gone last week.  When they made the change and what I saw and I had this conversation with Facebook people at CUNY when I brought in somebody to talk to product development people, we asked them what's news and Facebook saw the world in two buckets.  There was social content on Facebook and there was public content and everything was in public content.  So when some of the stuff in public content got them in trouble, they threw out the whole bathtub and with it went news.  So, as you know, they're pulling it back now, bit by bit.  They have this odd structure to survey a small number of people to find out what is widely trusted and that stuff starting to come back.  And that's the obvious.  New York Times is going to be there.  Yes, Fox News is going to be there and others.  And then they wanted to also put local in a local is easy to put in.  So it's geography.  So they're putting that stuff in, which is fine.  The hard part is going to be how do they put in foreign affairs or or twig or or the correspondent or these other things?  And I'm trying to suggest some methodologies publicly to them and others, but trust and distrust.  And it's God's work to try to get them promote more more good and important news.  That's going to be very difficult.  And I don't think it's going to be as easy as an algorithm.  However, I'm glad to see that local news is getting promoted by Facebook in this way.  And Google also started its new thing called Bulletin in three cities where people, the hoy-polloy properly used this time,  can contribute directly to the web without having a website.  Local news will see how that works.  But the fact that local is coming up in their in their views, I think is a good thing.  Tell me about this bulletin thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So right now you have to sign up for early access as Oakland and two other cities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel where they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I wouldn't be accepted because they have no Petaluma, although Petaluma would be the perfect place to do it.  Would be would be as opposed to a big city where I mean, I don't know.  So it's an app.  You put it on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Basically, rather than sharing something to Instagram, I think you're sharing something to your town.  It's interesting.  Nashville, Tennessee, Oakland, California.  Next door.  I think different in that it's not a clue that next door is very closed on purpose.  This is verified identity.  It's just the people you choose to do who really do live next to you.  I think it's broader than that.  I think next door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Next door.  I mean, I guess I'm in my neighborhood, but it's a pretty big community.  I mean, there's like hundreds of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they brought it over the top.  Originally, it was supposed to be like 75 to something like that.  And then like in my neighborhood, I started during Hurricane Sandy and there were enough people.  So now next door includes people who are three miles away, which is a little ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I signed up just to see at the end, they say, do you work in media?  So I think I probably will be rejected.  But you have cooties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they'll trust you more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that would be better if you.  Maybe.  Yeah, maybe.  So but this is kind of what CNN did.  Remember, you know, they decided all of a sudden all their news gathering would be by people with smartphones and.  Is that iReport?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep. Yep. Yep.  Whatever happened to that?  It just died and the death like all these things die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although they still, I mean.  You see a lot of.  Anytime anything trends on Twitter, they ask you for your.  Your Twitter.  Your video footage.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I can think of things like I remember the miracle on the Hudson where Sully landed the airplane on the Hudson River.  You know, the definitive pictures of that were all from people with smartphones on ferries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a business builder on the store full.  Verifies the social news content.  Oh, so they store full died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Store of five died.  Store of five died.  Store full.  I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, fusion.  Store full was bought by News Corp, which some might consider a death, but that's just a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did say you would get to build, pick your own.  You want to talk about the follower factory?  Sure.  Great article.  That feels like a Jeff story.  I think so.  It sells fake followers.  And they talk about fake followers in it.  And they even name names and.  I think so.  And then there's the.  The.  The.  The.  The.  The.  The.  The.  The.  The.  The.  The.  The.  The.  The.  The.  The.  Names and you know, what's interesting that some of the people whose names were named have  had some consequences from this.  So they showed here's the heat map for instance.  For  Here it's not loaded yet.  This is it uses Web GL.  So.  It's probably not going to work very well.  And it's it's working pretty well.  From a chef.  Chef Simon.  Who had a huge number of bots that he paid for apparently and admitted to.  Who was it that got in trouble?  Yeah.  Oh, Richard Roper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Richard Roper.  That's right.  It was Roper.  I don't know if that's right.  It's a waste of money.  And it's egotistical, but I don't know that it was a firing offense or suspended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did he do it for ego or did he do it because his bosses asked him to get more Twitter  followers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember maybe if he got paid, if he got paid bonuses based on following, then maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's it is definitely the case.  I've heard from people who should know that in Hollywood you can often get much more  money for a contract as an actor.  If you have more Twitter followers, there's a direct correlation.  But because you considered to have some market clout and multimillion Twitter.  So there's strong incentive for people to boost their followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you make the ones who really are in center are the so-called influencers who  are paid for counting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Roper had 225,000 followers.  Um, that's a lot of followers.  That's a lot.  I have more than that.  I have 600,000.  I've never paid.  Um, he was, remember he was paid to be your follower.  Leo, you pay as little as a penny per followers.  Very inexpensive.  Um, he had 226,000 followers as of Monday, a drop from 253,000 a year ago.  But it's a part of this, I think is Twitter kills followers.  And that's the other side of this story.  I've been seeing people saying a number of, uh, big accounts have lost dramatic  numbers of followers in the last few days since that article came out.  What about the Roper's punishment was, uh, he's under investigation  and the Chicago sun times his newspaper will not be publishing any reviews  or columns until the invested by Roper until the investigation is complete.  I see.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that is, it's a nice, you could argue that it's like an ethics  misrepresentation and you want your journalists to be presumably  as ethical as possible.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's unquestionably dumb, but in this range of, of sins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Hillary Rosen, former, uh, president of the RIAA and a political  commentator, CNN contributor.  And I think she worked on the Clinton campaign paid for half a million Twitter  followers.  I mean, it's, it's humiliating to have this be revealed, you know, cause it  seems like you're kind of grasping for followers, but, uh, I don't know if you  should, I don't know what the punishment should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, there's, we all have fake followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that's the part that we do.  Yeah.  Um, you know, I have, I'm sure, you know, half, according to some of these  social, you know, follower count sites, I have half of my followers are fake.  Um, which is, you know, not cause I paid for them, but there's, you know,  they're, they're bots or spam or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So did you see the Mark Cuban tweet this last week?  Nope.  So Cuban, uh, Gesundheit Stacey.  Sorry.  It's been so subtle.  It should have been so subtle.  Or anything, but I just thought it'd be nice to say Gesundheit.  So Cuban said that, you know, after this, that's it, that's it.  Everything has to be a verified person.  And a lot of us came in and said, no, you got to remember about, you know,  he discussed back with me and others.  Um, you have to remember about vulnerable people who are vulnerable  and, and having a verified identity, uh, as an issue.  And he wasn't so much talking about your name.  So much as saying it's one per person.  And there are some bots that are okay.  It's not as simple as say, ah, there's, I got the solution.  Let's just get rid of them.  Um, yes, Twitter and Facebook should get rid of fake.  You have three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I manage two of them are not acting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which one is the real Stacey?  Well, Gigastase is my primary.  Stacey number one or Stacey number two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a, I have a Leo Laporte, which is my primary one, but I also have a bot  called Chief Twit Bot, so it's not a secret and it tweets out things about,  you know, shows and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm shocked by it, but I don't know who's the real...  I used to have a partial ownership in fake Matthew Ingram.  Fake Matthew Ingram?  We created that at GigaOmForum.  Oh, you did?  Oh yeah.  It was, it was a Yonko Rutgers.  Um, he came up with the idea and then we all took, he gave all of us the account  and we asked his permission.  Oh.  Um, but well, yeah, cause we worked with him.  We didn't want to be a jerk.  He's Canadian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter begs to have multiple accounts created.  I had an account for my dog.  I had an account for, there's, you know, and then people have created  accounts like Leo's hair, Leo's table.  You know, there's a lot of accounts out there.  Most of them get bored.  They get, as they should, cause it's boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, but I have Stacey on IOT, which I'm not using now, but eventually will.  So, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's also a good idea to create accounts to preemptively to keep people  from making accounts like Leo Laporte sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which I don't own, but I mean, that's probably, I could do that for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  I had a, I had an account for my scale because my scale would tweet my weight.  That's right.  That was a bad idea.  Fortunately the batteries died.  Too bad there is no way to replace them.  Yeah.  And it just, it just stopped working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what should the, what should, what's the rule?  What should the principle be on a bots and B fake accounts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cause you can't stop somebody from following you.  Okay.  Oh yeah.  You could, you could block them.  Yeah.  So when I get spam, I report it from a bot, a follower, I reported  immediately and then block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's the, I'm asking if you're Twitter.  Oh, Twitter's rule.  What should the principle, what should it be in an ideal world?  What would you propose?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Stacy.  Do unto others?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gosh, you guys can't, we all just get along.  Yeah, I don't, I don't know.  Yeah.  I think it's challenging for Twitter.  I really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not one of those people who hate on Twitter all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get that this is a complex issue.  I don't think naming people is right.  I mean, having people proactively report bots is good if you  actually do something about it.  Right.  So for the Leo to start his chief twit bot is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The intent is to inform and news sites have it and so on.  That's fine.  I'm a bot that's going to give me the weather or going to give me bargains.  It's fine.  But bots that are there to, um, what, what, what are the, what are the sins?  Okay.  So what would the sins be?  Attacks, attacks, attacks, attacks, attacks, attacks, attacks, attacks,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  attacks, attacks, attacks, attacks, attacks, attacks, attacks, attacks,  attacking people.  Do you want to say misinformation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think spreading, not only, not only creating it, but spreading it.  That is there for the purpose of spreading misinformation.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would add obscenity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Screw that Stacey.  You know, I, it's so funny because normally I would be engaged in this  conversation.  I couldn't care less.  Let Twitter be Twitter.  Well, it's not that I hate Twitter, but it's just, it's, you know, it's like  saying, what should we do about that landfill over there?  Should we, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook earnings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How's that?  I got Facebook earnings.  I got a couple of stories still ago.  Google flights is using a little AI.  Remember we were saying now AI is going to mean everything.  They're going to predict delays and show how bad basic economy fares are in  the Google flights.  So if you're using Google to do your flight booking, that's great.  I think you'll know, you know, how reliably on time a flight will be.  Based on, you know, previous records and then you let's talk about Facebook.  Fark Mark, Fark Muckerberg.  Zark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no, nevermind.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Zark Muckerberg says that showing fewer viral videos on Facebook has reduced.  Get this.  This is, this is why every little knob tweak on Facebook has been reduced.  Facebook can make a difference has reduced time spent on Facebook by roughly  50 million hours a day.  What percentage is that?  I don't know, but geez, that's, you know, that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they, how many users are they at now?  Two billion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Daily active users daily, daily 1.4 billion.  Okay.  Monthly active users 2.13 billion.  That's over two now.  Over two.  Mobile advertising revenue grew 89%.  89% capital expenditures 2.6.  Who cares how much they spent?  How much did you make?  Head count.  Up 47%.  That's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You compare that to an old newspaper company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Think about what the, what the revenue, you know, per employee is on a company like that.  Well, you can figure that out.  Income for the month, three months for the quarter ending December 31st, 2017,  $4.3 billion for the year.  $15.9 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's up 50% over last year.  Divide that by 25,000.  Will you?  Somebody chat room?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of money.  Their, their, their profit is up 56% year over year.  20% over quarter.  Right.  And he's warning.  Not going to stay this way because you know, we made changes.  But by focusing on meaningful connections, says Mr. Zed, our community and businesses  will be stronger over the long term.  In 2018, we're focused on making sure Facebook isn't just fun to use, but also good for  people's wellbeing and for society.  We do this by encouraging meaningful connections between people rather than passive  consumption of content.  Contents.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would like to point out because Shira Ovide, I don't know how to say her name.  Um, his name, her name, I don't know.  Um, pointed this out and we used to track this at GigaOM because Facebook has a lot of  servers, their CapEx is going up to 14 to 15 billion in 2018.  That is more than double what they spent in 2017.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does that include, uh, employees or is it just?  No, that's cap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, that's just physical assets.  So that's data centers.  It, it should.  Yes.  So like their new data center spending, um, is mostly most of their capital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Data centers.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's well, that's, that's a, that's a forecast.  That's that is a forecast.  That's an investment.  That's they've got it.  I mean, maybe it's more along the lines of wireless as well, you know, cause they do  have some lovely, uh, antenna technologies useful for Leo, your 5G network.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't want the government to take that over, which would be worse.  Government taking it over Facebook, taking it over.  So that's the same argument people had about Google fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Long may it live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, so, I mean, I think, so I wrote a post, I wrote two posts.  After the changes, one was my concerns about the changes that I wrote another one.  Say that I think that both Facebook and media are looking at community too  shallowly and temporarily.  And so Facebook's goal is to get more, um, what was it?  Uh, meaningful engagements between people.  And so I obnoxiously edited that and said, it should be more meaningful and  long lasting engagements among people.  And that they're measuring community as does media now, based on the  now based on conversation.  And my fear is that we're going to move from click bait to comment bait.  Hey, a lot of people talked about that.  I got to talk about it.  It must be good.  And that's, that's a very shallow view of community.  Community is when you join together to do something together to act.  Uh, we lost all the Kiwanis clubs and Rotary clubs of the world.  And what can you really start on Facebook that has a  deeper version of community?  So I I'm coming to think that Facebook is very much evolutionary and that  there's another leap to be made in their definition, definition of community.  And he talks about it, but the current definition I think is rather thin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it, it fosters slacktivism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It can, but it could also, uh, I mean, it's like the founding of meetup  meetup was inspired by the book bowling alone.  Um, because people, the clubs were going away, the bowling leagues were going away.  We want to get people together in person again.  Whether in person or not, I think we want to have a deeper definition of what it  means to join with other people in the community.  And, and I think Facebook's trying to get there, but I  think there's a big step left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would also say that there's not there.  There's also, that is one definition of community, but not  everybody wants to take action.  Some people, even in the world of the Rotary clubs, just wanted to go sit  at their neighbor's house and gossip.  Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, uh, not, not that I know somebody a little deeper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, I like, I like going home alone and playing with my  computers and watching TV.  Well, that's like, that's all I really want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As an introvert.  I'm like, yeah.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think your daughter's an introvert now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think everyone in my family is.  Yeah.  But here's the funny thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I, I heart introverts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're three introverts, but what are we doing right now?  We're on TV.  We're presuming that the world cares about what we have to say for two hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was talking about, it's funny.  I was talking about this with Lisa yesterday.  Cause, uh, but what, but what I do is what we do is I don't, is the, is,  uh, is only apparently, uh, extroverted.  A lot of performers are introverts.  Johnny Carson was famously an introvert and you say, well, how  could he be an introvert?  He's performing, but performance like this and like what he did is  actually more internal than you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like how you just compared yourself to Johnny Carson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you have a problem.  I wish I were Johnny Carson.  I wish I were Johnny Carson, but I think that, I think Letterman's an introvert.  I think a lot of performers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So say more about what, why, what, what makes it internal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's well, it's just, I'm just telling you the feeling of it.  And I don't know what your feeling is when you do it, but, uh, I mean, I  used to do radio shows when my eyes closed.  I don't do it now cause we're on camera, but it's really very much.  Um, it's not, it's not like we're really having a conversation exactly.  I don't know.  It wouldn't, it wouldn't, it would seem to be that we were sitting around talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Leo mentally has his eyes closed.  Just in my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He wants to be home.  I don't know.  It's interesting.  It is an act.  I mean, remember it's an act.  It's not, it's not considered performing is performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's, it's a person.  Like I was talking to a friend of mine, um, after I had given a talk and he's  like, and we went out for drinks afterwards and we were talking about being  introverts and he's like, no way.  I was like, oh, yes way.  And he's like, oh, this is your Stacy performance.  Yeah.  Um, I was like, oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's how you can be speaking in public.  I think.  Yes.  Yes.  I turn it on.  Speaking in public is a good, is a better example than this.  Cause it's, cause this is more like a conversation, but if you're on a stage  giving a speech, you're actually more alone than if you were in a bar sitting  and talking to people, you're really on a stage by yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why would I talk to people at a bar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  I know.  I could just go home and knit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, or knit.  Okay.  Um, let's see, what else, what else do we have to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you want to change the subject, Ms.  Introvert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I just, I feel, no, I just feel like this is probably not engaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody cares about our, it's about us, Stacy.  It's about us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's cause we're introverts.  Yes.  I think we've, I think actually we've gone through all the good stories  unless you have something, um,  Oh good.  Then I can, then I can use my thing as my tip for y'all.  Yes.  Save your thing.  Save your thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, are you going to order the book that Bill Gates says is his favorite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is an interesting question.  Cause Steven Pinker, who's the author of, uh, the, what was it called?  The, uh, I like this little book, better angels of our nature, which is out and  you can order it.  And I did order that on audible so I could listen to it.  And then, and I, I tweeted the Bill Gates said his favorite book of all time  was that, and now Steven Pinker has a new book called enlightenment now,  which isn't out yet, but will be out soon.  And, uh, so I haven't been able to order it, but now it's by the way, the  case for reasons, science, humanism and progress.  And I gather from reading Gates' blog posts that really he's an optimist, right?  He's the world is better than ever before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, but he gives so much data.  This thing is like a college, like we have it.  I've read part of it and I was like, Oh my God, just no more.  It's very dense, very dense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the enlightenment now books won't be out until February 13th.  Yeah.  He likes data, but then I got an email from some people who said that, uh,  Steven Pinker is an alt right apologist.  So I don't know what that means, but no, that is actually so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me confirm that this is actually true.  This is actually a fake news.  Uh, hold on.  Yeah.  It was on a panel and what they did is yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  They, they, they cut off, they cut a small part of a lecture and, and it was,  it was an unfair, very unfair cut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They quoted the, his quote, the often highly literate, highly intelligent  people who gravitate to the alt right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So he was warning about them.  Don't underestimate.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he is, he is not.  So don't, so, but yes, the alt right decided to use that and paint Stephen  Beard, not that his, you know, anyway, yes, fake news inaction.  Influence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was at both Davos and DLD and I didn't get to see him, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I should read this book.  I think we have to download it.  It's Bill Gates favorite book.  Yeah.  Well, I got the, uh, better angels of our nature first, cause that's  the one that's available.  I'll listen to that.  And I, I almost pre-ordered enlightenment now.  And then I thought, well, let me listen to the first one, make sure he's not an  idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I read another one of his that was, uh, Oh, what was it?  Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sometimes I read this stuff and I just conclude, Oh, the guys, because this  kind of sin kind of syncretic kind of stuff, which is, is merging all of these  things into some grand revelation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of times he is not like a Malcolm Gladwell.  He is way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah.  Malcolm Gladwell is a good example of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can grab my book and show it to you and you will just be like, Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you have a lot of post-it notes in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's just, it's, it's like a textbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Good.  I can't wait to listen then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I, I, one more quick question.  So we're all, I think loyal here to audible as am I, and I listen audible,  but I'm curious, would you have any reaction to Google finally in play?  Do we have any books?  Yeah.  And, and, and not the pricey, it's not a club.  It's just discounted books.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Google books is getting a complete revamp and one of the things will be the  ability to, to buy audio books.  But, you know, if you think about it, this isn't that new.  Um, they didn't have before.  Yeah.  In a way it is.  Apple's has iTunes audio books, but they're from audible.  Uh, but, but almost every publisher puts out audio books.  The thing that makes, uh, so you can get fire and fury from, you know,  Apple from audible, uh, from, uh, there's one called, um, what is it down?  Let me see down poor down, down, down poor,  which is another audio book club.  Um, and it has all the same books.  Everybody does.  The only thing that doesn't have is the audible originals.  And I think that's one of the reasons audible does originals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And boy, some of those are really, did you ever listen to the one about, um,  the, um,  yeah, I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The butterfly effect, John Ross.  Yeah.  Did you listen to it?  Not yet, but I have it.  It's really good.  My problem is I love audio books so much.  I just buy, I buy two a month and then, you know, I don't get to them all.  They stack up.  Yeah.  I stack up.  So this will be interesting.  The, the one reason I think they're doing this is because Amazon's Echo has a  huge advantage when it comes to audio books.  You can listen to your audible books on it and Google, none of the Google  devices will play audio books, but they will now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  Except for, uh, Android auto, which will take a little time and they'll know  they're adding that in.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, you know, I think the prices will end up being the same.  Um, they say now 50% off your first book, but my question, you know,  there's things you can do.  Uh, Amazon for instance has, uh, no, I don't want to download Chrome.  Oh God.  These companies at Microsoft and Google, they just add each other's throw.  Come on, use Chrome.  Chrome's faster.  And then if you, if you launch edge, it actually showed speed dials.  You see it's faster.  It's faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, um, but things like, um, uh, Amazon has like, uh, flat rate subscriptions  and things like, and I'm one, you know, audible is, yeah, which is a better,  which is a better deal.  Yeah.  I'm wondering, I'm wondering if Google's going to start if I'd love to see a  price war, the problem is they're all, they're all copy protected, which  means when you buy it from Google, you have to listen to it from Google.  You buy it from auto.  That's one advantage downpour has not.  Some of them are now being copy protected, but a lot of them are not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you can see, do you do audible audio books?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like to read.  I read fast.  I I'm a very fast reader.  So audible slows me down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anybody's, and I don't have a commute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the other, and we should, we should also mention audible as a sponsor.  Of that's why I mentioned it.  Yes, we do.  Um, but I do think it's interesting that Google's doing this.  And I'll probably say it's the same thing is the point really is it's the same book.  Uh, the, cause so if you're a Daniel Suarez fan, it's not audible.  Doesn't record this book.  It's recorded by his publisher, Penguin random house audible sells it.  Google sells it downpour sells it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, you know, by the way, the production value of these things has gone way.  Oh, I love it.  Jeez.  Sometimes a little over the top, but, but generally good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Um, I'm listening.  Lisa and I are listening.  You know, we like to have a book we listened to together and we're  listening to Stephen Fry read the Sherlock Holmes stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think your daughter's old.  Yeah.  Henry Hudgens is great.  I think your daughter's old enough for Sherlock Holmes.  She's right about that age where you start discovering.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, this is just Google.  This is more to me, Google versus Amazon.  There, there's a big battle brewing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's, it's not brewing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's, it's on, it is on, which is, which is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What people are talking to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello.  Why don't you kick things off with your pick of the week and then you can go home.  Then you can, then you can collapse.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can just pop my head down and just go, um,  okay, pick of the week is you can now send texts.  If you have an Android phone using your Madam A.  I've been trying to figure this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you done it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it works.  So do you start where you go to your Echo app, Madam A's app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you go into the little conversation section.  So it's that little thing that looks like a thought bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Good.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then, oh, look, a pop up.  Ask, you know who to send SMS.  So it'll go, it can only, it doesn't work with an iPhone yet because Apple has no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  API, of course.  So you do that and it takes your permissions and scroll down,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  allow, drop in, show caller ID sentiment.  Okay.  And it'll send it from my Google five phone number, which is kind of funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I can do the same with, with, uh, yo Google, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  You've always been able to do that.  Oh, we do that.  Yeah.  And Siri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now I can say, Madam A text anyone in my contacts.  It sends both.  And so when you do the message, so I was like, Hey, Kevin, did you get this  question mark and it said it perfectly, but it also sends an audio message that  you can click on.  Oh, that's cool.  So if you get some weird transcriptions, because

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  which also means in the car, I could just play it for you rather than badly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Now that only stays around for 24 hours.  That says, so I assume that's just not to look and it appears in your SMS,  whatever your preferred SMS reader is.  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good tip.  Mr.  Jarvis, Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  J I think we should do this.  Uh, Google IO has been announced for may eight and Facebook F eight for may  one, which means I'll be making two trips in two weeks to California.  Hope you come visit us.  I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope.

Transcript:  And all right, maybe you can figure that out.  Yeah, maybe we will.  What do you think Carson?  Should we do a Google IO again this year?  It was so boring.

At one point he decided to delist the Korean exchanges and, uh, because he felt  that they weren't, that they were not matching the rest of the world from his,  you know, his charts and the, and he caused a 10% drop in the value of  cryptocurrency all by himself.
