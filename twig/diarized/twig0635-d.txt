I usually say Leo's gallivanting  right now. Leo, well, he's probably in Mexico at this point. He got up super early. He and  Lisa got up super early this morning to fly out to Mexico and hang out with Mike Elgin.  And so they are having a great time. Sure, they're gallivanting. So I'm here in his  place and always happy to be on This Week in Google when I get the opportunity to do  it. Welcoming to the show, Ant Pruitt. Ant, what's going on, man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am unbelievable, Mr. Howell. How are you, B-Sir?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course you are. You're always unbelievable. And you make me feel unbelievable because  you're so unbelievable. I'm doing good. It's good to see you. Also joining us, Jeff Jarvis,  who we have to do the full introduction here. And I've got it. It's a mouthful.  It's become tradition, you know.  Take a deep breath. Take a deep breath.  It is a little special today. The Leonard Tau Professor for Journalistic Innovation  at the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Craig, Craig, Craig, Craig Newmark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York. Welcome to the show, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let us give... let us give credit. Do we have the credit ready for who did that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely, we do. Jake Overton sent us this Barber Shop quartet version. You know what  would be really cool? There's probably a lot of people that watch and listen to this show  that also are musically inclined. It'd be pretty sweet if like everybody did their own  little version of this. But anyways, Jake, first one notable for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so Craig Newmark himself in Twitter in response to this offer said that he had Craig  Newmark sounds himself, but his wife wouldn't let him share them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see he's still doing that crowd work in his community gig, in his comedy gig.  Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Awesome. We finally have a tune to play so you can save your pipes. You don't need to  sing it this week. Although we'll be doing a lot of talking.  At this important moment?  Yeah, right. Well, maybe in the future we'll all like tag along. Although that's kind of  hard to do, like do a, you know, a harmony with something that you played on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should put it on TikTok. You know what we should do? We should put it on TikTok  and see what people can do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Make it a meme. Let's make it happen. Also joining us today, not Stacey. Stacey's actually  out this afternoon. We'll hope to see her again next week. But joining us has been a  while. Matthew Ingram, Columbia journalism review. I don't have a song for you though,  Matthew. I'm sorry.  Yeah, I don't know how to follow that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know how to follow that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that would take a long time. Nobody wants to hear that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's up to everyone to sing their own song going forward. We'll see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Jason, you're a musician.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I suppose I could do something, but I'm not going to do it. Not right now. Definitely  not on the spot. No, I'm going to leave the spotlight on Jake because he deserves the  spotlight this week. There we go.  Well, it's good to see all of you and good to have you back, Matthew. I was kind of working  on the rundown today. Normally I'm behind the scenes producing a show and pulling back  the curtain a little bit. I can at least admit right now that often with weeks like this  where there's just this barrage, this mountain of Facebook news and everything, I'm throwing  the stuff in the rundown, feeling comfortable about the fact that at least I don't have  to talk about this. This is all on Leo and the gang. This is one of those weeks where  I do have to talk about all the Facebook stuff. It's a lot to manage, but we've got a lot  of stuff to talk about this week. I suppose we could get the earnings out of the way because  it is earnings week and my golly, it seems like all companies are up. Everybody's doing  good right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except for Snap, but we'll get to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that's right. That's at the bottom. That's right. Snap, not so much. Google doubled  their profits. Facebook, they're kicking it out of the park. Their ad revenue rose 33%.  They're raking in billions of dollars. Their Oculus other bet is working pretty well. I  mean, it's nowhere near 28.3 billion. It's 734 million. That seems important in the realm  of the fact that Zuckerberg has been making such a big deal about this whole metaverse  thing that hinges on the success, at least in my view, of Oculus and what it's doing  there. I suppose that's good news.  Twitter, they're up as well 37% year over year growth. That's in spite of Apple's opt-in  ad tracking switch that actually lowered revenue. They said it would have been higher, of course,  but Apple did their thing and we'll see what kind of impact that has.  Then Microsoft, I didn't quite get to siphon through Microsoft's earnings very deeply,  but they're reporting 22% growth. Then, Jeff, you mentioned Snap. What's going on with Snap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Snap was the one that was most hurt by Apple's ad move. It lost a lot of equity. For a while,  Facebook did too. Who wasn't here? Fortune on the 22nd said that the ad changes have  wiped out 142 billion off Snap, Facebook, and other online giants' equity. I'm not  going to subscribe to Fortune, so that's all I can tell you about that story. You get a  headline and a lead and that's it. The real funny one is when Forbes says I've reached  the end of the free articles, you charge for this stuff Forbes, but anyway.  I saw your tweet on it.  Another thing about it is Apple's still targeting, and Apple is targeting because it has its own data.  That's really the game here. It's not that Apple is purer than the morning dewy dawn  in its ethics about this. They're targeting ads too. They're just cutting off their competitors.  And Snap was the one that was hurt most. Google has plenty of their own data.  Facebook has its own data. Twitter was hurt some, but it has a different ad structure where it's  not quite as dependent in the same way. I watched a call on Nextdoor, which is going to go public  in its back, and they were asked about Apple. They said, well, we know who our people are because  it's real identity, so we have our own first-party data. Publishers, I think, are going to get hurt  badly by the Apple move because they don't have their own first-party data. Oddly,  after all these years, they still don't see people as a mass. So the Apple move,  this is just the beginning of it, but I think Apple will have pretty profound impact on the  media industries over the next year or two. We'll see how this flushes out. Let's remember that Google  decided to get out of its sandbox and not make the changes it was going to make to replace cookies.  So I don't think we have any idea where all this is going to land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Soterios Johnson And what do you think about this, Matthew,  in spite of what Apple has made with the changes here and the impacts that it has on these  companies? And not to mention all of the attention that we're also going to talk about later in this  show, everything else that's impacted. When I look at Facebook and Facebook's humming along,  doing okay, obviously, this is three months and a quarter, but the last couple of weeks have been  really damaging for that company. What do you envision the impact is going to be three months  from now? Do you think we're going to see any sort of dip or pressure based on what's happening  right now with Facebook in the spotlight? What do you think? Matthew Fertig and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matthew Bregman My bet would be no. Historically, this stuff happens. There's been, in fact, worse,  I would argue, for Facebook, especially in terms of actual congressional hearings and so on. And  the stock just seems to be completely divorced from those sorts of things. It just goes up.  No one, at least investors, don't seem to care about the kind of things we're going to be talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about. Soterios Johnson And then Matthew, not just the stock price, which is kind of the result of  the other metrics, but also the user numbers and the ad numbers. The stock price would be down if  those were down. And that's to say, this is talked about throughout media and media is going nuts  about it. But I'm not sure the rest of the world cares nearly as much as Joe Scarborough does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. And I think we've seen that multiple times. They'll be I'm sure there will be calls. There are  calls for a Facebook boycott. But even if you didn't do thousands of people, boycott Facebook,  there's still 3 billion more people who are happy to use it. And I think as a number of people  pointed out, in some countries, Facebook is basically the internet. That's how the vast  majority of people experience the internet. There was an awful tweet today, which I don't want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  get. Sorry. I believe Coralie Doctorow said it best a couple weeks ago about just the friction  that comes along with trying to leave Facebook. Whether it's once you get off of it, and then you  trying to figure out a way to communicate with your peers that are actually on the platform,  they can't seem to get away from it in each chair with them different options, whether it be  Slack or Discord or what have you. And they just like, no, Facebook's easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's my challenge entirely. That's been my experience the past three, I think it's now three  or four years since I officially deleted my account on Facebook. But I've noticed that's been one of  the real big drawbacks is like my interaction with a lot of the people who I consider friends,  but I'm obviously not in the habit or the mindset to reach out to them like on text message or an  email on a regular basis. It's just not the same as having their lives in your face on the feed  that you're checking on a daily basis and interacting with them in such a casual kind of way in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  regard. How do you replace that? That's what makes it so addictive. Yeah, that's what makes it so  addictive. And that's what we're talking about when we talk about network effects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But being with your friends is not a bad addiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no. But if it only comes through one platform, then you're kind of addicted to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that platform. I think for me, since deleting Facebook, however many years ago, it helped me  to further see exactly who my friends are, my true friends are, because the people that I interacted  with on Facebook, there was a large percentage of them that had all of my contact information,  including my phone number so they can just shoot a text or whatever. And there's a tiny percentage  of those folks that actually still keep in touch outside of Facebook. The rest were just looky-loos  and just, you know, clicking the like button was not necessarily taken into effect what Aunt  Perot was doing or what Aunt Perot was doing. I think the hard part is when it's family. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  our one of our daughters deleted her Facebook account and then was forced to get back on again  because she said she missed so much of what was happening, photos and babies and, you know, news  that was just shared amongst all sorts of family members that she didn't find out about. Sadly,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a lumping family with my friends on this scenario. I can't speak for y'all because a lot  of my family, they couldn't tell you the first thing about me right now. All they know is I don't  live in Charlotte anymore. They know I moved. That's about it. They don't know what I do or why I do  what I do and so forth because it's not plastered all over Facebook and nor have they even tried to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  reach out. You know? But Aunt, is that being fair to your family and friends? If kind of norms and  structures change and you're the odd one out and they're there and you're not, can't they say the  same thing about you that, boy, you know, Aunt used to be around, he used to care about us, but he just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  abandoned us. Oh, that's, yeah, they can definitely say that. But I can also say that for a good two  years, I gave it a fair shake and tried to interact with my family on that platform  back and forth pretty regularly. And it was never reciprocated. You know? So again, I started to see  the true colors of people on that platform because a lot of people on there just for the dopamine hit,  they want to see that like button go up. That's all I was for them. It's just somebody that could  potentially hit the like button on something they shared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought differently about Facebook. This is a whole side conversation, but a friend of ours,  her mother was dying effectively has since passed away and she loved Facebook for the,  you know, funny cat videos and stuff like that. It kept her amused. And so I actually started  posting things specifically for her. So I would think about as I went through the day,  if there was something funny, I would post it on there just so that she would have something to look

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  at. That's cool. And what about selfless? That's the thing. Yeah, it's that's a selfless act,  versus what most of the stuff we see on any of these social media platforms is where we  we're a little more inward and thinking about our own game. And I say we because I'm including

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  myself in that. Yeah. What about this? And Zuckerberg pointed this out in the earnings,  pointed out this decline in younger, young adult usage and teen usage,  specifically said, you know, called out TikTok is one of the most effective competitors we've ever  faced, which seems pretty darn spot on. TikTok is a force right now. We saw that come in a  couple of years ago, but here we are. Also mentioned plans to shift more to video via  specifically Instagram and reels. Obviously, we know, you know, that he has bigger ambitions  on transitioning the company into being more of a metaverse, whatever the heck that is company,  maybe even a name change is somewhere down the line. But what like is Facebook in a position  where where any of us here feel like they're capable of recapturing that younger energy or  are some of these, you know, kind of news stories like are there are the are the younger kids? Well,  they're probably too young to really clue into a lot of that stuff. But but they're not too young  to clue into the fact that Facebook is, let's put it in air quotes, uncool. Like, can Facebook change  that change that perception with with moves like this? What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's going to be tough. Yeah, I think it's gonna be hard to be interested. I'll be  interested to hear what Jeff thinks. But I, you know, I would never say it's impossible,  because I think they they did compete with snap pretty effectively. You know, they acquired  Instagram, which brought in a whole bunch of young users. But if you look at the numbers,  it's pretty bleak for them. If once you get below like 35, it's it's not good. And so I don't know  if reels is going to be enough to, you know, it's it's fine. But is it it I don't know that's enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to drag people away from TikTok. Right. I think that yeah, Instagram alone, Instagram, as you just  said, Matthew was brought in the young people, I think was smart and was the way to go. I don't  understand Zucks metaverse vision. He's talking tomorrow at a Facebook event, we can the developers  event online. And his keynote is going to be about the metaverse. I'm curious what he's going to say  because I still don't get it. As we said on the show a week ago, since we talked on the show,  that we go about the name change. I threw out a theory that I was half serious about, but getting  more serious about. I start to think that I don't know there's Zuckerberg sees this or not,  but it's time for him to kick himself upstairs. It's that's what's kind of can't be rescued,  I think, is the current management team. And and so if Zuckerberg were off thinking metaverse  thoughts in his ex lab of Facebook, still controlling, you know, importantly, stock and  thus the company so he's not gone. But if he took himself out of that, as I saw a story this week,  this is Facebook likes to think it's flat, but it's not it all leads to one peak. And that's  and that's Zuckerberg. If that weren't the case, if let's say Chris Cox took over or somebody from  the outside took over Facebook as a brand, and Instagram is run as a separate brand, which it  kind of is now. That's a different question. So here's my question. If Zuckerberg suggested the  same thing. Yeah. And by the way, let me let me just add one thing here, because I think there  is something that is important. I saw a terrible tweet today, to which a writer for BuzzFeed,  luckily called it what it is, which was which was anti semitism, calling for Zuckerberg to be  executed at a Nuremberg trial. I mean, it's getting it's getting ridiculous. It's getting mad  on the other side of this now. Right. So so the rhetoric is is so ridiculous and so over the top,  and on all sides of this. So what if Zuckerberg did kind of pull himself out, just as a thought  experiment? What if if he really did hand over to a strong manager, he truly weren't there,  it's like Larry and Sergey kind of disappears, goes off. How much of a difference of a difference  do you think that would make in the PR regulatory view as stock equity view of Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think any. Yeah, I don't think that would matter. I don't think we'll change the  steps away. There's still the same core of leadership there in place that's already

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and he still controls it. He still controls it. All the votes, the entire board, you know,  then he would just be a puppet master sort of. Exactly. I don't you know, and I don't think that  would change anything about the business model or targeting or privacy or data or any of the things

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that people seem concerned about. You know, you were asking if there's a way to capture more of  the youth demographic. I think that that's what it reminds me of the way things are with AI. You  have to look at the people working on the product. Like who's on the team of developers there across  the Facebook platform that can relate to those younger people. I'm pretty sure those folks have  almost aged out of that demographic by now, right? So why would we expect them to be able to relate  and be able to pull those younger folks into this ecosystem? I just keep picturing Mark Zuckerberg

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in the Hello, Fellow Kids jersey with the skateboard and wearing an Oculus Quest,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  wearing a Quest in that as well. I too like music, band.  Is that kind of part of the appeal though or the potential appeal to  younger users like some sort of metaverse slash VR focus thing? I mean, I don't know that it  necessarily is. I feel like metaverse in the way that I understand it, which is not very much,  but in my own interpretation of it, I feel like it's still a ways off. And does Zuckerberg  think that by shifting the company towards being more of a metaverse VR, whatever company it is,  that it also ends up appealing to the younger users, which are apparently incredibly important?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In my view, that's even more far out than my theory. I don't think anybody's going to care  about that. I don't think it distracts anyone. I actually think it has some potential. I know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook has been talking mostly about workplace, how you can have effectively Zoom meetings,  but with your avatar and 3D, which strikes me as incredibly boring. And I only want to do that if  I can be a giant eyeball or something from Second Life. But anyway, it does seem as though  there is some opportunity for... I know lots of kids are obsessed with, whether it's Minecraft  or Roblox, there's lots of potential there, I think, for kids that are more used, I think,  to being open to that type of environment, to a fully virtual environment. So whether  Facebook can pull that off or not, I don't know. There's certainly positioned in a way that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  at least from a technological standpoint and from having the money to back it up,  there's certainly in a position to be the player that has the most potential of making something  like that happen. I just don't know if it satisfies what I was talking about, if it actually  really energizes and gets the younger users really excited about Facebook again.  Yeah, I agree, Jeff. I think that's a much further off in the distance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the time they get that going, what we consider young will have shifted completely.  Right.  And the kids of today will be the adults of tomorrow.  So that's true. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's even more true.  And Matthew's in my world. We kept on hearing, and we still hear sometimes today,  oh, when the kids grow up, they'll start buying newspapers.  Right. It ain't happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And obviously the choices are my age or older.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like record albums. They're going to start. It's going to become a whole niche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're going to spin that vinyl. Right. And so I think the kids today have such a different world  and so many more choices and different choices. And I hope they experiment with those.  And so, yeah, here's the other thing about it.  And you've heard me do this before. The Internet is not baked. It's not finished.  The current proprietors are not the forever proprietors. Facebook is not forever.  And yeah, you guys who decided to quit it, you know, have some things you can't do, but  your life goes on. I don't think it's that big a deal.  And I think that there will be other things.  And I think maybe Zuckerberg sees that himself. That's why he's grasping for the metaverse.  You know, I think I've seen a dangerous trend lately. I saw two pieces of people I respect in  the last week asking whether there's too much speech. And I so hate that question because who  decides what's too much. But I do think we move into a world where we need services that do a  better job of telling us what's worth listening to, who we care about, what's relevant to us,  what's valuable to us, what's intelligent, what's accurate, all kinds of quality judgments where  we're putting all this resources now into playing whack-a-mole with bad crap. Sorry,  John, on Facebook. That's not going to get us very far. I almost said another word.  What does that really gain us? It gains us nothing but a lot of stomach acid and agita.  Whereas if we put resources and this is what the institution of the publisher and the editor and  the newspaper were, what are the institutions for this age? I hope young people invent those  institutions to find stuff worth listening to. That's interesting that Neil Dash said that he

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  was working on something that would help surface good content on Facebook and Facebook shut him

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  down and cut off access to its API. Wow. I didn't see that. I don't know. My starting point would  be Facebook though. There is. That's true. I don't know where it is, but there's a lot of content on  the web too. It's also about the open web that I think we want to support. Bring back blogs and RSS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. We need to go back to blogs and get our general conversation with Ken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where are the blog roles going? Let's head into the future. Let's go back to blogs.  Oh no, I was just saying I had a general conversation over the weekend with a friend  about having a voice for everybody. It's great that everybody has a voice and at the same time  it could be pretty problematic that some of the stuff that comes out of folks' mouths  leads to a lot of misinformation and turmoil and chaos and all of that.  But I don't know. I think that beats the alternative. I do like that those other people  that didn't really have a voice have a voice now more so than them not having a voice and us dealing  with the stuff that we have to deal with. Does that make any sense?  Amen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And feel empowered and supported in some way in sharing that. This reminds me of your  article, Matthew, from last week that British MPs calling for an end to online anonymity  and just the effects that something like that could possibly have. If you want to do a little  summary of that article, I'd appreciate it. But it seems to kind of tug on the same cord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think this is something that comes up all the time. Britain has been going through  a big debate for years about online harms and what action to take against them.  There was a white paper a couple of years ago. There's a bill now called the online safety bill.  And when this British MP was stabbed at a sort of open house, a number of MPs said,  we need to add an amendment to the safety bill that removes anonymity, despite the fact that  as far as I can tell, there's no connection between this stabbing and the person who's been accused  and online anonymity. So it was literally just an opportunity for people to kind of ride a hobby  horse about anonymity. And yet all the research that we have shows that if you got rid of anonymity  and required quote unquote real identities, you would smother so much potentially,  you know, important speech from people who for one reason or another, cultural or political or  financial, can't reveal their identities. So but it's something that keeps coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Kossoff, who wrote the book on Section 230, and he suffers on Twitter every day trying to  correct people from their misinterpretations about it, has a new book coming out very soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The best and worst thing he ever done, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep. So he has one new book called the United States of Anonymous coming out very soon. I  warped it because it's very, very good. And so the next attack, yes, is going to be against  anonymity. And the British legislation that Matthew's talking about.  You said you warped it?  I blogged it. No, I blurbed it. I blurbed it.  Okay, there we go.  I will blog it, but I blurbed it. Sorry.  Words are hard.  Funny words of our language.  I see blurb writing is a thing. I had to go through four or five versions. Jeff Kossoff  reaves together history, legal issues and public affairs in this vital, timely and highly readable  book. Now, how's that for blurbies? That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've blurbed and someone just suggested the blurb for me and said, is this okay? And I said yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, Kossoff is writing about anonymity and the British law frightens me to  death, legislation frightens me to death because it goes after not just illegal speech, but legal,  but harmful speech without defining it. It puts a chill on speech because everybody's going to be  scared to want to take down. YouTube made a mistake recently of taking down a video and  there's going to be false positives more and more and more and more if we go after this.  Then if you go after anonymity, as Matthew said, you go after the vulnerable.  And so we get less speech. This is what some institutions want. They do indeed want less  speech, but as Ant was saying, we'll take the equation of hearing people we couldn't hear  before in mass media. But that's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the risk is if you, you might be okay with the UK's bill or Canada's talking about  a similar bill, but there are lots of countries that are going to take that ball and run with it  and bring in legislation that prevents all sorts of people from speaking. In fact, they're doing  it. They're doing it right now based on things like fake news, which is whatever the government  defines as something you can't say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. Cool stuff. We've got a whole lot more coming up. We're going to take a break  and then we'll get right back into all this stuff. It's great to have you all here. Jeff Jarvis,  of course, and Pruitt, Matthew Ingram. I love talking with you guys about all this stuff.  I appreciate that you're here. Today's episode of This Week in Google is brought to you by  something really cool. This is all about accessibility. It's userway.org. Userway  is all about bringing accessibility to the entire web because if you're not bringing  accessibility to your website, you're leaving a whole lot of people out in the cold. They  can't buy your product. They can't find out information about your product or follow what  you're doing. If your site is not set up to appeal to everyone and to be accessible by everyone,  then you're losing out. They're losing out too. Every website without exception needs to be  accessible because it's out there. It's a public entity and it's the right thing to do. Federal  ADA law actually mandates equal access to services for all Americans, which means that you could  actually be liable if your website does not meet ADA laws for accessibility. That's where userway  comes in. It has an incredible AI-powered solution that tirelessly enforces the hundreds of WCAG  guidelines. All you need is a single line of JavaScript code. It's that easy. Userway can  achieve more than an entire team of developers with just that. Userway's AI and machine learning  solutions actually power accessibility for more than one million websites. Leading brands,  the brands that you know well, Coca-Cola, Disney, eBay, FedEx, that's just a few of them,  so many more. Now, Userway is actually making its best-in-class enterprise-level accessibility  tools available to small and medium-sized businesses. When you scale, you'll need  Userway to do it. It's an accessible and compliant website is ultimately the goal. It isn't just the  right thing to do. It also makes business sense. Like I said, it's an Achilles heel for websites  to give everyone access to all the functions and aspects of your website. Registration forms,  navigation menus, shopping carts. So many times these things are just not accessible,  and that means that you're leaving millions of people out. Userway is going to make that  a whole lot easier for you and enable them to purchase your products, which is what you're  hoping for as well. For years, Userway has been on the cutting edge. They've been creating  innovative accessibility technologies that actually push the envelope of what's possible  with AI, machine learning, computer vision. Userway's AI automatically fixes violations  at the code level. It's all done automatically. When you're visiting the site, this stuff happens.  You don't even know that it's happened. Here are just a couple of things that Userway can do.  It can auto-generate image alts. So it's essentially putting text to the images that you have on your  site. If you haven't already put in those image alts, the AI can recognize, and we talked about  it many times on this week in Google, this kind of technology. It can recognize what's going on  inside of the image and actually turn that into text so that everybody can get those image alts.  If they can't see the image, at least they can read the text or have it read to them.  It remediates complex nav menus, navigation menus. It ensures all pop-ups are totally  accessible. It fixes vague link violations, any broken links, all that stuff. It ensures  that your website makes use of accessible colors, which can be very easy to overlook.  More importantly, you're still maintaining your brand. So it's not changing the colors of your  brand, but it is taking any inaccessible colors, these colors that are easy to, for someone who,  for someone who's visiting the site and has trouble recognizing certain colors,  this is going to correct those colors so that they can see everything and some things are missed  along the way. And it gives you a detailed report of all the violations that were fixed  on your website, which is super useful to have. UserWay is platform agnostic. So if you're using  WordPress, Shopify, Wix, you're clear. UserWay is cost-effective. It's easy to use. And those  aren't the only platforms, by the way. I mean, the sky's the limit. Same goes for AEM, Sitecore,  SharePoint. UserWay actually integrates seamlessly with all. And you can let UserWay help your  business meet its compliance goals and improve the experience for your users. Check out their  free scanning tool. They have a free scanning tool that you can use to see if your website  is ADA compliant. The Voice of Siri, many would consider the most popular voice assistant,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  has a message about UserWay. UserWay is trusted by more than 1 million websites  and 60 million users with disabilities. Visit userway.org to learn how one line of code

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  can make your website accessible. UserWay can make any website fully accessible and ADA compliant  with UserWay. Everyone who visits your site can browse seamlessly and customize it to fit their  needs. It's also a perfect way to showcase your brand's commitment to millions of people with  disabilities. Go to userway.org slash twit and you'll get 30% off UserWay's AI-powered  accessibility solution, UserWay, making the internet accessible for everyone. Visit  userway.org slash twit today. And we thank UserWay for their support of this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, my 95 year old nearly deaf father up here and vision going to, I've gotten such respect for  accessibility and the things that just are hard for him and hard to get to work for him to explain.  So accessibility is just vital and I've not paid enough attention to it in my career and I feel  awful that it took this moment for me to see that. So this is a really important sponsor and not just  for what it does, but for the message it sends. So I'm glad to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. Totally agree. And it's important to continue shining a light on the ways that things  are lacking from an accessibility standpoint on the internet. And we try to do that on these  shows, but it's really easy to lose the focus of that, right? When these aren't problems that  affect you directly, it's easy to overlook it, but super important. Let's see here. Do we, I mean,  I feel like we kind of like this ties in with what we were talking about before is the whole  Facebook papers thing. At the same time, I'm going to totally admit that like, I am like on Facebook  revelation overload. Like I've kind of at this point just accepted the fact that, hey, there's  a bunch of stuff that's leaked out and I've read a few headlines, read through some articles and  everything, but I'm exhausted by it. That's where I stand on Facebook right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't feel bad. I, no, I don't think so. I completely understand. And in fact, I think,  yeah, I think a lot of journalists would agree. There's just too much.  And that's one of my problems with the way that this was rolled out. I don't know who to blame,  Frances Haugen or her handlers or whoever, but to just, to have, to create the kind of situation  where 15 or 20 or 30 different outlets are all writing the exact same story with subtle details  about the same five things. It seems like a bad way to handle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Matthew, can you explain the, because I missed this too. I agree with you, Jason. I just,  I'm overloaded. So I've missed things. One thing I've missed, which I bet you followed Matthew,  was the controversy about the journalist consortium over the documents and how it  came together and then it's breaking apart. And what happened there? Can you explain that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I wish I knew. All I know is that there was an initial consortium and there was an initial  embargo. And then the New York Times effectively said, embargoes don't apply to us.  We're the New York Times.  You're not.  They said, oh, this is based on other stuff, not what was in the documents. And then everybody  else was like, oh, okay, I guess it's okay for the Times. So we'll just, you know, so this is a  classic journalistic problem. Cooperation lasts up until someone thinks they can get a little extra  attention. And so then what you get is just a dog pile of fighting over scraps and everyone trying  to sort of make the most out of the scraps they have and not sort of recognize anybody else who's  written about it. So don't link to them and don't mention that the Wall Street Journal has written  about most of this already. So I think you get this just cacophony, which does not help anyone  if you're even remotely interested, you'll get overloaded. And if you're not remotely interested,  you will just tune out. And so I think if you even assuming there are things here that should be paid  attention to, and that should be called attention to, this is the worst possible way to go about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is interesting because when, oh, sorry. Sorry, go ahead, Mr. Howe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was just going to say, and that's interesting because if, or it's interesting to me because  I know that if there was something that I had a burning desire that the world needed to know,  I would want to broadcast that as loud and as far as possible. But it seems like that's kind of  what's happening here. And instead of it becoming like reinforcing the details behind it, it just  becomes very confusing and numbing. Yeah, numbing, numbing is the right word for confusing slash  numbing slash. At a certain point, it's like I'm so buried beneath this information that it almost  feels like too much for me to get in there and wade through it. And actually Alex Stamos, former

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook head of digital security pointed out that it's ironic in a way that this is happening  because it's pretty much the same kind of thing that people complain about Facebook doing, which  is to focus solely on engagement and clicks and attention at the expense of understanding

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and information and accuracy. Because that's our model. Facebook, I mean,  Facebook obviously has got a different way, it's different scale, all of that's true. But media  have no self-reflection here that we're an attention-based business model. We engage in  this kind of sensationalism and attention grabbing. We pump up stories for that purpose.  There was a story just out, I think amidst of all this today, about how Facebook,  one of the things that Facebook unleashed that surprised them, they didn't know what to do with,  was how media was going to react to and try to create more. They were going to create more  clickbait to get the Facebook clickbait. And so Facebook helped make media worse. Right. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  media don't acknowledge that. My beef is we spend a lot of time each and every week talking about  the stuff that's going on with Facebook. And granted, they have a gazillion dollars to help  alleviate some of these issues and stuff. But at the same time, and I know this is totally out of  left field, but this is the thought that I had this morning when I was speaking to one of my friends  about it. So there are bigger issues out there, such as just food here in the nation. The FDA  and what's going on with them and literally putting poison into the people that can't afford to have  better cuts of meat and things of that nature. Why is it okay to have hormones inside of chicken  and things like that? And why is it less expensive to go out and buy a hot dog than it is to buy  a salad? I think problems like that deserve way more attention than the stuff that Facebook is  getting right now from all of our leaders in Congress and stuff like that. But none of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  gets brought up. By the way, I think that if it was what we said earlier, Facebook's not suffering  in users. It's not suffering in advertisers, it's not suffering in stock price. So there's a  disconnect here. And if you know, legislators, if you want to go after companies people actually  do not like, go after the phone company and the cable company. We all go. But they give a lot of  money. A lot of money. Poor Matthews stuck up there with carrier pigeons. Why don't we? Geez,  you got a good man for his sake. Yeah, don't, we're lost cause. So yeah, you are. Sorry for the tangent,  but that was all. No, it was a good tangent. It was right. No, I know it wasn't a tangent at all.  It's about trying to find perspective here. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, indeed. Well, then I think we can all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  agree that the Facebook files, papers, whatever you want to call them. I think we're spent on that.  So why don't we transition? If you want to have a little laugh there, if you want to have a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  laugh, line 57, as my friend said on Twitter, this is something to regulate. Is it the recruiting  video? Yeah, no, this is the open enrollment. Open enrollment benefits video. Oh yeah, I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right. Yeah. That was pretty funny, but I got to tell you, having sat through a bunch of  these corporate meetings about open enrollment, sadly, that was the best I've seen. It was pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  good. And I think you're going to get a work for Facebook now. Oh gosh, I hate those meetings and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's a lot of information when it comes to open enrollment because you got this plan and that  plan, it covers this, but it doesn't cover that. It costs this, it doesn't cost that. And  it's a mess. And so HR representatives showing up to present this information to thousands of  employees is as concise as possible. That could be challenging. And seeing this video, I'm like,  yeah, this is way better than anything I've ever seen. But it's still stoned. I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is basically a musical. And you're now endorsing this musical? Yes, I know. I don't  understand your taste in it. I'm not getting it. It's better than cats. No, I am not a musical fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're 100% correct on that. But boy, have you ever sat down, think about Ben Stein trying to  tell you about HMOs and in high deductible plans and think about that. I'd rather have the musical

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  than Ben Stein. I love Ben Stein. So we've got Anne's pyramid of life. At the very bottom is HR

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  presentations. Slightly above that in music. I realize we've talked a lot about this and people  in the chat are like, what are they even talking about? We didn't really even show a clip of it.  We can probably show a small clip of this just to get a little bit of the cringe factor out there  if you all want to see it. But essentially Facebook made a musical around its HR open enrollment.  I mean, I guess I could see something like this on TikTok. It would probably be done a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  better though. A TikTok person would probably make this one. I can't knock any one of these people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  who's doing these performances because they did a great job considering the material that  they're working with. But it's just one of those things where as you're watching it or as I was  watching it, it's kind of like curling my toes. I think it'd be better if there was a sea shanty  though. Yes, sea shanty would have been very now strangely. As you've done it in TikTok style,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that'd be the right thing for Facebook now. Right, right. Duet style on TikTok. So anyways,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  anyone who wants to hear the rest of that catchy song, you certainly can. It's floating out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look for that. Can I ask you a question there, Jason? Yeah, go for it. I know it's not a democracy.  No, it is. Go. I'm eager after a week, very eager after a week to hear what you think of your unit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of the Pixel 6 Pro. Yeah, so about that. Well, so I don't have the Pixel 6 Pro with me right  now. Leo has it. Yes. So he has it with him. He came by last night and picked it up for me,  he and Lisa after all about Android. So he has that. I have the 6, so I'm not left out in the  cold or anything. It's actually kind of convenient because it gives me a chance to spend some time  with this. If I had the 6 Pro, I'd be more inclined to just continue using it and never  actually get around to using this one. So this is the regular 6. But yeah, I used the 6 Pro for the  last week and a day, I'd say. And we talked about it a little bit on All About Android. Actually,  took great length on All About Android last night, had a really great show. And I'd say this is,  without question, Google's most polished device that they've created. And I think that was kind  of, you expect that going in, right? Like everything that we've seen leading up to the release of the  Pixel 6 and 6 Pro has seemed like Google is really taking this even more seriously than they have  the previous Pixels. It's a fantastic device. It's hard for me to know things about the tensor chip  and how that compares with other processors because there were moments in my usage of the 6 Pro  where a random slowdown would happen and be like, well, why is it stalling right there? Is that the  iOS? Is that Android 12? Or is that the Pixel 6? Is that the tensor chip not being as fast as other  chips? It's really hard to know where to place blames for little moments like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that the app optimized for Android 12 and stuff like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. It could be a number of things, but it's a fantastic device. It's certainly the  device that I'm going to be using for the next year until Google releases their next one. But  that's no different from any Pixel. That's always my choice. I think they did a great job. The 4X  telephoto lens that they have in that phone, I really enjoyed using that. I just love having  that extra extension. That's probably one of my favorite new features on the new device.  But it had some oddness with it too. There would be times where I'd be using the camera to take a  picture with the 4X and the lens, depending on what was in front of the lens, I could see the  software switching it from the optical lens to the main lens digitally zoomed to 4X. The quality of  your photo between those two things is going to be wildly different. One's a digital zoom and the  other one's an optical zoom that's going to look sharp and crisp. I don't understand why I can't  lock it in like that. A couple of random little things like that that I discovered in the 6  Pro in my time, but again, I only had a week with it. So it's really hard to know what the longevity  of that device is going to be. But so far, yeah, I think it's pretty great. I know, Ant, you pre-ordered  one. Jeff, did you, Matthew, are you a Pixel user or what phones do you guys use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got a Samsung. I had a, I have the S20 fan edition, I think it is. I did use the Huawei  and then a number of technical difficulties occurred involving me dropping it. And so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I hate it when that happens.  In the pond while you were rowing, perhaps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I have lost a number of phones in the lake. You have?  Kayaking. But anyway, this one I just dropped and then at one point the case was the only thing  holding it together. It was literally shards of glass. So yeah, so I got the Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's it. And that's a solid phone. From what I understand, I haven't used it  personally, but everything that I've read about that phone when it came out and beyond has been,  you know, the Samsung. For me, the camera is the main thing.  Yeah. Yeah, that's one of the most important things for me too. Samsung does good with their  cameras. Google has historically done good. That's why I got the Huawei P20,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because the cameras were amazing. Solid. Yeah. Mr. Howell, you mentioned that, you know,  this is something you would do every year, is check out the latest Pixel phone. But I gotta tell  you, I'm glad I'm not in your position because the five, I had no interest in that phone. None.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and I didn't either. I was using the 4XL even while I had the five in my possession.  That says a lot right there.  Yeah. Yeah. Well, and you know, for a couple of reasons, but I really like the face scanning  aspect on the 4XL, even though people were complaining because, well, we're wearing masks  all the time. It's like, yeah, but I'm not going anywhere. Yeah. But there were a couple  of reasons that I stuck with it, but then it started doing some weird stuff. So I was like,  all right, fine. I'll spend some time with the five. And I got used to it, but it was by no means,  you know, Google's best phone as far as pixels are concerned. I will be happy and proud to use the  six pro going forward. It's, I mean, the design, what they've come up with that like signature look  really looks nice when you have it in your hands, right? Like it looks interesting online,  but I wondered if once I got it, I was going to be like, I don't know. And it turns out it's just,  it's a really eye catching device. So I'm looking forward to that. Jeff, did you order it also?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so yeah, of course I was usual grumpy Jeff. And I couldn't order it while you were presenting  with Leo or talking about that. And I lost out. Then I got, then I came back and I managed to get  the 128, but I wanted the 256 and I want this phone to last. And so then it came back again.  I got the 256 is coming December 1. And I'm telling myself, calm down, Jeff, that's just fine.  Your present phone works just fine. You can wait till December 1st. Oh, but it's so hard. So it's  hard. It's hard. I went into best by today just to touch one. I didn't know it was going to have  that kind of Samsungy curve, half curved screen. What do you think of that? Yeah, you know, that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  actually didn't bug me as much as I thought it was going to, because I am definitely a fan,  more of a fan of the flat look. The regular six has the flat display on the edges. It doesn't  have the curve. But so, you know, so if you want the flat, if you absolutely have to have the flat,  the six would be the one you're going to save a couple hundred dollars if you do that. But I always  had the device in a case anyways, because I will inevitably drop that thing and it will break. It's  just how I know that's me at this point. I accept it. I would love to be the one that, you know,  that that can have this, this nice unprotected phone, you know, in use all the time, but it's  just going to fall. And I know it at this point and I embrace that, that and with the case on,  I really didn't notice that the curved edge on the side of the display, because the, because the  sides kind of raise up on the case high enough that it really doesn't matter. I mean, it's,  it's a little curved there. Yes. But you're not getting those inadvertent clicks that you might  get if you are or touches if you didn't have it in a case and the side of your finger bumped it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's my experience. What does yours arrive in? Mine is probably going to arrive at the end of the  show is scheduled for today, but I already got my tempered glass and already got my case over there.  I can't wait to hear what goes on. But yeah, I'm really looking forward to trying the camera out.  I have a product photo shoot that I want to try to do with it. I've already staged it up  down in the garage already. It's lights and stuff just to see what it's capable of. Because a lot  of times these, not just the pixel, but most of these newer smartphones, the lighting can make a  big difference in performance. Oh yeah. In addition to just sort of understanding composition. But  when we look at the reviews of the five versus the reviews of the six here, the signal to noise ratio  is supposedly night and day. There's not as much noise in low light situations with this pixel six  because of the larger sensor. That just makes perfect sense. So we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. The AI aspects of the camera, obviously, that's a big part of the pixel six story. The  tensor chip, as Google has been very vocal about, is all about these extra AI on device enhancements  and everything. I'm super curious to see what you think of some of those new camera features.  They're pretty awesome what you can do with them. Doing the open exposure.  In my usage of the phone over the last week, I feel like I didn't have the right kind of examples  to put them to the test. I'm not at a subway with the subway train passing behind my wife,  and I'm taking a picture of her so I can get the motion of the subway.  Do you try to erase anything from a picture? Try that?  Actually, you know what I did? We featured this last night on All About Android. I tried to  replicate ... Do you remember back in Google I.O. 2017 where Google showed off the kid who was  playing baseball and had the chain link fence? They were like, and soon we'll have technology  for you to remove the chain link fence. That's been this ongoing joke of like, okay, when is soon  and when is that ever going to happen, Google? Apparently they could never make it work.  Well, the magic eraser seemed like- Well, you can do it in Photoshop.  Well, you can do it in Photoshop. Of course, there are ways to do that.  And it's still challenging in Photoshop. Google said they were bringing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's that?  It's still challenging in Photoshop though. I mean, because Adobe has their own AI called Sensei.  If you can properly get the selection squared away and use the content-aware fill algorithm,  it does a pretty decent job. But again, that's on a desktop computer or a laptop or what have you,  not necessarily on a mobile device piece of silicon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Exactly. And that is one thing that I kind of played around with. I was like,  how difficult is this to do on Photoshop? And I'm not a Photoshop genius, not like you.  So I ended up pulling that image of the kid with the chain link fence and taking it into  Photoshop to see if I could remove the fence to the degree that Google did. And I kind of gave  up on it because it was so much work. It was very tedious. And that's the thing that this actually  is not tedious at all. The magic eraser is really just as easy as drawing a circle around the thing  and it goes away. And if you don't like the way it took it away and replaced it with its own  interpretation of what the background is, you can undo that and do it again. And within a half a  second, it gives you the new version of it. And I mean, the pictures were by no means perfect.  Google never said in the introduction of the magic eraser, and will finally allow you to remove  chain link fences from your photos. They never said that. I knew that this wasn't going to be perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can we remove a family member that we don't want in the photos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That I think is really, well, I don't know about family member, but people, yes. I think that's  part of why Google did this. Because if you're taking a photo and that's part of what their  marketing has been, right? You've got two or three people in the shot and then you've got those  people in the background. This picture would be so much better if those people were moved and you  draw your circle around them and they disappear. And yeah, it works pretty darn well doing that.  It's, I'm sure if you enlarge those images and you scrutinize it, you're going to find some,  you know, some weirdness. But with how easy it is compared to what the alternative is,  pretty impressive. And it's all happening on device really quickly. Like when I was  doing those images, it was like, bam, bam, bam. It's really fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which makes me think that we're going to see a lot more advances beyond just phones  in what can happen locally. You know, the same chip in a Chromebook, pardon me, could actually make it  incredible. And as my photo guru, as all of our photo guru, did you get a chance to look at the  next story on the, the, the, the, the wall street journal analysis of Google's claims about skin

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  tone? I couldn't judge the photos very well myself. I didn't catch that, but I did listen to the  conversations between them and as well as Adobe all talking about it. Again, some people were using  the word bias a week or so ago and I don't necessarily say it's bias. It's just, that's just  how the chemicals were back in the days when you were dealing with film. It is what it is.  It was a lot harder to get people of color to look right on film. That had nothing to do with bias.  That's just the way the films were. And a lot of the digital photography is basically trying to  simulate the way film was back in the days and it's just gotten better and better over time  and faster. But still it's not something that was easily fixable right out the gate. It took some  time to refine that whole process. Last night on the show. A Samsung, like we said, we looked at  the Samsung phone or whatever phone it was that Mr. LaPorte was using that I made fun of him.  Um, that was with a white person in the screen, Mrs. LaPorte, and it didn't get it right.  You know, it's, it's, it's not necessarily bias. It's just not necessarily easy to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which I think is part, is part of why I was happy that Google, and I've said this now a couple of  times, so apologies if you've heard me say this before, but I'm really happy that Google  has shown their light on this as something that they are committed to working on. Because I think  it, because I think it, it kind of forces them to continue working on it. Not, not that they  wouldn't otherwise, but putting it so publicly out into the limelight like that. Kind of,  it's almost like forced accountability, right? Yeah, forced accountability. That's a great way  to put it. Yeah. Of course, the feature we're talking about here is called real tone. We  actually talked about this also last night, our guest, Tshaka Armstrong, who came by your  recommendation, and so thank you. He's fantastic on the show. And he did a really great review  of the phone for Android central and spent a good chunk of the time talking about this particular  feature and, you know, talking about the fact that he and his friend, you know, when they're in shots,  you know, normal cameras would make both of their skin seem kind of like chocolatey. I think he  called it like the Hershey effect. Hershey, yep. Yeah. The Hershey chocolate effect. And,  and with the Pixel 6 Pro, you can see the differences, the subtle but perceivable  differences in their skin tone, thanks to what Google has done with real tone. So yeah, I mean,  from my perspective, yeah, it's, it's great that Google is committing themselves to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they have to be judged. That's why we'll have the journal to the story. Exactly. Amateurs view  of the photos is why I'm eager for Anne's professional view. It looks like Apple just  blew out what lit it up more, just overexposed things, which I don't think is sufficient,  obviously. So there's a lot more subtly to it in how it calculates. It'd be really interesting to  hear how they're doing this and what their standards are. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I'm sitting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  here looking at, let me see if I could pull it up on my screen. I'm looking at a shot, I had to do  some headshots for myself because someone was asking for new headshots from you. So something  that's coming up that I'm working on. And I shot this with my DSLR. And I remember going in here  working on the post-processing and, you know, getting the skin tones right. My DSLR, I had to  change the skin tone because it thought I looked like that. You know, and that's with Canon. My  skin is, yeah, I got beautiful skin, but boy, it's not that vibrant. You know, so again, it's all,  it's all in, this is a tough process. It doesn't matter who you are. So I had to dial it back a  little bit, you know, that's more natural. That looks more like me, not what the camera's  interpretation was of me. It's ridiculously bronze looking skin that it's not necessarily me. It  looks good, but that's not me. So it's a challenge. Yeah. It reminds me of-  You do have great skin though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Canon.  Yes, you do.  It reminds me of what we've seen, you know, on smartphone displays over the years where you've  got the, you know, the displays that are like a very flat, maybe a cool kind of presentation to it.  And then you've got displays like Samsung has been totally, you know, one of the companies that,  you know, when you are looking at a Samsung display, it's not necessarily a true representation of  color. It's like a vibrant, more vibrant saturated-  It's like HDR.  Yeah, totally. And they're making those changes. And it's kind of like, you know,  certain headphones out there that really accentuate the low end. And there are people  that really like that. They aren't necessarily looking for true. They're looking for enhanced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see a lot of that in Instagram photos, actually. People will use the filters or  whatever to just, and it's completely, you know, blown out the colors or just amped up to the  point where it's not even remotely realistic. And yet I think that's kind of what they associate  with a good photo.  Right. Right. Or what they're looking for in a photo is to not necessarily see them the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they're used to seeing themselves, but see a new, you know, a, air quotes, better version

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of themselves or, you know, what are we that way is defined by?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a time and place for that stuff. I get it. As an artist, there's a time where you want to  enhance certain features and things like that. But if someone is looking for a journalistic  representation of me, I need to give them a true journalistic representation of me and make sure  I dial it in the right way and not some superimposed beards and skin tones and muscles.  And, you know, because if I show up and I don't look like that picture, that's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you toned it down too much, though. I think you're, I think the one you showed,  I think your skin does glow more than you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, well, she's now better get my eyes checked in.  I wanted to show another thing here, Mr. Jammer B. Mr. LaPorte took a picture on the plane  and that's what the Pixel 6. I went ahead and grabbed it out of the Discord because it's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course, it has like a yellowish quality to it, doesn't it? What is that shirt? Wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a second. What is he wearing? He's wearing a pepper shirt.  A pepper shirt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that looks like peppers.  Oh yeah. Okay. He's wearing a chili pepper shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, Ed, but I just, I, I, I, squirrel, I had to comment on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A good eye.  Well, looking at this image, okay, that came from the Pixel device, a smartphone. He's inside of a  airplane cabin. That's limited lighting inside of those things. So the phone should struggle a  little bit. And it did. When I zoomed in, there's definitely a little bit of noise and grain  right here, but that's not, that's not a knock against the Pixel, right? It's a phone. It's a  tiny sensor. There's not enough light. That's what's going to happen. So now I hope to see what he  shares, you know, when he's out and about in Oaxaca with some better light and see where that thing  looks like. But that right there, I'm like, yeah, that's just a typical smartphone. I can't,  I wouldn't know if that was a Pixel. I wouldn't know if that was an iPhone or whatever,  because it's just an image shot in the light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the two, two, two things that camera phones have really made huge  advances on. And the first one I noticed was the Huawei, which is why I got it, was, was low light  and zoom. You know, lots of cameras were taking good photos in the sunlight, you know, outside and  so on. But you really notice things fall off in low light. And, and I think all the manufacturers  have made huge strides with both of those over the last couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I would agree. A lot of improvements on low light. Google seems to be one of the first to  really go there with gusto, you know, with their night site, however many years ago. And then it  seemed like that that raised up in priority for, for everybody else. And you know, Apple, Samsung,  you know, everybody has their their kind of night mode now. And as a result, it's improved  everybody's shots in those low light experiences. But to my eyes, man, Google does it does it  probably near the best. You can get some amazing shots out of those night modes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wanted to talk to you about the Android operating system, sir.  Yeah, as it is, I'm okay. Right. It was this is version 12. Right? Yeah, it's version 12. Yeah.  Okay, so I got that update on my Pixel 4. And it looks fine from a functionality standpoint with the  the large tiles at the top when you swipe down and all of that. That's great. But what's bothering  me is this color scheme that they're going with. And supposedly it reads off of whatever your  wallpaper colors are to figure out how to scan the rest of the OS from a color scheme.  Do I have that correct?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's material you which, you know, essentially, you can see like the the buttons  and quick settings is one example, kind of mirrors, it's like a, it's like an average effect of one of  the dominant colors. And actually, this widget, you can see the clock widget. Yeah, I mean, that's  my interpretation of it anyways. I don't know exactly how that makes a big difference. Because,  man, it's not a perfect. Yeah, it's not a perfect match. It's like it takes the general theme of  the color right now. This is over blue more than it is yellow. So therefore this the arms in the  in the clock here are a blue hue. They're not the same blue. But it's okay. But it's like a  complimentary blue. If I actually move this down, you can see it just changed to yellow, right.  And so there's different aspects throughout the OS that do that. And and apps, you know, Google has  done better this time when they did material design. It's like they released material design and,  and these, you know, apps are going to get material design coming soon. And it's low trickle for like  two years. This time, they got all their apps or the majority of their apps into material you land.  And it's all set to kind of tie into whatever the color scheme that the device has pulled out of  whatever your wallpaper happens to be. If I change that wallpaper, you know, it's oops,  how do I do that here? I gotta go to the screen. It doesn't have a bunch of stuff on it. Right. But  if I go here, I can, you know, find something else. Maybe we'll do this, you know, very blue.  It's going to require a download. I don't know if it'll be fast enough. But essentially, it will.  There we go. Okay, so we're good. So it's downloaded that we'll put that to home and lock screen.  There we go. And now, well, you know, it's still a blue, but it's a it's a different blue.  Yeah. And so yeah, I mean, you know, it's all kind of dependent on what you have your your wallpaper  image, which might seem like a small thing, but along with all the other design choices  that they've done, I like it. I was excited for it until I was excited for it until I actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  installed it and saw what happened. But you say it does make sense. Because it looks at my phone  and it gives me a lot of pink. And it gives me a lot of like a greenish yellowish every now and then  because I'm dealing with a lot of Clemson. My screen is a Clemson stadium football stadium.  So there's a lot of orange and purple and stuff like that. So it's averaging all of that together.  And I guess yeah, that will give you pink. And when I go to look at notifications, I'm like,  why is my screen pink? And it's a bit annoying. I clearly have nothing against pink since I'm  actually wearing a pink shirt right now. But I don't really want it on my phone. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a picture. Go ahead. I was just gonna say there are ways to tweak that and everything  manually as well. But yeah, what were you gonna say? I have a picture of marks and angles in a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  statue in Berlin, which I have on there I love. And behind it is the beginning of fall trees.  So my little horrible scalloped clock looks like baby couldn't help it brown.  And it's really unappealing. And there's nothing I can do about it. I don't think right. I there's  no way to change the choice it made other than to change the background. Well, that's actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so let's see here. So I'll go into wallpapers. And then you've got wallpaper colors. So this is  this theming, these theming options are derived from my wallpaper choice. And you have different  different selectors down there. So you can kind of in this case, they're they're all very similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I would say two of my three are exactly the same. Yeah, yeah. I suppose you could go in here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and you could you can decide like this is this is a color palette. Is this color palette tied

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  into the wallpaper? No, it must be exactly the palette that I have on my screen when you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So this says basic colors. So this might just be default colors. I haven't really played  around with this that much. But there are some tweaks that you can make to it. But I don't know  if it's a wide open. Go nuts sort of thing. Yeah. Unfortunately. All of the interesting pastel colors  and stuff. So baby couldn't help it brown. Yeah. Never heard before. Showtime. Let's take a break  and thank the sponsor of this show. And then we'll be back into well more we've got more Google and  other things to talk about. This episode of this week in Google is brought to you by CrowdStrike.  You've seen the headlines. You hear all about ransomware. I mean ransomware is everywhere.  Ransomware attacks basically happening all the time and threatening businesses,  holding them hostage. Really, I can feel like if you have a business, it can feel like it's only  a matter of time before that threat comes to you. You might then have to decide do you pay  or do you lose everything? What a horrible position to be in. But you do have a third option.  What about defeating your adversaries before the fight even starts? And that's what CrowdStrike  enables you to do with CrowdStrike. You're not alone in the battle against ransomware.  A secure future demands a shared defense. And that's why CrowdStrike's Falcon platform uses  their threat graph power by advanced AI to analyze the behavior on your devices, on your servers,  on your cloud workloads. And then with that, find the threats and then stop them before they have  a chance to go any further. Their security platform delivers the industry's most powerful set  of tools to fight today's most sophisticated cyber attacks, all delivered through the cloud,  through a lightweight intelligent agent. Forcer Study finds that Falcon Complete actually delivers  403% ROI. How do you like that? And in doing so, 100% confidence. We talked with CTO Michael  Sintonis. He actually explained how the threat graph system is actually a collaborative platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the crowd in CrowdStrike and that's the concept. The original vision was to build the  fundamentals. It was to bring in all of those signals, that telemetry, and the more data we  get, the more information that we have. We can use that to protect all of our customers in real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. CrowdStrike harnesses the power of every click, every action, every ally to grow stronger  and stop cyber threats before they can stop you. Falcon Complete stops breaches every hour of every  day. They've got expert management, threat hunting, monitoring, remediation, and backed by  CrowdStrike's breach prevention warranty. And they're not just saying it. They guarantee it  for Falcon Complete managed customers will receive a warranty covering up to $1 million  in the event of a breach. How about that? Terms and conditions apply. And by the way, Gartner  Magic Quadrant named CrowdStrike a leader for endpoint protection platform for 2021. Congrats  on that. Join the fight and experience the power of Falcon Platform for free today at  crowdstrike.com slash twit. Make sure and go to that special URL. That way they know that you came  via twit. That's crowdstrike.com slash twit. CrowdStrike because what we've built together is  worth defending together. And we thank CrowdStrike for their support of this week in Google.  All right. What's some other Google stories that we can talk about here? I want to see if we can  keep it locked in a Google for a bit. We've got, oh, actually this is interesting. Okay. So what's  the latest version of Android that launched officially? What is it? Is it Android 12?  12, right? 12? No, wrong. Yeah, that's right. Android 12 came out a week ago. We already have  the new version of Android on the horizon. Good Lord. Yeah, this is weird, but it totally happened  today. Did it fix his wallpaper color? No. This isn't even an incremental update on like  bug fixes and security patches and everything. This is like a new version of Android called  Android 12 L. And this was shown off at Android Dev Summit, which happened today. So it's a developer  summit that Google puts on. And they talked all about Android 12 L, which we had heard  previously that there was potentially a point release that would be coming a little bit later.  I don't know if, yeah, I think on Twig you guys had discussed at least to some degree that there  were rumors that there was a possibility that Google would release a foldable device during the  Pixel event. And the rationale around this was, okay, if that was to happen, it would have to  happen by the end of the year. That's what some of the leaks said. And there would be a new version  of Android to enable it. Turns out that this is the new version of Android to enable it. We still  know nothing about a Pixel foldable, but Google showed off and kind of spilled out the roadmap  for this next version of Android. It's all about tablets and foldables. It brings a bunch of  functionality for larger screen devices running Android, and as well, kind of like usability  tweaks that improve the foldable experience. So like a bottom of the screen task bar, similar  to what you'd see on just a regular desktop OS, something like that inside of Android.  Some enhancements to split screen and some of those navigating or pulling an app from your task  bar and putting it into the one screen, having your second screen be a completely different app.  Different changes to the notification panel, quick settings. So I don't know how much of this  we're going to see. This isn't going to affect the OS that's running on our phones, but if you're  going to get into the foldable space, you might. So Kevin Toffold just texted me, if you go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  aboutchromebooks.com, you'll see on the top. There's also speculation about what it would do  mobile apps in Chromebooks. He says, meh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says meh like he doesn't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think he doesn't quite believe it was going to go through a change. Kevin will correct me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so I'm curious to know that as well, actually, if that would reach into there.  Because I mean, Chrome OS is different than Android OS, and this is an Android  version update. So I'm not entirely sure unless what he's talking about is that the apps that are  created with Android 12 L or whatever it's going to be called in mind would need to also operate  on Chromebooks because Chromebooks do support Android apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And also do things that Chromebooks have problems with. Well, actually, that's the wrong way to  put it, probably. We Chromebook users who occasionally use Android apps would wish they  would do things like resize smarter and do other things. And they don't necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. So he's not sure.  Let me say that on the iOS side too, with apps not necessarily resizing properly for iPads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So. Yep. Yep. It's weird. We still have the bifurcated OS's.  The computer OS and the phone OS, and they haven't come together.  I mean, just, it's been a long time. They keep saying, people keep saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that they're going to, and then it keeps not happening. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When we get flying cars and paperless offices, we'll find them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait for the end. I mean, I think one thing that's interesting to me about this is that,  yes, it's about foldables, but it's also about tablets. And I feel like tablets,  Android and tablets have not been something that has, that's been an experiment that hasn't always  gone very well. Except for my beloved Nexus 7.  Well, yeah. And that's kind of what I was going to say. What I was actually going to follow up  with is that there was a time when Google had a lot of energy around, was putting a lot of energy  into tablets. Android 3.0 was honeycomb. That was the first version of Android designed  specifically for tablets or with tablets in mind. Eventually they came out with the Nexus 7 and  they're like, okay, I like where this is headed. And then somewhere along the line, it kind of  fell off a cliff. Which is not to say that Android tablets don't exist, but Google's certainly not  putting a lot of its attention or energy into it. They just don't seem to care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is too bad. I think they could have. It is.  I think that was a potential opportunity, but obviously they didn't think it was worth

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  investing in. ScooterX in chat is pointing out that this  Android 12 L is also coming to phones. Okay. So that's, I was wondering if it was just going  to be isolated to like certain sizes of screens or whatever, but I guess this would be all baked  into 12 once that happens. They've got, they basically spelled out the roadmap for the beta.  And I think sometime by like February or March, we're probably going to see  the version. There's going to be a number of betas leading up to that, but it makes me wonder,  like, okay, so then if this is the OS update that would pave the way for Google's supposed  foldable pixels, of which there's been a lot of, I would say credible rumors around,  maybe that means that we're going to see pixel foldables middle of next year,  something like that. Would anyone here be interested, like actually be like buying,  buying this phone interested if Google was to put out a foldable or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was interested in foldable devices. The surface duo too, is that what it's called?  Yeah.  For Microsoft, the latest one. I was really interested in that is I thought the form factor  made sense even with the hinge right there in the middle and splitting the screens and all of that  until I saw some reviews on it and the functionality just didn't quite, didn't just,  just didn't seem like it would work well. Especially if you wanted to do things quickly,  having to open and I don't know if that would be the case with the Google's version. If you'd be  able to do things quickly from it, just like you would if you pulled a camera, pulled your smartphone  out of your pocket, would you need to pull it out and unfold it and unlock it and yada yada yada?  No.  I saw that.  Part of me yes, but another part no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it's because I'm old, but I just don't, I don't understand why. I don't see the appeal  of a foldable phone. I just don't, I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Matthew, I agree with you. I thought I was, I was laughing at it, but then I went to Best Buy  to try to figure out my Chromebook situation, which is a whole other story. And, and, and I  stopped by to see not only the, the six pro, but then looked at the foldables again and the,  and the vertical fold, which Leo likes too, is really appealing. I don't know why it is,  and it probably is awkward and it's probably too big for the, when it's folded for the pocket.  I don't know why. I guess I just look at it and say, oh, it kind of works, but it kind of works.  Yeah, I don't know.  What you end up with is a phone. You end up with a vertical phone.  Rather than the two phone, it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you put it in your pocket? Because now it's a double width, like it's double thickness phone.  Oh, yes. It's a visible as you want phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It ends up being kind of like a smaller square. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But double the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, the kids can have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There we go. Yeah. They could do their tick tock on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. And Samson will be perfectly happy if that's exactly what happens.  I don't know. The Z Flip 3 is actually a pretty cool device, but which when I played around with  it, and I think Leo actually has it and kind of shares my opinion on it, it seems like the  first foldable that's like, okay, I could see this one doing really well. And I'm curious now  that we're a couple of months after it's been released, how it's actually sold. I don't know  that I've seen any exact numbers as far as that's concerned, but it really did seem like the first  foldable that had, at least in my use, in my mind, more of a consumer appeal for a number of  reasons. So Surface Duo too, yeah, I'm not sure how much consumer appeal that device has, but  we're still trying to figure out where these things actually fit into place, why we need to have them.  So, let's see here. What else do we got? We got...  We'll talk about some collusion.  Which collusion are we talking about?  Well, there's Jedi Blue or whatever.  Jedi Blue, okay. Jedi Blue again falls into the category of like,  holy cow, I'm drowning in this avalanche of stuff. But it's Google, so let's do it.  We've got to bring it up.  Yeah, so someone else is probably better to set up Jedi Blue, but this has to do with unsealed  court documents in Texas in an antitrust filing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a quid pro quo between Google and Facebook in which allegedly Facebook said it  would not raise a stink about Google's ad market share provided it got sweetheart deals in those ad  auctions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Awesome.  This is how to get richer, you know?  Like you said, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've always said where Google is vulnerable is not search, it's not phones, it's position in the  ad market. And they should have been hyper, hyper careful there because that is where they have  a near monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what can be done about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They also allegedly, sorry, they also allegedly conspired or tried to conspire with other tech  giants to delay privacy laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so this is when Apple is seen as the knight in shining armor because of their privacy focus,  right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And of course privacy, Apple's concerned about your privacy unless you're Chinese and live  in China.  Or unless you're an Apple user and they're concerned about your privacy as users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're concerned about your privacy as used by others, not by Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, they have the privilege.  Businessness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Had to do, there were a number of other things here.  There was a thread on Twitter by who is faster than Lime.  I'm not sure who this is, but Leo had tagged this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was resharing a thread that came from someone else.  I'm not sure who.  Got it.  But Jedi Blue's been around, it was reported on back in January, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  That's right.  And that was just one aspect of what this person was sharing.  Also that Google apparently had it set up so that it could win its own ad auctions,  even when they aren't the highest bidder, that they were taking a 22 to 42% cut of ad spending  that goes through the system, which was two to four times as much as the ad exchanges  it was competing against.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're basically saying that Google does what in securities trading is called front running,  where they basically take cuts of deals because they're the house.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you explain the controversy over header bidding to our audience?  Because I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, how much time do we have?  Perhaps not enough.  I mean, it is a real time auction.  And so all the things that are potentially problematic with auctions, especially where  one entity controls the auction, all of those things come into play.  Basically, that's the short version.  Okay.  And it all occurs in hundreds of a second while your page is noting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is by the way amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's pretty crazy.  See, you've got a combination there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Meanwhile, for a lighter note, I just want to be on the record here.  I'm known for the show for being bridge phobic.  I'm not crazy about this.  Your Richmond Bridge is insane, line 72.  Yeah, that bridge video was crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not going on that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.  The Bay Bridge collapses.  The Richmond Bridge, things fall over on top of you.  Bridges are dangerous.  That was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Okay.  I didn't see that you would put this in the rundown.  That is insanity.  So this was during the storms that we had, that we had swooping through here not too long ago,  like within a matter of days, definitely within the last week.  But on the Richmond Bridge.  Yeah, recently Saturday and Sunday.  Yeah, and I guess this is just wind barreling through the bridge, toppling, almost toppling,  just a huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, because it would have toppled completely except it's on top of a truck.  It's on top of a truck.  Of another truck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's still moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That guy's just stunt driving, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As the driver of that truck, what are you doing right then in that moment?  You're quitting my job.  You're a she-do.  That's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You are cursing loudly.  Oh my goodness.  That is frightening.  That jammer would be dumping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Probably changing your draws afterwards.  I can't even imagine being that driver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Being in that vehicle when that's happening.  No, thank you.  And also the truck that this big semi just like popped onto.  Yeah, that person too is like, what the heck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just minding my business in this traffic.  Wait, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someone said truck driver couldn't help it, Brown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good title, good title, mashed potato.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Love it.  What about Stadia becoming a white label game streaming platform?  Would you follow this at all?  This is what I've been waiting for.  Not anticipating like, oh, I can't wait for this to happen, but this is what I have expected  to happen.  And I know there was some mention that this was probably the direction that Stadia was  going to go before, but it's also just like, man, Google.  Why could Google not make Stadia more of an appealing product the way I think they intended  to when they launched it?  It's so quickly seemed to evaporate.  And I'm not saying that there aren't people out there who are ardent fans of Stadia.  I know you're out there.  I hear from you anytime I ever say anything remotely bad about Stadia, but it could be  so much bigger.  It could have made such a bigger difference in the game industry.  They're undoubtedly doing great things, but what they're doing right now is essentially  opening up the technology behind Stadia to offer up to other companies for their efforts.  In this case, it's AT&T to release one of their games driven off of Stadia's technology,  but not necessarily mentioning Stadia.  So if you go to the website, you wouldn't see Stadia or Google mentioned anywhere.  They're just kind of behind the scenes powering the experience.  But on one hand, it also kind of seems like this is Google's strength more than it is  creating a gaming platform.  It's creating the technology that powers the gaming platform.  I have a question for you, Mr. Howell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A question for you, Mr. Howell.  You were saying that this could have been so much better.  Google could have made this so much better.  My question is, how?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's a really great question.  Investing $20 billion?  I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But in what?  Into the infrastructure, into development, into what in particular?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a really good question.  I mean, the thing that I think is very much not appealing to me is just the sheer fact that Google  has proven itself to be hard to trust when it comes to big initiatives and projects like Stadia  in the past.  It comes out of the gate with something that's really cool.  No question.  This is awesome technology.  And I love the concept.  I love the work that they've done, but I still don't quite trust Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, there's so many examples.  You could list them the same as me, where that's happened.  And then they just don't follow up and they don't invest.  And then pretty soon, oh yeah, we're shutting it down.  And everybody's like, oh yeah, I remember that thing.  Yeah, yeah.  It was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They make promises and they don't deliver on the promises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's look at this in the perspective of the, as we like to call it, normals of society.  I think this is similar to the way Facebook has got that lock-in on people.  Xbox and that service and PlayStation and that service has people locked in.  You walk up to them and say, hey, Google has this platform or you can play this game.  And that game and so on and so forth.  And it's beautiful.  It's fast, yada, yada, yada.  They're probably still not going to walk away.  They're just locked in.  But what could Google do to pull those normal gamers away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the only thing you can do is come up with a game that is just so beyond, you know,  everything else.  Making it exclusively?  Yeah.  I mean, that's how those platforms did what they did.  It doesn't have anything to do with the technology or the controller or the,  you've got to have the game and it has to be different enough.  It can't just be kind of like, you know, Call of Duty or kind of like, to me,  that's where they should have invested the money and what they're prepared to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would bet that most of those, air quotes, normal gamers would have no idea about the  products that Google has launched and kicked to the curb because they don't care.  It's just they're just not in that in that world, if you will.  But if you walked up and said, hey, Google has something that's  pretty dag gum good.  You want to try it out?  They'll say, I'll try it for a week for free.  And they probably won't stick.  I just I don't know what what can Google do to make it stick, if you will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, touching on what you were you would just mention there,  Matthew, as far as, you know, creating an exclusive game like Stadia, they were doing that.  Google had had made investments and created their own game studio and acquired other  major game studios and major players in the game development industry to do exactly that.  The problem is they shut it down well before they were able to create anything.  They spent like a year with this project and then then like gave up on it.  A lot of people were quick to point out, like, if you're if you're looking to create a triple A  game with that kind of talent and something that's going to really move the needle as an  exclusive on your platform, they need Google needed to start three years prior to Stadia,  even being a thing just so that they could do that.  And they weren't able to live on that.  They gave up on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at Xbox and PlayStation.  I mean, it's not like they became hugely successful  and their games were kind of hugely popular overnight.  It took years.  Yeah, it took years of development and pushing and pushing and billions of dollars.  You can't.  That's something that just can't happen.  It's like saying, let's build a movie studio and then we'll release a blockbuster next year  and boom, we'll be a movie studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We did it.  Yeah, it's probably not going to happen that way.  And in that light, it kind of seems like Google really  it almost seems like Google really didn't understand what game it was getting into.  No pun intended, right?  Like they didn't understand the playing field enough to know that like what they were setting  themselves up to do wasn't going to cut it.  And they're getting rid of that studio.  And then now doing this white label approach kind of kind of makes it seem like, you know,  at a certain point, they were like, why are we dumping all this money into this?  We aren't certain that there's going to be any sort of success on the other side of all  of this effort, but we do know we have a good technology and why don't we offer this technology  to others?  I actually think it makes a lot of sense.  I think that makes sense for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a good route for Google to go.  This is essentially licensing.  They're all about open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they're still going to make some money off of it potentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  They're going to make some money.  I don't know what kind of money they're making on a deal like this.  And this is only the first one.  I have to imagine there's going to be others.  And, you know, will we know that Stadia is powering these others?  I don't even know.  You know, this one was discovered before it was announced.  So, you know, and acknowledged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this about like how it was with Chromecast?  I'm sorry for scratching on camera.  Is this about like how?  If it is, you got to scratch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because how else do you keep that beautiful sheen, right?  For your for your camera?  You can't go itchy.  It's going to it's going to twitch.  It's just not going to look good.  Yeah.  If it is even more now, I know we keep talking about it.  It's really I think I'm good now.  I think I got a scratch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just I remember when Chromecast came out and how cool that was.  Granted, it had had its glitchy moments and whatnot.  But then, you know, a year or so later, it seems like you see that little cast logo on  everything.  It doesn't necessarily say Chromecast.  It just says cast or something like that.  Is this a similar situation?  Then again, I don't even know if Google came up with that technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I you know, I don't know.  I haven't I haven't played it's about man Arkham Knight is the game that AT&T was offering.  And I don't even know how long it's offered.  It's like a free thing that AT&T was offering 1080p streaming, that sort of thing.  I do know from what I've read about it that there was no real indication anywhere that  they were using anything from Google.  It was somebody looking at the source on the page or something like that and discovered  a line of code that mentioned a code name that had previously been known to be associated  with Stadia.  And that was what prompted AT&T and Google to even acknowledge that there was a relationship  there.  So OK.  So seemingly this all happens underneath the radar and maybe that's just the way it's  going to be.  And you know, I don't know what Google ends up earning on a deal like this.  I don't I wouldn't be surprised at all if we see a whole lot more of this.  But I and I also don't know what that means for what Stadia is right now because you know,  the big downside for me, like I probably wouldn't buy a game for Stadia because of what I know  about Google and their their ability to pivot away from things when I like them.  But also, like if I'm paying 50 or 60 bucks for a game and it only exists in the cloud  and then Google changes its mind, like there's no guarantee there that I even own anything  at that point.  And you know, so that's going to keep me away.  And I know I'm not alone in that.  So that's that's a big hurdle for Google to have to overcome.  So, yes, and then we're we're kind of talking about living room stuff.  So we could probably talk a little bit about this whole Google, Google TV, YouTube, Roku.  Actually, there seems to be a whole thing with smart TVs and the and the smart, you know,  smart homes, smart TVs, that sort of thing.  So Google is is shifting Google TV to be a bigger priority in the information how to report  that said, Pachai is really saying that connected television is a big priority for Google right now.  They're paying partners more to use Google TV.  So they're paying anywhere between 10 to 15 dollars per unit for partners.  Roku's paying, then there's Roku paying seven to eight dollars.  That ties into, you know, the fact that Google and Roku have been battling it out.  And supposedly YouTube is apparently going to drop off of Roku in December.  This all has to do with, you know, like a search deal that that Google wanted Roku to give it  give its YouTube property kind of prime search placement, its own carousel in the experience.  Roku says, hey, that's affecting our search and we don't want to do that.  And so now Google's, you know, pulling YouTube.  I don't know.  I don't know if Google's pulling YouTube or Roku's kicking it off.  I doubt they're kicking it off.  It doesn't matter.  It's all negotiation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all negotiations and puffing up to try and win in the negotiation, I suppose.  Then you've got Comcast.  They have their own smart TV that's coming out now.  So it's going to be available.  Walmart.  It's powered by their own OS.  And then Amazon has their own smart TV launching today.  The Fire TV Omni series that you can find at Amazon and Best Buy.  Suddenly it seems like the living room is a really big deal.  And it's just interesting to me because Google's had Android TV for quite a while, for years.  Now that we're in the Google TV era, suddenly it seems like Google is taking the living  room more seriously and others obviously are too.  Why is that?  Well, why is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I have experienced pandemic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We weren't in a pandemic two years ago, three years ago either.  Yeah, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's also the changing economics.  I think you're right, Ant.  I think that changed a lot.  Our stream behavior changed, but the market changed too, right?  The power of Netflix, power of Hulu, and so on and so forth.  So the TV maker, the set maker, they've had the dumb box like the dumb wire all these years.  And suddenly it was with smart TV coming along.  So I got my father, my 95-year-old father, who's up here in New Jersey now.  His retirement community has 60 channels.  That's it.  It's all they need.  You got the golf channel?  Thanks.  That's all I need.  And so, and the Fox News channel?  Oh, no, Pa.  They don't have the Fox News channel.  No, no, no, you can't get that here.  You can't lie to your own father.  Anyway, so I just wanted a TV where he could watch TV.  I go and buy a Vizio at Costco.  I come back, I put it in.  I'm tearing my hair out.  I cannot get to the channels.  It does nothing but want to sell me Hulu and sell me Netflix  because it makes a commission on all of that.  In addition, Vizio, a company we used to like, we own Vizio TVs.  They also have been in some little minor PR hot water  because they are, perhaps one might say, violating your privacy.  They are using data to try to target advertising.  And so you find that the television set,  which was what we old folks used to call it,  is itself now part of the stack  and they're trying to grab their piece of it.  So that's why I think you have Comcast doing its own OS and its own TVs.  You have Google saying, hold on, we're the giant of the internet.  We can't lose out on this.  And we got YouTube and we got to worry that.  You got Roku saying, well, no, no, no, we're the add-on  that makes everything smart.  You got Hulu and Netflix and all those saying, we just want volume.  And then you got advertisers coming in saying,  well, this whole targeting thing has got to be a mess on the web.  What can we do on TVs?  So it's suddenly a roiling, fascinating,  probably very irritating market.  I returned the Vizio TV.  I got an LG TV.  I never set up the web stuff and all it does is go to 60 channels.  It's like kind of going back in time.  So my father, we got him a big remote with big buttons  so we can go to 38, which is a golf TV and that's all it needs.  But that's the rarity, obviously.  And so in a streaming world and a home war world, as Anne said,  I think as market changes in fascinating ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the streaming, I was going to say the same thing,  that streaming, I think, really started to take off.  Then Roku, I think was kind of, not that people didn't notice,  but nobody thought that was going to be a big deal.  First they had the little boxes and then, okay, now it's a new TV.  But then all of a sudden you watch the streaming numbers,  you watch Netflix's growth and then COVID comes.  Everybody's spending all their time inside.  All of a sudden smart TVs look like a pretty great business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  Well, I'm looking forward to Google TV getting more TV sets at least  because Google TV is a good interface.  I think Google has made some really great changes to what was Android TV.  Still don't really exactly know the difference between Android TV and Google TV.  Yeah, I was going to ask.  I was going to ask a new thing with a new UI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a Chromecast, the newer ones where it's basically like a fire stick.  I have that plugged into an old TV.  I was thinking about getting a new TV and I asked one of our kids works at Best Buy.  I said, can I get a stupid TV?  Can I get one that has no smart features and I can just plug the Chromecast in?  Yeah, you can't do that.  You literally can't buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's on the LG.  I purposely didn't go and put in any Wi-Fi information so that it couldn't be smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Robot in my Discord says every TV is a dumb TV when it doesn't know the Wi-Fi password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true.  True.  That's true.  You're still potentially dealing with weirdness in the interface and everything.  We have a Samsung smart TV and the little ads that it puts in the dock down there.  It's like, kill it with fire.  I can't take it.  But it is what it is.  I wish I had Google TV on that screen instead someday, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's one of those little interesting stories.  Can I ask Matthew a question?  Yeah, go for it.  Go for it.  Line 68, Reid Hoffman, George Soros investing in outright liberal media.  What have you said about this, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I got in a little trouble on Twitter as I often like to do.  I know you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I'm putting you back in trouble now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I just...  You're welcome, Matthew.  Thanks.  I sort of offhandedly said, you know, if right-wing billionaires did the identical thing,  everyone would be very mad.  And of course, everybody responded by dunking on me and saying,  right-wing billionaires have done that, which was exactly my point.  If you...  If you...  This is supposed to be okay because it's about disinformation  and it's about progressive news.  But fundamentally, you know, they're investing in...  Acronym was a hugely problematic kind of progressive lobbying effort  that created local news sites or what purported to be local news sites  and didn't really disclose very well who ran them or what they were trying to do.  And, you know, that's...  To me, that's not a great idea when what you're trying to do is get people to trust  your information.  And then we got into an argument about disinformation and is it in the eye of the beholder?  You know, everyone...  Disinformation is whatever someone says that you disagree with.  There's no easy way to sort of define it.  So Reid Hoffman wants you to think that his information is going to be better.  I just find the whole thing problematic.  Like if you want to invest in local news, then invest in local news.  Like don't create a like shell company that runs kind of quasi or theoretically local news sites.  And you know what I mean?  I just don't think it's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.  I defer to you.  I've got nothing on that.  I did not read that story.  What do you say we do a little bit of change log action?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's feeling like a change log time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's feeling like change log time.  Let's do it.  Sound the horns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we need a barbershop quartet.  Change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would sound a million times better than that.  That's for sure.  Google Chrome has some work that's doing into combining tab groups and bookmarks, apparently.  And Android police is not happy.  Not happy about it.  They're screwing with it.  95 power bookmarks.  They want to combine all those three things into one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm using bookmarks.  I'm storing stuff for some future research.  I don't want them to mess with it.  I agree.  Don't move my cheese.  Yeah, exactly.  Get off my lawn, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can enable this feature with a flag.  If you go to the Android police article, they give you the flag and then you just  restart your browser and you can check it out for yourself.  But yes, power bookmarks, bookmarks, tab groups, recent searches, all combined into a single thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you call something power, you're probably trying too hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  So yeah, I have no experience with that directly.  I'll probably test it out and never use it.  I'm scared to try it.  Yeah, not part of my usage.  So we'll see.  If you have a Nest Hub...  I haven't bookmarked a lot though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't bookmarked a lot though.  And in recent years, I haven't done a lot of bookmarks.  It seems like they have stored history.  It just saves it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And do you have your history deleted?  You know how Google gives you the tools to have your history deleted after a certain  amount of time?  Does that affect that at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's periodic, but I go to the same handful of sites throughout the week.  Sites all the time.  That's true.  So it kind of renews itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That is true.  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, I have a handful of bookmarks every once in a while, but just something that I  need to have in my kind of toolbar in my browser as I go to...  For instance, the doc for Best Ofs because I'm in the midst of creating our Best Ofs  for the end of the year.  And I don't want to have to go searching for that every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you know that URL off the top of your head, Mr. Howell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter.tv slash best of if you want to submit, which I'll just go ahead and say like no  one submitted this year.  It's all entirely on the producers this time around.  So hopefully you like what you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on, folks.  Help these poor producers out.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Christmas gift.  We've got systems.  You don't have to do our work for us.  We work here for a reason.  It's cool.  Nest Hub.  If you have a Nest Hub smart display, you're going to get an app drawer here pretty soon.  I don't know if this is rolling out immediately or coming soon, but it'll give you the ability  to get quick access to some of the favorite functions.  I don't have a smart display.  I ended up not bringing a smart display in our home when they were first launching, I  think a couple of years ago, because my kids were young enough to not be able to control  themselves if they saw a vector for YouTube.  And so I was like, you know what?  I'm not opening that door.  Now they're a little bit older.  Now I think they could control themselves maybe.  But so I don't have one of these.  So I don't know.  Does anyone here see all have a smart display and do you love it?  No.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Has anybody got Doom running on it yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I have to imagine Doom runs on everything, doesn't it?  I would think so.  I would think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw someone running on the display on their dryer, I think it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently.  Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  I mean, since you asked here, I'll go ahead and put underneath this story.  JammerBee is a YouTube link.  If you open this up, you will see from, oh, so for a while now, this was a video from June 8th, 2019.  Someone running Doom on their Nest Hub.  I don't know how they get it going, but if you scroll to about, oh, you know what?  They browse through the Internet Archive.  So if you go to about, so that's kind of a cheat.  That's the browser.  But I mean, technically.  It's not running on it.  I mean, like, it's cheating.  Yeah, that's the cheat.  That's through the browser.  But still, I suppose it depends on how you define it.  There you go.  That's better than nothing.  Google is accepting requests for parents or for people to remove images of minors.  So if you have kids under the age of 18 and their image is on a Google search result,  you can go to a Google support site and request the removal of that image.  And Google will do it, apparently.  So that is happening.  How do you all feel about it?  Because I know this messes with the permanence of the Internet and everything.  But I mean, I tend to think this is a good call.  Am I missing something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It depends on the parent.  I think about my boys.  And I remember years ago when they were in middle school, and they were like 12, 13 years old.  And there was this letter that the school sent out that it was a waiver  that you had to sign that says, OK, we can use your child's image in  promotional information for the school, so on and so forth.  And I had no problem signing it because they were athletes.  And the local newspapers comes to all of those games.  And my kids were going to be in the paper.  So I didn't think it was any different.  So it's like, whatever, just use it.  So I think it depends on the parent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, on whether you feel comfortable with that being the case or not.  I guess what this reminds me of is the right to be forgotten.  Kind of ties into that, which comes up on the show from time to time.  And I remember at the time that the right to be forgotten was such a hot topic.  There were a lot of reasons for and against it.  I guess when I look at this as a parent, I appreciate having a tool.  If I feel like I need to, it's nice to know that I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, one matter to have a convicted felon saying,  take my stuff down so I can be felonious again.  It's another matter for parents to say,  I made a mistake putting my kid's picture up or it's been misused.  And I'm feeling wonky about that.  It's my kid.  I'm more sympathetic to that.  Yeah, I agree.  Whereas two, it was also a case where Google was, right to be forgotten,  Google is ruling what may be remembered or not.  Put it in a position it didn't want by the court case, but it's there.  In this case, it's the parent saying, can you take this down?  And Google was saying, okay, Google's not really ruling in that case.  They're just saying it's a feature you can exercise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right.  Cool.  All right, I'm not missing anything.  So good news there.  Some changes coming to Gmail.  And specifically, these changes have to do with the two, the CC, the BCC,  the blind carbon copy fields.  Just some changes like, for instance, right click menu.  You can view a recipient's full name and email.  You can edit their name, their contact names, copy email address.  What's an avatar chip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you have any idea what that means?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Avatar chip.  Is that just a small image of that recipient?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it what the vaccine puts in your bloodstream?  I have no idea.  Yeah, you get it implanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get it implanted and your avatar appears automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm guessing reading this that has nothing to do with vaccine, but that it also has something to do.  Just joking, folks.  Stop joking.  I know, I know.  An avatar chip, I would guess that that's like a small...  That little picture of you?  That little picture of you that you normally see when you log into Gmail,  maybe that's attached to the two field when you select this person,  if their image is tied to their account, maybe that also ends up in your Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like they've got a new message and everybody's image shows up in their tab.  So you know you've got the right person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right.  Recipient avatars.  Okay, and now I found a Forbes article that actually shows some examples of this.  The Google write-up didn't show any examples, so I put that in for you, Jamerby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I hit my limit of free Forbes articles.  No, that's right.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You charged for it.  I didn't mean to put salt in that wound.  Apologies.  Flagging external recipients.  Email recipients within a company.  Gmail is going to flag anyone who breaks that pattern with a deep yellow color banner  at the bottom to say hey, and associated with that contact in your two field.  I think that's just a visual representation for you to know like,  oh hey, wait a minute, the information in this email might be going outside of our organization.  Is that okay?  Little changes like that.  Yeah, it all has to do with your two fields.  You can check that out.  Look that up and see how your Gmail experience is going to be changing very soon.  Then finally, the call screen feature that we hear in the US, and I'm assuming Canada.  I actually don't know for sure if Canada has the pixel call screening feature to date,  but definitely here in the US.  That's broadening out to seven additional countries.  Let's see here.  We're going to have it in UK, France, Germany, Australia, Ireland, Italy, and Spain.  That's a cool feature.  It's a cool feature that I don't really use a whole lot.  When a phone call comes through on my phone and I don't recognize the number,  I'm just equipped to like, you know what?  If it's really important, you're going to leave me a message,  or you're going to send me a text message.  Doing the call screen is even more work than I want to do with that random call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My rule is if there's no name, if my phone doesn't know who it is,  I just won't answer it.  I don't, it doesn't matter who it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dead to me, whoever you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samsung has the same thing.  It will show you if a number is suspected spam or suspected fraud,  and you can confirm if it is or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  And I think that is the Google change law.  We are going to do picks, tips, tricks, whatever you got here.  After a quick break, we'll thank the sponsor and then we'll get to that.  So get those ready.  This episode of This Week in Google is brought to you by Codecademy.  There has never been a better time to become a programmer.  Man, so many people.  We've had so much time to ourselves and had the opportunity to really reflect.  What do I want to learn?  Who do I want to be?  So many people are in a position to reinvent themselves right now.  And with Codecademy, you can learn to code on your own terms.  Whether you're starting from scratch or maybe you're looking to advance  where you're already at, Codecademy can help you reach your coding goals.  Simply put, Codecademy is the best way to learn to code online.  They're not only going to teach you job-ready coding skills,  but they're also going to help you build unique projects for your portfolio.  Also earn certificates, even prep for technical interviews.  And I mean, it's worth just looking at because it's interesting to think.  I'm not a coder myself, but sometimes I really wish I knew that because it is a world of creation,  a world of creativity that if you have that skill, if you know how to build that thing or code that  thing, I hear sometimes Leo talk about the things that he's working on and some of the  guests that we have on the network.  I'm like, man, that is a skill I wish I had because sometimes I do encounter that thing  that the solution doesn't exist.  And if I only knew how to pull this off, I can make it happen.  Well, Codecademy could be the window into making that happen.  With Codecademy, you get qualified for in-demand jobs in as little as two months.  You can learn at your own pace, your own level.  So it really doesn't matter what level you're coming in at.  You can choose what you learn from building websites to analyzing data  and everything else that you could possibly want wrapped up inside there.  No matter what your experience level, you're going to be writing real working code  and it's not going to take very long.  You're going to be doing it in a matter of minutes.  Languages like Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, JavaScript, and so much more.  Codecademy is going to point you in the right direction too.  If you have no idea where you want to begin, you're going to get that information with  Codecademy.  Get instant feedback.  Your code is actually tested as soon as you submit it.  So you're going to know right away if you're on the right track.  You get tools, cheat sheets to help those ideas really stick and to see them to fruition  and test your knowledge with tailor-made quizzes just for you.  Now they have an interactive platform that really helps you to learn in the process by doing.  You're not just passively watching.  You're engaged.  You're doing.

And we thank them for their support of this show and for teaching so many people how to code.  Pretty awesome stuff.  All right.  This is tips, tricks, picks, all that fun stuff that we do at the end of the show.  Jeff, why don't we start with you?  What you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, I'll do this one.  Evelyn Duhak, who's a brilliant law scholar, a young scholar at Harvard,  gave a talk at the Stanford Cyber Center.  And she started off with a slide where she said,  during the one hour of my talk today, these things will occur.  Facebook will take down 615,417 pieces of content.  YouTube will take down 271,440,000 channels, videos, and comments.  TikTok will take down 18,870 videos.  The Facebook Oversight Board will receive 48 petitions to appeal.  This does not include the number of decisions to leave up content or appeals  or other content moderation decisions.  And then as Daphne Keller, who tweeted this, said,  meanwhile, the Supreme Court has decided about 246 First Amendment cases ever.  All of this is to say, as our friend Mike Masnick often points out,  deciding that you should be able to moderate content, that is to say,  moderate the conversation of the world at scale, is hard.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Indeed.  No, moderation is easy.  You just say, I like it or I don't, you move on.  Just take the junk down.  Come on.  Yeah.  Just remove all the disinformation.  Yeah, that's all you got to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then everything will be okay.  Then we won't be racist, misogynist, hateful pigs anymore.  It'll be fine then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  I just want to call out also, you had another one in here that was near and dear to my heart.  20th, is it an anniversary or a birthday of the iPod?  20 years ago, the iPod began and started to change everything.  Which is really an important thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It changed our whole view of what you could hold in your hand.  Absolutely it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love the wheel.  I remember seeing-  Oh, I love the wheel.  I remember a co-worker, or maybe it was one of my superiors at one of my former jobs,  they were looking at a magazine and it had a picture of a hard drive that was the size of a  quarter. It just blew my mind to see, wow, storage is that small.  This is 20 years ago or whatever.  Thinking storage is that small and then next thing you know, stuff like this iPod is out  and it's using tiny, tiny storage like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see the-  It's good use.  ScooterX put this in the chat, but there was an image of the original prototype  and it's the size of a 12-inch tablet.  It's quite hilarious to look at.  Oh, wow.  Okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, no way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's try it.  They've got a real iPod next to it for comparison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Put it in line 168 at the far, far right. I put a link to that.  Yeah, and I heard Jamerby jump in there real quick and mention that.  So the first iPad was 20 megs.  That's how much storage was on that first iPad.  Is that right?  iPod.  What?  Sorry, not iPad, iPod.  Is that what you said?  I thought I heard you say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who Jamerby?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the size of the quarter.  Okay.  Yeah, I was just saying it's just a tiny size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They were this small.  Storage is this small.  When storage used to be-  That was a big-  Okay.  Storage used to be like that.  Well, this is the hard drive I destroyed, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was the name of the Microsoft version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Zune.  Zune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the Zune place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was at South by Southwest and I remember Kevin Rose was on stage at a party and Zune was a  sponsor of their show and he was trying to give away Zunes and the audience practically hooted at  him like, who'd want that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who wants that?  Dignation, right? Wasn't that his show?  The Dignation.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Dignation. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's another number I want to mention real quick if I may.  Yeah, absolutely.  Is Stripe our sponsor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  Okay, so Stripe is a sponsor.  They are a network sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I need to be going to say that.  So they put out a little report about the creator economy, which we'd love to talk about,  which either gives me hope or says we are into huge overdose fast,  but across 50 platforms that Stripe serves, the creators will get $10 billion in aggregate  earnings. 2020 saw a jump in new creators and it wasn't a one-time spike.  They're still coming on a record clip, a whopping 48% year over year.  In total, these platforms have onboarded 668,000 creators.  See earlier discussion about some folks saying, there's too much speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does that include only fans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's just, you know, us old bloggers, I think see some value in that, but  will there be too many email newsletters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will all of them make money and make a living?  Sorry. No.  No, sadly, not everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not being a creator.  Yeah. Crazy.  Let's see here. Anne, what you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I had to a couple of things, but first I did get the delivery of my Pixel 6 Pro during the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will do the honor of taking the paper off the screen.  Shiny, shiny.  I will be playing with that in a little while, but it is definitely rounded.  This feels like one of those iPhones.  One of them.  One of them.  Sort of curved on the edge.  Yeah.  I'm used to a flat edge phone, you know, but that is definitely round.  It's the screen that's rounded, which threw me.  And it's going to, yeah, that's slip inducing there.  So I'm glad I have a case for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Well, one thing you might notice is that the camera bump on the back  makes a nice little ridge for your finger.  So it is slippery, but at least you have a little ridge to kind of like throw your finger.  What about when you put the case in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does the case eliminate the ridge?  Cause it, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm curious to see that.  I hope it does.  I have a speaking case.  I'm not sure if it will.  It's over there in another corner.  I'll get to it at some point, but yeah, I did get the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kind of resent paying all this money for a shiny phone,  which is so shiny that I have to put a case on.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. I feel the same way.  So ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got a clear case. My case is clear, so I'm good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get a $900 phone and put a 699 case on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. Yeah. Hey, I mean, yeah, that is the best thing though is the clear case.  Then at least you get a little bit of that phone style shining through.  But, you know, if I don't have that case on there, I'm just going to drop it.  That's just the way it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I make it slippery. So don't make it slippery.  You know?  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd say, oh, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, there's something.  Yeah. See how that goes.  Yeah. Yeah.  Congrats, Ian.  My...  You got your pixel.  My pick... Thank you, sir.  My pick is I've been watching television.  So I finally... I'm trying to play catch up on all the popular shows out there.  And I finally got through sex education.  And now I'm checking out the Wonder Years, the reboot.  I believe it's on Hulu.  And I remember watching the Wonder Years umpteen years ago with Fred Savage.  He is now directing this show, but it gives you a version of it from a Black family's perspective.  And what I'm enjoying about it is, number one, the narration is Don Cheadle,  but the stories are really, really captivating and they're funny.  And yes, it took time, took place back in the 60s with all of the civil unrest going on here  in the U.S., but it's not a heavy handed dose of, this is racism happening right here.  It's still pretty entertaining because quite frankly, I'm sick of being reminded of racism.  I live it. I know it's there.  Sometimes I just want to watch TV.  But they do do a really good job of balancing that all out,  not necessarily just throwing it out the window, letting you know it is there,  but they do tell a good story and it's pretty entertaining.  I think it's on Hulu, but that's the Wonder Years reboot.  Apparently, Mr. Jarvis did a review of the original Wonder Years at some point.  Is that correct?  Loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, A+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I used to love that show.  Man, I loved that show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was my generation.  I mean, that was my age.  That was a great show.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Great show.  Right.  And then my next pick is a shout out and a nod to the hard head  who battled through a groin injury.  He's still suffering from a groin injury and had a kick return in the game last week.  So two of the last three touchdown kick returns have been by Pruitt boys.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.  Go, go, go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I was so impressed and proud of him because I know he was hurting,  but he still could outrun these cats.  So it just made old dad proud.  That's amazing.  Nice.  And some of the games are live streamed.  Some of them are.  And so his older brother, who is now up in Oregon in college, not at OU,  but he's at a college in Oregon, he says, oh, that was great, but he didn't get my record.  That's the first thing he said.  So his brother has the record of 95 yards on the kick return for a touchdown.  Now hard head sophomore, Jacob, his was, I think it was 92 yards.  So it's close, but not quite.  Better keep trying.  Yeah, they'll keep trying.  Go for 96.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go for 96.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  96 would be the one.  And lastly, I want to plug on Mr. Rick Salmon has a book out.  I've had Mr. Rick Salmon on our show, Hands on Photography.  He's such an amazing human being in addition to being an amazing photographer.  He's a canon explorer of light.  He's a prolific author.  I believe he's gotten about 40 books written to date regarding photography and just mindfulness  and things of that nature.  And this latest book is about passive income as a photographer, how to make money in your sleep  as a photographer.  And I got a couple of pages in it.  So I wanted to plug that and show him some love and just to say thank you to Mr. Salmon  for reaching out to me and allowing me the opportunity to share some of my information  about passive income, because this pandemic has taught a lot of us about survival.  And there are some things that you can do to help keep the bills paid.  And passive income is one of those ways.  You go to bed and you're still making money.  If you can figure it out.  So that's on Amazon and Mr. Howe will have links in our show notes.  Yes, indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice.  That is awesome.  Let's see here.  Matthew, what you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my thing is it's called the Jetson One.  I think it just came out earlier this week.  And the headline says it all.  For the price of a Tesla Model S, you can buy a flying car.  It's not actually a car.  I don't know why they said that.  It doesn't have wheels, but it's defined as an ultralight.  So you don't need a license.  And I think it goes up to like 60 miles an hour.  I'm trying to remember the video is extremely cool.  Yeah, this is awesome.  And it has a parachute.  Amazing.  And it has a parachute.  Crucial.  I think it goes up to like 4,000 feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is 4,000.  What?  Crazy looking.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can you imagine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That looks so fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Catch your orders in now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you hear a buzz over Petaluma?  It's going to be Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, just don't give one to Mr. LaPorte because he'll find a way to crash that too, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true.  That's a good point.  The cargo is a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it only weighs about 90 pounds, the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How far do you go in it with a battery?  That's why I didn't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it says that it's good for 20 minutes of hovering.  So I don't know how long it is for flying.  Probably not very long.  That's a pretty short trip.  That ain't good.  But that'll improve.  That'll improve, I'm sure.  It's pretty cool.  So I've got one on delivery.  Should be here by Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll make your way to the Bay Area 20 minutes at a time.  Have to stop every 20 minutes and charge it.  We'll see you soon.  We'll see you next year.  That is so cool.  I saw a video of that a couple of days ago.  I was like, I want that.  That looks like the future right there.  Everybody blasting around on those things.  Pretty awesome stuff.  Yeah.  So let's see here.  So I have two things.  First of all, this was a story that we talked about a little bit on All About  Android last night.  But sometimes I like to bring a tip to the show.  And I guess I can probably show this.  I don't think I'm revealing anything by showing this.  So on Android 12, one of the changes that happened is,  you will notice in the quick settings that you used to have a Wi-Fi and a  mobile internet button in your quick settings.  That would allow you to, and I did this a lot,  there would be times where I wanted to force my mobile internet and my Wi-Fi was on.  And the only way I could think to do that was to turn off Wi-Fi.  And then it would toggle over to my mobile internet.  And the connection quality would clear up or whatever the problem was I was trying to solve.  And Google made this change, which is,  a lot of people who have gotten Android 12 have said, well, this is no good because now if I want  to make any changes, I have to tap there.  Then that brings up my internet box.  And then I have to deactivate my Wi-Fi from here.  And why should I do that?  And it turns out that Google didn't really communicate very well exactly what's going on here.  What they did is, and I don't know that this necessarily makes it easier,  but what they're trying to do is they noticed in their studies that people would turn off Wi-Fi  and then they forget that they turned it off.  And so it would stay off.  And then they're churning through their mobile data over time.  Like, well, how can we prevent that from happening?  Or at least give users a tool that allows them to not have that happen.  And so with this, it's totally not intuitive at all how they intended for this to be used.  So I'm really surprised that they don't signal this better.  But essentially what they've done is if you tap on your mobile internet,  it says Wi-Fi won't auto-connect for now.  Temporarily.  Oh, but did you see it just totally did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it did.  It just totally did.  That's a Google moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're supposed to be able to do that, to turn that off temporarily.  And then it would turn it and then it would reconnect later.  But that's so funny.  It's like, oh, what am I going to do without Wi-Fi?  Anyways, that's supposed to be the feature.  But as you saw, it really wanted to connect to Wi-Fi.  So maybe it's not a tip.  Maybe it's a maybe it's pointing out a bug.  Looking out for you.  Yeah, Google.  Thanks a lot.  That could be a bug more than anything.  But anyways, just embarrassed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The god of Android here, Google.  Not cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all good.  This is how it works.  When you do demos, nine times out of 10, they're going to fail.  That's just the way it goes.  You're lucky if it doesn't fail.  And then my other thing is just a mention of something that I decided a couple of days ago.  I've actually considered participating in November for years, but I've never done it.  This year, I decided I'm going to do it for two reasons.  One, just to shine a light on men's health and mental health, especially.  I've done a lot of work on my own personal growth and mental health over the last three years.  And I feel like a better, more alive person because of it.  And so it's an important thing to shine a light on.  Everybody can actually find help for themselves and reach a better place.  So that's part of it.  But it's also because in my entire life, I have never grown out my facial hair more than  I'd say like a week.  And even at a week, I hardly have anything.  That's why I've never grown it out because I've been like, well, what's the point?  I don't grow facial hair like everybody else does.  So I'm curious to see what's going to happen.  So I've already started, even though it starts in November, I started a couple of days ago.  And I apologize in advance because it could look really weird and gross and strange,  but it's a journey.  And I hope that you'll forgive me for taking this journey over the course of the next month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So and as as a prostate cancer veteran, I thank you, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm so thrilled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The November causes and gentlemen,  I want you to we just lost an important actor last week of 59 years old prostate cancer.  Get tested.  Get tested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Jason, I want you to grow a big like twirly, like snidely, whiplash kind of mustache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure my wife wants that, but we'll see.  We'll see how it goes.  That's true.  That's the thing.  Like she totally supports it.  Like she's like, oh, it's it's for a cause.  Okay.  I'm like, you don't know what you're getting yourself into.  This could be the grossest mustache you've ever seen.  Like I could look really bad with a mustache, but I'm willing to try and see what happens.  So I'm really kind of I did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've done Movember twice.  The last time I did it, I let it grow out, but I ended up cutting it to where it looked like I had  some kind of weird designs on my face.  But I stopped doing it because it wasn't raising enough money, in my opinion,  to help out with the cause.  And I'm walking around looking pretty stupid.  But kudos to you, Mr. Hall.  I hope you can continue to raise awareness and raise a lot of cash for this research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I'm confident with the platform that we have through Twit and everything that we can  raise some money for all the causes that Movember raises for.  So I suppose we'll put it to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Worst case you look like a cop from like a 70s buddy movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like Tom Lemon from Reno 911.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, man.  I can only hope that I look like any sort of normal once I have this mustache or whatever it is.  There you go.  There we go.  There we go.  Grew out my Salvador Dali stash.  So we'll see how that goes.  Anyways, we reached the end of this episode of This Week in Google.  Always a lot of fun.  And I'm happy to say that I'm going to be here next week as well.  Leo returns from Mexico next Wednesday.  So I'm looking forward to that.  You're not getting rid of me yet.  But it's always a pleasure to hop on the show with you all.  And thank you for always being so open and welcoming me to the show when I am.  Jeff, what do you want people to know?  BuzzMachine.com, anything else?  Anything you've got on the horizon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.  That's good.  Just here.  Plug Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's Jeff.  Just there.  And BuzzMachine.com.  Always great to hang out with you, Jeff.  And then Ant, hands-off photography, twit.tv slash hop.  You got anything else in the cooker you want to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, again, make sure you're checking out Hop because there's a lot of good information  coming up this week.  I'm not going to.  People have been asking about NFTs.  I'm not going to talk about NFTs this week.  Right now with the stuff that's going on with crypto, the NFT topic has been pretty hot.  But yeah, just stay tuned.  I'm not talking about NFTs this week.  Maybe next week.  But yeah, just stay tuned.  Hop has been a lot of fun creating this content and being able to talk with different photographers.  But this week, it's going to be a lot of fun with Jefferson Graham.  You may have heard of him.  He's a travel photographer.  So we'll sit down and have a chit chat.  And I found that picture, by the way, from November.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, did you?  Oh, wow.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice.  So is that a fork off?  Is it like a fish tail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so bizarre.  That is pretty bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, gosh.  I won't do that anymore.  I promise you.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it.  No, do it again.  I think it's great.  All for a good cause.  That's right.  That's right.  Thank you, Ed.
