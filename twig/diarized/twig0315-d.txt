Transcript:  It's time for Twig, this week in Google, why some German chefs don't want you to take pictures of their food.  Is it all over for Google now? And what about Facebook M?  Plus, I'll give you a report on what happened to my stylus when I stuck it in the wrong way.  It's all coming up next, Twig.  This week in Google is provided by Cashfly.  And by PagerDuty.

It's time for Twig, this week in Google.  And it's a lot more than Google as always, but we're going to have a great time today because Mike Elgin is in-house.  I always love that when our news director from TNT joins us. Mike is a Google Plus fanatic.  I prefer freak, if that's okay.  And the best dressed man in this studio today. Nice to see you again, Mike.  See you.  We thought Jeff Jarvis wouldn't be here because you had an all-day event at QNIC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We were hoping not, but I'm sticky. You can't get rid of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe my response to your warning was, oh no, we can't do this show without Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Glad you're here. How'd it go?  It was good. I had a conference on media and membership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Membership? What does that mean?  It means a butt sneeze.  Go ahead, sneeze.  You can't do it on command. Oh, there we go. That was satisfying for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it just means that it's a new way to have a new relationship with your public and to get them to be members and what that means.  And all membership means today is give me your money. And we want to push the definition beyond that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't ask for people's money. We just ask for something a lot more valuable. Their attention.  Their devotion. Their love.  And if they want to give us some money, we'll take that too.  Ron Amadio is here from Mars Technica. Great to have you.  He's the Android guy. And thank you for retweeting my woes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That video was perfect. We'll get into it later. But that was the exact same reaction I had just offline.  Did you do the same thing?  Oh, yeah. I did exactly the same thing. That's why I wrote the article.  Because you read about it and you're like, yeah, whatever. And then it happens to you and you're like, oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's exactly. It all starts with Android Central and Jeff Nickinson's column in which he points out.  No pun intended.  Phil Nickinson, I'm sorry. You should not put in your stylus the wrong way in the pen.  And he really kind of, you know, I wish I'd read this first.  As usual with most people, I read the headline and kind of the synopsis. And I didn't get to this line.  The S-Pen goes into note 5.1. Do not put it in, but first it will get stuck in uppercase.  Had I read that, I might have been less likely to do what I did on Mac Break Weekly.  I used the video of it actually, because it was very easy to do that. Oh, I just did it. Oh, crap.  Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's their official stance is RTFM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you serious, Leo? Did you just do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't really withdraw the stylus.  I thought because it went in so easily, I thought, oh, this isn't going to be a problem to get it out.  The clippers closed down on it, apparently.  They did. So you did that too, Ron?  It's so easy. Isn't it? That's what's deceiving about it.  It goes in just without any effort. It just goes right in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is zero force. And yeah, it just kind of clamps down.  It's exactly the same feeling as using a Chinese finger trap.  Where you put your fingers in and then you try to go out and all of a sudden there's this force that wasn't there before.  It's really weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some people report, I think you reported this in your article, that you can do it again and maybe fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I got mine out without it being broken.  Oh, you. How'd you do it?  I just I put it in there and wiggled it out. And the first time I got it out, it didn't work.  And then I got it stuck again and tried to pull it out again. Right. And then it worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think. So you think if I stick it in again, there's a chance I'll fix it?  Yeah, go for it. You haven't done that yet.  Disaster here. So let me tell you what happens as as Mac break weekly ended up.  I had a phone that this is the note five, by the way, I had a phone that had a pen sticking out kind of like an antenna on the bottom.  And I went to AT&T because that's where I bought it from AT&T. Eight hundred fifty bucks. It was not a cheap phone.  And I know you pay full board. Yeah, I buy the phones.  So and I could you know, it is a little bit annoying because there's no if you're going to buy it in the US, you have to buy it from a carrier, you know, with the incumbent two year contract and all that stuff.  But that's the way it is. And I didn't want to wait for the unlocked version.  Like I've in the past, I bought unlocked international galaxies. And that's kind of always been a mistake.  So this was a mistake, too, as it turned out, because AT&T didn't want to have anything to do with it.  I said, well, I said, can I so the guy said, well, that's intentional damage. We're not going to fix that.  So is it going to be? Yeah. So I said, can I speak to a manager?  And he you know, he said, yeah, you know, you could say you could.  Samsung has a one year warranty. You probably could send it to them.  And then I said, OK, well, I like this phone. I don't want to lose it.  Now, it's only a week old. Could I just give it back? He said, yeah, you could do that, but you can't do it in this state.  You have to pull the pen out, put it back in. You know, that will break it.  And he he I think what he was implying is, well, we wouldn't know that.  So because the breaking, by the way, I should point out and you know this, Ron, the breaking isn't that big a deal.  The breaking only means that it doesn't sense the pen sliding out.  So it doesn't go into that off screen notation mode. I can still use the pen in every respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. Well, and the and the little menu doesn't pop out automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but if you press the button and hover, it pops out. So it's not the end of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the this stylus is supposed to be the big differentiator on these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, I mean, I don't know which it's not the end of the world, but it's still the end of your eight hundred dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's still gone. I mean, the phone works in every other respect. Air Command works.  You just have to press the button on the on the stylus. Now, it turns out that's not actually it.  It isn't. So this is a little deceptive.  That hook is the spring hook that you press. So it'll pop out.  There is an even I see this here.  There is an even tinier little tiny plastic hook below that that gets caught in one of the ridges of the pen and snaps off.  Now, apparently what happened to you, Ron, is that that got pushed up, but you were able to kind of pull it back down and you were lucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a great picture, though.  I've had I've had people send me stuff about, oh, this happens to me, too.  And somebody broke the top right off and it stayed in the device and they just have, you know, it broke off like just above the G and and and yeah.  So but but he said he talked to Samsung and they replaced it.  So I said, I haven't said too much about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there as their response was, we should have read the manual, but doesn't come with a manual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it does not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their their response.  But there is an online PDF that does say and by the way, this is a mistake on their part.  Very clearly not to do this right.  And it might break the phone that which is an admission that they knew before the phone was shipped that this was the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what about those videos you always see the product?  We know we do this a thousand times to make sure it will always work.  We dropped on it. We did all this good stuff.  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would Apple would Apple have done this?  Well, my initial thought would have blamed you.  Well, but when I left the 18th Easter, I was thinking, had I bought an iPhone and something like that happened, Apple would have just swapped it.  Yeah. Kind of no questions asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, well, but if no, no, the difference is this.  The product as a whole has a flaw.  Apple's first response in the past has been that's how you're how you're holding the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Imagine how expensive this will be to fix if they try to fix.  Well, how many units are out, though?  Oh, that we don't know.  Maybe they sold 10. I don't know.  This is this is a superb phone.  And one of the one of the things I'm unhappy, I don't want to give this up so I can live with I did break it so I can live with it being broken.  I suspect they'll fix this flaw in future ones.  And it'll you know, if you bought one in a week or a month, it will be fixed.  But I don't know what they're going to do for us early adopters.  I don't. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, if you permanently if you break the little sensor thing off, then you would need a replacement.  I think I wonder if there's some kind of alternate stylist design that they could ship out to existing customers that wouldn't get stuck because this this is a hollow plastic tube.  This doesn't really cost any money. Right.  I'm sure they could come up with something maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's the illustration from nine to five.  Google, it's really a little technical, a little kind of a technical illustration.  But so this lever to the first lever up at the top is actually the, you know, not the lever that gets broken.  That's not the sensor lever.  This little notch in the pen apparently gets caught in a much smaller.  There it is.  You can barely see it.  A sensor here.  That's the presence sensor.  And there's a tiny little black piece of plastic there.  And I guess that's what's on mine snapped off.  Yours works, though, which is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there's a state that it can be in where you remove it and it won't work anymore and you put it back in and it will maybe go to a state that does work and then you can remove it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should I do that, Ron? Is that your recommendation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could try. I mean, it's already broken.  I could break it worse. I could break it worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, the thing is, I expected, so this is my natural suspicion of tech blogs is, oh, you know, they're overblowing this.  You probably had to press harder to get it to do that.  And what I didn't understand is it just went in very without any pressure at all.  And it just happens if you pass a certain point, you're done for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so now when you put it in, but now you have no fear of which way you put it in because it will still broken the same way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think I'll get my I'll get mine jammed again.  I wonder I wonder if we don't know.  No, no, no, no, no, no, do it right.  Straight up gravity.  I wonder if it will get stuck. See, you see how easy that went in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ha. OK, that's the demonstration.  That's the demonstration. That's the critical demonstration.  Yeah, right there. That's why I was surprised.  Gravity is sufficient.  And that's why I think they have a little bit of a problem because you could see a kid doing this or in the dark.  I'm not really paying attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who pays attention to which way you're going to put it in?  Exactly.  Since you're able to go in any which way you want to put it in, it should guide you in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would hope everybody now would pay attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what's even more interesting is that previous notes prevented this.  This one does not.  This could not happen.  I don't understand why.  All they really had to do was make the the flat end just a tiny bit wider than the rest of the entire pin.  And that would prevent all of this.  Why did they not do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They wanted it to be flush on the bottom, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a brand new stylist design that has this kind of spring loaded pop out thing.  Oh, you got it out. Did you get it out, Ron? Have you got it out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I just kind of pulled it out.  And is it working? Is the sensor working?  Uh, no.  So you broke it.  You did it for us, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It did this before, though, and I put it back in and kind of messed around with it and it works again.  So.  Woosa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought that was very, very telling that he just let that go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The gravity was what he's willing to do for his public.  Now it's working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's working. You fixed it.  OK, we're good. We're good.  You fixed it. And that's the one thing that doesn't work anymore is on mine is, is that kind of cool feature, but not one.  I call it the the red girls number down in the bar feature.  It's not something I'm doing.  So I ask a different question about the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  How is the state of Samsung bloatware?  Much better.  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is my until then.  This is my favorite phone right now.  I'm waiting.  It's better than I'm waiting for the Moto X Pure.  That's coming out.  And well, you can order it.  That's gonna be cool.  September 3rd.  And I'm waiting to see what the next I are because I'm you know what?  Google Fi has turned out to be a real money saver for me.  Really?  Yeah.  So it's 20 bucks for unlimited voice and text and then ten dollars per gigabyte for data.  But I it was only 30 bucks last month.  Because I didn't use it because I'm also the data is on Wi-Fi.  So I could see that being a real savings because it could be as little as 20.  But if you don't if you only in Wi-Fi, you only use 20 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plus, if you leave the country for a month, you can turn it off and come back and you don't have to buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not fond of the Nexus 6.  I think it's a little large.  This is five seven.  It's just right.  What do you think, Ron?  You like this phone?  It's wildly expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it's what?  Eight hundred dollars was more than 800 bucks, which kills me.  Yeah, especially when you compare that to, you know, Samsung's nightmare.  Our Xiaomi is selling.  If you've ever played with a Xiaomi, you know, those are like four or five hundred bucks.  So I really don't see the three hundred dollars worth of extra value here.  I mean, it's it's a great device.  It's like the most premium note Samsung's ever built.  You know, you're not going to be able to take the battery out or do an SD card or whatever.  But the build quality is great.  The camera is great.  It has a fingerprint reader and all that stuff.  It's just it's just priced the way I feel like you priced cell phones a couple of years ago.  And and now everybody's kind of kind of dropped prices in Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's ironic, though.  That's in the Android world.  Apple's not going to drop its prices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they don't have to.  So there's no competition for an iOS device.  It's about the ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is Apple priced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Ron, I'm so glad you're on the show because I want to ask you something.  The Huawei Nexus you wrote about this has the weird like protruding camera stuff.  Right.  And it's very conspicuous looking.  It's probably just a lot of camera electronics that they couldn't quite cram in there.  But what is that bump?  But what are the chances that this is Project Tango?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a picture of a case on there, too, and it covers everything other than the.  Yeah, so there's a case and they make these cases to the manufacturer spec.  Basically, they say we need cutouts here, here and here.  So the only cutouts there at the top are the camera, the flash.  And that little extra thing must be a laser autofocus.  So it's unlikely.  Yeah, it's just it's just extra stuff.  I think a lot of that bump is it's a plastic window to get signals out because the majority of the phone is metal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Explain what Tango is so people understand why that's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so Project Tango is Google's invention for 3D mapping in real time of indoor and outdoor spaces with a smartphone or a tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you could you could buy a Tango tablets, which they're selling right now.  They're selling the inside of your store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could do it for games, for augmented reality.  There's lots of applications for it.  In blind. Exactly.  And it's amazing technology. It's a big ass tablet.  It's a big ass tablet.  The electronics for that used to exist in very expensive desktop computers.  Google managed to get it down into a mobile form factor.  This thing is not coming out to the end of the year at the earliest, I understand.  And so it occurred to me that since the tablet's already out there and of course, this was first demonstrated on smartphones, this could be their first on try, given that it's a Nexus and so on.  But yeah, it doesn't it doesn't seem likely to me either at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Tango needs sensors.  It's a 3D sensor.  It's basically like slapping an Xbox Kinect on the back of your device.  And it needs, you know, a camera here and then over here.  So, you know, so you get two different angles, like a stereo view, kind of.  So you'd need a hole on the other side and there isn't one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So why did they why did they need so much space for this camera electronics?  Everybody else is cramming, you know, for the most part, the camera electronics into the cases that are, you know, that are shipping.  Why do they need so much extra room?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This looks a little bit like the Lumia 1020.  That was their 41 megapixel camera in a Windows phone and it had a fairly hefty bump around the lens.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Huawei likes to build the thinnest possible devices.  Like if you if you look at some of their stuff, big camera bumps like this are always kind of their thing.  I think it was more a design decision than anything else to take what is normally a camera bump and kind of extend it across the whole back of the device.  Maybe they'll put the bigger components up there and make the phone as thin as possible.  But I mean, everything all phones have camera bumps.  Yeah. And and Huawei, I think, just chose to take theirs and go all the way across it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Make it a camera stripe instead of a bump.  Yeah, you're going to see bumps because to get low light performance in a phone camera, you need more lens elements.  And they have so you're and everybody's touting six elements, seven.  I think the new Apple phone will have seven elements.  So that's necessitates a bump. You just can't put seven layers of plastic in there without some protrusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And better better to bump that than the whole phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's an ugly choice.  But, you know, well, I don't care about phone thickness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd rather they make it thicker and give me more battery and more battery.  And like this thing looks ugly, but we've seen renders of it before that match this design that used white cutouts on the top and bottom.  And it looked way better. It's just the contrasty plastic thing makes it look like, I don't know, like a vent or one of those things that a ship for talking to people below deck.  Right. Right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Full speed ahead.  Ridley. All right. All right.  So enough. I don't want to step too much on all about Android toes here.  You guys do such a great job every Tuesday evening.  5 p.m. Pacific 8 p.m. Eastern with our our steam Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, we actually didn't talk about the Huawei Nexus last night.  So you didn't step on toes at all.  This is the render actually, or one of the renders anyway.  So that was better what you were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all made up. Yes, exactly.  It's all completely unofficial at this point.  We don't even know if Huawei is actually actually actually even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wouldn't it be weird if Google used a Chinese company to make Nexus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they use Chinese company to make the thing, the router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, the on hub. Oh, yeah, that's right.  TP link. TP link.  Sure. I mean, everybody uses Chinese companies for Chinese manufacture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But to actually use a and isn't Huawei partly owned by the Chinese military?  I mean, this is not this is not just some random.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is why it gives me pause.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually is a massive company.  If you go to like CES or Mobile World Congress, they have the biggest truth there.  And they make everything from, I think, like satellites to cell phone towers to a million different other products.  So it's not just cell phones.  But I think the point is that Google wants to to take Huawei and say this is an OK brand and you can, you know, pay attention to this company.  And I think they want to elevate them with a Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and on Huawei's part, they've they have never been able to get in the U.S. market.  Yeah. So they would love to get in the U.S. market.  Right. Maybe maybe that's the beginning for them as well.  Not LG, you think not LG won't make this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, this the six inch one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't LG making? Oh, they're making the Nexus five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they're making a five point two inch device.  And so this is a six. They both kind of share a lot in common.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yeah, well, five something says I don't really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's all rumors, but sure. Right.  But yeah, it's weird. It's basically like the iPhone six and six plus model, but from two completely different manufacturers.  And they kind of share a design and a lot of design styles like they both have the rear fingerprint sensor.  They both have front facing stereo speakers, kind of similar designs.  It's it'll be interesting. Google is Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, by the way, Huawei makes cell site equipment that's used in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ron was talking about their big booths at Mobile World Congress.  They had bouncers to keep the press out. Really? Out. Not in. Out.  It's unbelievable. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they had a subway turnstiles at Mobile World and you had to you had to like NFC badge in.  Yes. And yeah, that was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when are you getting your Google on hub, Jeff Jarvis? You got yours from Walmart lies.  A Walmart lied. Surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Walmart said expected September 11th, you know, a week later, it's still not shipped or anything, of course.  You see if I have any. So the first time I've already in Walmart, all I've gotten is spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have tracking information. I got it from a recent order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll love these things, too. Actually, Jack, from them. So Google, no way to track it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I ordered it from the Google Store and it says October 1st through 5th. But that was a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Google Store is that the worst place to get it? What? Really? Oh, yeah.  Oh, Google's retail is so out of whack. No, I had an order from Amazon that was going to show up September 2nd.  But but then Google said they were going to ship me once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just call Google customer service. You should have kept your order. I would have bought it from you, Ron.  Google's having an event today in San Francisco, which we were not invited to.  Thank you, Google. Bastards didn't even tell us about it. Bastard.  And it's on. It's the on hub show off thing.  Does ours have somebody there? Yes, of course they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to get one FedExed over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think Google would know that in fact, broadcast media is as good as blog media, web media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Blog. He spat that. Blog.  Damn tech blogs. Those kids. Get your blog off my front porch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I had to fight. We had to fight the print media for years. You know, everything was print.  You wanted to get into an event. You wanted to get into a pepcom event.  You'd have to give them tear sheets of your articles.  And I said, I don't do tear sheets. Would you like a video? Would you just go to the website?  No, no. You need to have a tear sheet.  I've had the worst time with pepcom getting into their events.  Now it's what's your blog? They're smart. They got smart.  No more tear sheets. But now what's your blog?  What's your what's your URL? All we want to do, Google, is talk about it.  We just want to cover your gosh darn crap. Yeah.  You know what? They know we'll cover it anyway.  What have we learned? Have we learned anything yet, Ron Amadio, about the on-hub that we didn't know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's going to be a developer preview in Q3 this year that switches the operating system to Brillo,  which is Google's kind of Android based Internet of Things operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is a Trojan horse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, that sounds that sounds super awesome.  Yeah, I was really suspicious of it because you look at the specs  and it's got like a dual core processor and like a gig of RAM and I'm like, this is a router really.  But yeah, it's going to start running Android soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Brillo. That's their Internet of Things operating system.  Yeah.  So and I think everybody kind of knew, especially because it had support for Zigbee 802.15.4,  that this was really a home automation play as much as a Wi-Fi play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can anyone explain why Google didn't make this an Amazon Echo?  They need speakers and a microphone and they can compete with Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the speakers we learned last week, the speakers are extremely low wattage.  Yes, it has a speaker, but it's not the right kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. The Amazon Echo has beautiful speakers, very rich sound.  And once you buy one, you never need to buy another one because they can upgrade it in the cloud.  How much are you guys really using the Echo?  I use my Echo 50 times a day.  It's the most useful device in the house.  Does your wife make fun of you still?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, she uses it even more heavily than I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She does.  We use it for every timer. We use it for the weather. We use it for everything. It's so useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have it in the kitchen. We don't use it that much.  I'm thinking I'll put it in the bathroom. That's where a hands-free device would really be handy.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You keep yours in the kitchen?  Kitchen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's great for us because you can say, I won't say her name, but you can say Echo,  listen to Tech News Today on TuneIn and it'll play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just plays the live stream or it'll play any of the shows.  You can just say, hey, what's happening?  It'll play BBC News, NPR News, and it'll go into this thing where it has a computer voice reading the news.  It's just totally hands-free.  I'm so confused about how Amazon beat both Apple and Google to the future of home computing.  Basically, that's what this is. This is the interface of the future.  I think it's a small niche, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it too, but I think it's us.  What do we think of M?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do we think of M?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, let's take a break. We'll talk about M, the new Facebook Messenger tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it not Dorothy's Ant from WizzleBoss?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. In fact, it stands for Moneypenny. That was the original code name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It no longer stands for Marshmallow because Marshmallow is Marshmallow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish they'd called it Moneypenny, but I think that probably isn't right.  But that's who it's, you know, it's a personal assistant in your Messenger.  And frankly, we have a story about Google Now, maybe that Google isn't as committed to Google Now as it used to be,  which is really depressing.  Yep.

So it's pretty clear there are two areas that all of these companies, including Google, are all in on.  One is messaging. Wait a minute, Google's not really all in on messaging.  Hangouts should be.  They kind of let Hangouts drift off.  And the other is voice-activated, kind of Google Now style stuff.  Google's all, no, they kind of let that one go by the wayside too.  What is Google doing these days?  So this is the latest stories that many of the Google Now team disappeared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Jeff's next book. What is Google doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What the hell is Google up to?  They, after...  FDTF, Google.  After Google I.O. and the announcement of Google on tap, according to this story, all but one of Google Now's original team is gone.  We're gone before I.O. is a little bit.  And the feeling is that this is something Larry Page really took seriously, but Sundar Pichai less so.  Well, that's disappointing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm starting to think that I'm just, you know, not enough information still.  I'm starting to think that Sundar Pichai is less of an impressive leader for Google than everybody says.  Well, we don't know yet.  Is he too narrow?  He seemed, I mean, this article is a great article in Recode.  And they really talked about his style of leadership.  He's a, he's kind of like one of these leaders who basically everybody comes to him with a problem and he comes up with a compromise between everybody.  He's kind of a weak leader in that sense where he's more into like handling the politics than being a visionary who says, no, Google Now is the future.  We're doing it all the way, which is what Page used to do.  Exactly.  And so I'm worried about that because that's not the kind of company that Google has been traditionally.  They've been more of a, you know, let's go for it kind of a company, not a Microsoft style.  Oh, these different people are giving me pushback.  I better make some compromises kind of a company.  So, I don't know.  That article made me sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mark Bergen writing in Recode yesterday says, now escalated inside Google quickly because it had the backing of Page.  He would open up, he's quoting a Google anonymous Google source.  He would open up every single all hands meeting with Google Now.  Then Page started to step away.  Blame the foundation as it turns out now we know for Alphabet.  Meanwhile, Google's core business Search continue to lose steam as mobile app usage rocketed.  At some point last year, Amit Singhali, SVP who had Search requested that Now be moved from Android into Search.  Several engineers objected according to multiple sources, their initial vision of Now as a mobile assistant,  tailored to particular users works best living on mobile, not within Search.  But, and this is Pachai making the compromise, he approves Singhali's request.  In part perhaps because Google must balance all products like Now, which push information to users with its central business problem,  how to make more money from mobile.  So, in the face of that, now not that Facebook is the bellwether or the brilliant leader.  I mean, they've launched a whole lot of products that have just tanked.  But with Facebook announced or actually was revealed that Facebook is doing a beta test,  Wired had this story today, only with a few hundred people in the Bay Area of something called Am.  That's part of Messenger.  Yes.  It's not just Now, I mean, it's humans too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  They make a decision about whether something's going to be handled by a machine or by human beings.  I think that's one of the brilliant things about this.  The other is that essentially you're texting this service.  It's not talking and then it's talking back audibly so much as you're it's there.  Engraining the habit of using Messenger as a texting service.  And I think that's brilliant as well.  I really like the direction of this.  I like the fact that this is actually kind of the type of thing that Google would do,  which is that other people are trying to make a product out of this, out of virtual assistants.  And they're saying, it's just a feature. It's not a product.  It's a feature.  And so they're making a feature of Messenger, giving you a reason to download and use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the context of what we've been talking about in past weeks, Jeff, which is that Messenger platforms are the hot new area.  And pointing back to that New York Times article about WeChat, or was it Wired, maybe about WeChat,  which is basically a platform in China for everything you want to do.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And companies are using, I'm so tired. I'm going to break.  Slack.  Slack. Thank you very much.  I'm reading his mind now, ladies and gentlemen.  That's scary.  They're using Slack now in all kinds of ways for companies.  Slack does it. HipChat does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  WhatsApp, which Facebook owns, is in certain countries huge.  Line in Japan is as big as WeChat is in China.  Here in the States, everybody, it seems to me, everybody uses SMS.  Or if you're on iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is really funny because the rest of the world was so far ahead of us on SMS.  We finally caught up and now they've gone way past it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, because SMS can be expensive, right?  Here, almost everybody pays for unlimited SMS now.  So it's essentially free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other paradox here is I think we end up maybe going back to voice  and even one-on-one voice communication at some level.  That's what it might be. A lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What I love about all this other personal assistant stuff is it's like Google built this new API into Marshmallow,  the assistant API that makes Google Now on tap work.  So you can build this assistant app and Android has all these hooks in it that it can plug into now.  And then at the same time, they built this API to open the door to everyone else.  You get this article about how they don't care that much about Google Now.  So, you know, they kind of shut down their own solution and threw the door open for everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's also interesting that I think related to this conversation,  which is that Microsoft came out with something that's like Now on tap that doesn't require an API.  Cortana. Yeah, it works really well too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's called...  Yeah, it's not Cortana. It's built into Bing Search actually.  It's called Snapshot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, but you have to use Windows Phone for this?  No, it's on Android.  It's an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Bing Search app.  And I mean, it works the same way as On Tap, essentially.  If you have an article or something on screen, you swipe it over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who's going to put Bing Search app on their Android device, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, but Microsoft keeps doing this kind of thing.  I mean, they did something that's like Project Tango for the iPhone.  It's still in research mode.  But it looks like Microsoft is really targeting iOS and Android first.  And eventually people are going to kind of go, yeah, you know, this Microsoft stuff on Android is actually pretty good.  It needs to be a differentiator though, right?  What's the differentiator?  For starters, you don't need to wait for the developers to build something for it.  It works right out of the box.  You're delivering most of the promises of now On Tap.  So Google got to release...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody will ever know that if they never use, if they never install it.  You got to get people to install it.  Yeah. It's an uphill battle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your Android phone's going to come with now On Tap.  It comes with now.  So when it does finally launch, everybody will have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's an uphill battle to get people to put a third party search.  Because I know I have Hound, which is fast and really interesting.  And I never use it because I go, OK, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's so built into the iOS.  Before we leave Facebook, can I do a demo?  Yeah. What do you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Live.  I am so mad at you. I am so mad at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you go to my Facebook page, here we are, three, two, one, we're going to go.  Jeff Jarvis got it first.  We are live. So now we are live.  You think you're so verified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're mocking Ricky Jarvis.  So I don't have a cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you go to my Facebook page, there it is.  You should see it live.  There we are. Very live.  Has it been robust with you?  The first two times I used it today,  frankly boring things from my panel,  or my conference,  it went out of me in like 30 seconds.  And then I did an eight minute one and it worked fine.  So here we are. Here's my setup.  Why do you have Post-it notes all over your door?  My computer?  My Post-it notes say,  can you see them or not?  Is this something I was going to have to be start doing soon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to start doing soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of them says password equals one, two, three, four, five, six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says be right back in the men's room getting a sandwich.  Oh, I get it. Oh, that's clever.  It says you put it on the other side of the door.  This is my setup for my, this is the wonderful studio I have here.  It'll catch up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's lagging a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, there's like a 15 second delay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want this so bad.  And now it's Ricky Gervais and Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Must have been something you said.  It's a nice laptop stand you got there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my god.  I would have thought,  I would have thought we'd get a lot more viewers from Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  32, 32.  27, it's going down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry, what do I do? Take off my clothes?  What should I do here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Try to be more boring. It works for Ricky Gervais.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I need a cat.  Imagine there's a cat right here.  And I'm walking with bad teeth.  I have the same bad teeth Ricky Gervais has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look, I got fangs.  So Webweaver again in the chat room says,  we have whole sites dedicated to this apps like Periscope and Meerkat.  Why do we think it'll catch on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, all of this Facebook stuff,  when you're like, it's going to show up on Facebook,  I'm always just like, oh, I don't.  Well, here's the thing.  My Facebook is all friends and family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ron, yeah, but here's what happens.  Facebook has so much of my attention,  my stream attention, right?  That when Ricky Gervais comes on, it gives me an alert right then.  It says, hey, Ricky's on and I go to it.  And so whenever Leo gets on in six months,  and he's live,  then I can see that.  I think that there's some uses.  Facebook's advantage is  it has your stream attention,  has your attention through a stream.  Versus Periscope,  I never end up looking at anything in Periscope.  Never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, oddly enough,  this has to show up in my news feed,  and Facebook controls that,  and it may or may not. I'm going to look through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It may or may not tell anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me see if you're in my...  I'm your friend.  You follow me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You also follow me, or you're just my friend?  Does that make a difference?  I don't know. So is this your page, or is this your personal...  I thought that was the problem, because my page...  I don't even have a page in ages.  So it's your profile.  No, it's my profile.  There it is.  Way down, though. You're under Justin Bieber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're doing this live,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and it's like five post-it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Priorities here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course, Google had this three years ago.  The difference is,  as you said, Jeff,  once again, the one and only benefit of Facebook  is that everybody's on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're saying Hangouts Live was the same thing?  Three years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Much better than this, actually, because you could have multiple people if you wanted.  You could have one person.  It was much less of a lag than this,  and it posted immediately on YouTube.  Three years ago, in May of 2012.  But this will stay on Facebook, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the things we're learning about Facebook  is that native Facebook video,  because it starts playing as soon as you get to it,  gets much more engagement than a link to a YouTube, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, they just count  they count autoplays as...  No, I understand, but I think it does get more engagement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's no doubt about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, when you were scrolling through your list, you passed four videos.  So that was four views that you could...  Did you enjoy them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I understand, including  including Ricky Gervais, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So by the way, I got this working.  I bought an iPod Touch just for the purpose  of testing things like Facebook,  instant articles, and this.  Took me a while, for some reason it wouldn't work, but I finally started working.  My old iPod 4, I mean, iPhone 4.  Is that how you're streaming this?  Is from an iPhone 4?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  An iPod Touch?  Now see, I've lost it. I don't know where it is.  Sure, Lazar gets it too.  How come everybody's got it except me?  I don't want it anymore.  Take it back, Facebook.  I don't care.  It doesn't really matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't really care that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My theory is 86 viewers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a terrible stream, because all they're hearing is me  and a lot of silence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My prediction is that when  this is open to everybody,  then the celebrities will stop using it.  And then when they stop using it,  everybody will stop using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we talked about this last week.  What this solves right now is the penis problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm speechless. Do you have a penis problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anything that solves the penis problem, I'm up for.  What you mean is the problem of people using  just to flash the Facebook stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So by having celebrities,  then that limits the content that's there right now.  You'd think, wouldn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Ricky Gervais is moments away.  I don't know why, I just feel that.  He's just moments away from taking off his pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could happen. I could leave this here for the rest of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the things I really like about  the Note 5  and the new S6 Plus  is this YouTube live streaming that's built into the camera.  That's so cool.  I've used it a few times, and it's actually pretty neat.  To me, that makes more sense maybe?  Or maybe not? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A YouTube live built into a YouTube app?  No, it's in the camera app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you're in the camera app,  one of the modes, you have a panorama mode  and a pro mode,  one of the modes is live broadcast mode.  You tap that button, and I've tied it into my YouTube account.  You obviously have to do that.  Preparing broadcast.  Leo Laporte's live broadcast.  I'm now live in public on YouTube  with this broadcast right there.  So you take your Facebook live feed  and I'm going to rebroadcast it on YouTube right now.  Is that fair use?  Or doesn't seem fair?  We're crossing the streams now.  And then I can do this.  I think this is kind of cool.  I feel like, for instance, we're having a meetup.  Hey, Jeff, can you come to our meetup, by the way, on September?  I'm going to be in Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm totally meerkatting this right now.  So would you hear it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is the battle of the platforms, I guess.  See, the Samsung thing, though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that should be an app.  And I'm sure YouTube will release an app  in a few weeks or months or whatever.  It's not reasonable to buy a phone,  which is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although, apparently, they have a deal with YouTube.  I mean, it's not just like they just built it in.  There's some sort of deal going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure YouTube was involved.  But I don't think they have, like, an exclusive  on the future or anything.  I'm sure it'll roll out to everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the first time I've had a reason  to use meerkat in, like, four months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just a bunch of narcissists, frankly.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, what do you call a narcissist?  I was listening to you waiting for you to talk about me.  What a terrible world we live in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now Donald Trump's going to be president,  and that's just... I don't know what to say.  Not if Jorge Ramos has anything to say about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You had some things to say about that  in your blog, buzzmachine.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm so disgusted with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You believe that the mainstream media  has become a lapdog to the Donald.  I used a different term.  Yeah, but I'm going to use lapdog.  You used a stronger term.  Yeah, I'm going to use lapdog.  I'm going to use lapdog.  You used a stronger term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I did. I thought I'd get some crap  for using that term. I did a footnote that said  it was stronger than lapdog, so go look it up  on Buzz Machine if you're curious what we're talking about.  Yeah, I think it's ridiculous. After Trump's  thing in Iowa,  CNN was just falling  over themselves. Oh, that was really great.  What a show! They're treating it like  show business. But Jorge Ramos,  who is an extremely important  figure, he is the most  important figure in Spanish language

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  media. He's the Walter Cronkite of American Spanish  language television. Bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's highly unlikely that Donald Trump did not know  who he was. Oh, you bet he knows.  Don't forget Donald Trump was supposedly suing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Univision for $50 million  for $500 million.  I don't know what it is. For dropping  that for his comments about Mexicans.  So he knew exactly what it was.  He told him, get back to Univision, which is  the same as saying get back to Mexico. Yeah, he basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  deported him out of the press conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then claimed he didn't know  who security was. Of course, it's his security.  He nodded to the security saying  And then they brought him back in.  And then he just acted like  But you ask a very interesting question, which is  if Jake Tapper had been shoved out of  the room for being impertinent  to Donald Trump, what would  have happened?  That would have been a different situation,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right? They all should have left the room.  They should have asked the same questions that Ramos was trying  to ask. Instead, what happened?  The next question, somebody if I gets in,  Megan Kelly and his feud.  We've all become part of Trump's reality show.  You know why? You're all schmucks.  Good ratings. Yeah, that's depressing  as hell. That's not the only business we're in in journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As long as we're talking about journalism,  just a deep  condolences to  the friends and family  and everybody  coworkers  just a tragic

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  story. Awful, awful, awful day.  Let's be clear that journalists die  all the time in the rest of the world.  They don't usually die

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  during stand ups.  They don't die during a simple feature stand up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With somebody from the Chamber of Commerce.  Yeah, it's just awful.  And I've already gotten  some tips on Facebook already because  having discussions on Twitter  because in my mind,  do not name this person.  Once you name him once, that's fine. Do not give him  the attention. Do not air his stupid  manifesto. Especially  do not air the video he took  for God's sake on something like Facebook Live  on Periscope or  on YouTube or whatever tool he used  to tape the actual  crime. Twitter pulled it down  immediately, right? And to do  that, I got in a big fight with somebody on Twitter.  I said, you're  part of the  crime of the next person who does it.  And you're only giving that person what they want  and it's only for sensationalism you do it.  It doesn't really inform us anymore. And there's  a limit. There are levels of responsibility.  And yeah, I was  fairly disgusted with what was happening  immediately.  There's nothing served by serving  this maniacs, this murderers

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  attempt. We won't mention his name. He was  a disgruntled employee

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I gather. Yeah, two names anyway.  There's one thing that needs to be said that's  somewhat positive, which is that  Twitter and Facebook both reacted  very quickly and very appropriately.  In Twitter's case, they  kept his profile up  and removed all the content from that profile.  So they didn't just have this  question raising  error message. They basically  just had his profile there, but there's no  content. So there was no way to  sensationalize what he had said  or done. But at the same time  you got confirmation that in fact this was  the Twitter account that was  in the news. So that was the right thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So deepest condolences to  friends and family of Alison Parker and Adam Ward.  The good news is that the Chamber of Commerce  executive director who was also shot is expected to  recover.  Vicki Gardner. But it's just  very sad.  It's also for  I mean this was not just somebody going up for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  somebody randomly. It was not just because they were  public. It was a disgruntled employee.  But you know, it's just  doing the simplest thing in public  and that's what we're doing.  And that's scary for all of us.  Well I don't do stand-ups so I'm not  doing it anymore anyway.  Depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alright. Let's find something else  to talk about that's much nicer and it has to do  with tech and we like.  God, it's hard to say.  How about Verizon?  What is Humm?  You covered this this morning on TNT.  Tell me about Humm.  Humm is a  very popular thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell me about Humm.  Humm is kind of a cool thing actually.  Basically what it is  it gives you OnStar like functionality for your  old car. Just about any car  made in the last 20 years  will work with this. And it gives you  many of the features of OnStar which is a  very expensive concierge like  emergency oriented  GPS specific  service. But at a fraction  of the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It uses, it's interesting, the OBD2 port  which every car has.  We've talked a little bit about that.  I use it to give me grades  as I'm driving.  But you could put this connector  in that port. What's your GPA at this point?  I'm good. I'm doing good. I got 99.  Because it  gives you penalties for stepping on the gas.  Fast acceleration.  In fact my watch will beep now if I do fast acceleration.  And  also jamming on the brakes  is bad.  What's actually most useful is it tells me how much  the gas that I spent  that I used on that trip. Like that trip cost you 99 cents.  When you don't know that  it's very easy to drive around a lot.  What? That cost me a buck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been driving a Prius since  2004 I think. And I've always contended  that the main way that you save  gas with a Prius is that it shows you how much gas  you're burning. Just the knowledge.  Causes you to ease up on the accelerator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this will send you  that thing connects  to something on your visor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's something that clips to your visor.  And again it's got GPS and it does all kinds  of really cool stuff. It collects  data on things like your fuel economy battery.  Sends it right back to Verizon. All that kind of stuff.  Why is it Verizon doing this?  Why is this a Verizon? Well it's  another data thing. So it's like you're renting it  from them. It has a SIM card. It's basically  like a... It's 15 bucks a month. It's an Internet  of Things device. Let's be clear about it.  There's a marriage of the Internet of Things with mobile data.  And yeah, and it uses a mobile data system.  But it costs 15 dollars a month.  No upfront... Will it do calls?  No, it won't do calls. It's not a phone.  But it will track... Like it does things...  There's an app, right, that goes on your phone.  And it will do things like  it'll remind you where your car is.  And there's also a place for you to take pictures  and add notes about, you know,  I'm on level 3 in this part of the parking  garage. If you have your  car stolen, you can report it stolen.  It says, okay, make sure you fill out a police report.  Here's what you give to the police. And then here's where it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's mostly about road safety, though. Isn't that why people want OnStar?  It's mostly about road safety.  I had an accident. Come get me. Or I might  broke down. Come get me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. But a normal company  would build this and just have it Bluetoothed to your phone.  And then you wouldn't have another monthly  cellular bill. There's really no reason  for it to have a cell phone connection when you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  bringing your cell phone. Oh, you're right.  You're already paying for that connection.  And, of course, Verizon says...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The difference is that  when you get out of your car, you take your phone  with you, and this thing keeps GPS  with a data connection in  the car. So if your car is  stolen or if you park your car,  then each of you has a GPS  and you can find each other. So that's that one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  difference. You want to throw this out the window  if you steal somebody's car, just a little tip.  If you're going to steal cars, that's what you do.  Verizon says it will vigorously  protect your data, sharing it with third parties  only in cases where  it's needed to provide services. When they politely ask Verizon.  When they politely ask.  And it will share data with law enforcement  only where authorized and required  by law. Oh, no. I don't really  trust Verizon. That's pretty much everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't really trust Verizon. Well, AT&T would turn out  to be a bunch of... Yeah, I don't trust any of them.  Shmucks. Verizon, Verizon.  You see the other news on Verizon right below there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on the rundown? Tell us all about it, Mr. Jeff  Jarvis Verizon fan. You may

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  remember my fight.  By Agri-Fall.  Slowly I did.  To try to get my  Nexus 7 attached to the Verizon network  as was required by law.  And I complained to the FCC. And of course  I lost. Good guys lost. Nothing ever happened  because the FCC didn't really protect us. That's another matter.  Verizon is a bunch of schmucks. Well, now  I'm guessing because they're charging  you full price for phones.  And there's no special deal to be hung with Verizon.  Now suddenly Verizon will let you  connect your unlocked phones to the Verizon  network. Gloriosky.  Gloriosky.  Took a little, what, about a year and a half  here? Now, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They will finally take your money.  Yes. Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. Well isn't the issue, hasn't it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  always been that they're  CDMA?  You could only do this, only works now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's when they won  part of the spectrum.  Remember the story. Google  was part of that spectrum auction and Google  threw in the requirement for openness that  you could have open connectivity. Google  then, and they basically did it for that reason to get that  in there. Then Google dropped out of the  race. Verizon won that  spectrum, but attached to it was a requirement  of open connectivity  that Verizon never honored.  For GSM  of four spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So  if you have an LTE  capable phone, LTE requires  a SIM card and most of the new Verizon  phones I get have a SIM card  for LTE. Right. You could put anybody's SIM  card in there. They're unlocked  because they had to because of a consent decree  with the FCC.  This is only for CDMA devices  that you want to bring to Verizon's network.  Oh it is? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I  missed that. Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they have a  site you can go to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Plenty of devices  have CDMA as well as  GSM and LTE and all that stuff there. Especially  since CDMA is a big deal in China

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  too. Well if you got a phone at Sprint  for instance. I mean there's really  this is really so your Sprint phone  can work on Verizon basically.  Oh, I read a different version  than the one I- Well I might be misunderstanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I read an earlier version I couldn't find which just  basically said, oh you can hook up your Nexus 7 now.  Oh.  Well let's put it this way. Maybe you still

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  can't. I have a Verizon  iPhone. If I pop  the SIM out of that, I could put anybody  else's SIM card in there and it works fine.  On AT&T, on T-Mobile.  Because that's an unlocked SIM slot.  And I think all of Verizon's  LTE SIM slots are by law  unlocked. So that's  not a problem bringing  I would guess it could go the other way if I  had an AT&T- Actually that's an interesting  question. But the activation  for  is not done for CDMA is not  done by the simple introduction  of a SIM card. They have to  unlock your phone by sending a signal  down the line. So  what you do is you enter your device ID  to see if your  device is compatible  and then they'll activate  it for you. And take your  money.  It's kind of cookie.  So let's see.  Nexus, there's an Android operating  system. From your home screen select  menu settings, about phone status  you need your IMEI  ESN or MEID number.  Have you tried this yet Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm not giving them a penny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so funny that this is being  trumpeted because it is. It's just saying  oh yeah we'll take your money.  Big deal. Thank you Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All I tried to do, I tried and tried  and tried to give the schmucks money  and they wouldn't take it.  The reason I tried  so hard was I already had a shared data thing.  Right. Too late.  That reminds me, I'm still paying for my  old Chromebook Pixel  SIM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now you know why  Google didn't do a SIM in the next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mine is still active.  From Google I.O.  I still have LTE.  I still have free LTE.  Don't tell anyone.  I don't know.  I'm as amazed as everyone  here is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we'll talk a little bit about the new  interactive Android Wear watches.  I got one.  I can do it.  We'll talk about  IAIMAI  which is the  most obscure palindrome  you'll ever hear.  We'll talk about the stock market.  Up and down.  And a new feature in Google Photos all coming up  in just a little bit.  But first a word for those of you  on pager duty.  And those of you who make other people  do pager duty.  I'm talking about pager duty  in operations performance. I love pager duty.  Have you seen the t-shirt  Don't Hate the Pager Hate the Game?  PagerDuty.com  It's a great site.  If you're on call you know what they're talking about.  You want that t-shirt? I'll tell you how you can get it for free  in just a second. Pager duty  is, they prefer to think themselves  as an operations performance platform.  It delivers to you  and your boss and everybody in the operation  information that not only  will of course  help the people on call get the right  you know get the right information  so they can fix the problem.  But also optimize your system so you don't have  as many incidents.  If you rely on your software and services to  always be up you gots to have pager duty.  It becomes the hub of your operations  connecting all your systems  into an easy to use  easy to see single view.  You'll see all the critical events  and we're talking more than a hundred  ready to use integrations. Nagios, New Relic  that's what we use. Keynote  App Dynamics, they have a great API  so it makes it very simple for you to roll your own.  You'll decrease your resolution  time because when an incident occurs  PagerDuty, it already knows  who's on call. It has the on call  schedules. It even has personalized  learning preferences so it will  notify the right team and the right team member  first time  right time every time.  And if the alert isn't responded to it automatically  escalates to another team member until it  is responded to. It's very  smart. Dedupe  the alerts  so that you, they're automatically  filtered and deduplicated. So only  actionable alerts are delivered and they're not  over delivered.  You can dispatch alerts not just by pagers.  You can tell they've been  around a while but really now it's phone calls, SMS  email, push notifications.  You can resolve incidents on the go.  It's really, the people on PagerDuty  will love this. And the analytic  tools, this is what the boss will love.  The analytic tools built into PagerDuty  will help you identify common problems so you can  make system improvements and prevent  future outages. Isn't that what we're all about?  PagerDuty  is relentless when it comes to reliability  fully distributed across multiple  data centers, multiple hosting providers,  multiple contact method  providers per method. You're not  going to miss an alert.  And I can't tell you how frustrating it is when  something goes wrong or the server  goes down and nobody responds to it.  Or nobody even knows it happened.  This solves that problem.  Customize it to fit how you and your team work  regardless of location or size.  This, PagerDuty is the one. I mean Microsoft  uses it. Boeing  uses it. GitHub  uses it. Get the right engineer on the right  problem at the right time. PagerDuty.com  slash twit. You can get a two week trial  and for as little as 19 bucks a month increase  your uptime. And you'll be showing  your support for Twit. PagerDuty  dot com  P-A-G-E-R-D-U-T-Y dot com  slash twit. And by the way  when you sign up for your new account you get the  t-shirt.  I have one. I should wear it.  PagerDuty dot com slash  twit.  If your SaaS is on the line  you need PagerDuty.  I love that too.  Google Photos has  introduced a new feature. Recover the day.  Has anybody used TimeHop?  It's like TimeHop. I like TimeHop.  This one's a little weird  because it just picks  the day  in history and then just picks a bunch of  let me see if I have one. No I don't.  I have had a few. I don't have one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right now. I call this featurization  and Google does it a lot. Basically another company  like TimeHop, another app exists  as a product and Google  says no it's just a feature.  And therefore we're invalidating

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  your category. Here is August  20th 2013.  Two years ago. This was Henry  was about to go  to college for the first  time. And he was saying goodbye to us and his  friends and he had a big dinner around  the round table at Seard, the  local steakhouse. And so these  are all the pictures I took in  videos too. Not particularly well  organized or anything. Just kind of  montaged all together. Hey that  was your day two years ago. Thank you  very much Google.  TimeHop does it better I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you want this. Yeah. So check this out.  I don't have mine on the I don't know if we have  the overhead on this but I can give you the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  special doohickey.  You want the special doohickey? Sure. Here's the  special doohickey. Plug that into your machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like a special doohickey  myself. Let me see. Okay so I'm  other side. Other side.  Oh it's HDMI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you have a doohickey too Ron?  Everybody should have one.  I stuck my doohickey in the wrong way  and now it won't come out.  I can't. So I tried this  while we were in a break and it doesn't fix anything.  It goes in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't want to push it. If you press it in  more you'll get the clicky. That I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  want right? Because that could break it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No I try it. It's almost

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  all the way in. This is the part where  I just let gravity do it.  Should I push it past that point?  Sure yeah. That fixed it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The clicky thing. Did that fix it?  Yeah mine kind of started  vibrating then. It should  vibrate like you're removing the pen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It clicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does it start vibrating when you  move it in and out? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was still doing that when it was stuck but now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh right okay. So I guess  you busted off your thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I busted my doohickey.  Okay.  We are now looking at  Mike Elgin's day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So two years ago I was  living in Florence and this bar  was doing a Christmas in August  celebration. I see it's just a bunch of pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here I am with the Virgin  Mary. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She doesn't look like a virgin  to me. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not going to say anything.  She's Italian. It's okay.  You're right. It's not as good as  TimeHop. They're not being selective here.  They're just kind of saying here's a giant pile  of pictures from the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are so many nice features in the  assistant but so many of  the images I don't really want.  There's Santa. So you had Santa and  the Virgin Mary. Yes. It was very

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ecumenical. I wouldn't say had but  yeah it was  you know  a good bar too right there. I do like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the stories.  Do you like stories? Do you use stories? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're best when you go in and find  that one picture that just totally  doesn't fit and swap it out for a good one.  You have to tweak it. It's never  perfect the way they do it. But it's  a nice feature. It's really well done.  They give you the maps and the dotted line that goes  across the thing and now you went to Sausalito.  I do like that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I put all my photos on Google  Photos because I'm never going to do what I ought to do which  is make an album.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The thing is since this isn't part of  the social network anymore when are you supposed to  stumble across it? Right.  You have to open the Google Photos app  and find it in there. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Don't you ever do  that? No. Maybe if I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  if I need to do something if I'm looking for a  picture but I never open it to like browse  through old photos. It's not like Plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is dead. Plus is still  there. It's still there. In fact  here's a tip for you folks.  When Google Photos first came out  I was very positive on  it and I've since become more negative  on it. The editing tools are clearly  superior in Google Plus and  they're still there.  If you go into  Google, if you do a Google Plus post, go  in to pick a picture and then you'll have all the editing  tools in there. They have things like  they have  better focusing. You can focus on one  part of the picture and blur the rest and control  that. The tools are, it's everything  the Google Photo  editing tools are  plus more refined  other options as well.  But it's still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's the Google Plus editing tools,  Google Photos editing tools and then Snap Seed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Google's problem.  They do this so  often. They create so much confusion  about what the product is and where it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What they should do is just roll out  Snap Seed everywhere. I think  that's still better than Google Plus  and free so they really have no reason  to withhold it or lock it into an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's exactly right. That is the best tip.  Use Snap Seed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about this YouTube gaming?  Has anybody got the app yet? I haven't gotten it on  Android but supposedly today's the  day. Yeah, I've  had early access.  You've been writing about it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and they had a hands-on thing  a couple months ago.  It's really neat. I mean, it  kind of covers  all of the stuff that Twitch covers but it's  YouTube and there's way more eyeballs  there and YouTube streaming is way  better and  everything  works over HTML5.  There's DVR capabilities so you can  rewind a live stream.  Which I would  have loved to do on Twitch the other day or on  Twit the other day when I heard  about you breaking your pen. Oh, we used to have  that rewind capability. I want to go backwards  and see what happened  because I missed the first part. Yeah, we used to have that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  rewind capability but the new site

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  is a little bit different.  It's cool but  kind of like Facebook, Twitch is  where people are right now  and the people that watch  these video game streams have their  favorite streamers and unless  they want to switch platforms  it's going to be tough for  YouTube gaming to take off so  I guess what they need to do is  pay attention to those people  and try to make the streamers happy so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they'll switch over.  And then there are apps  for Android and iOS.  The apps just let you watch video.  I presume not record it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think  they do. I think that's a future  feature that they're going to have.  They talked about one day streaming, you know,  Candy Crush from your phone.  I think that would be kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Watch me play  Fallout Shelter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The cool  thing about this though is that it's not just  streaming. It's all of YouTube's  video content plus live streaming.  So they made  25,000 game  pages and they kind of  sent their robots to work on YouTube  to categorize all of the  videos on there by game and  by type of content.  So you just go click on  Minecraft and you'll get  all the Minecraft live streams and all the  Minecraft YouTube videos  all on this one page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I may be wrong but I think Minecraft is much better  represented as it is on YouTube  than it is on Twitch.  Twitch tends to be League of Legends, more  hardcore gaming.  Yeah, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you can star games  which is neat so it'll kind of  it helps with discoverability  I guess when you say, you know, I like Hearthstone  it'll show you not only  your favorite streamers but whoever else is playing  and popular videos in that  category and all sorts of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Ron, I talked to  Jeffrey Grubb on Tech News Today  this morning and I asked  him what would stop somebody from using  it as just a live streaming, you know, Meerkat  clone and having nothing  to do with games.  He wasn't sure about the answer. Do you have any idea  if they will ban you if  you just try to do streams that are not related to  gaming content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I mean, YouTube's live  stream thing existed before  this. So you've been able to  to do YouTube live streams  before but they were set up as like  events like you would have to schedule  it and have a calendar entry.  It was set up like for rock concerts.  Basically. And with the  YouTube gaming thing  the streaming part of it  is not actually part of YouTube gaming.  So is this live?  Is this a live video

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we're watching?  This is an ad. After an ad it will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, I mean, okay, so if you go click on the top  right and pick like live stream  or something, is there an option  up there to live stream? It says go live.  So you can go live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do I embed myself in it? It's not using  Flash either. So this must be... See now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you have left YouTube gaming  and you're just on regular  YouTube live streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it says for any reason, by the way, it doesn't have to be gaming.  So they're going to categorize  it at some later date.  Maybe they have an algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a special interface  for games, but as part of it  they totally revamped live streaming.  And anybody can use it, yeah,  for whatever. It's just  a matter of where do these end up  when they're not gaming live streams.  I'm not really sure because nobody  does non-gaming live streams

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  on YouTube. You get a live URL  that you can point people to,  but I don't know where it surfaces. And it's presumably archived

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  under your account, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it would end up on your...  It would probably end up on your channel page.  So if I'm a Let's Play

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  gamer, it doesn't go to my channel page?  It goes somewhere else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, it goes to your channel page, and it  goes to YouTube gaming  under that game category.  Under categorized, I get it.  And it goes in that game under the Let's Play category.  Which it automatically detects  and pulls out. This is almost really a specialized

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  search. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's all kind of like dynamic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's mobile. That's Clash of Clans. So apparently  they have mobile play. Or is this an ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is Clash of Clans. Yeah.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Weird. I would really like to  figure out  how to do this. I want to  just... I want to be the bad  gamer. Like the old  man gamer. What happens  when you... Oh my god, it blew  up! I want to be that guy. See, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that would be very entertaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stop killing me.  So what do I need?  I need a camera.  You'd think I would know how to do this.  I'd have to ask my team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You probably have it in your laptop, right?  Probably could do it. Well,  I had heard somewhere that there would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  software that would automatically  cut you out  and put you in the game and stuff like

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that. Yeah, some people do blue screen  or green screen backgrounds, which looks really neat.  But I thought that this was something YouTube

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  was going to add to the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Leo, you're a streamer.  Are you going to put Twitch on  YouTube Live?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so don't tell anybody, but we're on Twitch  right now. Because  we were on Justin TV. And when Justin TV  folded, we're on Twitch.  And even though Twitch says if it's  non-gaming content, you shouldn't.  But it's been a year.  So we're actually thinking, well, maybe we should  tell people about this because  they don't seem to want to get rid of us. I like it.  I don't mind it. I do like the idea that Google  is using HTML5 and not Flash.  People always say,  well, Leo, you're so against Flash.  Why are your streams in Flash? Well, because  we don't do the streams. You  stream and Bit Gravity does.  We actually do pay for  a non-Flash stream from  Flowsoft for iOS users  because there's no other way you can watch it.  And in fact, I can watch it on my Android  device if I go to twit.tv slash live.  That's an HLS stream because there's no Flash on here.  I would  love to have more options, non-Flash  options out there.  But we did have conversations  early on with YouTube Live and they said, well, if you're going to have  commercials, you can't be on YouTube Live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What? Oh, they want you to use  AdSense. You have to use their commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not your commercials.  So it's a profit deal.  It's a profit deal, eh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So in terms of  competition with Twitch,  Twitch should be scared because  every streamer and  every viewer on Twitch also  uses YouTube. So like streamers  already use YouTube to archive  streams and all that.  So there's definitely  the market is definitely there for YouTube  to capture. They're already going to the site.  They just need to not go back to Twitch.  But Twitch has  apps on like gaming  consoles. Like you can stream directly from  a PS4 or Xbox to Twitch.  And you can  watch on gaming consoles  and all that. Where Twitch is only  from a PC or some  kind of weird box  that somebody makes to, or  I mean, YouTube gaming is only from  a PC or some kind of weird box  onto YouTube. So they  still have a lot of ways to go to get on  all of those different gaming platforms out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So like you say, ultimately, go ahead, Jeff.  There's no

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  subscription services  or ways to pay  streamers money.  Oh, interesting. And Twitch  has all that stuff. So the monetization  options, you kind of either have to use  AdSense or have to go off site  and send people to PayPal  or something. So this is live

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  stream from my Note 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, streaming live content. You should  look into that. That's an interesting concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Viewers will be able to seek back  up to four hours. That's what you were talking about, Ron,  while you're streaming.  This is kind of neat. Optimize for interaction.  Low latency, optimize for less  viewer buffering.  You can actually set the latency.  This is pretty nice. And then for monetization,  you just say, monetize me,  baby.  Well, I'll, I just have to find a game  that I'm really bad at.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Grand Theft Auto. I think we should just watch  Twitch on  Twitch while we're playing a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  game. Yeah. I always  wanted to do a Twitter poker  style, like the  poker TV shows where we're all playing  poker and talking about  tech. I don't want to see  Dvorak play poker. I feel like he'd be an interesting  poker player. Twip. Yeah, he would  be. He'd probably turn the table over a few times,  but  you call that a hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have a couple aces under the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you'd want somebody  who cheated.  Tech stocks took a big hit  this week. No fault of theirs,  but weakness in China. Although Tim  Cook called  Jim Kramer of Mad Money  to reassure him that in fact, no, the iPhone  is selling quite well in China. I guess the feeling  was if China's collapsing, then maybe  the tech companies will suffer  as well.  Google was  down 4%.  I don't know what it's at right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's all come back.  It's all come back. I tweeted  my stock market analysis just  now. Oh, what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The analysis was never mind. It's a visual.  Oh, it's a visual? All right. Let me go to Twitter.  This is why I don't like covering stock

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  market because it's like, OK, it went way down,  then it went way back up, and now  it's like, it's not worth the effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everybody panicked and then realized they were  done for panicking. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.  It was very brief. Turn up  my audio.  And here it is. Jeff's  response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Never met.  No, she's a bad editing job by somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the real question  that's been bandied about this week  is whether Tim Cook's  email to Jim Kramer was a violation  of SEC fair  disclosure regulations. We talked

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  about that. I know you talked a lot about it on TNT on  Tuesday. We talked about it on Macbreak weekly.  The consensus was he didn't give Kramer  any information that had not already been  published by Apple in their

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  advisories. But even if it did,  what's the difference?  Where were they going to find them? Who cares?  They could. They could. They could. They could.  It made a huge difference.  But how much are they going to find them compared to how much  benefit there was for Apple?  Even if there was a...  They could put him in jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they could. Martha Stewart went to  jail.  Why couldn't Tim Cook go to jail for the same thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know Martha Stewart. Martha Stewart's a friend of mine and Tim Cook  is no Martha Stewart. You know Martha Stewart?  No, I don't. It's just how the line goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do. Do you know Martha Stewart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that  meme that went around a couple of years ago  with Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart were cooking  together and the caption was,  one of these is a convicted  felon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they have  some pretty big sticks they can wield.  But if the SEC feels that it was insider  trading. Because Kramer's a  journalist and did immediately  report it on the news.  He's also an Apple investor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but Cook knew he was telling the public when he told Kramer.  Telling the press  is a way to tell the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would be different if he called Jim  and said, just on the QT, Jim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know you're broadcasting live  right now, but don't tell him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kramer also went to him as a reporter, as a journalist,  asking questions. He said, I'm going to be on the Today Show. What would you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like me to say?  Or what would you like me to tell people you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How did Apple do  today? I didn't see. I'm sure everybody's  back. Who cares? There's still argument that  China is trouble for Apple.  That's where their sales growth is coming from.  Well, but see, yeah.  So Apple is up  109.69. And by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  when you get these big 4 and 5% moves  in companies like Google and Apple, you're talking  tens of billions of dollars.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, we always say that, but does it really?  I'm just out of curiosity. It's not like  somebody made that or lost that, right?  I mean, it's like you don't get a check at the end of the  week from Google. Google  sends you a check saying,  or Larry and  Sergey don't get a check saying, hey, here's your $62 billion.  It's just  the market value,  the market cap.  We don't invest because  well, Jeff does, but like  50 bucks worth.  We're not allowed to invest. We don't allow ourselves  to invest. And  we know how foolish it would be.  Meanwhile,  in Germany,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  is taking a picture of food

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  violating the chef's copyright?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love this.  Which I added back in there today, mainly because  Google Maps is now asking you for  your restaurant food photos. But in Germany,  they say that if you take a picture of the chef's food,  the chef owes the  copyright of the vision of the plate.  Some are arguing.  Good Lord. I know. Good Lord. It's another  German story. What the hell? You can't  make these up. You can't resist them.  They're such fun. For carefully

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  arranged food in a famous  restaurant, the cook is  regarded as a creator of a work.  What if it's not carefully arranged food?  You know what? I say America's got to hit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  them back. Every time a German takes a picture of a  Big Mac or an order of fries,  or a coach. And it's a famous restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Ronald

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  McDonald has that copyrighted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have a right to use that food  as you will. If you don't want to eat it, you want to take a picture  of it, that's your right. You paid for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe you just get licensed  the food and don't retain  the copyright.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the new technology way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Even if you're like the most insane  copyright enforcer, this kind of completely  disregards all of that photography  stuff. The photographer  should have a right to copyright too. You have  composition and lighting.  True. And all this other stuff. I mean it's completely  insane. But if we're going to be insane,  go all the way. And they should  have a joint copyright over the picture

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of something. What about modification  of the work? What if you take a bite and then it's like  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Has anybody seen this Google Map  pop up that says,  I see you're eating at a restaurant. Take a picture  of the food.  I don't think we should encourage

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this. No, I  like it. I think it's  more data to know what  the restaurant's like. I like this a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, as an obsessive food  picture taker of.  I think this is great. But what this is  yet, I think the Google angle here  is how bizarre Google's world  of food photography, etc. is.  They got Zagat.  They bought that. They folded  it into Maps. They folded it into Google+.  They started adding their own stuff to it.  Now they don't really pitch it as Zagat.  Now they ripped it out of Google+.  Now it's in Maps and you can upload photos.  And nobody knows how to do  it.  Plus, when you go to a restaurant's listing  or whatever and you see all these photos,  it's going to be another problem where  people are going to be gaming it with more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  PINs. I have lots of beautiful...  When I eat at a nice restaurant, I take pictures of the food.  Yeah.  Oh, golly.  You really know how to use this stuff,  don't you? You're so  good. Look at that. That's a  lovely, lovely meal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I took pictures of my hearing  in  Copenhagen last time, in Stockholm.  This is actually a dessert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  luscious dessert. Does the chef know you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  posting this? Jesse is going to sue me  because I can tell he put a lot  of effort into that. Yeah.  These little gold-plated foods.  I remember when you shot those. Yeah. Yeah, this is at  Madrona Manor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, I remember you took pictures of  Wurst in Germany. They're coming after you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I did. You're right. I've posted German  Wurst pictures.  Can I type  Bratwurst in here?  Look, here's a food spotting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  photo. You can actually type in delicious  food, and it will sort the delicious from the  delicious food. No, you're lying to me now.  It knows. Google knows everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sausages. Type in indigestion memories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sausages. Let's see. No results  for sausages. Well, type in the city.  It was in  Regensburg, I think. You could do

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  food in city,  or food in country. Oh,  you can? Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see. Let's see. Food in Germany.  Try that. In Germany.  See, this is why Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing.  The right to be forgotten.  You know what? I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, did you have your location?  Oh, yeah. There it is.  That's not in Germany. You had bacon in Germany?  I don't think so.  I don't know. That's not even my bacon.  Some stranger's bacon in my  Google feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They saved somebody's bacon, but unfortunately

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is definitely not food.  Well, it is a restaurant. I guess that counts.  It looks German. It is German.  That's not Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But this notification  pop up. Your normal people aren't going to  see it. It's just a test going out  to  called Google Maps local guides.  So like really heavy reviewers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, right. They're like level three  It's like Scientology.  You like rise  in the levels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, it's going out to  some of these people and it's just kind of an experiment  and in the  notification, like right at the  bottom is a feedback link to say, hey,  what do you think of us  asking for your pictures?  Because it's interesting. Usually Google  just kind of takes the data in  the background and now they just kind of pop  up and say, hey, will you please send us this data?  But it's interesting because, you know,  you take a lot of photos and  the assumption is that they all need to be  private. And I guess if I take a picture of food,  it really doesn't need to be private.  So, I mean, if it helps a restaurant  review, I guess it's cool.  It's interesting  though. Brian Krebs, Krebs

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on security digging deep into  the Ashley Madison hack  noticed that he  had received a tweet  after he published his exclusive story  with a link to the cache of data  that had been confidentially shared  with him from the hackers.  A link no one  else knew.  He said initially that tweet startled me because I couldn't find  any of their sites online that were actually  linking to the source code cache.  He began looking through past tweets  of Tadeus  Zu, found a lot  of hacking information, a lot of  guys, apparently a very prolific  tweeter  he thinks that Zu  might actually have something to do with the  impact team. It's a great  story. This is why we love  Brian Krebs, not only a great writer on security,  but he gets in there,  gets down in the trenches  and kind  of starts looking at this stuff.  So he's put together an interesting  story, which I highly recommend reading.  Who hacked Ashley Madison?  He thinks maybe  he might know.  Wow.  Let's take a break.  Come back. Lots more to talk about  with our fine team of  experts. Mike Elgin's here  from Tech News tonight.  And today.  And today. Oh no, I'm sorry, tonight.  Today, tomorrow, forever.  Ron Amario from ours  Tech News.  A year.  Jeff Jarvis from  CUNY.  Yay. Are you studying Spanish,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  aren't you? Yes, I am. How's that going?  37 days into the Pimsleur method.  And it's really pretty amazing.  Nice. You were reading  an article.  Yeah, well, I got a headline. I got much farther, but I'm getting  it. That's a start.  It's amazing.  I'm liking it.

We thank them so much  for their support  of this week in Google.  Was it last week during the show that I  started getting the Android Wear download?  When did I get it? Maybe it was during TwiT.  People were talking about the new Android Wear  1.3. I have the  LG  What do they call this? The Grande?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  G-Watch R.  The Watcher is the Urbane.  Urbane. Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could show you the  Bits Watch Face, which is I think the first one.  Jason, you're going to have to help me out here.  This is interactive, which means  now you can tap the Watch Face.  So I have two, like, here's the  Watch Face. Tap it and it will grow into  a clock, but I can tap the  missed messages and it  will grow into a bigger thing. I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't have the update. So I'm  actually watching you do it and  learning from what you're doing. But how do you  do, is it possible to do the tap  like the normal action  of tapping the Watch Face and having that  pull up the menu, or do you have to swipe for the menu now?  Well, this Watch Face

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is dopey. So...  But there are third party Watch Faces  coming that do some of this stuff. For instance,  I use... I really like this. This is a  weather face and it's already  interactive. It's a little bright. It's hard to see,  but I have the time here. If I tap that,  nothing happens. So that's really cool.  If I... Oh yeah, if I  tap the weather, then I get a full weather  forecast. You can't really see this very well, can you?  You can get the picture.  What's stupid about it is it tells me that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have 12,000 email messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well yeah, you don't want that, but that's because that's a dumb...  So it could be done better. So when I tap  the time here, I actually get my agenda  and there's my calendar. I can scroll  through it. So the idea is...  This is, believe it or not, Apple Watch fans  are saying, what are you talking about?  What's so what? This has never been available  in the past. This idea  of being able to use the watch face as  a call  to something else.  So interactive... Yeah, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Android Wear's biggest problem has been that  Google's been the only company that's  been able to touch the user interface.  And yeah, they made the watch face just like  you click it and the  voice command thing comes up,  or the menu pops up. And this is  the first time that developers have been able to  add buttons and make  different things happen depending on where you touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm sure there are more interactive  faces coming out all the time. The first one you get  is part of the Android Wear app, is that  silly bits thing. But I  actually like this. It's called  Weather Face or something like that.  And you mentioned the LG Watch R. If you  do have that first LG Watch,  the first round one,  it weirdly added  Wi-Fi support. Apparently Wi-Fi support  wasn't in there initially. So  just like the Moto 360, it's  kind of... The radio was in there  but nobody knew about it.  This is called Weather Time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like Weather Face  better. I like Weather Face better, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been called worse.  You see it has now interaction settings.  So I can enable interactions.  I can have a weather icon, calendar icon,  date icon. So you  can't do a whole lot with it. But this  came out right away. So I imagine  there will be soon more interactive faces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does this erode your skepticism about  the category? Not in the least.  I think the category... What do you think?  Does it make it worse? No. Because it's more complex

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and more confusing? No, this isn't bad. The Apple  Watch is really, in my opinion,  is crazy complex. They've got  two buttons, force touch,  different things do different things.  To me, it's...  But it's an attempt to  take a really tiny  device and make it useful.  And that's the same thing with this.  I just feel...  Wearables... I love the idea of wearables.  I've never seen an execution  of wearables from Google Glass to  smartwatches. It makes much sense.  When I said that, I get a lot  of people who email me saying,  like Jorge, who's in our audience  right now, who said, but it's the best fitness  watch I ever had. Yeah, there are some uses.  Certainly use cases. A friend  is a nurse. She's on her feet a lot.  She can't pull her phone out at the hospital,  but she can always check her watch.  So for those people,  smartwatches maybe make some sense.  You know what I'm excited about?  Smart hearing aids. Yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hearables. What? The hearable market, I said.  I feel like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that actually might have some  legs, but again,  I'm not saying that they won't  at some point, but right now,  if you're sitting on the sideline saying, should I  get a wearable, I'd say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unless  you have money burning a hole  in your pocket and you don't know what to do.  The notifications are nice.  The ability  to do texting and messaging with people  from your wrist is nice.  A couple of other things are nice. It's not  a mind blower. It's not like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like I get all that from my phone.  So I'm not sure why I need a second  device to do all that. Would June Tomorrow

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  just stop wearing a wearable?  I don't wear it. I really wear it. I'm wearing it today because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wanted to show you the interaction.  I have my bedside table.  I have an Apple Watch and an Android Wear Watch just sitting  there charging in case I need them.  I wear the Apple Watch for iOS today because we  talk about iOS devices and I wear the  Android Wear Watch when I want to show something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Truthfully, I think  the future of wearables is  multiple wearables. So if you have  something built in your glasses and a wrist watch  and a hearable device,  you'll be the computer at some  point. You'll have a panned personal area network  and stuff. You mentioned hearables. Doppler  Labs Hear Active Listening System,  which I'm sure we've talked about on various  shows. This  is an interesting new category because  it combines multiple features. One of them  is for you to be able to custom tailor  what you hear.  So one of these in this, well the Doppler  itself has a reduce  baby button. So you're on an  airplane, a baby's screaming, you can push a button

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and the baby goes away. I have a friend whose watch  ties to his iPhone. He can have,  it geo-locates so when he walks into  a certain kind of restaurant it changes the  equalization. I'm actually going  to the audiologist tomorrow. I'm hoping that I need  hearing aids because I... Yes, yes.  There's a couple of companies. Starkey  is another company that's really on  the cutting edge of this stuff. Some of these,  it's easy for a hearing aid to measure  your heart rate,  but they may be able to do a lot more.  Again, this is all, again, early  days. This was a kickstarter,  the Bragi Dash.  This isn't a hearing aid, these are Bluetooth  speakers. Although in my opinion,  there's a fine  line between them, right? One of the reasons  I wouldn't mind wearing hearing aids today is  because I could use them as headphones  during the radio show. I could use them  to listen to music. I could, I mean,  this is a whole new game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no question in my mind that hearing  aids are about to become obsolete  because the difference between a  hearable device that's customizable  for a 22-year-old  is the same device that somebody who's  90 is going to need as  a replacement for their hearing aid.  One of these devices is  called the Soundhawk Smart Listening System.  It actually comes with a separate  microphone. You can put the microphone anywhere.  You can put it up on the  stage and then go back and take your seat  and you'll have the best audio  experience of anybody in the building.  I think  that's great. I think it's great too. The other thing  if I can introduce a new word  into the  world of geek lingo,  the word is disappearable.  So I think we're on the verge of having  a category of disappearables where you can't tell  somebody's head. And that's why

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want it. I don't need something on my wrist  or on my glasses.  And I don't need a user interface because these  things are too small to really have a good user interface.  I want something that, well,  and Dr. Mom says anything in your ear can measure  heart rate, body temperature, blood oxygen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  levels. My problem is it won't stay  in my damned ear. Well,  these are molded. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's why I'm going to the audiologist. They're going to make molds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they have surgical screws that will go right into  your ear and they screw right into your bone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So my headset just

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What? There's no room for battery  in those. Like any kind of Bluetooth  headphones you get have like a big  plastic chunk somewhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not anymore. These Bragi's, the battery's  in the Bragi. And I agree with you. That's one of the  issues that has to be solved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're going to last like two hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this takes advantage of  a new Bluetooth  profile.  And it takes advantage of the fact that you have  a fairly powerful computer in your pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has a touch pad on the  hearing device. So  it's like person of interest. You  touch your ear and then look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem  is every time I can't  get it in, I try to push it into the ear,  of course that disconnects the call.  Right. Right.  It pisses me off every damn time. Mine just  broke. Do you have any recommendations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am clear that this is  early. As early as  the watch is, as early as Google Glass  was. But I feel  like, but I do feel like wearables  and maybe multiple wearables. I love  the idea of invisible wearables.  Because I don't want to look  like that guy with that guy.  Here's the killer feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the killer feature for this category.  Essentially what they do is they  record digitally what you hear,  run it through a signal  processor and then spit it out almost  instantaneously, whispering it into your

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ear. Imagine Google Translate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  built into this. Google Translate and  Google Now, Siri, etc. But here's the killer  feature. You can TiVo things.  Somebody said something, you didn't quite catch it,  you can rewind it. What? Eh?  And that'll rewind it. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my father needs that. Eh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I need it all the time. Does it have a microphone, the Proggy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this doesn't.  These are basically Bluetooth  headphones. A company  called Starkey is apparently doing some  work in this area. They're a very  well known hearing aid company.  But they are doing some  very interesting wearable  stuff too. I would imagine that any forward  thinking hearing aid company is going to  be looking at  what these  capabilities could be.  And it just makes sense  that this is in your ear. Anyway, I'm going to see what I  can get. It's not that I'm  completely deaf. I definitely  have some hearing loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does having to wear these things in your entire career,  does that have an impact on your hearing? Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Absolutely. But it's mostly  like anybody my age and your age,  the high end. What? The high end  is gone, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So my phone, a little  more mundane, my phone headset broke.  Any recommendations?  You hated that Motorola thing. I returned the Motorola  thing unopened. The hint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't hate it, but it didn't live up to its  promise. We always like the  electronics. Jawbone has always made  some great stuff.  Who else do I  like? I can't remember.  It's been a while. Nobody wears  I use wired.  Because the wireless, it's always been problems,  right? Yeah. I just, I use wired

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  headphones. Well, you  probably in your car use the car. See, I don't have an old  car, so I use Bluetooth. But you could use

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wired headphones and put in one ear.  Another wire. I believe I got so many

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  wires. And then the microphone instead, just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like on, I wouldn't use the Apple ones. I use  Edimotex. But the microphone's  right there instead of up here, which is  not a great place to put the microphone up by your ear.  It's down on your chest.  Disappearables.es. I'll take a picture of my car.  I'll register it quick. Yeah, I like  that. Yeah. Disappearables.  It's a little too many syllables. Yeah.  Purables.  Invisibles.  I like wired. I think, I think, I bet  you a lot of people who used to use Bluetooth are going,  yeah, let's just use the wired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you saw a little bit of news in the  rundown, the bottom there is that  stumble upon.  I thought they went out of business.  Nope. They got taken over by  a co-founder. Oh.  By Garrett. And  he's returning and is going to fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good, because that was, that's  one of those things that was a classic in its  day. But in 2001,  Garrett founded it.  Yeah, Garrett founded it. So this was  up since we went on the air. It was a product  I was excited about, one that helped  people find content, but boy, the time,  the years left stumble upon  behind.  I wonder what stumble upon  could be today.  Does anybody still?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We still get a good amount of traffic from stumble upon.  Do you really? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're one of these things  that's operating background. They've always  been a big solid driver

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of traffic. By the way, Garrett has some money.  He was a co-founder of Uber.  So he left stumble upon  and created Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will tell you this.  The stumble upon traffic is down  50% from last year.  Good job, stumble upon. Nice job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But still, you don't want to unplug  that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

This may be what TV  looks like coming, going ahead,  including HBO with Sesame  Street, Tribeca, Sesame Street, Hamptons  and True Detective  Levittown.  I don't know, it's too  inside, but I love it.  It's very well done.  That's Rex  Sorgatz. We're just going through a couple  of really quick,  this is kind of sad, Rovio's firing  260 more people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, whoever thinks that a game company  is going to be magic  forever. I mean, I was jealous. Those guys were great.  They were wonderful. Their sweatshirts were amazing. They  were smart, but it's a game.  Same thing for,  I need the airpiece to  tell me what's going on here. What,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Zynga? Yeah, same thing.  One Hit Wonders, OMG Pop,  remember them? Yeah.  Just One Hit Wonders.  But, gosh, I thought Rovio  might make it because everywhere you walk in New York  City, you see Angry Birds hats.  But of course, they're not paying license fees, are they?  Sad, they had 800 employees. They've  now fired 370 of them since

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  800 employees for Angry Birds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, isn't that phenomenal?  That's probably the source of the problem.  The end.  For Angry Birds.  Now they're really angry.  Now they're really mad. Those  piggies, we're going to get them.  Amazon's Fire TV  outsold Apple TV in 2014.  That doesn't even seem possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it doesn't.  Plus, we never know what Amazon sells of anything.  How do we know that? Amazon never reveals  a thing. This is from 9to5Mac. This is from

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Parks Associates. But this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is one of those things where everybody who wanted an Apple  TV got one, and then they never changed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It hasn't been changed in years.  Yeah, that's true. It's a time thing, yeah.  Roku is number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and then Amazon can shove the fire in  everyone's face when they go to buy  whatever on Amazon. If you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to look at actual usage,  the Apple TV would blow away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem with Apple TV is  it's the Apple ecosystem.  I want Amazon, and I want  Google. I wish one device  would do all of those. There is none.  Apple's the only device that does

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  iTunes. But barring that, I'll take the Google one  because that's going to be the most open one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We mentioned SmartThings is coming to  the Echo. That's good news. That means  you'll be able to control your home by talking to  it. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Alexa can hear me all the way from  the bedroom on the other side of the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When Alexa's playing loud music,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  though, can it hear you? Yes, it can hear you.  You can talk to it. You can raise  and lower the volume by talking. But yeah,  it'll be blasting loud music. And I'll  just say, you know, Alexa, give me a five-minute  timer. And I just set off a whole bunch of timers  for everybody who's got Alexa. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't say that word. Yeah,  no, we don't say the A word. You know,  Dvorak spammed everybody on Twitter.  He kept saying all the words  and yelling things like  I'm going to go erase all files.  That's not nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fortunately, that's not a real thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You guys are selling me  on this Amazon Echo thing.  You should get one. And everybody can

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  now, right? They're cheap, too.  Well, they're more expensive than we  bought them. They're worth $150.  Can I get a second one now?  Oh, yeah. Because that was one of the problems.  You could only get one. You have two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin does. My son Kevin has two. I want to have one in the bathroom  now. Yeah.  They can talk to each other.  So you're so lazy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  rather than taking a magazine in to read,  you'll have to read two. You know what you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You say, Echo, give me my news.  And it gives you a news brief.  And you customize it, of course,  as to the news sources you want.  It's $180 now.  Say again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Has it made any funny mistakes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sometimes it just doesn't know what's going on.  Or sometimes it just talks as if somebody  talked to it. It's not that great.  But if you cook,  if you do a lot of cooking,  I got my hands in dough or making  cheese or whatever. You need timers. You need  information. How many tablespoons  in there? You make cheese?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're making cheese? Yeah, we're making cheese.  I saw your wife was making

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  butter earlier. Yeah, butter, cheese, yogurt,  you name it. If it comes out of a cow,  you can just go to the store.  The stuff we make is so much better than what you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  can buy. Actually, homemade butter would be awesome.  You know what? Amira does this really smart.  She doesn't just take cream, which I could do.  Anybody could do. Take heavy cream and whip it  past the whipped cream stage to the butter stage.  She cultures it. She lets it rot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She lets it rot. She ferments it.  And it's even more delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why aren't you opening a restaurant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. You should see.  If you're not following Amira Elgin  on Instagram,  best food pictures ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's my motivation, Jeff?  There is a restaurant and I'm the only customer.  He's the only customer. He gets a seat  at this restaurant.  We live on a farm and we now  sort of have this...  We milk the cow every other day.  And we get all the milk from that.  So we get a gallon and a half of milk.  You have your own cow?  Do you trade magic beans for it?  Magic beans, yes.  It's a giant opportunity.  What happens on the other day, Mike?  The farmers get the milk for their family.  So every other day you get the milk?  How much milk is it? A gallon and a half every other day.  That's why we're making so much cheese.  Anything that reduces the volume...  How do you go with a gallon and a half of cheese?  Oh my God!  I'm telling you, it's a problem.  Bring some in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you opened a restaurant, then you wouldn't have that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I told Lisa we'd bring in some butter.  So we're going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can only imagine how that tastes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what about having an echo on the table there?  Here?  Yeah, there, just asking questions of it.  We did a review of it on Before You Buy.  I don't mean that.  We want to know something, we forget something.  Can you just ask Echo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not that good, is it?  It depends on what?  For pedestrian things, it's perfect.  For any sort of exotic thing,  throw out a curve ball.  But again, it's software upgradeable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Over time, I think it'll be really good.  It upgrades itself, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does.  In fact, we noticed an upgrade for it.  Because what we did was we set a timer,  and then set another timer,  and it'll keep all three timers.  And then you say cancel the timer,  it used to cancel all of them.  Now it says which timer would you like to cancel?  The 10-minute one, the 15-minute one?  So like in a period of a couple weeks  after we started complaining,  maybe it was listening to our complaints,  but it upgraded.  So little by little they're upgrading it.  But again, the thing that's great about this  is not the technology,  it's the fact that it's an appliance  that's a speaker that lets you do stuff  hands-free, and the psychology of it  is what's good about it. And that's it.  It's not the technology, it's not life-changing.  It's the psychology of talking to the room  and making things happen that's so great.  And so surprising that Apple and Google  didn't do this first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samsung SmartThings,  the sponsor,  is also integrated now with Alexa.  Now what I'm really interested in is talking to my  SmartThings stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My son Kevin has it integrated with his  lighting system, so he walks in and says,  Alexa, turn on the lights,  all that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We say Echo here, because  if you say Alexa,  Dr. Mom gets really upset.  Sorry, Dr. Mom.  I gather,  this has been a little bit, I don't know how sensitive  this is or not, but  SmartThings is taking computers for a new  hub, and I don't  know what that means.  The second generation one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We showed that off at CES, I think.  Did they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so it's not a secret.  Yeah, I don't know what the delay has been, though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because I mean, CES was  almost, was what, eight months ago?  Well, but they had just been acquired

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  by Samsung.  So I'm willing to guess  that's what the delay was.  So I'm sure they'll send me a hub,  because they are still a sponsor, but  contains Zigbee and Z-Wave radios.  So I think that's really interesting.  It's the same thing Google, I think, the Google  strategy, although Google does not  support Z-Wave, which I think is a little weird.  No, they don't. They have

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Zigbee and their own stuff,  Weave, and I'm not even going to  get into all the IoT protocols,  but there's a couple in there, yeah.  Right. All right. Time for our

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Picks of the Week before we wrap things up.  Who wants to start? I'll start with you, because  you're our guest, Ron Amadio.  So my thing is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's the Android Developers Backstage Podcast.  So this is a podcast  done by people at Google that work on  Android. It's usually  Chuck Haas and  Tor Norby,  who write  all sorts of code for Android,  and they kind of just wander around  Google and pick somebody from some  part of Android and ask them what  they're building and  kind of go over the code.  They're building and kind of go over  stuff, and it's super,  super technical and geeky  and stuff like that. And they talk about the Android  framework and all that.  But I've  got a ton of information from it.  I will source data  from it for reviews.  There was one where  they talked to somebody from  Android Auto, and there was just tons of information  about how  the car-to-phone protocol works  and all this other stuff. So it's  a really cool podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is at AndroidBackstage.blogspot.com  Yep, BlogSpot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're going all in on that  Google ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is the future of BlogSpot?  I mean, this has just kind of been left

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to hang. What was the social network?  Orkut, how do you pronounce that?  Orkut's gone. Right, it's just  going to sit there and rot. I feel like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google has so many treasures.  Maybe that's the problem. Feedburner.  Feedburner, we all thought was going to go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Never did. I think they forgot it was there.  If they remembered it was there, they would have cancelled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well.  I like BlogSpot. I mean, it seems like there's somewhere you can go with that.  But maybe not.  Why don't you  do one, and then we'll get your number of the week.  Why don't you do one first, Mike Elkin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so I'm  a big hater of Facebook,  and especially its design. And that's one of the things I like about it.  Oh, it's so ugly. It's so ugly.  Hater, that's strong.  That's why I use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think you're not alone. I think everybody  uses it and everybody hates it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there is a Chrome extension  that goes a long way toward fixing  the design. It's called Facebook Flat.  And if you search the Chrome  store, the web store for  Facebook Flat, you'll find it.  And basically what it does is it gives you  a toggle to toggle on, I should  have plugged in here, but  it gives you a toggle to  go back and forth between the  old and busted looking Facebook  and the new cleaner, more modern  Flat look for Facebook.  It gets rid of some of the extraneous  links and details and  visual noise  and gives you something that looks a lot  more pleasant and easier to look at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, this is not hard or bad  to do because it's just really applying new CSS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and again, it gives you a  switch in the upper left hand corner  that lets you toggle back and forth. So anytime  you want to look at the original thing, you just throw that switch  and you're back instantly to the  ugly design.  But you know,  we all have to use Facebook, I think,  we can all admit. It's  not friendly,  it's not anything other than the fact that  the single place where everybody is.  And so this  helps, and I'm enjoying it.  Nice. Facebook Flat.  And so I see your  where is it?  Oh, it's flat.  The switch is the upper left hand corner.  Holy crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was looking for an interface.  It just does it.  So what did it flatten?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you go to the upper left corner, there's a switch  you can see what the difference is.  Yeah, right there. Boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the ugly Facebook.  That's the ugly Facebook.  Oh, this by the way, takes out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ads. Yeah, it takes out ads and it speeds  up the performance as well. It sure is fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, I wonder how many employees  Facebook has and how little  Facebook changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They still like that blue. Let me see if I could find  see how Jeff Jarvis's stream  looks. Yeah.  We're going to flatten your stream on your  on the flat stream. Professor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did stop it a while ago. Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ricky Gervais is he's  there though. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice. Does that look better?  It looks just looks better.  Facebook.  By the way, square video.  Yeah. Well, you know why? So that  people won't bitch at you because you're doing exactly  important. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This whole time of the wide screen  was a temporary aberration.  Sixteen nine

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is dead. It's all  four by four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One by one. I mostly  take square photos these days because who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't know where it's going.  I think it's time for a  number of a week of the week for Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Professor. Sure. So  business insider did one of those  basically means roundups from Glassdoor  of what people make at Facebook. And  the long and short of it is, you know, a dozen  jobs and they all  at least 10 reviews per job  title. What it means is not  as high as I would have thought. They all are low six  very, very low six figures. Hundred ten to  hundred fifty thereabouts.  Really? Good money.  It's fine. But I just want to thought there might have been some kind  of spike or somewhere in Facebook.  Well, these these are the folks who fill  these out. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I feel like that there are people  who don't fill it out because they don't want to  know how much they're making. And this is salary, not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  bonus, not stock, not everything  else. So I don't know how the  what makes me wonder is how what is the mix  in Silicon Valley salaries these  days for companies that have stock  that's still going up, but, you know,  more mature than it was.  I mean, you know, I wonder whether

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, a hundred thousand dollars  is a good pay.  But I don't know. For some reason, we got the impression

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it was much higher. Exactly. Exactly.  That's what I'm saying. So it does kind of bring it back to reality  is that these are good jobs. They're  well-paying jobs. They're fun jobs. They work  hard. And the salaries are good.  But if we had  some idea that they're all stratospheric, that  everybody in Facebook makes gazillions of dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they're still jobs. And it comes with all  the fruit loops you can eat. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can you even buy  a house in the like San Francisco  California? No. Not if you make a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you and your wife have to both  make a hundred. Even then, even

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  then, if you had  you know, I've seen, you know, shacks  in the Valley that are going to three,  four million dollars, right? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep. So this  yeah, so that's kind of surprising. They must  be bonuses that they're not talking about. Oh, there certainly are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Certainly are. Certainly are. Yeah. But all the other reasons  I didn't find a very good number. I was in my  conference. You're better off being a database engineer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  than you are being a designer, for instance.  Database engineer, 141,000.  Not bad.  Technical program manager, 146.  Product manager, 147.  Software engineer,  grade five, 157.  But that's eight to ten years of  experience.  Senior software  engineer. Now, you know what? These are now  getting more like what I'd expect. 160.  Yeah. Yeah. Engineering  manager, 166.  You might be able to rent a room  in a ranch style house in  Campbell for that place.  Where does that go?  I don't know why the housing costs  are so high. Yeah. Oh, man.  All right. I don't I have a  number of different things I can pick, but I think I'm going to show  this one. This is called  UBlock Origin.  And I found out about it yesterday on Security  Now, and Steve Gibson is going to do an entire  show on it next week.  We've talked about ad blockers.  We've talked about plug-in blockers.  This one is the simplest, cleanest  I've ever seen.  It has a big, it's a Chrome  extension. And it came from  an email we got  where the guy said  instead of Chrome OS and all this,  when I have my clients, they need to be safe.  It's really simple. Macintosh,  running Google Chrome,  running UBlock Origin.  That big on-off switch will change  how, let's go to a, what's a site  that's just really loaded with  commercials and  how about the Verge here?  Now, I've got UBlock Origin. Let's turn off  UBlock Origin and  refresh this page just to see  what it looks like. Maybe the Verge isn't as  good an example as it used to be. This isn't  too bad. The front page isn't too bad.  Where's a, I hate to  pick out any of our friends.  Lately, I haven't been able to use Android Central on my  mobile because it's just got so much.  But this doesn't look that bad. But you turn it  on and it just blocks.  Oh, it's on. That's why.  It blocks and it shows you how many  requests have been blocked to third party sites.  Domains are connected.  It has a very advanced  mode.  Not recommended.  But it's pretty impressive.  And very simple.  And boy, I tell you, when it's on, and I've  been using it for a couple of days  and I haven't even really noticed,  when it's on, it speeds up  the load of pages like nobody's business.  And by the way,  I don't know if it was Facebook Flat or  UBlock Origin,  but it was blocking those ads on Facebook.  It might well have been. Now, ad blocking  is controversial.  Because as Renee Richie has pointed out  at iMore.com, that's  what pays for all this great content we  get from this site.  On the other hand, as others have pointed out, you may have  100 megabytes with the downloads from a front  page that takes several minutes.  So,  we'll have more on this on  next Wednesday or Tuesday on security now.  But boy, this was a  simple and fast install on, and  I'm not encouraging people to do ad blocking  by any means. Because it blocks our ads.  Thank you for that.  I know how you feel about it. And me too.  But  unfortunately, it's not merely that  ads are annoying. There's a security  impact with a lot of these ads now.  And a performance. And a big  performance hit.  We've got to do more Google contributor style  stuff. We've got to find ways to make journalism  pay, because I don't want to  block ads. But I  have to admit, Jeff, and you probably agree,  how often  do we click on those ads? Are those ads really  worth anything anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right?  I think we have to reinvent advertising. Yes, different thing.  But in the meantime, this is how we're making money. This is how we're going to support  media. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've had this. Yeah, Steve and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  go back and forth on this, because  yeah.  And I've never blocked ads before.  But I have to say it  does speed things up an awful lot.  Wow.  Anyway,  in the past, I recommended Privacy Badger, another  great tool from the EFF.  This one's interesting. You block origin.  We'll do a whole bit on it. And I  think the debate has to continue about  how we support  online sites  without having them  weigh us down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm the biggest fan of advertising.  Yeah, because you say it's...  It's more...  It's an ethically superior form of monetization  because it's democratizing.  It basically makes things free  for people who couldn't pay  a subscription or whatever. So I like it  for that reason. But the real thing is we need  to... These companies need to  deliver on the promise of contextual advertising.  They harvest all the data and have been doing  it for a long time. And everybody complains about the  data harvesting, but nobody complains about  the fact that we don't get much for it.  The ads aren't particularly contextual.  They're not particularly relevant or specific  to our needs. And they're annoying as hell. And that's the  solution. If the advertisement  was so dead on about  what you want and giving you what you want,  everybody would love it. But that's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the case. So I mention this  as a public service to many  of our viewers who do block ads.  We do have that conversation  regularly on this show  and others about the consequences  of doing that. But I realize  I'm a hypocrite because I skip ads in  the Tivo all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think just flash blocking  is a good compromise.  Where you get rid  of the super crazy, heavy  advertisements and  just kind of do the  tech stuff or the pictures or whatever.  And the flash is a huge security issue.  Yeah.  All of this pays our salaries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've been through this before though, remember?  When X10 and others were doing  pop-unders and pop-ups. And the  browsers built in pop-up blockers.  And because that  was so annoying, they were, you know,  and you could make the same argument, but  those X10 ads are paying  for Windows  magazine or whatever.  But they were so annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should Twitch lead a boycott  of flash? Just get everybody  to stop using to disable it.  We use it.  After we stop using it. I can't not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  use it because our providers  use stream and bitgravity.  Their stream providers are in flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've got to be preparing to move  beyond. Well they are. In fact, if you go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  twit.tv slash live on an Android  phone, which has no flash, it'll  still be Ustream, but it'll be an HLS stream  from the stream. So they're capable of doing  it. I don't know why they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like old Yeller. You know, at some point you've  got to go out there.  Old Yeller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody says go to break.com. That'll break

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  your machine. There you go.  That's a good cipher. I wonder how fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've never, look how fast  that loaded  with uBlock Origin off.  Now let's reload  it.  It's still blocking. Oh no, there they are. Here they come.  They're slowly  arriving.  Filling up the page.  Oh look, I'm on it.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
