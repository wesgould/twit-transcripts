It's time for Twig This Week in Google, the show where we talk about Google, the cloud, Facebook, Twitter, whatever's on our mind.  A lot of media too because Jeff Jarvis is here, Professor of Journalism at CUNY, the City University of New York.  Thank you for coming out for our New Year's Eve party.  Jeff is still beardless, which he did for $20,000.  I am still hairless, which I did for $40,000.  We raised $75,000 for UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund. Isn't that great?  Amazing.  Nice job. That's Gina Tripani from ThinkUp.com.  Hello.  And all about Android. And I have some very sad news.  This is her last twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, my last weekly, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We said come back whenever you want, but I know that the business at ThinkUp has gotten busy, busy, busy, and you just don't have time to do.  She's also leaving all about Android. In fact, you don't have any podcasts, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, I won't be doing any podcasts the first time in like six years.  Yeah, this is just so sad and bittersweet.  But, you know, I started building this company, ThinkUp, and I think we have a shot at making something that is sustainable.  But it's been a weird kind of year. 2014 was hard.  You know, we raised some venture capital and then we figured out that we're a business, but we're not a venture capital business, meaning that, you know, we're not the hockey stick geyser, you know, 10 times, whatever.  We're just a regular business kind of building revenue very slowly.  So we decided, hey, you know what, we're not going to do VC.  We had to lay off a bunch of our team, which is really tough.  I didn't know that. I'm sorry.  Yeah, no, no, it's OK.  I mean, my team was fantastic and everyone was extremely understanding and totally got it.  Everyone landed on their feet and it was a small team to begin with.  But yeah, it was tough.  It was definitely painful.  But, you know, we, Anil, my co-founder and I, you know, really want to give this a go and we want to work on it full time, the two of us together.  And that's what we plan to do in 2015.  And so it's going to be a full time job and a half.  And I've just been trying to be real honest with him and with my family and try to figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have a new baby and I mean, you just moved.  And so there's a lot on your plate.  I completely understand.  And I'm still I'm still bereft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm still very sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff and I had the same reaction the chat room is having right now because they're here for the first time.  I said in capital letters, this is horrible.  Jeff, what did you write? It was great.  I got in fact, I got to read Jeff's tribute to Gina because it was it was you said it.  Of course, you're the wordsmith.  You said it better than either a J.J.  Lisa or I could do you just just quite moving.  Let me write. Let me read it to you.  I am so depressed about this, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wait, this is our email. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If there's anything that would make the show possible, I'd be so happy to keep working with you.  And we have worked out something.  So stay tuned.  Gina's genius is bringing both a technologist perspective and a profoundly ethical view of technology.  And she's the nicest person I know.  These are going to be impossible shoes to fill.  And as we all agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of shoes, I then I then try to push Gina Gina perveracative.  I tried to push that we could do this like a shark tank where Barbara and Lori shift off.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It could be the part time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And your response, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I said I only wish that I could wear heels the way that Lori and Barbara wear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That email thread was quite fun, I must admit.  And Jeff really said it eloquently for Lisa and me both.  There's no way we can replace you.  You have agreed, I'm happy to say, to come back once a month.  Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And thank you for letting me do that.  Because I tell you, the idea of quitting completely cold turkey really freaked me out.  This was such a hard decision.  I mean, we've been through a lot together.  It's been six years, 400 hours once a week.  I mean, I've lived in four different apartments.  I've done this show from two different offices.  From my mother's basement.  I mean, yeah, I had a child.  I mean, yeah, a lot has happened.  We've been together for a long time.  And I really wrestled with it.  And it's just a matter of kind of hours in the day.  And part of it is that I'm primarily a developer.  You guys are embedded in news, right?  It's easy for us.  It's all we think about all week long.  Yeah.  But there have been times, and I'm sure that our listeners have heard it.  There are times when I show up and I'm like, I haven't heard the story.  I just haven't been reading the news.  So it's a little bit more prep time for me.  And it takes my head out of, you know, I get into that coder flow thing.  And I'm just going to have more on my plate this year.  So it was such a hard decision.  But I've so enjoyed my time on the show.  And I am going to be back once a month.  Thank you.  And if I can harass Jason and Ron into having me on the show.  I don't think that'll be hard.  Harass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you kidding me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hopefully I can come out and do it.  Anytime.  Let me ask you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To be honest with me, if you had won the App Arena, would you have stayed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this what we needed to do to keep you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that because I can fix it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I went out strong last night.  And I'll be doing a show, the episode next week.  But yeah, no.  No, it was Ron's turn.  It was all good.  I needed to give Ron a run.  I wanted to give him a run.  And I did.  I took him to the last episode of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At this point, every regular host on all that Android has won a year.  So it's kind of worked out in a strange way.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's nice.  It has.  Well, you really are a huge part of TWIT.  And we won't let you go.  But we will let you have a little more time to yourself.  I understand that.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  You've all been so supportive.  The door's always open.  You know that.  Yeah.  And so Jeff and I will soldier on without her.  We are going to...  We're open to other...  Oh, no!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're open.  We have so many great people who have filled in and have been on the show in the past.  Danny Sullivan, Kevin Marks, Matt Cutts.  In fact, I told Lisa, you know, call Matt and see if he left Google.  Because I could see this is Matt Cutts' new job.  Matthew Ingram.  So many good people have been on this show on a regular basis.  Kevin Toffle, Adam Pash.  So we have certainly plenty of people who will rotate in.  And I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think it's also really important...  I don't want to discuss that, but a female perspective on this in this tech world is so valuable.  Well, that's right.  And so we are going to look for a woman for sure.  But it's... you know, I was racking my brain.  That's what's wrong with technology.  It is so hard.  Gina, you're rare in more ways than one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and the great women in tech are in great demand and there's a lot of competition.  But you made a suggestion.  We're going to call her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm being an unabashed feminist and suggesting lots of problems that I know.  We absolutely need that female perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Keep the names coming.  On all our shows.  I make... you know, Intel announced yesterday that they're going to devote $300 million to improving diversity at Intel,  which is, you know, pretty much white and Asian men.  And they're going to fund scholarships.  They're going to do education.  They're going to create jobs to get African Americans, people of color, but also women in the door there.  And it is something we all need to do so much.  And you have my commitment that throughout all of our shows that we're going to add diversity as much as we can.  And we really try as hard as we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I want to help with that as much as you can.  So if you ever need suggestions, and I will continue to make suggestions for my replacement here, but anytime in any capacity, I want to help with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'd love to have a coder, because that was the other thing you brought here.  That's the other thing, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Real perspective.  Developers' perspective is very valuable.  So we'll, you know, we won't replace you, but we will find some other people to be on the show.  And there will always be a chair or an avatar, as we call these screens.  You're the best. You're the best, Gina.  Thank you.  Now I know how Nick Denton felt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, screw Nick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The heck with Nick.  Getting to the news, and we will do the final changelog.  I don't know if we can do the changelog, Jeff, without Gina.  I think that's her...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We screwed it up every time we tried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We are so bad at that.  So bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you'll find someone who can do the changelog, or you can retire it and do a different segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll figure out some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The chair room is so over-clempt.  They're just like, they're so sad.  I kind of almost feel bad for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You guys are awesome.  This was really hard, but I'm actually glad that we got it out in the open.  And now I'm thinking about all the time we spent together and how great it's been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We love having Gina on.  And by the way, speaking of Matt Cutts, $1,000 from Mr. Matt for our UNICEF donation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We would also say his timing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why? Because he put us over 50.  Yeah.  His 30-day challenge is, can I get a tattoo on Leo's butt?  And he succeeded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazing.  In one click of the PayPal button, or whatever it is.  He did his 30-day challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Matt, I invite you to quit Google.  You're tired there.  Come to work for us, okay?  I'm just telling you.  I'm just saying.  Google did finally weigh in on net neutrality.  Both Google and Microsoft, in fact all the big tech giants, had stayed strangely silent  in the open comment period where the FCC was deciding how do we protect net neutrality.  You remember President Obama suggested Title II regulation.  That's the part of the Telecommunications Act of 1934 that allows the FCC to regulate common carriers.  In 1934, that meant the phone company.  One of the approaches to protecting net neutrality, even the court suggested this in the Verizon versus FCC case,  would be to declare broadband providers common carriers.  Then the FCC would have jurisdiction.  There'd be a lot of rules that maybe we don't want applied to internet providers.  President Obama suggested a legal term called forbearance.  That is, the FCC could selectively enforce Title II.  Google has weighed in.  Finally, with a comment, there was some thought that really the big tech giants were actually lobbying against Title II secretly  through their lobbying, their governmental lobbying arms.  But Google filed a comment and said that if the FCC does treat broadband internet providers like Google Fiber  as telecommunications services, that would be potentially good for Google because Google Fiber would then get access to utility poles  and other essential infrastructure currently owned by the utilities, including other broadband providers.  Really thrilled to have Google make some statement in this regard.  And I'm kind of thrilled because it means Google may even be considering Google Fiber as a business, which we weren't sure.  We thought maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's cool.  Just the statement is a little weird, though.  I mean, is this in support?  I mean, it felt like a little bit of a zinger, like, oh, great, we get access to the poles now.  It felt I wasn't sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a zinger to Comcast.  Like, ne ne ne ne ne.  Like, if this is what we get, then great.  Because Comcast has access to the poles, by the way.  AT&T, Comcast, all these others, they do have access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody on Twitter said if we're at the point of negotiating the rate for access to the poles, then things have changed.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Fiber, which competes against Comcast and AT&T, does not have the right.  And the service has had trouble getting access to some poles as it builds out its fiber optic network to homes.  A lot cheaper to put a wire on a pole than a trench.  It's very expensive to dig.  So it's about a tenth the price of digging trenches.  Reid Hunt, who was chairman of the FCC in the 90s, said pole access is fundamental,  and Google will never be able to make the case for Google Fiber without it.  If Title II gives Google pole access, then it might really rock the world with broadband access.  Please.  Wouldn't everybody, well, maybe not everybody, but wouldn't almost everybody watching want to at least have the choice of Google Fiber?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you know what?  Competition is good.  We believe in competition.  It has had an effect.  Just like T-Mobile just had an effect on AT&T, Google has had an effect on Comcast.  It's good.  It's the American way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  According to this article in the Wall Street Journal's Digits column, Alistair Barr writing,  he quotes a lawyer at the firm, Kelly Dry and Warren, who is also involved, a lobbyist in this.  They are saying, Google is saying to the FCC, if they go the Title II route,  here's a fine point to deal with, regardless of whether they support or oppose the general approach.  This is what you're saying, Gina.  It wasn't exactly you should go Title II.  It was, well, if you do, so he says, Google is covering its bases.  They're merely being pragmatic.  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We like them so much, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  They're very pragmatic.  There's no doubt about that.  They're being pragmatic.  Love to get Google Fiber.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  At least have that option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That'd be fabulous.  Let's see.  Google TV is dead, but we'll save that for the changelog.  Yeah, we can talk about it now or we can save it either way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll chat about that.  Because we've got Android TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't need Google TV.  We've got Android TV.  Yeah, that's the upshot.  Google also lobbying to free up low cost and unused airwaves.  This is the other shoot-a-drop.  They've talked about super Wi-Fi for a long time, and I think that's the other thing they're going to push.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's about 150 megahertz of spectrum at around 3.5 gigahertz, so it's not that low frequency.  But they're saying leave it unregulated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just like 2.4 gigahertz is unregulated.  Look what we got because of the unregulated spectrum at 2.4.  We got Wi-Fi.  We got Sonos.  We got all sorts of interesting things.  3.5 gigahertz is not particularly useful to wireless carriers because it's not good for long distance and it doesn't go through thin air.  It's not good for long distance and it doesn't go through thin air.  It's not good for long distance and it doesn't go through thin air.  It's not particularly useful to wireless carriers because it's not good for long distance and it doesn't go through things.  But it does carry a lot of bandwidth.  So it would be good for perhaps things like local wireless networks in parks and things like that.  So Google is lobbying saying, free the spectrum.  Free it up.  Free the spectrum.  Wireless.  Please release me.  Google has, like all the tech companies, finally realized that if you really want to get anything done, you got to go to Washington.  You got to pay some lawyer with access to Congress critters a lot of money.  And you got to play the game.  You got to play the game.  Windows 8.1 vulnerability.  Microsoft knows about it.  In fact, they've known about it for three months because Google told them.  Microsoft waited.  Google announced it.  They said after 90 days, it's fair game.  Microsoft, I'm sure, would have preferred that Google said nothing.  But Google's point, and I think it's well taken, is if there's a security hole, it's reasonable for us to give the company a time to patch.  But it's also a public's right to know if this hole exists because the company could otherwise just ignore it and attackers could find it.  Now, don't worry so much because Microsoft points out that a bad guy would have to have valid login credentials and be able to log on locally to a targeted machine.  It's not something that could easily be done over the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have weird mixed feelings about this.  On one hand, I totally understand that Google notified Microsoft about this vulnerability, gave them 90 days.  And once the 90 days are up, even though Microsoft didn't issue the patch, announced the bug, published code on how to explain the bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They showed you how to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I sort of get it.  But I also wonder a little bit, like somebody from Google couldn't pick up the phone, call somebody from Microsoft five days before.  And they're like, hey, no, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they may have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It felt like a little bit of a public shaming slap in the wrist PR thing going on here at the at the, you know, at the risk of, you know, opening up users to a vulnerability.  Like, I really can see both sides of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it certainly is true that Google there's no love lost between Google and Microsoft.  They are competing, you know, Microsoft Windows competes kind of with the Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, Microsoft is very aggressive about the users lose, you know, like just because of a corporate spat doesn't mean that that users should be.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think this is a standard security.  I can remember 20 years ago talking well, maybe not 20, 15 years ago talking with Matthew Conover of Woo Woo, which was one of these early security firms.  They'd found a bad bug.  They'd asked Microsoft to patch it endlessly.  And after six months, they finally said, you know what?  The hackers are going to find this.  We've got to tell the world.  And so it's a debate that does go on inside the security community all the time.  What's an appropriate amount of time?  Right.  I think everybody understands you can't sit on it forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's absolutely right.  And it concerns me that Microsoft wasn't able to push a patch.  You know, I mean, it concerns me just from a software perspective.  We talked before, like the measure of good software isn't how many bugs.  It's how the company responds to those bugs, right?  Like how quickly it gets fixed and how well and, you know, that doesn't go well in six months is too long.  And I get it.  I totally get the argument.  But it also feels like why are you putting users at risk to sort of make a point, you know, that Microsoft is slow and didn't fix it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, well, you can blame both Microsoft, Microsoft and ignore it.  Microsoft ignored it for three months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft too slow and Google didn't, you know, Google.  They're going to fix it now.  Oh, yeah, I'm sure that they will.  I'm sure somebody's in trouble at Microsoft for that.  At least I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google's policy to do this has been in place since 2001.  So it's been a while.  In fact, it's kind of a general practice in the security industry.  I know what you're saying, Gina.  It would be a little easier if these two weren't battling each other.  I mean, it seems like they hate each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microsoft published those, you know, the Google Gmail man reading your emails and don't trust Google and, you know, well, and hires lobbying companies to go after them and PR companies go after them stealthily and they're pretty nasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and Google has never made a good version of any of the Google apps for Windows Phone and even even tried to force Microsoft to get rid of the one version of YouTube they had.  The Microsoft did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microsoft, Microsoft hasn't put Skype on Chrome.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're right.  Although I think I think now you can.  Isn't there a Chrome extension?  There is a way to.  Not yet.  No.  Google has been asked to remove 354 million pirate links in 2014.  This is according to Torrent Freak.  That's a lot of infringing links.  Three hundred forty five million.  Not only that, it's an increase of seventy five percent since 2013.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seventy five percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In 2008, Google received only a few dozen takedown notices.  Now it processes more than a million a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, these companies have to be automating these takedown requests, right?  I mean, they're not hiring humans to submit these like they were back in the eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's probably somebody sitting in the Capitol Records building in Los Angeles.  That sole job is to just keep pressing send on that email button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This one and this one.  Send send three hundred forty five million times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The way Torrent Freak came up with his number, Google doesn't do a yearly figure,  but Torrent Freak went through each weekly report, which Google does do, and found.  By the way, this is unique URLs, not merely requests.  Three hundred forty five million, one hundred sixty nine thousand one hundred thirty four unique URLs.  Most takedown requests were sent for the domains for shared dot com.  Just in case you're a pirate and you want to know where to go for shared dot com, rapid gator dot net and uploaded dot net.  Each had more than five million targeted URLs.  UK music industry group BPI is number one.  Sixty million reported links from them from BPI.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does Google? Google sometimes does pull these down, right?  I mean, they aren't they required to by the DMCA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do. I thought they take down most of them. I thought not all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess their relationship with the MPAA went kind of sour because, yeah, you saw the Sony,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the Sony part of the Sony league showed how the MPAA and Sony had been in concert  attacking Google by doing such sleazy things as hiring a former Mississippi State Attorney General to lobby current  Mississippi State Attorney General Jim Hood to sue Google over pirate links.  We do it. Tim, over there. Yeah.  Google says the right combination of price convenience and inventory will do far more to reduce piracy than enforcement can.  I agree with that. Mostly true, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, look, there's always people who are going to go out of their way to not pay, but I think most people I definitely had that shift.  I there was a time when I was acquiring video files in ways that I will not describe in detail.  I mean, I think most people I definitely had that shift.  I was like, I'm just going to pay for it. I'll just stream it. I'm just going to pay. It's easier.  I don't have to deal with all these crazy clients and like we're sites.  I'd rather just pay the four bucks or whatever the heck it is.  Like it's just easier. Like now I do. I pay for I pay for everything.  It's all in the up and up when it's available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know why Game of Thrones is the number one pirated show of 2014 because HBO didn't offer it to you.  Couldn't watch it. It's too hard to get.  So you had to pirate it if they offered it for sale.  I bet you half of those pirated copies would have been sold.  The other question is how many of the pirate copies would that those people have ever spent any money anyway?  You know, are you actually losing right sales?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So how much impact will the new wireless ESPN?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, isn't that a good let's take a break and talk about that.  This is an announcement from CES from Echo Star.  They make the dish network.  They've got a new sling TV, which means you don't have to have a cable TV subscription.  You can use your current Internet to get ESPN, CNN and others.  Sports is a big part of why people have local TV.  Yeah. Cable. Yeah.  Let's take a break. We'll talk about that in just a bit.  Gina Trippani's last show.  Jeff Jarvis is here too.  We're crying. We're babies.  I have a dream.  Not forever and ever.  No, I have a dream. I have a fantasy that, you know, think up is going to take off.  You're going to sell it to some big company, make a billion dollars, and then you're just going to work for free here forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The alternate possibility is that think of fails completely.  And no, no, that's not my dream.  Leo, please hire me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will triple. I will quadruple your fee.  Whatever it takes, we got to make sure Etta is, you know, gets plenty of applesauce.  Does she eat applesauce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She loves applesauce.  Who doesn't?  We even tricked her into liking the non-sweetened stuff.  She's a tree fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  20 bucks a month.  That's not bad.  It's just ESPN. No terrestrial networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not ABC, CBS, NBC.  But Turner, Scripps.  I thought I saw CNN as well in here, but maybe not.  As previously reported by Variety Dish, at some point anticipates being able to offer broadcast programming in a separate premium tier.  So this is kind of like what that area was, but with the cooperation of the content creators.  Starts at $20 per month, and that includes ESPN, TBS, and TNT.  ESPN is the most expensive cable network.  Cable companies know that customers keep their cable TV because of ESPN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but there's also, except for my son's home, Jake's home, no one here watches ESPN.  But I have no choice. You have to have ESPN, and it's the biggest single cost.  I think it's 16 bucks a month to the cable company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a lot. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I would love to go to Alicart. I mean, I wish they'd do amazing things. ESPN is amazing, but I'm not a sports fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'll get the Disney, all three, ESPN, ESPN 2.  Now, remember ESPN is owned by ABC, which is owned by Disney.  So it's also the case you get the Disney Channel and ABC Family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't get like the ABC broadcast.  We also don't get the eighth or ninth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  El Ocho.  There's a whole bunch more.  You'll get Cartoon Network. You will get CNN. I was right.  Now Adult Swim and YouTube stuff from Maker Studios, because Disney owns Maker.  That's interesting.  So this is kind of almost a Disney deal.  There's a kids extra option for five dollars a month that gets you more Disney.  Disney Junior, Disney XD, Boomerang, Baby TV and Duck TV.  You'll be getting those soon, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, this honestly, I mean, my, you know, we moved in the new place.  I was like, I introduced the idea of not getting cable and it was like came to a dead stop because my partner is just a huge sports fan.  She was like, no football. Like I was.  Yeah, same thing. I couldn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lisa would kill me. Yeah.  And there's no way to watch NFL football unless you're a Verizon customer.  Right.  There's no way to watch it otherwise.  And I like to watch, you know, this Sunday, my favorite drunk awards show, The Golden Globes.  I like to watch. There's some live stuff I like to see.  You can only see on network television.  She likes the voice once in a while.  I personally, if I would just watch Downton Abbey all day if I had a choice, but that's because I'm so posh.  You are posh.  You hate Downton Abbey, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, I don't hate it, but I just it's no, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah, I love Downton Abbey. What's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. It's like Glee in costumes.  No, it's not at all likely in any form or fashion.  No, no, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I watch it just for the Dowager's lines.  Yeah. No, she's so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maggie Smith.  Now, you will not get a Sling TV set-top box.  You will be able to use Roku or Fire TV, the Amazon solution, or Google's Nexus player.  Some smart TVs, too, from LG and Samsung will have it.  Xbox One will have it.  And of course, you can do it on your computer and Android and iOS.  Interesting.  I think we're starting to see this shift to IPTV.  It's going to be slow. It's going to be painful.  You know that Comcast and everybody else are going to...  You know why they're doing this right now?  I swear, the Comcast-Time Warner merger has left Comcast a little bit weakened.  They haven't done it yet. They want to get this through, right?  And it's, boy, it's touch and go.  And so Comcast has got to sheath its claws, even though you know they'd love to spank these companies.  Say, well, if you're going to do that, I guess you don't need us, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's great news for you, too, Leo.  It is.  It is.  It means that maybe it means that it'll be easier for people to discover, quit on their devices, on whatever devices that they're using.  You know, last night on All About Android, we had the founder of Haystack TV, which is a mobile app that does personalized video, like news video for you.  So you're like, I'm interested in CES, for example, and I'll show you news clips from various sources in the app.  And it was a great conversation. I highly recommend it.  But what I loved is that the app started basically as a Chromecast app, as a web page that would kind of pick out news clips you'd be interested in and then cast them to your screen.  So it started on Chromecast, became an Android app, and now they're on Android TV, which we'll talk about later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're an aggregator of others' content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  News clip aggregator, right. So like I don't need a cable subscription in order to just to watch the news clips that would matter to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And how do they get the rights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all YouTube.  That's a good question.  It's all YouTube.  So they're basically, yeah, from what he said, they're basically, if it's on YouTube, then they have the ability to play it through their player.  And, you know, news organizations are more and more putting up their individual segments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're going to stop if it costs them money to do this.  And so if people choose this in lieu of paying for a cable subscription, that comes right.  You know, it's kind of hard to understand this, but the money you pay to the cable company for the local channels then goes to the local channels to some degree.  Right. The cable companies are paying the local channels for this.  So if the cable companies can't sell you local packages because you don't need it anymore because you can watch news on YouTube, that's going to impact them, I think.  And I think that's why this whole thing is so rickety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody is shifting business model, right?  It's got to be a shifting business model, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. You know, and this is why it's taken so long for ESPN and others to say, OK, we're going to go over the top.  HBO is a perfect example.  We're going to go over the top.  We're going to become an Internet channel because the cable companies, either it's in their contracts, they can't.  It was with Tech TV.  The contract was very specific.  You cannot put this stuff online.  There were some limitations.  You can only do a certain number of minutes per hour and so forth.  Right.  And I think these these clauses persist in existing contracts.  But also there's the threat that if you do it, well, I guess you don't need us anymore.  And right now, the business model for HBO and CNN and ESPN and everybody else is you've got to be on the cable.  So it's going to I don't know how I don't know, frankly, how they're leveraging this.  I have to think it's because of this time order thing.  The Comcast can't really threaten them.  And they're hoping they can get some.  You're right.  I think they're hoping this can get some critical mass, some momentum up before Comcast, the time order is over.  One way or the other.  Because they're trying to play nice.  Yeah.  They don't dare say anything.  They can't say boo.  Yeah.  All right.  I got I got to ask you about this one.  Gina, you did 23 and me.  I did 23 and me.  So we all have wet ear wax.  I know that.  Yeah, we all I have brown hair, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if you know this about me.  I don't know.  Brown eyes.  We don't we don't know.  But my spit says my hair is brown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I love this idea.  In fact, if you go to 23 and me on the Web, that's they sell this whole idea that, hey, it's great.  You're going to it's a genetic ancestry service.  And for 99 bucks, you spit in a little tube and they tell you kind of weak stuff, frankly, about like I'm 2 percent neanderthal or something.  I mean, silly stuff.  But if but read this page carefully.  Because I'm wondering where it says, oh, and by the way, we're going to sell your genetic information to big companies for tens of millions.  I do believe with permission, I do believe the story says they say and I don't remember them asking me.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll have to go and get permission now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, they have to come back because they look at your first case.  It's Parkinson's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's secure.  If you have Parkinson's, Leo.  Yes.  And if you believe that sharing your data is going to be helpful to try to find a cure for this disease, then you would want to do that.  Right.  And you would absolutely, I think, want to do that.  And the story that I read said that you'll be given the option to.  OK, we'll have to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they haven't done it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because this is going to be this is going to start exactly the kind of techno panic that you start to allude to.  But but it's an example where sharing data could save.  I agree.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I feel like they should be they should have been more clear up front or it should say on the page is one of the features and benefits because paying them ninety nine dollars to share my genetic data for tens of millions of dollars with Pfizer.  Isn't in my mind how the deal was now, if they ask me, we'd like to share your stuff.  It's it's opt in or opt out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or did I already when I signed up with a lot of fine friends, the story I read, the story I read and I can't find it now said they were going to have to go back to three thousand people who have Parkinson's and ask them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's for those.  That's because they want to combine the medical information with the genetic information.  But they are also selling the larger database of genetic information that they have they have gathered.  So that's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, this is anonymized and aggregated or this?  Yeah, I presume it is not the three thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the difference, I think.  I see.  Well, this isn't it's not completely clear.  So I guess we should find out.  I but I saw a lot of people being saying, oh, look, they've said if you ever saw their slide deck for the for their investors, you would know this was the plan all along.  And so I immediately went to the front page of the website expecting something around this, but I didn't see anything.  So I think maybe it was in their slide deck.  But unless you go to those kinds of conferences or you're a venture capitalist, you may not be completely clear.  So this is the first of 10 deals with big biotech companies.  Genentech is going to pay 60 million dollars or up to for access to 23 and these data to study Parkinson's.  Since 23 and me started in 2006, it's convinced 800000 customers, including the three of us, to hand over our DNA one vial of spit at a time.  By the way, they don't do a full analysis of the of the DNA.  They only do small little bits. It's not a full genome you're getting back.  But 23 and me wasn't going to find a big business by selling spit kits at the cut rate of ninety nine dollars.  Well, I don't know about that. They've made 80 million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they started when they started. It was like 250.  They get the more you lower the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Big data has been in 23 and me's DNA from the beginning.  Right, Sarah Zhang in Gizmodo.  She said actually it was founded by Anne Wojcicki, who was was Larry.  I'm sorry, Sergey Brin's wife.  She told the New York Times she watched in the early days of Google.  She watched Larry and Larry would say, I just want the world's data on my laptop.  She said, I felt the same way about health care.  I wanted the world's data accessible.  So that's why I started 23 and me.  But I wasn't this wasn't the sales pitch I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny. So I feel like I'm probably the most pro privacy of the three of us.  But I don't I don't have any problem with this.  In fact, I feel like, you know, I want this is data I want to help, given that it's aggregated and anonymous.  I mean, they're not giving my name and address and Social Security number along with my with my sequence.  Right there. Well, they will in some cases, but they'll ask you for permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they'll ask permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they're asking about my lifestyle and where I live and my background.  And then if I have certain genetic markers and they're going to do research on how those things correlate.  And I mean, that's the best possible use of my data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is ironic because I did I try to sign up for that MIT project where you would very publicly give them your entire genome.  You'd pay for it thousands of dollars and then they would give your information by name to companies who wanted to do genomic research.  And that I was behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you feel duped like you feel like you were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you got to be you got to tell people this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't disagree with that, Leo, but I but I do agree with with Gina that in general, I think it's a good thing.  And the real issue to me when it comes to privacy is not that some pharmaceutical company gets tons of data that they can analyze and get some correlations out of that have value.  I think that's a good thing.  The real question is, could the police get your DNA and use it against you in a way that you don't know?  That's privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but I'm also reading their privacy statement.  They don't mention that they're going to sell your anonymized.  They should say specifically, and we may sell your anonymized data to big pharma.  They don't say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  They should definitely be transparent about it.  They should be in their slot only in their slide deck for sure.  I think because I knew the company's connection to Google, I just assumed that that was part of the business model.  But of course, you know, that's because we do what we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And there should be a big link on the front page and in this privacy to this setting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't logged in to 23andMe in a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does say if you've given consent for your genetic and self-reported information to be used in research, 23andWe,  this is another business, I guess, 23andWe, research as described in the applicable consent document, no link,  we may include such information in the aggregated genetic and self-reported information intended to be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  It doesn't imply that it's their own research arm, 23andWe.  I don't know.  I feel like it was I feel like they should have been a little more upfront.  I agree with you. I mean, there's a huge benefit, societal benefit to this.  But right. But people need to explicitly know what they're doing if they're going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's funny. I think I told you guys that when I did do the 23andMe, it was one of the weirder like user experiences I ever had.  Because I had submitted my spit sample and then I got this email from them that said, oh, you know, you've got this new information has been unlocked.  And then I logged in and it said, hey, we you know, we have now identified this marker for Parkinson's and now we know whether or not you have this marker.  But, you know, this is potentially life changing information and you might want to sit down and get some private.  That's appropriate. By the way, they don't do that anymore.  And I was just like I was totally freaked and like I was in the middle of my workday.  Not at all. Not at all prepared for this. And I clicked on the button and I was like, oh, no, you don't have it.  And I was just like, oh, it was just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Implied that you did. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it was a very bizarre interaction to have with a website like that's an interaction I expect to have with my doctor.  And it was weird. It felt like they'd built up this big reveal when they had nothing to tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Essentially. Anyway, I think that was required.  I remember the FDA went after them and I think they have now stopped.  I think they've stopped giving health information.  OK. OK. I think that was the thing the FDA didn't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the thing with the FDA. The FDA got FDA. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK. OK. Yeah. I had the same experience.  I don't know. This is a very, very long privacy statement. I don't see anything.  They mentioned advertisers, general service providers.  We may share aggregate information with third parties.  Striptease registration information is different from individual data about genotype.  I just think nobody's going to nobody's going to deduce that they're going to sell us for 60 million dollars to Genentech from this information.  OK. Withdraw my consent. You can go to your account settings page.  All right. So let me do that and see if I can do that easily.  Well, I won't do it on the air because I have to sign it. Would you withdraw your consent?  No, you think this is good. Hello. I do. You give them consent.  Yeah. And like I said, I mean, I wanted I never got selected, but Esther Dyson had done this big thing and it was a really cool idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wanted to do it. Wait. So did you so they sent an email. Did they send you an email saying, hey, you want to know they didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK. I'm looking. Privacy consent. I do not want to receive sharing invitation.  See, you get all these invitations from third cousins. I want right.  That's different. Relatives operate basic research consent.  Here it is. So apparently I have given consent to participate in 23 and me scientific research stripped of identifying registering information.  That's the other thing that worries me a little bit is.  That how how much can you anonymize genetic information?  Right. And by the way, they still have my spit.  There's a there's a button that says discard sample not recommended.  I think they want to keep my spit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you imagine that warehouse in the spit warehouse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The spit house. Eight hundred thousand saliva samples. Bricks spit house. I want to see that.  If I withdraw my consent, does the info that they sold get taken back?  No. Anyway, it isn't really learning more about yourself this new year.  It's really more letting genetic learn more about yourself this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But who's going to invent the drugs that are likely to say I agree.  I agree. It ain't going to be you or me or AT&T. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's going to be them. You know what? Everybody should be aware.  That's all. And I wish they were a little more clear because I missed the slide deck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Inevitably, the answer is is is clarity and transparency.  And you cannot make an informed consent if you're not informed. Right.  That's the key. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This really scares me. Remember, the FBI says that, well, we know.  We know that it was South North Korea.  FBI director says those sloppy hackers revealed their IP addresses.  That's how we know. Oh, dear. Oh, my.  Oh, my. Speaking at a Fordham Law School cybersecurity conference on Wednesday.  Yeah. Hackers in the attack failed on multiple occasions to use proxy servers,  revealing the IP addresses that tied them in North Koreans.  They got sloppy. But we saw.  So maybe that's the secret information.  But as everybody knows, this stuff's more complicated than it might appear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This also felt like a PR slap in the face a little bit.  I was trying to try to embarrass the North Koreans. Yeah, they were sloppy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They were sloppy. Yeah. You know who acts Sony.  We know it was North Koreans. We know they were sloppy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They always leave a mess behind and we can identify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless it was sloppy Chinese people who pretended to be North Koreans.  But wait a minute. Verizon is apparently, according to Bloomberg,  approaching AOL for a takeover or a joint venture.  Joint venture, big deal. Takeover, interesting.  Verizon wants to do more video.  And the company isn't having significant acquisition instructions,  according to Verizon chief executive Laurel McAdam.  But there is potential for us to do partnerships.  But I think that would be very interesting if Verizon acquired AOL.  Boy, that would be a sad end to a sad story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would be. I have my doubts about it.  I think this is a bad idea.  I was pretty apoligized for Mims from the Wall Street Journal,  who I think is good at covering technology,  put up a tweet that I thought went over the top and said that Ross Levinson,  the former Yahoo executive who I guess had speculated to him about this,  said he shouldn't be ever able to work in a tech company again.  I thought, geez.  God.  And I finally said to him, there are people who say that about your proprietor in journalism.

Transcript:  So.

Transcript:  Megan J. Smith, former Googler, MIT trained mechanical engineer,  and now the nation's chief technical officer.  Has a BlackBerry and a 2013 Dell laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, wait, Megan has a what? Did you just say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or perhaps in her case, a pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She might have a Chromebook pixel, too. Why not?  Yeah, she might.  Why not?  We've talked before. We talked with Clay Johnson, who founded Blue State Digital,  and the guy who ran Obama's online campaign in 2008.  He said, you don't have any idea how bad it is when you arrive  and you see these clunky old CRT monitors and technology is not, you know, up to date by any means.  It's slow.  You want government to be slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Security. You have security. Oh, right. You do. Right.  Until they tell you they hand you the BlackBerry and the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Then you go, oh, that's slow. That's really slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, it's not one of them new BlackBerry classics. Oh, no.  Nothing like that.  We haven't done the changelog yet, have we?  Let's take a break when we come back. Gina's final changelog.  For a couple of babies. If you shaved your head, we'd both look like babies.

Not just the Chromecast, but the protocol, the Cast protocol.  At CES, Google announced Google Cast for audio,  which will let you play back sound from apps directly to speakers, sound bars, and AV receivers.  Sony, LG, and Denon will be the first to offer Google Cast ready products this spring, Google says.  So it'll be cast in your audio.  That's cool.  I actually already use my Chromecast to cast audio.  I Google Play music, but you know, your TV has to be on, like the screen has to be on.  So this is kind of nice.  Hangouts for iOS is basically that Google's updated it, and it's basically brought it to parity with the Android version.  So Hangouts at iOS now has Google Voice integrations.  You can access SMS and voicemails from your Google Voice account and Hangouts app.  You can quickly share your location.  You can add status messages and access stickers.  Of course.  So that's all on iOS.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have stickers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are stickers in Hangouts.  Yeah.  Hangouts has gotten kind of fun in a weird way.  I texted hooray to someone recently and you know, this little cute little guy.  If you just type hooray, it does it?  Yeah, if you send it to, or if you say like, where are you?  Or if someone texts you, where are you?  There'll be a little button will show up that'll say like, tap here to share your location.  It's gotten really smart.  So it actually kind of analyzes the text of what you're sending or receiving and then will respond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But not on the desktop, only on the smartphone.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why.  Yeah.  Okay.  Let's see.  What else we got here?  Google search results now displays song lyrics right in the one box at the top of the results page.  So if you type in the song title and lyrics, it's kind of hit or miss.  You'll get lyrics if the song is basically in Google Play.  So the results are powered by Google Play.  So if you type, you know, Beastie Boys, Fight for Your Right lyrics, you'll see the song lyrics right there, right there in the results.  I tried a couple of other songs.  I didn't get them.  It really, it's got to be in Google Play, but still kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a question for you.  Wasn't that long ago where lyrics sites were being taken down just as much as download sites because lyrics were copyrighted, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Now we have things like Rap Genius.  Yep.  Is it now, do artists now say what the heck, my lyrics or my promotion, it's okay and nobody's fighting it anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so.  Yeah, I remember when that was, yeah, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was a thing, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was a brief thing and maybe they lost in court.  So what is the search?  You type lyrics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you just type the song title and lyrics.  So if you type like, yeah, okay, try that one.  Because this is, I'm getting this special thing.  Yeah, try Beastie Boys, Fight for Your Right.  That one definitely works.  It's got to be a song in Google Play, so it's a little bit limited, hit or miss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I type in, take me to church, a song I like by the way.  There you go.  I get the video and then I get maps to churches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So maybe I have to type Rolling Stones, Honky Tonk Woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you see what says full lyrics on Google Play at the bottom of the box?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because this one I never could understand the words of, I would really love it if Google, yeah, see, I guess it's not in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it mustn't be in there and then written in their database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  Nobody knows the words.  Nobody would.  Yeah, I think when Tina Turner wanted to record it, she actually had to go to Mick Jagger and say, could you write the words down?  Because I don't.  Could you just jot that down?  What the hell are you saying?  Yeah.  What is that exactly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She should have done like the Google Voice transcription version.  Finally, Google TV, rest in peace.  It's effectively dead.  Google pulled support for the Google TV developer tools, which basically means you can't build apps for Google TV anymore.  It doesn't mean that existing TV, Google TV devices will stop working.  Those will continue to work.  The apps that you have on them will continue to work.  But essentially, the Google TV team is going Android TV.  Android TV is the new hotness.  So, yeah, no more new Google TV apps.  I know we were all on the edges of our seats waiting for new Google TV apps.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I bought many a Google TV.  I have several.  I had the Logitech one.  I think I had the Sony one.  You schmucked you.  What a fool I am.  Man, oh man.  It feels pretty antiquated now.  It feels about as bad as a 2013 Dell laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember just the big pitch for Google TV being like you get the web on your TV.  And I remember being like, yes.  But it was just the implementation that was wrong.  And Chromecast was the right implementation.  It's so lightweight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's so great.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  David Schmidt on Twitter just tweeted me and said, isn't the Pixel itself a 2013 computer?  Oh, it is.  Yeah, like Touche, I said.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot of people in the chat room are mad at me saying, what do you mean a 2013 Dell?  What's wrong with that?  Well, I'm just going to say in most companies, including ours, when a new employee arrives,  they're given a new computer.  Whatever, you know, so it would be, you know, you don't give them somebody else's hand me  down.  It's not antiquated, but it's not normal in business to do that.  Maybe it is.  I don't know.  You're right.  2013 is only two years ago.  I'm showing my snobbery and that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well done, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got my Google Conch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My mournful Conch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just not, it's almost majestic enough, but not quite.  Almost majestic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's me.  Almost majestic.  Almost majestic enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sounds like a bull elephant, mating call of a bull elephant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not good.  I dig the beads.  That's fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a, this is a Vuvuzela from South Africa from the previous World Cup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if a fan brought it, it was actually played in South Africa.  It's not beads.  It's like knit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's knit.  It's knitted.  It is beads, but it's a knit.  It's not made of beads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a knit cover.  Gotcha.  It's like a cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's pretty sweet, huh?  Hey, if you'd come to our New Year's Eve party, I would have let you play the guitar.  If you'd come to our New Year's Eve party, I would have let you play it with the band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh man, next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anything else you want to say before we get to our picks, tips and number, our last tip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh wow, already there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Geez.  Yeah.  How about Evan, Sarah Lacey?  I didn't even know they were fighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Sarah wrote this call and then she got, she got some, some grief for it.  She wrote a piece basically saying that tech guys don't have the courage to be media guys.  Using as an example, Omidyar and Ev, and I forget the other one saying they were conflict  averse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos maybe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bezos, yeah.  And she was, she was comparing, and she was comparing herself to her role model, some  said to her role model, Kate Graham.  Oh please.  Washington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And Walter Cronkite is my role model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so that was, so that was, so she was already getting some, some grief over that.  And then Ev came back, I think with a very, very good response in which he said, you know,  what are you, what are you saying?  I'm, I'm conflict averse or risk averse.  You know, he's, I know Ev risked everything he had to get longer going.  He's risking constantly.  He's changing the world a third time now.  He's doing amazing things.  And you're not going to say what the kicker is, but I'll just say people go to the link  and read the kicker because it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Brilliant.  Yeah, I just read it.  Yeah, it's brilliant.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  I won't spoil it for you.  Just go read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, she said to Ev, F off, right?  And then, yeah, that, oh no, that was her.  That was his response to her.  Okay.  To her.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because, because she said that he doesn't like conflict and his response to that was  F off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then what do I, I'm okay with conflict.  See?  That's what was brilliant about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, there it is.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's so inside baseball and so few people even know who Sarah Lacey and Ev Williams  are.  I know it's true.  It's like, oh, they're fighting.  Oh.  But it's fun for us.  It's fun for us.  We know who they are.  It's fun for us.  And we know the backstory, the incessantly long backstory.  I somewhat, I mean, I'm not going to get into it.  I mean, I feel like Ev, I mean, there is a point taken that he's really not, I mean,  Medium is about as much about journalism as Blogger or Twitter.  Well, that's what he says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what he says too is why are you going after me?  I'm a magazine publisher.  Some of the stuff we publish, we publish ourselves.  Some we don't.  He's gotten crap because One Piece was taken down, but he didn't take it down.  The author took it down.  Right.  Right.  You know, Ev is creating a platform where people can create and say all kinds of things.  You love Medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You publish on Medium, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do a lot.  I'm publishing my entire book, Geeks Bearing Gifts, available now.  Not only to buy, but you can read it chapter by chapter.  I'm still puzzled by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've said this to you many times.  I don't understand why you would give away your content to Ev.  It's distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in this case, my goal is to change the world and brainwash people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  You want to see as many people see as possible.  But Medium isn't like YouTube.  I can see you do it on YouTube because YouTube is where everybody goes.  But really, is Medium like a big publishing platform?  Send it to the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's pretty and it's easy to use.  It's pretty and it's easy to use.  And we'll go there and so I'll use it.  It's a nice tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a great tool.  Yeah.  And there's a certain cache about it, right?  I mean, it has a certain...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ev's very good at that, too.  But it's all to his benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's a businessman.  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's okay.  And this is part of the Stallman piece, too.  This paranoia that occurs if somebody else gets benefit out of something that you do  there.  You know, I remember when...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Richard Stallman, who I love, who created...  Oh, he drives me nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he created good news.  He started amazing things in his career, absolutely amazing things, but he's paranoid.  He was one of the original MIT hackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He wrote Emax.  He's religious.  He's religious about it.  In fact, he doesn't want people to call it Linux.  He says, and won't do an interview with you unless you call it GNU Linux.  He doesn't like unfree software.  He says all software should be free, as in Libre.  And he says, don't use Uber because it uses a non-free app program, an app, and it requires  the use of other non-free software.  It lets Big Brother track you.  Well, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Non-free programs trample users.  That's a top reason for not using Uber?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's because it uses an app, which is a non-free program, and a non-free program tramples its  users' freedom.  But I understand Richard's philosophy.  He is a purist.  Oh, boy.  But there's no...  I mean, it's just not practical in the real world to only use Libre software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stallman has to exist.  I'm glad that he exists.  I am too.  Right?  Yes, yes, yes.  He sets an extreme bar, right?  And then you can...  And he asks questions, maybe, that no one else...  I think it's important to have kind of the radicals in the world.  And he's one of them.  And I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He does, by the way, in the remainder of the article, talk about all the other completely  legitimate and good reasons you shouldn't use Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Listen, there's plenty of ways you can complain about Uber and think it's an awful company  and does some bad things.  I have no problem with that.  But the rationale behind this, if it's free, it's bad routine, if you're the product, I'm  just tired of the can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Neil also hates that line.  He's not paying.  You're the product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to miss this.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm always in favor of open versus proprietary.  But it doesn't...  I'm not religious about it.  Which he is.  Which is fine.  I don't...  I think he's right.  Remember, he comes from the earliest days of computer hackery, where if you needed a program,  you wrote it yourself.  It would be rude to not let others take your program, modify it for their own use, that  kind of thing.  And that's all he's saying.  And that comes from that.  I think that in many ways, it's like Marxism.  It's a little bit ideological, but I understand what he's saying.  Maybe more on his side than not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you just do that to be contrary.  Hairless among the hairy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He is very hairy and he plays a mean recorder.  And we got him on the screensavers to sing the open source anthem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, by the way, you know, some time ago, I really wanted Barlow to come on and do a dramatic  reading of his.  And he...  No, he wouldn't do it.  He wouldn't do it.  I asked him to do it.  He wouldn't do it.  Now he's done it.  Have you seen that?  No.  He's done a great reading.  I don't think it was quite the...  I would have given it, of his Declaration of Independence for cyberspace.  And you can buy it as a limited edition vinyl disc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope he says inspired by Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm sure I was one of many who asked him to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I probably is a proprietary.  I can't play it.  No, not with him.  Well, I maybe have to pay for it and give money to the EFF.  I love John Perry Barlow.  We, you know, when he was on triangulation, I mentioned that and he said, I don't even  believe in it anymore.  He said, I wrote that a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Search for JP Barlow Declaration of Independence vinyl and you'll find it on Boing Boing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Vinyl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that funny?  Isn't it funny too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I had to go buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a limited edition vinyl.  He wrote it in 1996.  It's 180 gram vinyl edition from the Department of Records.  Black on black sleeve with an embossed title.  A high quality printing of the declaration inside.  The B-side sports aversion backed by an original score from Drozgen Bozhenak.  Jack.  Wow.  But it is, you're right, free CC licensed downloads.  Of course.  Of course.  Of the industrial world, you weary giants of flesh and steel.  I come from cyberspace.  It does sound outdated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, but I love it.  We'll play just a few seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Should I?  If I can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is the audio on here?  Go to the link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.  Scroll down.  Let's see here.  All right.  Track one.  Ladies and gentlemen, we give you John Perry Barlow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A declaration of the independence of cyberspace.  Governments of the industrial world, you weary giants of flesh and steel.  I come from cyberspace.  The new home of mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a little like hearing Ezra Pound read his poetry.  It just takes a little of the wind out of the sails.  Some people are better.  He's unreasonable.  He's supposed to be mad.  Yeah, I'm here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is 1996.  It's a great piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I still think.  You are not welcome among us.  You have no sovereignty where we gather.  We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wish this were true.  Let me play it with the music.  Let's see how that sounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Governments of the industrial world, you weary giants of flesh and steel.  I come from cyberspace.  The new home of mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure there'll be a YouTube video soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, Jeff, this was your idea.  A declaration of the independence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, I was hardly the only one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Departmentofrecords.co, that's who made it.  And I guess this is the first of many from the Department of Records.  I think we should buy it.  I'm going to buy it.  How much is it?  You can get it in flak, MP3, or for 50 bucks you can get it in plastic.  And then all you need is a turntable.  Turntable, that's the problem.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the worst time I've ever had in my life.  Because I have to say goodbye, temporary goodbye to Gina Trepenny.  She'll be back every month though, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll check in on you too.  And you will see others on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a chance for us to get many of the other hosts that we've had  filling in the past on a regular basis.  And I think we're going to find a woman of color who is a computer  programmer and an Android lover to replace you.  That's my goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can do it.  It's at the bar that high.  That's at the bar high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, Gina, you're the best.  You really are.  People, please, let's keep Gina gainfully employed by going to  thinkup.com and subscribing.  It is awesome.  Five bucks a month.  There is a free trial.  The insights you get will be amazing.  I'll show you my insights.  Jeff and I are subscribers.  Oops, I went to the wrong page.  And we love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It attracts my F words religiously.  Beautifully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see.  Kashmir Hill has changed her bio.  I got three interesting new followers, including somebody  named Jupiter in velvet.  Now the head shaver got some big favorites this week.  Big favorites.  19% of my status updates contained the word I mean mine.  That's not bad.  I am not as bad as people think.  My most popular tweet two years ago, what happens in Vegas  city badge on Foursquare?  Those were the days.  Remember that?  100 replies on my bald passport picture.  And Steve, you can thank me for generating more than a half a  million more people seeing your tweet.  So this is fun.  This is what you get.  Thinkup.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you so much for talking about Think Up and being so  supportive.  You and Jeff and Jason, Ron on all that Android.  I really appreciate it.  And yeah, I don't know.  We'll see what happens.  It's a lot of fun.  You'll be back.  You'll be back.  Thank you for six amazing years of talking about Google.  It's been such a pleasure and a privilege to have this time  with you all every week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I've always been such a fan.  And I remember when Merlin Mann said, I want to do a  productivity show with Gina Trapani.  And we called you.  And from then on, it's been nothing but a romance.  And so you're the greatest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina, I can't tell you how much I've learned from you and  how delighted I am to be near you.  And we're going to make sure you get rich so you  retire right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  That's my fantasy.  Verizon comes along, buys it for $100 million, and you  spend the rest of your life doing podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's not my main goal, but I'll take it.  As a side effect, I'll take it.  Yeah, I wouldn't turn that down.  Well, thank you.  Thank you again for everything.  And I've learned so much about broadcasting and about  watching, especially you, Leo, and especially Jason, two of  you are such consummate professionals and you're so  good at what you do.  You're such incredible experts.  It's been six years and I still trip over my own words  and have a hard time forming a complete sentence.  It's been incredible.  And I'm really glad that I'll be back in a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, we'll make sure of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll be in touch with Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got your email and your number, actually.  We know how to.  We know how to find you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we'll just skip the tip and the number and just make,  because I think this is the way to end the show.  Yeah, I think so.  Thank you, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or Gina.  Gina, you could shave your hair now if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your hair, I wanted to say this, but then I thought,  oh, it would be sexist and wrong.  Your hair looks great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does look great today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, thank you very much.  I'll take a hair compliment any day.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I just really wanted to thank the chat room for,  I mean, just all the love I am getting today.  Thank you so much.  My head isn't going to fit into the Skype box.  If you guys keep going.  This is incredible.  And thank you to the chat room.  Chat room scared me at first in the first year,  but after that, it was a love affair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you going to continue to post at scribbling.net?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I am.  I am.  I sure am.  In fact, I did a post about wrapping up here.  And yeah, I'm going to try to be writing a little bit more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're going to want some self-expression  and more than just a PHP.  You need a little more than just a little C code,  a little Java here and there.  You got to use prose, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Good.  It's true.  I love that picture.  I love that picture too.  I hope, I mean, I included that picture because I just,  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, we're looking more like those guys.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I like the Miss Piggy version too.  Yeah, that's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, Gina, all the best.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Jeff, you'll be back next week, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you should play Gina off with the trumpets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should never quit the show, Jeff, or I'll plots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm just afraid that our ratings  are not going to go down to zero  because we're already watching for Gina.  Could happen, right, boss?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sad elephant trombone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're nice.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See you later, Gina.  See you everybody.  Thanks for joining us.  We'll see you next week.  This week in Google.
