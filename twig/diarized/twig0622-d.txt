Transcript:  This is Twig this week in Google episode  622 recorded Wednesday July 28th 2021  rocket to Hawaii  This week in Google is brought to you by Wealthfront to get your first  $5,000 managed for free for life go to Wealthfront.com slash twig and start growing your savings today  It's time for twig this week in glutes, I mean Google  We will not be speaking about glutes today on the show. No we already have we got it out of our system earlier  So this is a little bit of an odd  Situation Jeff Jarvis is on the road and then Stacey called in sick  And so Jason Howell has very kindly consented to fill in hello  Nice to have you a host of all about Android and of course the show's producer  Aunt Pruitt is here. Thank goodness in his Clemson orange. Good to see you  Hello, sir. Nice to have you here and joining us from Yorkshire in the UK Kevin Marks our favorite Yorkshireman

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't sound like a Yorkshireman  Yeah, I wouldn't claim to be Yorkshireman, especially in pubs here. Yes, but there he is on the moors adopted Yorkshireman

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah adopted. That's perfect. That's perfect. You must be happy to see your former company  alphabet  aka Google nay Google  is crushing  The q2 earnings are out and they beat the estimates soundly  Which of course the stock market  responded by selling them off  So I don't I don't understand anything about the stock market  revenues of  61.9 billion dollars in the quarter ending June 30th a net income of 18 and a half billion dollars at six billion dollars a month  One and a half billion dollars a week. That is a lot of money a day. I'm not gonna do the math. It's very very successful  Yeah  Top-line growth of 62% net income expansion get this of a hundred sixty six percent  Now part of that is because q2 last year was not very good was looking like  When kovat first hit right? Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But did Google do particularly bad when all that happens?  I don't think so. I hope they didn't yeah, so it's easy to point to that but they were totally fine last year

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of people were out of work and lost a lot of money last year  But big tech and a lot of these people indeed stock market. They were just fine. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, look at that  Yeah, initially shares went up just a tad but today they've declined pretty precipitously  Yikes  It's just you know, I don't know what the stock market has to do with anything. That's that's always been my contention  It's some sort of strange machine YouTube revenue seven billion dollars that's up 84% year over year  But by the way  advertising digital advertising was a big winner across the board both Facebook and Google and  really really huge growth in digital advertising to the point where I  Think the television networks are gonna be start being a little bit nervous about this. I think the YouTube revenue

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Being so high it makes a lot of sense from like Q3 and Q2 enough from last year to now with a lot of people going  and ho-ha going doing their own content and or  Putting more into their current YouTube channel just to grow it because they felt like you know what? I'm here  I'm home  I have control over this and I can make a go of it and Nick and I'm not just saying just regular  Small creators or whatever but brands are saying, you know, let's put more into it as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  digital advertising  Let me see if I can find the increase in Google was a he was a big increase in its  credited with the success that Google had in this quarter chief financial officer the  Famous Ruth Porat or I almost said infamous Ruth Porat said our strong second quarter revenues  reflect elevated consumer online activity and broad based strength in  Advertiser spend of course, I think that spend was down last a year ago. Yeah because of covid  so  Google is benefiting Cornets under Pichai from a rising tide of consumer and enterprise demand and speaking of enterprise  Google Cloud had revenue of 4.6 billion up 54%  Year over year. That's a little bit more actually than Microsoft had for Azure and and and Microsoft had an excellent year  for Azure  On other bets

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is where things go the other direction, yeah, but are they ever

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much how wide is that it's always supported by the search and ad sales search and search and ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Search for business. They did amazing. Yeah, the other stuff that they're used to losing on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So revenue on other bets up losses up  Alphabet  Skunkworks posted 192 million in revenue up from 148 million, but the  the losses  Mounted as well one point four billion. Okay. So let me just put that in perspective  They may they revenue is 192 million. They lost  1.4 billion  That's a lot more if my math is right, I think that math works out  Yeah, yeah, and that's up from 1.1 billion  your other bets is  All the other stuff  right  Android I'm sure had a good quarter. They don't break that out Android and Kreml and things like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's it's it's it is things that are supposed to be speculative is verily and yeah, just the hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does the hardware division fall into other bets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's interesting. They're their pixel line probably not that's a more line of business thing. Yeah, I would I would hope so. Yeah  Other bets is the thing Google kills. Yeah  Project Loon certainly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  experimental things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Access calico. What is Calico? Google ventures their venture arm is considered other bets  Nest is Waymo is obviously their self-driving thing. Yeah, Google X

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm surprised Google ventures Google capital. Is that other bits now? No, that's closed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh  Now that's closed probably not is it gone is GV gone. No, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I mean if it's fib it's been  Acquisition. Oh you talk about it  Well payment to that will have counted as another bit. I see

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, that makes sense  So the things like Calico  Verily Waymo and the X  X projects those make sense as kind of likes very highly speculative R&D  And then the other losses come from investments that haven't yet paid off  I'm surprised nest is in other bets. I think I believe now it's actually out of it. Okay, they move it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, yeah, I think yeah  Last February, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  McConaughey jigsaw Chronicle and nest jigsaw lost their other bet status is Waymo considered other bets because there's no Waymo car  For it's no way Mo money

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is Waymo money losing  Waymo has been a little bit of a disappointment. Remember they brought in a big shot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Said they were gonna buy 100. They were trying I give them credit. They were trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, is it just harder to do than they thought it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe but Tesla seems to be fine with its initiatives

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  GM's cruise is starting to drive around San Francisco, although I have to say what if you ever see one of these  Do you like avoid them? Like if you see one of the self-driving vehicles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, if I ever see them I usually just sort of stop what I'm doing and just marvel at it because it's it's interesting tech  Yeah, right. Yeah, I probably should run

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wasn't that what happened when the when the bus when one hit a bus or something? Yeah, but that was good news

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  according to Google  The engineers said well  That was a tricky situation because if the bus had been merely a passenger vehicle  The Waymo made an assumption that would slow down for it as it re-entered traffic because it was stopped by the construction sign  And so it had to re-enter traffic and it and the engineer said now we know if a bus is coming  Don't assume they're gonna give way  And so we've learned something here was a it was a minor fender bender wasn't like a horrific

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought it was more that the buses were used to like the Google  We've got out of their way and they changed the code so it didn't I mean it's unfortunate. Yes, they updated the code

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not it's exactly what they do unit testing involved a fender bender though. Is there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tesla's ones have done I think yeah, you don't want to burst into flame. There was three years  People those things are  Crashing to the divider on 85. Yeah, that was sad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they hired a guy named John Krafchick was very well known in the industry and he quit  Because Waymo just wasn't I think I'm reading between the lines moving as fast as  They had been planning to move. He joined the company. Okay  Well, we had the stats I had a story

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The car was the car hit the bus in 2016

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  18 miles an hour if I'm not mistaken flashback. That's pretty fast. That's still pretty fast. Yeah  Krafchick came from Hyundai Motors and  They really wanted to they want to make still I think Waymo be a taxi system basically  And you can take Waymo's there's a guy post on YouTube all the time with his that's right Waymo rides in Arizona Phoenix

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know got in San Francisco and few other areas  Yeah, we don't see him here so we definitely don't see him in pedal. Yeah, I get a sworn

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've always saw Waymo cars at CES downtown. Oh, yes downtown Vegas. You bet. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. Anyway a good a good quarter a quarter to be proud of  For alphabet mm-hmm dollar dollar bills. Mm-hmm. What is so Jason? You're the all-about Android guy sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Off for two consecutive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Android and and and the pixels I mean, I guess they don't make money on the pixel phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really doesn't seem like Google's raking in the dough when it comes to their pixel hardware  Yeah, we had this conversation not too long ago on the show  Can't remember if it was TNW or all about Android just trying to really understand like it does Google care  that their hardware division is  I mean it has its enthusiast fan base. Yeah, I would consider myself kind of in that camp  I'm always looking forward to a new pixel phone  It's the phone that I tend to be drawn towards right but has no real pull from a wide  Perspective when compared to a lot of the other manufacturers out there  Does Google really care that much about that aspect or are they more sold on the fact that they're creating an open platform?  That they want all competitors to to put in the right in and yeah the pixel may we always thought was a  Reference design as opposed to a business. Yeah, you know versus the Apple approach which the Apple approach is very you know everything  We want everything is just as important as everything else and it all works together and everything Google  It really doesn't feel like they care about that same kind of equity of their products when it comes to their pixel hardware  Again, so if it loses money like is that really the end of the world?  Is that what Google even expected to begin with you know that that the pixel was gonna light the world on fire for a company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That their business is data you would think they would put more effort into a piece of hardware that can get more data like right now  You know well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but does the data that comes off of their own hardware matter more than the data that comes from all of and of the Android hardware  That's that's running no software. No. I would say no you know what I mean like they get just as valuable information  Yeah, if not more valuable because they just provided the platform everybody else is doing all the expensive  You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pachai did talk about it in the analyst call today  He said the Google pixel event is expected to happen sometime in the fall. Thanks for the revelation  He also said  You talked about Android 12 the personalization features which are really the big new features in Android 12 yes the new privacy features  I'll talk about that in the changelog  They actually have kind of attempted to reach parity with what Apple's doing with their privacy features with the App Store  And then transitioned into the fall hardware event where he said quote Google will showcase  Android 12 and deep technology  investments  Yes, that's probably Whitechapel Whitechapel. That's the new chip

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For the pixel 6 yeah exactly the Google the the in-house kind of chip Google  Taking more of the the SOC into their own hands good. Are they were they making that weird?  Yeah, right off the top my head. I can't recall. I have fuzzy brain. It's not just them  I can't remember if it's Samsung and in Google or who it is, but they are making it in conjunction with somebody else  Five nanometer actually wouldn't be surprised if it's Sam's arm obviously has the Mali graphics

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Engine in it. It's like in it. It's like an Exynos kind of yes. Yeah, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right, which which further kind of illustrates. Just how cozy Google has become with Samsung in in recent months  Yeah, we also have where OS 3 which you know Samsung's gonna have their event  Next month the impact event and that's gonna be kind of the official they have kind of made it just to made up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it ties in we're gonna merge that with where  Yeah, yeah, they kind of have kissed him in up. They should big for a long time Amazon  I mean Samsung would not even say though the a word in now. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if I still don't know if they do or if they will at a fact, but you know, yeah, it's true  They really have not mentioned the word, you know of Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm excited about the pixel 6 the rumors are besides this new chip the Whitechapel chip  It's gonna have a new camera system, which they did not do in the pixel 5 which was a real disappointment  It's why I didn't buy a pixel 5. I thought makes no sense. I already have that chip. I have the pixel 4. Yep  I think I'm probably not alone in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know Google has rested on its laurels as far as its camera system has been concerned  It's been a very dependable camera system in the pixel devices year after year  But it's been the same one from the from the beginning when they first put out there  I think it was the pixel 2 that had the amazing camera and this is the same camera ever since and so  You know, everybody else is throwing a lot more into their camera systems. It's time for Google to step up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's past time actually for Google. Yeah, but they were put in more effort into their AI though. Yeah  Definitely works wonders for those phones  There's a lot of times you take a shot with a pixel phone and you can tell oh a pixel shot  It's not just some totally totally agree. I just gets it right. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google actually is attempting to  Fix its cloud  Product here's an article from Ron Amadeo in the hey  Technicola call

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  friend of our

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Choke ours  Technica Google Cloud offers a model for fixing Google's product-killing reputation  they've announced that they're going to  Go a minimum of one you give a minimum of one year notice if they have to change the API in cloud  Of course, this comes, you know from the history of Google saying, you know  That new thing you like so much. Yeah, we're not gonna not so much. We're not been fairly good at API deprecations

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's more like product stuff that they blow up. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google says to make sure we follow those tenants the one-year  API any change we introduced to an API is reviewed by a  centralized board of product and engineering leads and follows a rigorous product lifecycle  Evaluation. Yeah, you don't want to put your eggs in an infrastructure basket that's gonna change  Yeah, too quickly  Protocol  Reports that Google Vice President Kripa Krishna was asked during the announcement if she's familiar with a killed by Google website  Good question  Of course they are protocol says Christian couldn't help but laugh and she said well  It's pretty apparent to us from many sources on the internet that we were not doing well, so they're aware of it  Good. I yeah, you're right though Kevin, you know saying oh, we're not gonna deprecate an API for a whole year  It's exactly it. It's doing a great if you're actually relying on it around trip, you know or a new a  New way of doing things well, and it's nothing new

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean from either from the developer side of things or from the consumer side of things at this point if you follow Google  And you have any sort of affinity to Google's products  whatsoever in the last however many years you've you probably had at least one situation, but likely more where a  product that you once thought Google was truly sold on suddenly  Goes away or is suddenly announced to be dead and at this point it's it's a meme in and of itself like any time  There is a new product coming from Google a major product for anyone to get excited about it's always  You know dampened with the wet blanket of well that is as long as Google cares about it doesn't kill it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody starts their little sin was it?  How long is this gonna last here we go, you know, and and so it's a meme

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People get worked up about it and like oh, yeah, you know  Don't need to worry about that  But we actually do because there are many examples of it at this point  It's hard to trust Google when it says it cares about something  Yeah, because it very quickly does not but Google isn't the only company to not care about his products and to find  Find out that it needs to move on from things. So why does Google take the heat on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is I would assume Google is more prolific with announcing well at least that one one point in time  They were announcing different apps and services  Pretty regularly. I didn't hear about Twitter announcing fleets and then announcing this and then announcing that I just heard him announcing fleets  And then killing it and then killing you know  But I mean but Google it was alo and then it was chats and then it was hangouts and it's not chats  And then it was voice and then it was you know, they pretty prolific with the things that they release  But again that goes back to my theory of they had pretty crap-tastic  Product management where it's just everything is so scatterbrained and all over the place and I think someone in a higher up  Needs to you know, get everybody a little bit more focused or you don't have to have these meetings of okay  We need to go ahead and kill this app, you know and and replace it with some of the features

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take some of the best features and put it over here, but not for a couple of years. So, you know  It's just right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it is  I mean  I think part of it is is Google what by design was supposed to make it easier to launch things because they're worried about  Startups competing with them  But that also meant that then they would kill them when they when they died  You don't care so much when some startup fails and dies  But Google's true by default gets millions of users on day one. So yeah  Yeah, and that yeah and the messaging thing is just been chaos forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get the sense. This was kind of Larry Page and  In the early days and maybe Eric Schmidt had something to do with but I get the feeling was more of Sergey and Larry's  Idea of we don't want to be a big company. We want to be a collection of nimble fast-moving startups  right  But at a certain point those startups need to talk to each other  But now that Larry and Sergey and Eric are gone and maybe it's time to start to  It's hard. I understand. It's hard, you know, you don't want to become hidebound. You don't want to be  A big corporation where you know, and I know Kevin you've worked for big big companies where things move  Like molasses that's true and and nothing gets done because of you know fear and  Caution and you want to be nimble, but that's the risk that then you then you make a lot of products that don't don't make it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure Google is not the only people guilty of this  But these departments are so siloed and they never ever talk to one another again. I think that was intentional

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they really wanted which doesn't talk to each other. It's more that the culture was we'll have lots of products. Whereas Apple  Does try lots of things out, but they tend to do it before they launch it  And partly that's the sort of historic thing and in private by the way. Yeah, that's that's fair a lot of a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Regular people assume that Google is putting products out for the consumer to beta test it instead of doing their own  Beta testing mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They will dog feed it first no dry stuff out internally and then then they'll push something out to consumers  But yeah, but there is there's there's there's definitely more chaos involved  And it's but it's partly because web things are easier to sort of launch and kill and there's not as much ramp hours, right?  Hardware, it's just software culture is very much. We're launching hardware  We're doing one big release a year and you can decide which things go into that release and that becomes the you know  So the next iOS version will have a bunch of stuff in it and then I'll deprecate a bunch of stuff and  We'll miss some of it, but it'll be mostly be talking about the hardware features, and we won't necessarily notice that  You know I'm sure what they're gonna kill this time, but you know this stuff comes and goes up there as well sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting because in a way Google's becoming more of a hardware company  With the acquisition of nest and Fitbit and the pixel and Apple's becoming more of a software company  They've seen that the future for Apple  You know once they saturate the iPhone market is services service and so both companies wanted want to do both  There was this actually segues into an article that this is a little more  Philosophical, but I thought would be very interesting to talk about I don't know if you've been following the news out of China  But it started with Jack Ma and aunt the Alibaba  richest guy in China China slapped him down at one point he disappeared  And really they've kind of they canceled the IPO. They've kind of dismantled the ant  financial  Now they're going after DD which is the uber of China and Tencent which is China's biggest social media company  I read a really good think piece from a guy named Noah Smith. I love the name of his blog Noah pinion  But  He's he says you know there if you look at what China is shutting down  What China's clamping down on?  It may mean not so much that they they want to clamp down on dissent or they want to  Control more tightly the social media what they're really trying to close down on is  The companies that aren't really creating a lot of value  They're doing almost a lot of rent taking in the ecosystem companies software companies  Companies like you know DD and Tencent which are hugely successful Alibaba  Which is like the Amazon of of China they're hugely successful, but not by adding  value to the economy as much as a company like let's say Intel or Apple or Microsoft ads and  He points out that in fact  The big Chinese you know hardware companies are not facing this kind of scrutiny  They're not being  You know shut down or investigated  They are being and so he says maybe this is China  Reorienting because they don't need to do it through a  Democratic process, but reordering by fiat their economic priorities. They're shifting  He says after the Cold War our priorities in the US shifted from survival to enjoyment  Technologies like Facebook and Amazon which are fundamentally about leisure and consumption  Because in the early days technology was about R&D was about winning wars you know before World War two  Defense spending has traditionally been a huge component of government research spending in the US and many of America's most successful  Private sector tech industries he writes are in some ways spinoffs of these defense related industries  But then post-war it became about fun  Entertainment he says China never really shifted out of survival mode they embraced economic growth  But really they what what they really want is comprehensive national power and soft power globally economic power  Chinese young people Noah writes may be increasingly ready to cash out and have some fun  But leadership is just not there yet  So when China's leaders look at what kind of technologies they want the country's engineers and entrepreneurs to be spending their efforts on  They probably don't want them spending effort on stuff. That's just for fun and convenience  They they probably took a look at their consumer internet sector decided the link between that  Sector and geopolitical power is too tenuous to keep throwing capital and high skilled labor added and so in classic  CCP fashion it was time to smash. I thought that was a very interesting  Take on that on that and and maybe that you know because China's handling their big tech  By fiat just like okay  You're out you're gone  We obviously have to go through a much more prolonged process, but there's also in the u.s. This kind of  anger at big tech maybe we should think about what we're angry about and  Think about the companies that are adding real value not just a social and not just a geopolitical power  But you know to the economy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean part of it is that you know we've been very financialized here, so if you look at the recent you know  Investment bubbles they have not been tech centric. They've been financial centric right and I include  Blockchain stuff and things like that in that but also that there's a very you know  You is there wasn't a you know we've been looking for the what's the next thing?  For a five-year period or so and haven't really settled on it yet, right? We've we've we don't know what's past phones  That was the last big you know  Hardware driven change  And there's been a lot of you know as you say social social tech froth and then other kinds of very financialized froth  And a lot of the investment models in the u.s. Have been these  Effectively let's lose money to try and get a monopoly companies like like uber yeah, and  We work and and you know Airbnb and so on  and  China has had examples of those they they had the they tried it  huge bicycle  Boomin bus there right  Which was you know they we've had you know bicycle rental things here  But in China they were like six competing bicycle rental companies  And there's still like in huge like you can see photographs of them huge landfills full of  Abandoned electric bicycles because they were trying to do the will make the money from the data gathering and not from the bicycles  and  That's so there's that that stuff and again though also they've they've pushed out all the Bitcoin mining in the last  three months or so  So they're basically saying when we're not sure about these these  Financially fluffy things let's look at things that are actually productive. They're also reducing apparently venture funding

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're trying to squash that bubble

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they're also investing a lot in they've been investing in infrastructure not just in China  Which has been you know very visible, but also in other countries around the world for supply chain  What this is a belt and road initiative? Yeah, yeah, so there's yeah, so there's definitely a sense  they're looking at it differently and possibly drawing back from the  Sort of financialization and and the so the companies you're talking about  Them sort of backing off from are the ones that are closest to those those bottles

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're frothiest they support Huawei still doing strong the government is  According to Noah create hell bent for leather to create a world-class  domestic semiconductor industry  Spending heavily on AI we know that  So it's not technology China's smashing. It's the consumer facing software companies  They're going after and that if you put it in that light. That's kind of an interesting strategy  And and I wonder  You know I mean certainly our hardware Intel did very well AMD did very well  Qualcomm is very successful. I haven't seen their quarterly results yet  Microsoft and Google I think you could say are mostly on the side of creating  You know hard tech value as opposed to something like Facebook or Amazon or Twitter  Those companies are doing well in this country, but I wonder if that if if in our scrutiny of big tech  We're not thinking as strategically as the Chinese

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Communist Party is thinking tech aside on this, but I'm see if I can say this without getting in trouble  when I see articles like this I always think about the notion of  People think Americans are just so  horrible and spoiled  And then you look at places like China where they're just worried about you know bottom line kind of things  You know allowed to be hard points. You know it's just bottom line kind of things  We're over here just sort of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I gotta I gotta say that there are plenty of horrible and spoiled Chinese yeah millionaires and billionaires now  Yeah, it is, but it's interesting that China  You know Jack Ma was kind of the poster boy for that and China cracked has been cracking down on it  Which I think is kind of interesting  And maybe that's because they don't want to all right. You know I think that's right. They wanted to they wanted that growth  They wanted that startup economy, but then looked at the consequences of it. Maybe thought maybe we should redirect it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean they haven't been scared of infrastructure investment the amount of you know high-speed trains and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's something I really regret that that we are not doing here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's right you know we'd rather put it into let's launch into space  That's that's the big thing and I'm giving you I believe I mentioned last week even though the media  pretty much  Pooped on Bezos and in Branson for their efforts to go to the edge of space  There's still some plenty of research that can come from what they did that may eventually end up helping up helping out the regular consumer with travel  Not to edge of space, but just from this side of the country to the other side of the country  Yeah, you went to Hawaii for your vacation. He asked me. There was no no no scientific benefits that I can guarantee

Transcript:  Know that I can digest spam was soo be before getting on an airplane so other than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean just you but you asked like had I been to Hawaii and and and I had to tell you no  Because it was a long way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These coasters go to the Caribbean they go to the bar right they go to Florida even though

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would love to go to Hawaii, but I  Thought about that a little bit more what if there's a way for it to be a much faster trip  That's economical for folks on the East Coast to be able to see would you write a rocket to Hawaii to Hawaii but not the space

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I guess it would kind of you've kind of crossed the common light  Yeah  That was that's the plan right? I don't know is it Blue Origin that wants to do that  I can't remember a parabola. Yeah, and so they're talking about New York to Shanghai in a matter of an hour or two

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that's good  You know and if you want Elon wants to and if we can get costs down for  Regular consumers to be able to do that in the next 20 years or so  I think that's I think them doing this right now is good for the future  But again humans are involved and humans are greedy and going to do some really greedy things and we may not even see anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did it New York to Shanghai in 40 minutes. I'm sorry that would be even Wow even better  And that's Elon Musk it wants wants to do that with SpaceX  Hmm. He said it would cost about the same as a first-class ticket to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And first-class tickets are in their quotes expensive. Yeah, very expensive, but at the same time  Paying for an air the first-class ticket to go to the other side of the planet. That's pretty daggum pretty amazing  Yeah, economic economic, you know  You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right  Let's take a break come back lots more to talk about. It's nice to have you Kevin Marx  Are you you're doing the IndieWeb thing still? Yes. Yes still doing it any web stuff. There's

What do you use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not jitsy we tried to see and we ended up using zoom because it was a bit more reliable  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I know that story. I just shut down my jitsy server

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I like jitsy I could never get anybody to use it. I created a twit jitsy  I remember when you created it never get anybody use it. So we all use zoom now. Are you on zoom Kevin?  I'm gonna zoom in the minute. Yeah, we got you to use zoom to he looks good

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that's not too bad. I mean I have used I've used Skype with you before but I don't I'm sure I've got skype anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't even think Microsoft has Skype

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've got teams and Skype for business and I'm never quite sure what yeah, well we've been talking about that on Windows weekly. Hello dozers and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And  It's pretty much they're gonna phase out Skype in favor of teams everybody seems to agree  I think even Microsoft has said that so we've been talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Galeen a couple times on floss weekly here the last couple weeks is another video. I don't know that one  gilean  Galeen.org

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Galeen that's from mr. David Tatt. Oh like a baleen whale, but it's a galene whale.org.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's open source video conferencing and mr. Searle's been using it. It's French  Galen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We know how my French accent says. Oh, it's implemented in go. Oh, okay. Okay, and web RTC uses the pion  I don't know what that is implementation of web RTC  Interested. Mr. Searle says it's legit. He's been using

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, is that web RTC was supposed to mean that we could do this in browsers and just in one way  But everyone's wrapping in in their own thing as well. So it seems like a bit of a shame

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Galen is one Janice ion SFU and jitsi, of course, I'll use web RTC on the open source  Solutions and unfortunately the closed source solutions like zoom and Skype have really better

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mean the reason zoom  Took off originally was because they actually bothered to do the bridging to phone thing, right?  Make it work. And so it was easy for them to adopt in that in that market, right?  But I think I think they're running on web RTC  Are they well at least I think they I think at least the browser version ones  Oh, yeah, I'm sure the browser version is but I've actually posted the protocol directly. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, are using the browser version or the desktop? No, I'm using the app at the minute. Yeah. Yeah  Also, it's great to have ant Pruitt hands-on photography your photo show has what this week this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're gonna talk with the mad scientist. Mr. Don  Comorechka, you know, we're gonna look at some macro photography. I've already spoken spoken about macro photography, but he's the man  When it comes to macro photography, so he's gonna share some really really good tips and tricks and dive into some snowflake stuff  It's a TV. Nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  hop  Hop Jason how of course tech news weekly  All about Andrea during our editorial meeting on that Tuesday. We're saying what are we gonna talk about?  Facebook in the metaverse and then I realized oh wait a minute Apple Google  Microsoft AMD and Intel are all gonna announce quarterly results this week.

Slow and steady wins the race who won the turtle in the hair the turtle right the toy dough the toy  Titus won the title and the hair be the Titus. I don't think that's their slogan  Thank you wealth front thank you wealth front yes all right metaverse  So the metaverse best first chapter in the history of science fiction in my opinion Neil Stevenson snow crash  Do you remember it the pizza delivery gal she's on a skateboard? It's really exciting. Oh what no never mind  Lost me a skateboard anyway  Giving the car first and then the skateboard it's good. Is it you remember that right Kevin?  You remember that yeah, it's really great 92 things  things are different, but one of the best features is snow crash like all Neil Stevenson novels ends with a whimper not a bang but  starts with a bang so  It's actually some of his more recent novels have much better endings  I really like seven eaves, but anyway, that's this that's different. You didn't like seven eaves the ending of seven eaves John  You wanted more?  Well that maybe he can write a second one I  All right, Jeremy is fired up back. Yeah, I thought that was a great novel anyway  the metaverse comes from that book snow crash it is  You know and now with ready player one and plenty of other science fiction  Creations everybody's kind of aware of this notion of jacking the matrix jacking in to a  World is so realistic it becomes your life becomes your your second life. Was it second life?  Yeah, that was not  When there was nothing we honestly I think a lot of  Innovation in tech and in science comes from the fact that we all read science fiction  And we're just trying to invent that thing that we know so right when we were 16 right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well the thing in metaverse about earth, I'm I definitely wrote that right straight into a product spec, and I know that the  Google Google Earth and Google Maps guys did as well  I think there's that basically envision the idea of having a globe that you could turn around with your hand and zoom in and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Out and see everything so that's what Google Earth is earth from snow crash. Yeah, that's cool  That's awesome. See thank you. It's a scene in the in the chat room as well a second

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was I was reading 3d atlas at the time and and we said okay  We've done this thing with a CD-ROM board where do we go next?  I said we want to put a whole 3d globe and all this stuff. That's so cool, and it is still cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but let's not forget. I mean  Even though we've kind of gotten used to it. That is a very very cool product absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still use it because because it's just so easy to use and it allows us to  Go somewhere that we're probably never right to go and really go and really get into it. Yeah, you know 3d and everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I  was futuristic

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's the other part of this is that also that the thing that has happened is that and what's happened with mapping is that?  It has gone from a product to a commodity  Yeah, we have open street map we have  Apis like leaflet and things so actually embedding maps in your website now is a line of code  And the assumption that you can embed a map that has the entire earth on it and drop points on it and move things around  Has become yeah, that's just commonplace  Yeah, yeah  and and part of you know and  Open street map is a is an impressive achievement there in that it has managed to gather a lots of the other companies  Apart from Google to to to to collaborate and work on that  So a lot of data from that Microsoft and Apple are feeding into that as well and putting stuff back out again, too  So that's interesting. I didn't realize that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the original idea of open street map was it would be kind of crowd sourced, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It'd be like yeah, and as soon as you can you can open up a stroke in stream out now and fix things  I've added, you know paths and things here  And to still do that  But in terms of and also it's it's very flexible you can do  Anyone can construct new map layers from it. So there's lots of different kinds of map layers that you can you can  Construct from it and get custom versions, you know waiting for Apple of it will update their product for it to look different  So that's that's a powerful thing  so the part of the question for the sort of the metaverse stuff is how much of it will be a  back between the giants about who owns the  The tech and the specs for that and how much of it will be stuff that gets pushed down into those kinds of layers  And that's you know with with I mean the nice thing about the earth is that we have  Sort of agreed coordinate system. I mean, okay with two or three  But basically there's there's a primary coordinate system that we all use  And you can cross check that with a GPS and you can cross check that with other people's maps and see does this does this thing  Fit where it belongs and part of the challenge of the metaverse stuff is saying  What they've done so far has been like tabletop VR where it's okay  We're putting things in your room most of the time and there's and the the idea of putting stuff in the world  Which which they're starting to do now means you need that kind of  Shared model of the world that we have for mapping, but you needed a much higher resolution  I need to have buildings and things in as well and you hit the question of  If I'm putting on my goals and scanning the neighborhood  If I'm doing that out of doors fair enough we can share that if I'm doing that indoors  You probably don't want that to be uploaded to an open street map like thing or even a Facebook like thing  You didn't necessarily want them to have a model of the inside of your house, but that's what you're constructing  So so the sort of the models around how we do that and what counts as public space gets a lot messier  I forgot you have a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Expertise in history in this area actually completely forgot that  One of the things I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Recently well fairly recently the last couple of years  Was I've been working for part of the UK government called digital catapult and two years ago  We wrote a thing called who will own the metaverse  Which was trying to think through some of these pieces and and draw the things together interest and and  The question is those companies who were thinking about this, you know Nantix another one. They've basically built this they built the world  They've got an AR overlay for it, right?  They've got an AR overlay for it  And they used ingress and then they've they've used that for Pokemon go and they're now building a platform that you can build your  Own games on top of that and then and starting to think about how to sell that out. So they've got they've done  some of that mapping stuff that is based around the idea of  not just  Where the earth is but where a place you can actually play on the earth so they can they can tell  The difference between a public park and a you know a railway a railway line and and make sure that they put the Pokemon in  Barker not on the road with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microsoft had some ambitions with this with HoloLens their mixed reality. They made a Minecraft earth  That was kind of a Pokemon go you could put build Minecraft stuff in  In the real world and they killed it. Yeah, it didn't last very long

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, like yeah, they launched it and it was neat  But I did it ever even get and like an official public got out of beta

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was it was like it felt like oh, we're so close  But that's part of the problem with all of this is the technology really isn't there yet  But now it's time to start thinking about yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right for sure part of part of it is, you know bits of it are when we're trying to fit the pieces together and make  It but to actually overlay things on the real world in real time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need a bunch of stuff to work very very well Microsoft was really using it to show off their what was it called Azure?  Something points map points. That's right. Yeah, they had a cloud-based kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Geocoordinate system so that multiple people could be in different places looking at the same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so all of this is in the news again because  Mark Zuckerberg, you know, it's clear the Facebook's had this kind of ambition since they bought oculus, right?  Yeah, they've been talking about this for a while. There's horizon. So he was he was talking to a Casey Newton and  He called the metaverse the successor to the mobile internet that clarifies a little bit what he what he thinks of it and  This got a lot of attention pledged to turn Facebook from a social media company to a metaverse

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  company  Well, I see that line. I'm thinking about that oculus that you gifted me and how I don't touch it anymore  Because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook account oh, yeah that one you can use that one. I think you can use the first quest one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he has the original. Yeah, I don't know seems like I remember seeing a banner pop up one time  What's your Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Attempt on that that's why I never get the quest to if it's not required and maybe I'll keep playing it cuz I enjoyed it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they have there according to protocol all in on the metaverse  They're reorganizing to build a metaverse product group. It'll be headed by Vishal Shah who's currently VP of product at Instagram  Facebook gaming VP Vivek Sharma will be leading development  They have something the company calls their horizons VR world. We've seen some of that. That's seen some that that's out in prototype  a gaming executive from Facebook Jason Rubin  Will be there as well and they'll all be reporting to base Facebook's VP of AR and VR Andrew Bosworth  He announced on Monday announced the founding of this group with this with these words to remember  To achieve our full version of the metaverse  We need to build and I think this is kind of what you were talking about  Kevin the connective tissue between these spaces  So you can remove the limitations of physics and move between them with the same  He's is moving from one room in your home to the next to focus our efforts and deliver on this vision  We're bringing together the teams that have been driving some of this fundamental work. Maybe I'm misunderstanding it  But it is true that on the rift and the HTC Vive  Moving around is really hard because you can't actually walk from place to place

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, and even even hit a wall on the quest. I mean the quest has come a long way of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do they do it you point and you say take me there you point with a controller and say well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm talking about like free motion walking like you can use your controller or you can walk around  Well, they've talked about that using cameras wireless and you can draw your safe zone  I can't remember what they call it  But even with the pass-through camera, it's still pretty tenuous  Like it's better than not having a wire frame of the room

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just never know where that could that when that the corner that you forgot to draw out is gonna like peg you in the forehead  We're gonna take you to the floor  There's always a little bit of that, you know, so they've got a ways to go in the ready player one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course the guy had a all the young treadmill. I'm gonna weird, you know, I'm 36 degree treadmill  You can move in any direction and it was attached to the last six and it looks very uncomfortable

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To be honest with you actually tested that for I remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was really weird it was not normal he's not natural when you play one have a haptic so that people kick you in the leg  Oh  You had a full haptic suit  But I mean, but there is I mean the problem you have with I mean the AR stuff makes some sense  so the thing that my antique does says okay, we'll put you out in the world and you're playing in the world or  You know Google's does the AI navigation now, which is which can be quite useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I'm kind of more of a believer in that the mixed reality or augmented reality kind of vision. That's not a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Channels there. Well, yeah, that's my question. Well, it can be metaverse but it but then it but then you've got to be in the right place  You know, right if I'm standing on top of this pill in Yorkshire, then there's no one else around right?  And I couldn't you know, I'm sounds awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nineteen's actually been struggling with that in Pokemon go you because you can do a rate if you're approximate to gym  But they've during kovat they added the ability to do remote rating. You're still playing Kevin. You're still playing I can tell you're nodding

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's just my son works them so I know how he does. Oh, that's cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well tell him he's doing a really good job and not to take back the kovat enhancements because it made the game much more fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but but is that is the challenge the challenge you have with AR is especially even if you're just doing for data overlays  If I want to look down on the city, I've got to go and climb a hill to look at it, right?  Or I've got to decide how to fly and you hit the same problem  You know any of these mapping things you hit all these projection problems  What makes sense and what doesn't and you also hit the classic SKC D thing of everything's population density  And so everything you every piece of data overlay ends up just being a map of where people live  So you you hit a bunch of sort of weird?  It's kind of the great goo problem of the metaverse, right? Everything's all kind of the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm still kind of foggy on what exactly it means to be a metaverse now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never I never read snow crash that's probably part of the reason and maybe I'm admitting something that's not true  That's probably part of the reason and maybe I'm admitting something that I shouldn't be admitting out loud  Don't worry. There's two of us in the room. Don't hurt me. Okay, there we go. But like it's a fairly quick read

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's quite fun. Okay. Oh, it's really good. It's thick. You may say it's a quick read, but it's a pretty thick book  In the beginning there was a command line is short, but most of it's pretty thin

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not as thick as it's not as thick as what he's done more recently. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Quick you mean quick silver trilogy the 18,000 page

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that sounds approachable. It's not that long

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy is it on audible? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even audible had divided the six different books it was so oh my goodness

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Getting around him not finishing his books wasn't it?  We wrote six on the glue together, but no so the basic I mean snow crash has a bunch of deep stuff  It has some good mythos things in it as well  But the basic idea is the world is split into strange commercial franchises  But there's another shared world that everyone can go into which is the metaverse which is involves headsets and and wandering around and it was  It's interesting because it kind of predates the web. It was written before the web was  Was mainstream and so it's thinking about the web but from a from a VR point of view  So it's kind of okay on in a sort of history technology thing  You know the other one that's fun like that is which I've mentioned on this show before is  Douglas Adams hyperland which was made in 8990 and was an exploration of how do we do hypertext?  Just before the web existed and so and it ends up wondering if we are and doing weird stuff like that  I'm sorry, but there's this  Some of this is like old tech that keeps coming back, you know, we've had  Imagined VR worlds for a very long time. Sure  they know there's there's an entire genre of movies from them from the 90s that there are different kinds of  Imagined VR was because it appeals very much to Tron

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tron loved it lawnmower man. It's cheap because you can you don't have to build a set

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tron was expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But so what you're explaining by the way you saw all the money on the screen didn't yeah, I mean you're  Hey at the time it was hot a little shade there. I think this is the problem is that  Fiction can imagine this we can imagine this and it's appealing this notion of a world  It's not of the world go and it's really escape and you can fly you can do anything you want  And it's so real that you can't it's almost impossible to distinguish it from the real world and that's not it's it's I think  It's it's can you consider?  it's not such a hard reach from a  Conceptual idea because your sense or you're really already in the metaverse  We we don't we only see the real world through these  engines of our sensorium the senses and  And the real world actually looks nothing. I think I don't know because I've not been there nothing like the world  We're seeing but we interpret it with our brain. So in effect we are already in  The concept of a metaverse. What do you almost said? Yeah, he thinks we're in a simulation  That's a little step beyond that which I'm not convinced is wrong, but I just don't think there's any way to  Prove how do you improve it really similar? Yeah. Well, no, it's just right now your perception of the world comes from touch smells

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, and you're in the limited levels of touch that smell like we don't even experience the entire  If you did you'd get an overwhelm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, true and and your eyes are in are seeing everything upside down because the way lenses work  So your brain is correcting flips it around  I mean so there's the brain my mind right now  Your brain we are in a metaverse in effect, you know, we're in a an imagined  Constructed reality based on what is out there, but it's not necessarily exactly the same  So I understand why conceptually it's easy  I think technically it's much more difficult and the problems to solve are almost intractable, you know  Until you can actually have a wet wear interface  you know, what what are the the  cyberpunk version of the metaverse  Gibson's version of the metaverse you plug in I was good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I was just gonna say it seems to me what we're craig or I don't know if we're craving it  But what we expect is something that takes our current perception of what reality is and sensation and all that and replaces it with something  That's like a one-to-one replacement  That doesn't come from putting a VR headset on and putting a controller in your hand because that's very different from what we experience in  Basis it has to be something that plugs into you and short circuits or something your actual sensory system

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin from your experience with these companies. I  Mean, this is obviously super blue sky if this if this were you know, IBM  This would be considered like you put these guys off in a building somewhere far away in our mock  This is very very blue sky for Facebook  But but everybody's doing it. It's like Waymo in a way. It's turning out to be a harder problem  How important is it is it because these companies are trying to find the next big thing and they're really  Reaching or it seems like everybody in techs doing this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is part of it  I mean part of it is that you know  The the obvious technology progression that we have had has gone  You know if things were getting smaller and we were carrying them around and we've gone from you know  That desktops to laptops to two phones and we try to risk things that we do much  And part of that is or whatever you attach the displays to our faces and we've been you know  that that's it's been a trope, you know, as I said since the 80s and  The question is, you know, can we actually do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we can but not with attaching things to our faces, right? Right, right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, and that and that's a lot of them look weird, you know  Well, Google glasses trying not to attack you attached to your glassy of a little screen here  and and and the  Whatever the  Projects with the Google one is supposed to not involve screens over your face, but but light-filled things  That one they bought which has gone a bit quiet  There's there's all ways to try and do it  But the challenge is always but you've also got to either replace your entire visual field with something compelling  Which is very hard to do for more than a few minutes at a time  If you if you spend more than half an hour in one of those things you do end up feeling a bit  You want to throw up? Yeah. Yeah  It's an intense gaming thing rather than a I would spend my workday in this type thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so the question, you know, it's so funny because we're still seeing Microsoft videos of people spending their workdays in these things  Yeah, this is yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Microsoft in was that weird thing where they were putting the people in the same shared space  Yeah, they had to fake their faces because their faces were covered in in Google  And they had no legs I think  The point of snow crash was there was only 22 cared about people's faces and that was actually the most important part of what they  were doing  but they had to invent like laser scanning your eyeballs and things to make it work and and  I'm not sure I really want a laser scanning my eyeballs controlled by something written by Facebook. Yeah, Mr. Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if you have an answer to this, but what do  Shareholders or stakeholders and all of these tech companies are they saying hey, why aren't we looking into VR more and a arm?  Is that what's pushing? You know, is the push coming from the people with the with the money or is this truly just?  Development and wishful thinking and wanting to try to make the I think I think it is more from the tech side

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's more that people have been have had this dream for a long time that you can replace the world with your computer  and so  They're you know  Palmer lucky said well, why don't I just build it and he built it and built something that sort of half worked and then  Facebook bought it bought him and there's been you know a whole series of companies that have been doing this for a long time  And the originally would sell to the military and things like that. There are there are good  Heads up display things, but they're still very expensive  All right, and what they've been trying to do, you know, Google's Google did the what if we just stick your phone to your face?  thing with cardboard  But she's dead now Google has killed now one of the reasons these phones doesn't my phone doesn't is getting combative  Oh, look at that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you supposed to show that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But part of you know, I was saying part the reason these phones had such  You know, this is this phones got a 4k screen which makes no sense as a phone  I don't made senses as a thing in cardboard because if it's that far from your screen right face then the 4k screen makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so, you know, it's bad for battery life. It's cost more. Yeah, and you can't tell it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no yeah, there's no real visible difference unless you're using a microscope. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sometimes I think we've gone the wrong way in any case

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm one of two people that enjoyed using daydream back in a day. Yeah, it was neat  No, I liked it me and Hulu or me and Netflix on one of my armchairs and some really you'd watch a whole show that way  Oh, it was great. It was just it was so relaxing because in a virtual movie theater  Yeah, everything was quiet on the floor

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do want to point out we do have an amazing  Very advanced very mature technology that does that it's called movies  Even though you're not attaching it to your face. You go in a darkened room. You look at a large screen  They use music they use drama. They use sound they are very effective. There's people there  Well, that's why I don't go to the theater. Yeah, but if you okay nowadays, yeah, but no, no, no  In  1917 is an example and it's all shot kind of first-person on yeah, but that is a virtual reality experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is yes  If you're not too aware of the fact that you're sitting in the theater because I know exactly what you're talking about  There are times where I'm watching something and I get so immersed that I forget that I'm watching something

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a good movie. Yeah does that yes, and it is a very advanced technology. It's a hundred year old technology  We've gotten very very good and you know, it's a good movie because you laugh you cry  There's nothing to laugh and cry at you're sitting in a room looking at a screen at a wall with lights  Projected on it, but it's making you cry. I agree. That's a virtual reality experience. That's amazing  We're very very good at that. So I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We do have that with gaming we have the ability to do  Explore free explore a 3d world with gaming  And you have a big enough TV you can immerse interactivity is the problem that's right difficult  But the the intuitive is there we're getting in a few if you're I have to admit when I play Valhalla

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I actually got a sense of this even though Valheim, which is a silly  Viking  Survival game that people know I'm a little upset was a little says wait you play Valheim  By the way, I play Valheim  But I was playing it on a 5k 55 inch 5k monitor arms length away from me  So it was immersive and it I got to the point where I felt like, you know what?  I understand how you could think this was yours. This was you  Another world and you were having another experience, especially if you play about eight hours a day, which I was doing at its peak  That was my life  Wow, and it was interactive and you know, it's funny the graphics weren't super good. They were okay the physics  It's funny that the textures were low quality, but the physics the lighting and everything was superb  So there was an interesting mix, but it wasn't that it was so realistic. It was but it somehow was immersive  So we are we can do get immersed in Minecraft and that's that's that's right even lower quality. Yeah  You should see the things I've built in Minecraft

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's part of it is like we're still feeling around the edges of these pieces totally that's that thing  I linked to is like we've got all these different parts  We're trying to find the pieces of it together and work out how they work  And all these companies are trying to do that, but it's still yeah  The problem is what is the what is the what is the compelling thing that you can do with this?  You can't do with anything else. Can it get good enough to subsume everything or will it be?  Sort of pieces of it that we slice off that's like okay, it's good for gaming if you do it this way  It's good for watching movies if you do it this way  Yeah, it's good for walking around the world and finding things if you do it this way  Is there a unified thing there or not and that's the piece that they're all wrestling with I think it's it's easy to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How right now at this point in the development of technology that let's say the VR headset is the closest that we can get to  A metaverse or is the beginning building blocks when you're talking about  You know when you're talking about movies being around for a hundred years  like it's  We as humans for the last hundred years have also like conditioned ourselves through the creation through the  Consuming of movies to lose ourselves into it in the way that you have we were complicit now  We're at the yeah, we're participating in that regard now. We're at the beginning of this next phase  Let's say and I'm not saying that Mark Zuckerberg is gonna be the one to do it  But we're at the beginning of the next phase of what that develops out into and of course  It's gonna be pretty infantile in the beginning  Yeah, and there's gonna be a lot of holes to poke into it  But I'm I'm pretty convinced that at some point down the line  We could be a lot closer to whatever this metaverse thing actually is and yes where we're at right now is the foundation of that  Or at least it's the beginning of it. Yeah, so there's something to be said. I was hoping that I'd be able to jack in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the nursing home  Experience a whole life with that, you know and in my later years, I don't think it's gonna happen in my lifetime  Yeah, I think it's 80 years off. I think it's you know, it's within maybe it's within your lifetime

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not it's been 10 years off for 40 years. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's funny there's a the kind of the seminal article on this was written about a year ago by Matthew balls of venture capitalist  The metaverse what it is where to find it who will build it and for it  He talks a lot actually it's an interesting article. I recommend it, but he talks about vannevar Bush's famous  article from  1945 called memex which really predicted the internet and we should ask people think yeah, yeah as we will think yeah  That's right. That was the name of it. He talked about the memex  So that was 80 years ago  It might you know, you can conceive of it long before you can make it and and we can see all the technical challenges  Yes, but you but I don't I think we're you know, we're conceiving of it for sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think it will happen eventually, you know, but at the same time we look at so much horsepower  In air quotes that's that we carry around in our pockets with these phones  And then you have things like that in one chip from Apple and what the iPad is able to do and you would wonder  Why aren't we there yet because we have so much hardware prowess going on right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, well, we have a lot compared to what we had ten years ago  But not not enough yet to create a metaverse  Mm-hmm  And we're slowing down a little bit although by the way, I just learned that we are gonna stop talking about nanometers  Did you see this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never understood the significance in nanometers  I know you talk about like what Microsoft hasn't been able to do versus Intel. Yeah. Yeah, not Microsoft Intel Intel

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're still at the 14 and 10 nanometer and TSMC is announced the 2 nanometer  But some companies are calling that the 20 a or 20 angstrom size we are now into angstroms  20 angstroms is 2 nanometers. I  Don't know  What's the layman's description of what we're talking about because it isn't really accurate anymore  Because it used to be it used to be related to a transistor density  And yeah  You can see the more transistors you could put on the chip the more power the chip  Conceivably have that was Andy. That was  Who's law gosh now I've more  And and it was double it was more predictive the number of transistors on a chip would double every 18 months  It did for a long time. I don't know if it still is  But that really comes down to how small you can make that process right the transistor is more and smaller  So what you're really measuring I think Kevin correct me when you talk about  10 nanometers or 2 nanometers  Used to be the size of the the traces right that connected these things  But but now it no longer applies because it's not a two-dimensional field of transistors. They're stacked stacked now  Okay, so now it's more like 10 nanometer equivalent or 2 nanometer equivalent. You're really what you should be talking about is transistor density  That's the real okay number you're talking about and they I don't I don't know are they going up  Are they doubling 18 every 18 months anymore? I don't know no that's that's not happening basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But what they were measuring this to stop having but what what happened was that they started optimizing on different  constraints so rather than  Doubling the density they started worrying about power consumption and optimizing that up and also  It was also doubling clock rate was the other thing they were thinking about but that that ended up causing problems, too  Because that multiple cores multiple cores because he became a big problem and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I have to say the the M1 Apple's M1 has 16 billion transistors on  Something the size of your thumb  Some nails. I don't even get it. It's kind of amazing. Yeah, but yeah, I guess Moore's law  I think Intel ran into this with maybe it was even back to the itanium where it was just so hot and  The clock speeds were stalled and so they just decided you know what we got to do is you guys put more more cores  Mm-hmm, and then it required software being redesigned to take advantage of those cores and a lot of software still doesn't say  People like Adobe still struggle with yeah with that yeah only a few things you you know a Gaussian blur you're gonna  Maybe you're gonna go off and split that up  Yeah, most of us still do you type in one thing's waiting for you. That's all and wait in a long time  Let's take a little time out Kevin Marx  Great to have you  Mr.. Ant Pruitt and of course Jason Howell  Do you have a good all about Android your return to the seat the chair? Yeah? Yeah, it was good to be back

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Flow I forgot was away on vacation  Next week it's gonna happen yes, and we've got Russell Holly joining us. Oh, I love Russell. He's great  He's a senior now, but yeah, it was great  It was just me and Ron hanging out and had a blast always do love that show and burkless to right and burkless  We have Victor Victor back on the ones and twos so you know it's a good time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have no idea what you guys are talking about mr.. Burke was the TD was he yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was the TD during the during coping now Victor's doing it and yeah Victor was before and so he's back during the lockdown  He's back here here, so we got to introduce everybody to Burke on that show

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right on we go with the show oh blizzard oh  Blizzard oh  Blizzard you see the latest I  Haven't checked Twitter to see where everything so blizzards in a lot of trouble activision is a lot of trouble because yeah  they're getting the employees have walked walked out big demonstration because the of the  Hostile work environment and now pictures are emerging of  blizzards  Bill Cosby sweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No  I hadn't heard about that one. Oh, I think look I understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Game development, maybe a little bro culture II yeah, right and the guys who do it  Are maybe our bros?  Which is too bad because I'm sure there are a lot of wonderful women talented women  Yeah, who would want to be on those teams, but doesn't don't want to be involved in the Cosby suite right no  Activision really has a problem and their employees are really talking about it  one of the people  Has been named in a sexual harassment lawsuit sad as like he was pretty appalling  The lawsuit calls it the cross the bill Crosby room. I think that's just I don't think there is a bill Crosby  I think it's a typo from a lawyer who doesn't know what he's talking about but  And and and  Activision says oh no no we called it the Crosby room because it was a conference room that the  Carpet reminded us of Bill Cosby sweaters. This is not holding up  They also had Cosby suites at game conventions  Blizzcon this is back in 2013  And of course these are important if you want to be  You know hired by Activision if you want to be come part of the World of Warcraft team or you know you just want?  to talk with these people, but do it does any woman gonna want to go to the  Bill Cosby suite no  They it's just I mean it's bad it is bad. It's it's bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I'm not I'm not super up on my blizzard background. You know  I've heard some things about Activision over the years  But Blizzard as a company from my understanding from the outside looking in has long been a pretty  I don't know a pretty positive place like I know a lot of people who have worked there used to work there  Scott Johnson Scott Johnson and then  Patrick Bajaj Patrick Bajaj used to work there and and I feel like I feel like the sentiment that I've heard about Blizzard from  From them in in you know many years past has been pretty pretty darn positive that Blizzard is a pretty awesome company  I mean  You know it just goes to show like same story different company this stuff more and more as it should is  Being is being aired and attention is being paid to this as like I said as it should yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and it is a  I think an indictment of the corporate culture when you see it and read the Kotaku article because it's I don't even want to  Talk about some of this stuff is so horrible that this was the tolerated as part of the corporate culture  is  sad

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unfortunately a lot of the country is trying to evolve and get out of all of this just ridiculous behavior  that was considered normal over the last couple decades and I  hope that's the case with  Activision and Blizzard

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can really go up there? You know making noises about doing something about it apparently I didn't know this there are  There's problems in Azeroth  There's boy. There's some sexism in the actual world of Warcraft  I don't know. I don't know exactly sexist  comments or  Some of the places apparently in Azeroth are named after  various people  I don't know. It's pretty distasteful, so I don't know what to say about it. It's just that now with the emergence of this  It's it's starting to look even even worse. Yeah a lot of employees walking out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe our first interview tomorrow and TNW is with someone who is at the walkout. Oh good  So we're gonna definitely be talking about this on the show tomorrow Blizzard's CEO announced last night the company's previous statements

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's apologizing for the apologies now have been tone-deaf and  Pledged to make some changes to the company going forward including investigating all managers currently at the company to see whether  They ever impeded the integrity of our processes for evaluating claims  yeah  The problem is it only happened because of a lawsuit  You got to wonder what the commitment is to me. Yep. That's it by now anyway  All right, I don't we don't normally report on that stuff  But it's such a big story and that when I read that Kotaku story. It was like oh  Yeah, oh my goodness  Facebook one in  District Court  But in a court filing today  Attorney General's attorneys general from 45 states DC and Guam  Say they will appeal last month's decision that threw out the suit against Facebook  Part of the problem was the judge says you haven't defined monopoly. You've just you ask us to assume that it's a monopoly. Oh  and they also was an issue with the  The time frame they he's the judge ruled the states had waited too long to challenge Facebook's  Acquisition in 2012 and 2014 of Instagram and whatsapp  respectively  Facebook's been demanding that the FTC chair Lena Kahn recuse herself from the case because she has in the past written  Academic and other articles suggesting that a big tech and Facebook in particular should be broken up  So there's gonna be a lot more court going on and an appeal from the court said she were she should recuse herself  No, no Facebook said she sure  I don't know if she I don't know if that's I don't know if that's gonna happen  Facebook is going to limit the ads children can see  after revelations that  Australian alcohol companies have been buying ads for teens  Advertisers on Instagram Facebook and messenger will no longer be able to market to under 18s based on their interests  I hear you like tequila  The interest Facebook will impose more controls and the types of ads and children as young as 13 are exposed to on Instagram and other platforms  They'll stop advertisers marketing to teens under 18 based on their interest  They will the advertisers only know age gender and location

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To target these ads so this so these were targeted at teens who had in some way shape or form on these platforms  Signaled their interest in alcohol or whatever. Yeah, there was a group  In Australia

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a group in Australia called reset Australia that said we were able to buy ads targeted at kids aged 13 to 17  Based on interest they had including smoking extreme weight loss and gambling. That sounds like kids. Oh boy  Frankly that does sound like yeah. Do you worry about what the hardheads see on  Ad wise I mean not so much. I'm just gonna educate him. Yeah, they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not so much I hardly ever worry about them online anymore  What are you gonna do? They're old now? Well, yeah, well the one is old enough. He's 18 and  He's right here. So sure  Yeah, Mike, I just got his driver's license. Hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I'm curious up in the morning says see ya. Yes later

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bye. Bye. You have a lot of confidence about this and as a parent of kids who are younger are definitely close to becoming teenagers  Mm-hmm. Like where does that confidence come from? Like what did you do early on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That confidence now that's the thing. I've been talking to them about this stuff for four years since they were little trying to educate them on  privacy and  awareness of the room awareness of when you're out and about and just just to be careful and but at the same time  I also wanted them to explore, you know, the the senior college  College bound hardhead he used to be big into Minecraft and just digging into stuff and breaking things down  You know, he's not doing so much of that now, but he was inquisitive  So I had to sort of stay on his case to be like, all right, be careful when you're doing this research  I want you know people are gonna try to target you and things like that and they learn, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but boy if you're in the Minecraft you live on YouTube with my craft, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was it was YouTube a lot of the YouTube videos for Minecraft and there was this other video game  He used to play all the time  Five nights and Freddy  Friday five nights and Freddy's. Yeah, Michael  You would watch a lot of videos about that and and a lot of those videos were pretty questionable for his age  There was a lot of swearing. Yeah, cuz that's a game where you get scares. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  scares

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Years ago we were having these talks about you know, be careful online and be careful what you click on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Michael will sit watching a he watches on his phone which is their goal a YouTube video. He's 18 also  and it's just like  The worst words coming out of there. I'm gonna what are you watching? Oh, this is funny  It's comedic. Mm-hmm, and I used to see and I don't you know what that's being a kid. Yeah, we probably were the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had conversations about those videos and I had to tell them look you're not old enough for that right now  Yeah, so we had to cut some things down and even with our their older brother back when Grand Theft Auto was a big game  And he was he was just chomping at the bit to get it and I wouldn't get it for a little while and  When I finally broke down to get it however many years later. I warned him then I said look  I don't want you thinking this is reality. This is a video game  You're not gonna go out here and start trying to rob people and thinking that's the real world and stuff like that and  He got it. You know, there was one instance of him being an idiot and I had to take care of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like no, it's not how life is bro. If you only had one instance then you've done

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos is trying to buy a  NASA contract  In April NASA awarded Elon Musk's SpaceX  Yeah with a two point eight nine billion dollar contract to build the next crude lunar lander  Under its HLS human landing systems program  Jeff didn't like that because Blue Origin is a competing civilian space  group  They didn't give a chance  NASA gave ten months study contracts to Blue Origin Dynetics as well as SpaceX to work on loser lunar landers  They lost that contract. So now Jeff says hey  I will cover up to two billion dollars of your costs if you will give us the lunar lander contract  Talk about under bidding  Collie what do you do now?  Blue Origin will waive all payments up to two billion dollars from NASA and the current and next two government fiscal years  They would also fund their own Pathfinder mission to low-earth orbit  And all they want is a fixed price contract from NASA  Why go to the moon?  Well, that's another question entirely, right? But he really  See this is my you know earlier

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Earlier I argued with them to say that you know  This is a lot of potential research to help make things better for us as consumers here on earth and regular people that don't have  $2 billion to just throw into research  But this right here you telling me let me get that contract for the moon essentially when  What are we lost it? You know, what are we gonna get out of it? Yeah, you know  well, Jeff can afford it that sounds more like  Almost cussed that sounded more like a competition between two it is it's a pissing match it totally is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it really is. Mm-hmm. And I will forever be glad that Jeff Bezos  actually posed for this goofy picture after he got off the  He's wearing a cowboy hat and holding Texas Amelia Earhart's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aviation glasses up. Yeah, he's no longer CEO of Amazon. He can do whatever he wants at this point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's like it's not a risk

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he's a cowboy that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean the thing is he's  Muscat's has actually got a chance of getting his rockets to go to the moon because he's building ones that are big enough. Whereas the  Bezos is barely, you know, hasn't achieved orbit yet has he so yeah  Mm-hmm  But I mean if you actually look back at Apollo then that wasn't like one company building it all it was it was collaboration between  Lots of companies organized by the government  The different bits of the Apollo were built by different companies and they had to work hard to make them fit together  And that was part of what they learned from it as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I'm glad that there's a commercial side of this that we're doing government and commercial partnerships  It's too bad though that as soon as you get commercial entities involved and there's this kind of  Kind of bizarre competition, you know, Jeff take the two billion and do something else, you know  Yeah, do yes and not no, I want it take it away from Elon  last week we talked about the problem with the Chrome OS update that  Bricks Jeff Jarvis's laptop. He wasn't sure that it was I'm sure it was him

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm only saying it because he's not pretty sure  But he couldn't log into his laptop for a while after a Google Chrome OS update

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and then  You know the choice at that point was to either  Power wash it or wait. I guess he waited because it started working again after Google pushed another update  We now take that long. Yeah, it didn't take too long for them to fix  We now kind of know a little bit better what happened. Thanks to a redditor named Elixir  Redditor named elitist  ferret such a cool name  He he did a little digging in the code. I don't know how he got it and he found  This is open source. Yeah, is it open source so he could see oh nice  So and I think you've done a little C++ coding in your time. He found that instead of writing  ampersand ampersand in this if statement, which is a logical and  The coder wrote a single ampersand which is a bitwise and and has a completely different meaning and in fact meant  That the the login would fail every single time  For one of an ampersand

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Again, where was QA on? Yeah, I wonder

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's always code review, right? I mean, there's also lint. I mean, I don't understand why  This should have been caught right away it seems how does this sneak in Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a bit they're gonna have to do the review of because how did it manage to deploy as again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They say now sir canary through the different channels death through death through canary. I mean, yeah  it feels like almost like I  Mean that it had two ampersands all the way through testing and that for some reason some guy had it  Open in his you know, his emacs was open. He hit a backspace in an opportune moment  Didn't notice it power button  Let's push I  Mean how well I mean it feels like that's what happened. It's a yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why would you change?  Yeah, I mean, you know, it's it's the kind of time for you make yes. Oh, it's easily

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I'm sure this happened to everybody. I mean, this is a very it's like he was I'm sure has happened  It's like a single equal versus double equals exactly, right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is my double this is triple but yeah triple single double triple whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What there's no triple ampersand is there? Hey, can you lose me at semicolons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There and are supposed to be there so yeah, I'm done

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good catch elitist ferret. He found the fending ampersand  That's pretty that's actually pretty cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it was it one of those kind of could be that? Yeah, I mean if you it was only if you had to log in  And then it would check the password store and if it was in the password store  It matched it would pass you through but because there was no logical and  It just never got through oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it maybe they were using some other login thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they were using fingerprint or the Android phone bearing but that would have to be a lot of people I would think  But maybe everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says anyway, he called topo G Joe or topolino. What is the password so easy? Well, it's even easier if you watch  Little a little embarrassing but not a major security breach you'd have to actually get to the booth  Exactly not everybody has

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially at this year's Olympics actually hardly anyone's let in yeah in a way though

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Do you remember this I saw this yeah, yeah, so  It's in front of a locksmith it was in front of a locksmith shop in Seattle  It was a normal coke machine except that there were two buttons named mystery  And then all the buttons were named mystery and it would dispense  mysterious cans of  long  Disappeared or strange international  Sodas like maybe tomato juice might have been in there. Oh man. I'd want to refund. Yeah  Yeah  No, because you'd go and you'd press the button just as mystery just because you want to see there's a list on Wikipedia  Mountain Dew whiteout Wow raspberry flavored nest tea brisk a Hawaiian punch a great fan of vanilla cokes black cherry  frescoes  sun-kissed cherry limeade  the locksmith claims he knew nothing about it, but  At one point the machine had to be moved for sidewalk repairs and never came back although  There was a sign placed  On its Facebook page stating going for a walk need to find myself  Maybe take a shower even oh wow I mean it did look like a dirty

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyone who has access to a soda machine and wants to play that game to have some fun and create some mystery buttons  We should do that here John. We should have a soda machine kids don't know what soda machines are though what do you?  I don't see any these oh yeah, I see effect when we got home from our vacation  We're getting our bags, and there's a very  Modern soda machine that you are expected. I think to use your your watch  Okay, and there was a poor I felt so bad for a little old lady standing there  And she said can you help me? I don't understand how this works right because there was no prices or anything  on the sodas  Wasn't a mixer was just like a regular vending machine although it was one with the arm because  But  She said you want a bottle of water. How much what do I do?  How much money do I put in oh boy and I had explained well you enter the code for the bottle and then it'll tell you  How much it costs and then if you have a watch or a phone you tap it otherwise?  Good luck  So yeah, they're still around  We should  Know I know that was pretty old  As a long time ago hey, why don't we play the drums because I think this would be a good time to do  the Google change long  Some big changes coming along in the Google Google verse this is posted in the privacy sandbox calm  website the timeline  So this is actually interesting remember Google said at one point  We're gonna kill third-party cookies and then recently said  We should put that one off for yeah, they announced flock they have a variety of privacy  Initiatives but maybe you've been a little confused by the moving targets so now they've they've posted this  So there's discussion testing ready for adoption transition period stage one  Transition period stage two and it goes all the way out to q3 2023  So now you can see

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where we stand third party cookies transitioning out of Chrome over a three month period finishing late  2023 see that's the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone should take a screenshot of that and one back in in another quarter

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that screenshot moves trust. They have a lot of initiatives trust tokens API flock  fledge  Core attribution. They're doing a lot of stuff. We had a great. Oh man. This was so interesting  Discussion on security now yesterday about  Google's attempt to fix fishing  Websites to identify them and the problem is they have a database of fishing sites  But they want to let you know, you know, if you've seen this warning you get the big red warning  This is don't go any farther. This is fraudulent  The the issue is they want to do this on device  And they want to do it so that means this, you know  They're gonna have to do something about you can't put all the images of the website  You got to have some way to fingerprint it and  So they came up with a very clever way to fingerprint fishing sites. They hash  the colors on the page and  That hash database is small enough. They could actually transmit it to your to Chrome in Chrome  Mm-hmm, and then when you go to a site and they've and they are the other thing that was fascinating about this post was  See if I can find it they described  What you needed to do?  To hash the colors on the page in a reasonable amount of time because if if it takes an hour  The guy's gonna go on the so they say we can get it down now to five seconds  We hash the colors on the page we check and see if it matches the hash of a known  Fishing page and that's how they know nice in Chrome. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think that's really interesting. I'm trying to beat the bad guys before they can  Come up with a strategy to change the wolf. It's an interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Computer science problem because  How do you do this fast?  This comes out in m92  The title of the piece is the fast and the curious

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they describe how they'll go through the colors on the page and hash them  So that it'll give you this deceptive site ahead and how they how they were able to make it faster and faster  It's it's really if you're interested in kind of computer science algorithms and solving kind of interesting problems  This is a great piece. It's in the chromium  Blog they say starting with m92 chrome now executes image based fishing classification 50 times faster  At the 50th percentile two and a half times faster than 99th percentile  So on the average users will get their classification results after a hundred milliseconds  A tenth of a second instead of 1.8 seconds, so that's good. Yeah, you want to know immediately  Yeah, you don't want to spend some time  Browsing around so good job. That's that's the kind of stuff to me. That's really really interesting. Yeah, it is  Google Drive will let you now. This is something they've needed to do for a long time  People can harass you by sharing documents to your Google Drive, right?  Google Drive early over the next couple of weeks will let you block other users  Say stop sharing with me Lily McDonald at ink-42.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Such a suspicious place to send an email from man

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've had this happen. I used to be a problem  There's a setting in Google Calendar where people could put calendar events. Oh, yeah, that's right. Yeah, I do remember that that was terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute. What's going on with my time to buy another?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  another Instagram  product  So this so this was announced in May, but it's gonna be rolling out over a period of time  So good good on Google  Maybe you saw the Google Drive security update message  Yeah, I did a security update will be applied to Drive  You might have gotten this in your email  This is Ron again Ron Amadeo writing in Ars Technica  He says a whole bunch of us got this blasted with this  last night  July 27th if you visit Drive Google comm you'll see this message on September 13th  The security update will be applied to some of your files. You'll even see well  I'm gonna see this because you getting this I've seen it did yes  I can pull it up here Google's changing the way content sharing works on Drive Drive files. Oh, yeah  Look at that. It's right at the top have two sharing options. I should see if let's go to my drive  Let me just see see I don't have a little refresh  See no, no, apparently they're not gonna do it to me, but it's rolling out  We're gonna do it to you though and Leo  You need it  zero  There's two sharing options a single-person allow list  Where you share Google Doc with specific accounts? I use that all the time. I do too. That's what we do, right? Yep  And a get link option where you get a generated link which you can then paste into a message  I do that a lot too. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do both it's part of being a producer. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The get link isn't actually private right if somebody could guess it. It's just an unguessable. Yeah, it's just super long  I'm probably not gonna be guess. Yeah, I suppose so it's it turns out. Oh surprise. The links are actually guessable

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm gonna check that out. There's probably a tool that someone you know created or figured out  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To sell the scheme this this is an article describing this from veronis.com security site  so  Google responds. Let's see  by  Doing this update  It's also by the way, that's the same thing with the YouTube links when you get a you can have an unlisted YouTube  I use that all the time. I'll put something on YouTube, but I won't list it right so that it's quote private  But it's not and if it's guessable, it's really not private right  In  2017 YouTube rolled out an update to the system that generates new  Unlisted links which included security enhancements that make the links harder to discover. That's what Google is gonna do  They did it on YouTube in 2017  That's presumably what they're gonna do and drive to it adds a the new link scheme adds a resource key  to the end of any shared drive links  so  It's just another big long hash

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We took your long hash we doubled the size we replaced it with another even longer  That's oh my gosh  Yeah, that's really what they did right? Yeah resource key equals, okay  Whatever you got to do to make it more secure. Yes, it doesn't doesn't matter to me, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there so if you head to  Update drives in a browser you'll see a list of your impacted files if you mouse over them that I presume those are files  You've shared that way. Yeah, you'll see a button to remove or apply the security update  And that means after September 13th that link you shared with people will no longer be good. You'll have to  Send it again with the new resource key  Apparently I haven't done that maybe that's why I'm getting that you must have yeah, I have there's a couple that I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On my personal drive that were just is easy for me to share it to them with a link versus trying to  Send the whole file and stuff like that. Yep. Yep. You remember that great

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Technology Google showed off at Google I oh about 18 years ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Duplex how long it was that was to you. Oh, yeah, it was probably two or three. It was three Google Ios again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah three three IOs ago. Hey, you're now gonna be using it for fast checkout  So hi, can I help you quickly check out  And I don't know are you gonna say yes, I don't know so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so this is  Probably working with select sites. Yeah on the processing the one or five Google has a picture of hot topic comm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, okay. Well, then I'll definitely use that's where I get all of mine  crop tops

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  T-shirts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi, can I help you quickly check out and then there'll be a button that says fast checkout  you'll have to you'll have the option to disable it entirely or skip it just for that purchase or do  fast checkout you'll have to agree to Google assistant and Chrome and  The Google fast checkout in a few taps capability then it'll show you your contact info payment method and shipping address  Is this it is this right? Is this where you want to go?  Huh, huh, huh, and then you say yeah, so it's gonna walk you through the check. It's like it's faster

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's what I'm wondering is an auto fill  assisted by  Well assistant and that's kind of what it sounds like well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll be able to turn it off remember when I was telling you about China looking at us Americans and you're too lazy to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  check a box and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Confirm your dress you want somebody to walk you through it is that hard for us Americans to do this it isn't you know  But I guess is now I'm thinking accessibility. It's not for us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's for accessibility for people who are confused by the process sure and frankly  It's in Google's interest to make it easier to shop online. Yeah  New unified backup system backup by Google one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I said I'm a Google one user you don't need Google one in or even though  This is one of those  Situations where Google names something something and it makes it seem like it's one thing  But it's actually something else from for what nine to five Google says here  You don't have to be a Google one subscriber to benefit from this they are upgrading the backup system for Android  To include a few things what is it's more granular?  photos and videos

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice yeah  So you'll have a in your backup settings on Android now you'll is this Android 12 only or is it gonna?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's eight and up oh nice, and I don't know I think they're gonna  You know be bringing this into settings  I don't know if there's a companion app or how exactly that's gonna go  But everybody's gonna have a more comprehensive backup for when you're in a story your phone from their cloud backup  The one thing that's missing from here, which I still am very curious about is RCS  I mentioned this last night on the show RCS messages still not backed up by Google still very hard to backup  Using other backup apps  Right is that a problem? I believe that's that's the problem  But as more and more of these phones especially here in the US now  We've got all the carriers dedicating themselves to RCS or Android messages, so we're gonna have a lot of people  communicating via  RCS chat here in the US that means more messages in our app that are RCS  So how do those get backed up and I don't know because people are gonna want those backed up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even if it's encrypted, it's just a blob. Yeah sort of RCS data store. Can't you just take that blob and copy it?  Wonder what there's what the issue is I have no idea  You know might be okay. I have a thought  the key to that RCS encryption  stored on your phone and secure enclave  Cannot be caught I don't have access to that. Mm-hmm. So you could copy a blob that you couldn't decrypt, right?  Right, does that make sense? Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm-hmm  But people are gonna want those messages

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't encrypt them. Yeah, you said you wanted to encrypt them, but no you don't right?  Oh, yeah, totally you really want to back them up and let us  Duplex call you what you want. Tell me what you really want. You want user  Oh  Phones YouTube creators can oh finally apply to test the stadia crowd play bait  Yeah, this is one of the things that they touted with the rollout of stadia. Yeah, and now it's starting to open up audience  Participation says stadia like you've never seen it before  Crowd play allows your friends and viewers to jump into the game and play alongside as you stream  So you can give them a link that is not just a link to your video but a link to where you are in the game  And they can join your server and play cool. That is a really neat feature  I remember when they announced this I thought oh, that's really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but here we are a couple years later. At least we're seeing it  At least it isn't that removing the fence from photos. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you do have to apply and  You obviously have to have a stadia account and a Google  YouTube account and they ask you to list which games you'd be interested in  So I think you it sounds like you have to have cooperation of the game platform, right? Yeah, that makes sense  Android studio Arctic Fox  Is now available with wear OS pairing and jetpack compose. Would you explain this to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Deb talk, right? Yeah, this is this is all developers Android studio the next major version Arctic Fox  I couldn't tell you a whole lot about it personally  I'm not a developer but I'm assuming this means at least I'm hoping this means kind of some of the new wear OS

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The IDE for Android, right? It's one of the IDs and it's actually I think I don't know  I'm not a fan. I'm not a big IntelliJ fan. It's based on IntelliJ  But I think it's probably widely used in the Android developer community  And yeah, you of course if you're gonna have a new wear OS you got to have an emulator  Yeah, so I mean that's one of the things that comes with Android studio  I'm gonna play a little bit with flutter. I'm actually very interested. Have you tried flutter at all Kevin? Oh  You're muted no wonder we haven't heard a thing from him. Oh, oh, there you go. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I thought you were just ignoring me  I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I did walk off to let the dogs out a few minutes ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's probably what it was we heard a lot of barking and we muted you yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't played the flutter yet. No, I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dark plus flutter is their cross-platform  For Android and iOS development tool also lets you actually develop web apps as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty is pretty like platform things, but I haven't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just impressed. I'm impressed. You know, it's a framework and  It's very detailed I'm played I haven't gone deep into it, but it seems pretty darn good  It even has the capability putting in native  Widgets for iOS or Android so, you know all your iOS apps don't look like material design

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll just object oriented stuff all looks the same to me, sir. It is it just it does same. It's funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mentioned this other show but I I've been doing functional programming for so long  That when I'm looking at flutter and I'm see that you're assigning a value to a variable and then changing it  I'm going you can't do that  It's it's so funny how you get in your head  Oh my god, they're changing the value of that variable  What are we going to do?  I'll get over it and finally. Oh

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is related. This is jetpack. Yeah, that's just part of jetpack compose him. Okay, so this is a UI building tool  This is actually important to you know  If you're gonna nowadays when you're designing software really it's a lot of it is about UI and and all these widgets  This makes it much easier  to design

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  An interface. So yeah nowadays. That's what hooks people in  With the exception of snapchat snapchat did a  Really good job of keeping people  Interested in their app, even though their UI is by far one of the worst I've ever seen in my life

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's intense. I'm convinced. Oh, you know  It's a totally intentional. Yeah, because then the people who know are in the end  The club they get to be kind of hey, oh like their lead  How do you send this and they get say oh, let me show you and then you're in the club  And I think I'm totally convinced. That's Evans Evans Beagle's idea for  growth hacking make it hard  Impenetrable, but then teenagers will share it. It's just brilliant. I think it's brilliant. Keep those old folks out  I may be giving them too much credit. It might just be a sucky UI, but  So so jetpack compose 1.0 is out. It's official  and you can start using it in your Arctic Fox Android studio and  That's the hugel changelog  Let's see anything else to talk about  Jason I'm sorry. I just dumped a whole bunch of articles on you know this morning  Jason has to try to whip them into some sort of sense. This is nothing. This is nothing new

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm used to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Based my schedule around this and then I come in and try to figure out what the hell I did  Twitter is I'm sad actually is hired away the team behind it  I thought a really cool news app the idea was we will give you five stories. It's all you need. It was called brief  And and now they've you know added to their portfolio. They they bought nuzzle and killed it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what's gonna happen to brief. I still miss nuzzle. I thought nuzzle was great. I like great. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm a little sad tech crunch is calling this an aqua higher  Which is usually bad news. There weren't very many of them the startup brief was from former Google engineers  It was a subscription based news summary app  The sum of like into the old-fashioned newspaper where you know, you can you'll actually get to the end unlike the internet  You can actually get to the end of today's news stories. Yeah, I liked brief a lot  So I hope Twitter does something good  With it. They are piloting a shopping section. I haven't seen it yet for brands if you're using Twitter on iOS  You might see the new shop  Module this is just one more way Twitter's trying to figure out how the hell do we make money on this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This one the nice thing is that Twitter is doing this stuff in the amp which means I can ignore them because I use the web  version, right  They show them up they get can and then I know if they have to worry about them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They they are they are showing some good revenue growth so maybe maybe Twitter is has figure it out  Here's a disappointing one and I'm sure you'll Kevin be as disappointed as I am  Twitter revealed how many people use two-factor on Twitter and it's a stunningly low  2.3 percent  That's an increase of 9% over last year  So and of the people who use to two-factor of which again, it's only two by three percent  Use two-factor folks, please protect your Twitter protect everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this I do but that's too much for normal people. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't they don't make the connection of what the true value proposition is  Spend because it is it is inconvenient and it takes it takes dedication  To get beyond the inconvenience and get to a point to where it's just like second nature of the 23 people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the thousand on Twitter that use two-factor  80% which is what is that? That's like 18 or 19 of them use SMS, which is insecure

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Worst  Yeah, that's no good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't understand this. Oh, I guess oh you can have more than one way of doing it enabled  So 80% of SMS enabled I did disable SMS that was only recently added to Twitter because after Jack Dorsey got hacked

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just say they fixed it. So they have a feature they have you had to enable SMS first

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could use the other ones. Yeah, and then they now let you turn it off  But for a while you couldn't for ages you could you had to have SMS now  You can just use an authentication app about a third of users do that  And only point five percent use a security key

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we use a password manager and every now and then  Someone in the family needs the Amazon password and yeah  I just tell them go on the last pass and boom do your thing and then they get that  Oh, I need the one time password and I say yeah, that's on purpose. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, good for you here's the code because I have to confess there are a couple of accounts I turn it off so that Lisa  And I can share an account and she doesn't have to call me and say what's the what's the authenticator?  Have to solve that. There should be a way to family share authentication  I could actually if you probably when you create it, you both need to take a picture of it or sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you probably can but I like I like this that little bit of security and control right there  especially  Especially when you're dealing with credit cards

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely, absolutely  It's funny. There's so many forces trying to make you be insecure  Like the fact that you have to enter the password on a TV using a remote that was designed. Oh, yeah  So my Amazon password is shorter than it should be because I got tired of yeah  Again

You never get to do a pic of the week  Yeah, sitting there watching thinking why don't they man if I had a pic of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I would do. Yeah, meanwhile, this was one of those weeks where I was like, what am I gonna do?  So I'm going with something that is just kind of top of mind  I did talk about this a little bit last night all about Android  But I've kind of enjoyed this because I never really thought about so I have YouTube music  It was gone for about a week and a half  Traveling through Oregon did a road trip through some places in Oregon went camping and I knew I was gonna be going to this campground  That had no  Internet I was pretty certain that it wouldn't have any internet connectivity  But we want we like to listen to music and I didn't want to spend all night like creating a curated  playlist on my you know YouTube music account and  I don't know why it never occurred to me as probably something that's occurred to everybody except for me up until this trip  But in YouTube music you have a your likes  Playlist which is basically any songs that over the years you've possibly given a thumbs up to it  Just throws those those all into a single playlist and I I marked that playlist as a download  So download this playlist to the to the device. It was somewhere around 650 songs over the years  I've liked 650 songs apparently so it takes up a little bit of space  but I'm but it was actually a really awesome experience because  Because I never knew that existed first of all and once I started actually listening to this playlist  It's like I got to rediscover all this music that over the past 10 years  Yeah, I've liked in one way or another and then forgotten about and it's just been a really cool experience like getting to  Reminding myself of this music that I've kind of been missing I was like oh, yeah, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is a great song. I look at this and I think it's all over the place where the hell had my YouTube account

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So do you have your YouTube music's account set up to also?  You also don't have very many likes there but to import in likes from YouTube proper because there is a  Shut that off you can deactivate that because if you if you like  Anything that's  Potentially even remotely music related on YouTube proper it will then add it will then bring it in you end up with the weirdest

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have both the short and the long version of the sugar hill gang rappers to like beautiful  All right, I  Never even heard of some of this bill biv Davos do me do me that's a classic  I must have I must have been like either listening to it and fell asleep and hit the like button Wow or  It's just a weird collection although I want to thank you because this was a song that I liked years ago  And I could not remember  I've been police has been saying  Well, you know, it's African electronic music. I don't think Francis baby is gonna go after me for this  I couldn't little for the life me trying to remember this song  Just did me a real solid  Yeah, well, you know keep in mind what you're seeing I'm gonna get to know Bill Bev Devos

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My name is Bill Bev Devos  All this information came from Google Play music prior to YouTube music so nice it's probably about ten years old potentially

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I didn't have YouTube music at the time. Yeah, but I have to at some point  I really have to cut back  I have subscriptions for all of them and I rarely use YouTube music, but you know  What I do want is the YouTube premium and the music it's hard  It's hard to have that and then go away. I don't ever see an ad on YouTube ever. No neither do I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Premium we tried Spotify when when they forced everyone into YouTube music. I was like no, that's it. I'm done  Let's just do Spotify. Everybody's on Spotify and  A there was the ads on YouTube thing, you know  Basically, basically when I told YouTube music that I was done they gave me 30 days, you know  They gave me 30 days and change your mind  So I was really happy to have that because a the thought of not of having YouTube with ads at a certain point  I was like, well, you know what?  That's worth it because I use YouTube a lot and my family uses YouTube a lot  That's why I keep it and be what was so annoying for me  And I've talked about it plenty of times and all about Android is that we've got Google homes all throughout our house  And we've got you know  Our kids who want to listen to music and everything like that  There was no easy way with Spotify and I tried everything all right  To make it so that they could listen to what they want in one room  And I can listen to what I want in another room without it getting interrupted  We had a Spotify family account and it still did it and at the end of the day we're like, you know  What's a bug right? What's that? It's got to be a bug. I don't know some people say they can get it to work

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I couldn't and maybe Spotify only allowed you will have one one  Maybe I don't know a time because I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Family I have Spotify family because I opted not to go with Google YouTube music  Yeah, and on my phone I'll see notifications of Jake listening to something in this room  Versus me listening to a podcast on one of my low speakers or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, are you voice is everybody voice activating these things? Yeah, and it's so I don't know what the difference is  All I know is I try I wrestled with it and wrestled with it and it kept being just like this  Contentious thing in the house like ah you interrupted my music again  So finally I was like, you know what doesn't do that YouTube music. Yeah, so I'm gonna go back  It just made sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still have YouTube premium because I didn't want to see the ads because I watched as I've said before  There's so much stuff on there's so many ads and his words unwatchable and every time the stupid credit card needs to be  Updated or whatever I hear about it  Apparently everybody else in the house watches at least as much as I do the thing that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Resent and I mean the Charms saying this I pay an ungodly amount for YouTube TV  Could you please give me ad free YouTube? I agree on that. No with that  That really makes a lot of sense but not yeah, so 65 bucks. I do have to say my pick of the week is  at least for the Olympics  Upgrade if you have YouTube TV to 4k  It's going to be down the red a year if it's gonna be 20 bucks a month on top of 65. Wow, that's insane  Wow, but for now you get a one month free trial and the first year is only ten bucks a month  But at least do it for the Olympics because I have to say 4k  HDR on a lot of this stuff is  fantastic and I  The DVR for the Olympics is great. You basically I'm recording everything  Yeah, so it's really easy to add stuff and  I just so it's really helped us because the other thing is the recordings if you just say record all the Olympics  It's getting it from every NBC entity and will some and will have the earliest play  So in sometimes they're taped to laying for primetime, but you'll be able to see this earlier because it was played on you know  NBC  Alright 4k to in the middle of the night  Yeah, and so that's really nice so at least for the Olympics if you're watching the Olympics and you're a YouTube TV subscriber  It is worth you get a free month turning that on and I have to say they that looks good on my 4k TV  I so I know a lot of it is upscaled 1080 or  So some of it is down some of it is shot in 8k downscaled to 1080 for the transmission then bring back up to  4k it's  We got a long way to come but but but it does look I think a lot better  Especially on YouTube TV and you know what they're smart because I think I'm gonna get end up being hooked  Yeah, watching 4k of everything else that sharp not everything's 4k, but because of  streaming and because of the imminent  ATSC 3.0. I think a lot of even local news and stuff is gonna upgrade to 4k  And yeah, once you get used to that you don't want to go back. It's hard to go back. I want to go back  Yeah  Mr  Let's let's do Kevin Marks next for his pick of the week

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you made me think of a couple things that I mean the YouTube music is something I found  I actually found was good from

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm looking at the playlist it makes they're not bad. Are they they're not but also the point is you can play stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's on YouTube that isn't isn't label stuff, right? Which is also a great thing. So I thought one of my links is  It's a link to a blog spot blog, which is which is a wonderful thing to link to these days  It's a list of all the of all the John Peel sessions that are no kidding. Look at this  Don't know who John Peel is John Peel was a DJ in the UK who did the late-night show on Radio 1 and  He would get bands in to do recordings before they were famous  And so what you get is  Bands you've heard of and bands you haven't heard of as well  But what you get is early live versions of their songs, but you probably shouldn't play them because you're gonna get yeah  Shutdown you can play them at home  We can play them at home and also they and they they YouTube is it a radio show or is it just the songs?  It's a radio show. So it's usually just it's just the songs but they're on they're on YouTube and then you can  Thumbs them up and they're going to look at all this  but it is you know, it is like  30 years or so of  Recordings of bands just as just around as they were becoming famous and some of them would come back into sets later  Wow, but so it's often a version of a song that is a classic song  But it's a live version they've done in the studio the BBC. So it's not like listening to the live songs that you get  on  YouTube where it's a recording a scrappy recording from a  From a live gig. These are actually sort of recorded in a BBC studio by BBC engineers, but the band playing that so  They're often very interesting versions and you could play these on your YouTube music

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, do you how do you if you're doing it through the YouTube voice? Would you request?  peel session

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you if you just search for people sessions you do tend to find you tend to find that's the other two  You just have to peel session and the band name  If they were all like if they showed up in the UK ever then then this is a great link

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you for sharing this. This is a gold Wow  Just like deep deep cut stuff. Yeah, but a lot of bands everybody will know  I mean, there's some really yeah, you know if you're if you're an echo and the buddy buddy man fan from 19  You know, whatever 85 actually there is no echo. Oh there is from 1979  1980 1982 1983 you would this is great. This is like gold

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, yeah  Basically, he had the late night show on radio one and he would break bands  They send him in tapes and then he'd then he'd bring something to record sessions

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this goes back to the 60s some of it. Yeah. Oh my god. Oh  This is like early Pink Floyd playing live I would love to hear interviews too though, I wish  You know, it's not just the music. I would love to hear the interviews

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not sure I'm not sure you actually did interviews you think it was just like  It's not the tiniest green wood Mac from 1967 one of my favorite bands of all time. Oh, yeah wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what you listen to while you play a Valheim exactly that's the beauty of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your the soundtrack is done is yours

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's I mean this this is this is the nice thing about YouTube music in that it ends up having all these weird things other  People collate because of YouTube. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there's the other one that I like is there's a  Version of the Pink Floyd wish you were here that they recorded with Stefan Grappelli on violin. Oh wow in the next studio  Wow  It's like there's lots of random stuff on YouTube once you start poking around the edges of it. Mm-hmm. Oh for sure. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice. Very cool. And you also mentioned  Earlier in this show Douglas Adams hyperland that exists on archive.org you yeah, it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's it's an affair recording from the BBC in 19 real I 1990

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a huge Douglas Adams fan. I became aware of him when public radio in the US  Re-broadcast the original BBC  Hitchhiker's Guide and it was the best radio I'd ever heard in my life  And that made me a fan prior to the books and the movies and all that  hyperland Wow look  There's a Mac portable  This is great. Oh, I know what else I'm doing tonight. It's a time capsule

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, and it is fascinating because it was made is made by  Friends I've I work with we ended up working on a first startup is that when we left the BBC  But it was him trying to cut give across the idea that interactivity was coming  But the web had it into into consciousness yet because this was made in 89  So is interviews with with lots of you know, it has one of our Bush and it has oh really interviews with so this is nonfiction  It's not why it's it's nonfiction, but it's he's you know, he's telling it in his own weird way  so he tells it is he's having a dream and he throws his TV into a junkie and then okay and  and  Then the avatar guy shows up and talks to him  So it's it's it's kind of fun like walking to the air scrap heap and throwing the wretched object away

Love having you here and Pruitt as always wraps us up with his pick of the week

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll be brief the first one  They all sort of relate in my opinion  The first one is audiobook that I just finished a couple weeks ago nine nasty words by mr  John McWhorter and what I found interesting about it is that he goes into  Not just okay  we all know what curse words are but yeah swear words and just the differences between that and how they came about and  How they're used and how some people use them differently and how sometimes a bad word is not necessarily considered a bad word  depending on context it was  Really really interesting and it made me think about some situations  I've seen here in town with the with the hard heads and their teammates and the coaches and how they speak to one another  And I'm thinking man, there's no way I would have been talking to my yeah, you were brought up not to you  There was no way  You know there was times have changed a little bit right one time  Isaiah comes home and he says hey Andy wants to know if we can have a team meeting here at the house  And I'm like who the heck is Andy  He says the coach I  Say you mean coach so-and-so is a no his name is Andy  It's a generational difference. I'm like, dude. No, it's also California. Yeah, there's that too  But that book just just made me think a lot about those conversations I've had I love John

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm ordering but this is really good. He talks about some of that in his podcast, too  I mean, but oh I will be absolutely this man. This is his newest book and it's it's it's outstanding  Nine nasty words English in the gutter then now and forever. It was really really good  It's on audible hardcover and Kindle. Yep, but I like because he narrates his own books, which I really like and he's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so I will listen and I what I like about him is he's  He's not necessarily doing it to be liked by everybody because he's a lot of controversial things  You know, there's a lot of people that don't like what he has to say, but I listen to it  I'm like, you know what I get where he's coming from. Yeah, it's not gonna be popular, but I get where he's coming from  Yeah, so  And the next thing this made me think about another generational type of thing this article  This is from the German  German judo coach the Olympic team  He was slapping one of his participants one of his players before a match  She she requested it as part of alright, this is  Gang go time for me in this match  Pump me up coach and she shakes her and he slaps her in the face and there's video of it and whatnot and  people went wild and did not agree to it and the  Governing body at the Olympics raised the question said hey, we're not allowing that at the same time when I saw the video  myself I said oh  I remember when my coaches used to grab me and yell at me and slap me across the head and I absolutely  Loved it. I needed that, you know, it's it's it pumped me up. Yeah, she looks completely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cooperated she wanted it. She asked for I mean, that's a bad phrase to use in this context  But right but but this was something that they do obviously and she was expecting it was on not unexpected, right?  And she said thank you at the end  She nodded and said thank you and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Saw that and saw the reaction from the press and I'm like man. This is just a whole different  Generation of things and people have disagreed with me and I get it you can disagree with me  But I know I had some really really special  relationships with coaches in my past that I love to this day and  They we spoke that language when it came time to go out and run that race  That coach yelled at me a certain way that a teammate couldn't listen slaps me before every show I think it's  That's it. And so then this leads into my next video here  This was Max day with the hardheads and I and if you turn up the sound you can hear I'm talking to myself  But then I couldn't stop laughing because if you look at my hardheads face, let me just do some math here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's one two, three, four five six  forty-five pound weights  45 pound bar  So there's seven times. It's 280  315 pounds and there's more there's a couple of why you even bother with the five?

Transcript:  Man, but if you listen, I'm talking to myself

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because that's just part of me. That's how you do it. Yeah, if you if you slap yourself if you could right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there was a guy in there in the gym that was pretty loud and he was sort of getting in my head  It's just part of motivation and that the way that coach was helping out his player and the way she wanted that help  It's just something that stuck with me. I'm like, yeah, I get where she's coming  Yeah, although but the face I wouldn't want to be slapped by anybody could bench bench 380. So don't hit me, please  We've been lifting for about a month now since the gyms open back up has he and he enjoys doing it with you  That's a nice father son.
