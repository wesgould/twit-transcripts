Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Welcome. We love having you on.  Yes.  There's always stuff right up Kathy's alley.  We need the attorney.  We also need the king of the open web.  Our good friend Kevin Marks is joining us  from IndieWeb.org,  from his home on the Moors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I did climb up a hill this week,  so I'm going off by taking a photo up on top of the hill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Great to have you, all of you,  on a sad day in America.  Sad to say they never seem to stop, unfortunately.  You know, last week, 10 days ago,  11 days ago when the Buffalo Massacre happened,  we heard people blaming Twitch and 4chan  and Discord for both radicalization  and communication and so forth.  I think again they're saying  there is some involvement with...  You've got to stop blaming the internet for this stuff.  That seems to be the least culpable agency here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think, Leo, that the conversation has shifted.  I think that I've heard a lot more about Tucker Carlson,  about Murdoch, about media as a whole,  and less about the internet per se.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll be honest, I will defend  Tucker Carlson's right to say whatever he wants.  Oh, he can say whatever he wants,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  doesn't mean Rupert Murdoch should be paying him to say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, or Rupert, I mean, I guess,  he owns the presses, so I guess he can say what he wants,  but that's protected speech,  but that doesn't protect him from  blame and enigmany,  you know what I'm saying.  None of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem is the outrage conflates the issues,  so I get very nervous about,  okay, great, people aren't kicking the internet  and my job is to protect the internet,  okay, that's a relief,  except they're still taking issue with  some things that are First Amendment protected,  because I don't think people see the difference of the toggle  between there ought to be a law that ought to be illegal  versus that kind of crap up with which we should not put.  And I think that's a very different question  about what we should tolerate as polite society,  as acceptable messages within our midst  versus what we should have a law  to make sure it can never be spoken.  And because there's not a good understanding  of that difference,  you end up seeing things that are,  we should ban Fox News,  and I think we should not watch Fox News,  but that's a very fundamental, different question  of saying that the government should step in  and make it impossible to watch Fox News.  Yeah, I absolutely agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely agree.  In fact, in some ways you can,  I mean, honestly,  I'd like to blame the judiciary  that released Kyle Rittenhouse  after he used an assault weapon  on people on the streets  and found them not guilty.  That was a message to 18-year-olds all over the country.  It's okay.  So, I mean, there's lots of blame to go around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to blame my cable company  for making me pay for Fox News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good point.  Good point.  That's an interesting distinction.  You could, we could push cable companies  as its customers to stop carrying crap like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, or even not that.  Even, you know, they're not carrying RTE anymore,  so fine.  They have a right, just like Twitter does,  to decide what they carry,  what they don't carry.  You can't stop them legally,  but we could as customers say something.  We could have an a la carte,  which has come up again and again and again,  but if you want to,  an ad boycott of Fox is meaningless  because the pillow guy is going to be there  no matter what.  Right.  And Murdoch doesn't really make his money now that way.  He makes it from subscriptions  either directly with Wall Street Journal  or indirectly through carriage fees and cable.  Right.  And if we didn't all pay for Fox and chose not to,  that would have an economic impact on him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin, you know, you're in the UK,  sitting on the outside looking in.  You lived in the US for a long time.  Do people think we're nuts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, broad, I mean,  we had a school shooting in the UK  27 years ago.  It's a similar one.  We had somebody went into a primary school  and shot a lot of children.  And we passed a gun ban within a year.  And it was a handgun ban as well.  So, yeah, there was a response to that  and a legislative response to that here.  And similarly in Australia,  they've passed weapon bans as well.  Yes, yes, it would be harder in America  because there are many more people with weapons  and many more weapons,  but it's not impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have 5% of the global population,  42% of the global guns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think a third of America owns those guns.  So it's once again,  as we constantly see these days,  it's the tyranny of the third.  And today somebody on Twitter said,  I'm a proud non-gun owner.  People talk about they're proud gun owners.  What does it mean?  Well, I'm a proud non-gun owner  and I'm a proud non-gun owner.  I have never fired one.  I never intend to.  Yeah, maybe it's time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, for a long time,  we've kind of a little bit cat-tat and said,  well, you know, we have the right,  the Second Amendment, blah, blah, blah.  Maybe it's time to stay.  No, no, you know,  it's time to stop.  Let's, you know.  I think there's a low-hanging fruit  we could go for first.  The problem is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is the conversation is so polarized,  where, okay, let's accept that there's  an appropriately libertarian argument  for why certain weapons should be ownable  by the population.  But it doesn't necessarily mean that it extends  quite as far as it's getting extended.  I think there's a lot we could do  before we actually start bumping up against  what should be the next step.  Bumping up against what should our  inalienable rights actually be.  There's a lot of sense you could bring  to the policy discussion to where  you haven't really interfered with the liberties,  but you have sort of maybe bottled up  some of the more risky consequences  that we keep tempting.  But we're not having a reasonable conversation.  Everything is very polarized.  All or nothing.  And I just don't think we're going to get  to something sensible if those are the two  polar positions and nothing can exist in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do, a little bit of a bright light, I guess.  The news media, at least as far as I can tell,  is not naming the shooter in the last two events,  which I think is exactly right.  I don't think there should be any glory  associated with this.  No one should mistake.  Well, that's the thing.  But all the mainstream coverage I saw  barely mentions the shooter, as is right.  As it should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the fringe media and the New York Post  and the brand new sentences are glorifying them.  Yeah, but they did worse than that.  Spreading the shooter.  No, yeah, they lied about the shooter  and they said they made up a bunch of stuff  about it that wasn't true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They named innocent people as the shooter.  So in a sense, in the accurate information,  people have been making stuff up  in a way that's actually causing harm.  So maybe it isn't really the way to...  It's hard to know what the right, most ethical  and responsible way to report on this actually is  because you're sort of damned if you do  and damned if you don't.  If you don't give credible information,  people gap fill and they gap fill badly.  So that's a problem.  But on the other hand,  if you give the credible information,  then there's consequences of what does it mean  for that information to be known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, well, I was just trying to give somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  some credit for doing one thing right.  There's no room for that in this in 2022.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we have to acknowledge it.  I didn't really plan to spend a lot of time  talking about it, but I think we do have to acknowledge it.  It's such a great tragedy.  It happened 10 years ago at Sandy Hook  and should never have happened again,  never, ever happened again.  And it's time maybe to stop soft peddling this  and start taking a hard line on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Last night, this is going to sound ridiculously trivial  in this context, but I was,  last night, Fred Guttenberg, who's just heart rending  when he speaks about this was all with Nicole Wallace.  One of the parents of the Sandy Hook child.  Right, no, of Parkland.  Parkland, okay.  Whose daughter would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't it sad that we have so many that we confuse them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His daughter would now be a freshman in college  and he's watching his friend's children in college  where his daughter is not.  Last night, I won't do it for this.  I don't want to get John mad, but he used the F word.  And I thought, oh, I'm gonna, you know,  watch, MSNBC is gonna apologize for this  and I'm gonna get really angry.  And they didn't, and they put up video,  even though in the text they didn't use it,  but they put up the video.  And I dare the FCC to come and complain  about a passing obscenity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If ever there were an appropriate use  of strong language, that would be it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly, and so the other thing that's interesting,  I don't know if you saw it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because you were on your air quotes air,  I'm floating through the air.  Beto O'Rourke.  Yeah, Beto interrupted Governor Abbott's  unseemly fundraising event the very next day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right, which I think was great  and I think we're at a take no prisoners moment  on this independent conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of how I feel.  I feel like, yeah, I see a lot of rhetoric,  especially from senators who have to deal  with it, and I see a lot of people  who are saying, well, maybe we can do some minor compromise,  we've got to do something better than nothing.  You know what, vote the sons of bitches out in November.  Period.  It is time to say, for the majority,  to stand up and say no more.  Period.  And it is the majority.  It is the majority.  And you know what, they're going to keep  taking money from the NRA.  The NRA is going to have its say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought the NRA was bankrupt, by the way.  I really don't understand that.  They gave $13 million to Mitt Romney.  I literally thought they were bankrupt.  Where's this money coming from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's talk about the Florida social media law,  because, Cathy, you've got an article  in this week's Tech Dirt about...  You know, and the way that Tech Dirt capitalizes titles  is really good.  The problem with the otherwise very good  and very important 11th Circuit decision  is the Texas social media law.  So, first of all, is SB 7072 like the Texas social media law?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, so we can't escape this conversation  not talking about Texas.  Texas is also going to be relevant  to what we're talking about.  And Texas just filed something at the Fifth Circuit  saying, our bill is totally different than the Florida one.  So this 11th Circuit decision  that largely flew throughout the Florida social media bill  the Council for the Plaintiffs who are challenging it  submitted as supplemental authority  like, dear Fifth Circuit,  while you consider authoring an actual decision  about how you want to adjudicate this appeal,  you might want to know that your fellow circuit over here  took the bulk of it, the bulk of the law  that was trying to regulate content moderation in general  and said the 11th Circuit found that it implicated  the First Amendment rights of platforms.  So they just went back to the Fifth Circuit and said,  by the way, you might want to know that  that's how a fellow court decided things.  How bound is the Fifth...  These are both federal courts of appeal,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but is the Fifth in any way bound by what the 11th does?  Are they completely standalone independent?  So they are standalone independent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The 11th Circuit would be regarded as persuasive authority,  but the circuits are free to do what they want,  except they're all supposed to follow circuits  precedent and national precedent.  So if the Supreme Court has actually articulated something,  then the circuits are all bound to...  They can't...  They're not supposed to come up with it.  They have to be consistent with what the Supreme Court said.  Now that gives you a lot of wiggle room as a court,  because then you basically try to argue  that what the Supreme Court said  is inapplicable to the case before you,  but they're supposed to follow that.  So when the 11th Circuit looks at Supreme Court precedent  and says, based on the things  that the Supreme Court has said before,  when we apply it to this type of law,  we think that there's a problem.  It's bumping up against the First Amendment interest  of the platforms,  and we've decided that's unconstitutional.  But the problem is,  and the reason we have to go back to Texas,  is so both states had their own laws  that they came out...  Florida had their law,  which involved the weird theme park exception  where it applied to all platforms,  unless they happen to also own a theme park  as part of a law.  The theme park is part of their corporate assets.  And Texas had...  Which by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  given how Governor DeSantis feels about Disney these days,  they probably wouldn't have left that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, they had took it out.  They actually literally took it out.  They amended the law  while it was getting in the appeal process.  They actually took it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't like you anymore.  You're too woke.  We're taking you out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they took it out,  and then they wrote to the court  while it was busy chewing on this decision  to update the court to say,  by the way,  the theme park exemption is no longer in the law.  Oh, that's hysterical.  But it's kind of like,  from the other side,  the people challenging it,  it's kind of like,  yes, they're right.  This just shows how arbitrary and capricious  and how offensive it is  to First Amendment editorial judgment  that you would toggle it about  who your political enemies are  and this is who you're going to target with your law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was the show title last week, Leo?  I don't remember.  What was it?  About laws that are made just for one party?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this a quiz?  I was only half here last week.  I don't remember.  Oh, no, it wasn't last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, hell, it was last October.  It was the week before that.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, the gotcha moment failed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It did.  I just got myself, yeah.  Bill of a tanger.  Bill of a tanger.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good old Bill of a tanger.  Who could forget him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  William Ong.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So both states had these laws  that kind of did slightly different things.  Like they had a slightly different focus.  Florida's is more about journalism  and political campaigns and Texas.  Maybe that was the political campaign.  They had a little bit difference in their orientation.  But basically they were fundamentally  that the state wanted to tell big tech platforms  how they got to do their moderation  and put a lot of voter's requirements  that would take away their ability to do it freely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's be in the new spirit of calling things  what they really are.  So the first one was don't ban Donald Trump  from Twitter law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it boils down to how dare you.  And others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But yeah, you're not allowed to ban Donald Trump  from Twitter law.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So both states.  I've got a question for you.  You keep going with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to have a question for you.  Keep going.  Okay.  So both states had laws like these  and both states laws got challenged.  And in both instances, district courts looked at them  and said, we're going to enjoin this,  or at least most of it,  because we see that this is conflicting  with the First Amendment rights of platforms.  So the laws were enjoined.  Nothing could happen with those laws.  Then each state appeals,  because they're unhappy with that.  They want their law.  So Florida appeals to the 11th circuit  and that appeal was heard first.  But then we were waiting for a decision for a while,  which is not abnormal.  It usually takes a long time to get a decision.  And then Texas had appealed  and that was heard by the Fifth Circuit  in an oral argument that didn't really make sense.  That didn't really go very well.  It was very strange,  sort of some of the questions  being put back at the plaintiffs.  But then it quieted down,  but then all of a sudden out of the blue,  two or three weeks ago,  both laws were currently enjoined  and then the Fifth Circuit,  with no explanation whatsoever,  came out of the woodwork and said,  with a two to one decision,  we're going to stay the injunction,  which basically in this one line order said,  guess what?  The Texas law gets to go into effect right now.  Whatever constitutional effect it has be damned.  It wasn't going to talk about it.  It didn't explain why I thought  it wasn't defending the First Amendment.  It put it in and the Texas law is active law right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pending, of course,  it's still on trial and pending a judgment down the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pending that they actually issue a ruling  on its constitutionality,  which we're still waiting for.  So then this led to an emergency application  to the US Supreme Court by the plaintiff challengers  to say, hang on a second, we need some relief  because this is a really bad law.  We definitely think it's implicating  our First Amendment rights and how can this be live?  We can't even appeal it  because there's nothing to appeal  because there's no decision.  So we shadow docketed.  There's an emergency application  to the US Supreme Court  to ask it to give some relief.  And I wrote an amicus brief in support of this,  so I have shadow docketed too.  Oh, good for you.  And so now we're waiting.  Yes, this is quite of a big deal.  But unfortunately,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the justice in charge of the Fifth Circuit  is Samuel Alito.  Justice Alito.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now he did issue an order to make the state respond.  So the state had to put in a filing.  So there's some tea leave reading  that suggests that this is being taken seriously.  He could do two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He could send it back, say, nope,  not going to get involved.  Or he could then refer it to the other justices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not entirely sure what all the options are  because this is also really under-articulated.  The US Supreme Court is normally very regimented  with a ton and ton of rules,  including if you're filing, like as an amicus,  there's a ton of rules ordinarily.  But in this case, there's no rules.  They have some proposed ones,  but basically this is sort of like,  they're making it up as they go along,  which is really not something  you want to see in your judicial system.  But nonetheless, it's sort of as a litigator,  it gave you a little freedom of like,  I didn't have to like spend money on expensive printing  because that wasn't the rule here.  We just kind of shoved it in with like,  this looks reasonable.  I think they'll take it.  But this is really not how you want to do your litigation.  We're seeing more and more

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  of these shadow docket orders, unfortunately.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So where we are now is nothing's come out  of the Supreme Court yet.  Nothing's come out of the Fifth Circuit  to explain its order.  But early this week, the 11th Circuit,  I think rushed out their decision  and their decision took aim at most of the Florida law  to say this is really colliding  with First Amendment rights of platforms  and gave a very full-throated analysis  to talk about how a lot of the arguments  like common carriage and this, then the other thing  were like, nope, this is wrong.  You've really done something that's unconstitutional.  So it mostly continued the injunction  on most of the Florida law.  My tech dirt post is raising concern  that they didn't fully enjoin it.  They let a few provisions go through  and I think it's problematic that they did,  but it's not the end of the litigation train for that.  But that only shuts down the Florida law.  The Texas law is still alive  and we need somebody to give us some relief  or at least some explanation on why did the Texas law  get to go into effect, given that the 11th Circuit  has just articulated a very sensible basis  of why these types of laws are hugely problematic  and interfere with First Amendment rights of platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did Florida or will Florida then send that  to the Supreme Court or do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would not be surprised if they did,  but to do it, they would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who is the justice in charge of the 11th Circuit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, all the judges on the 11th Circuit  who rendered this unanimous opinion  were all appointed by Republican presidents  at some point in time.  One is a Trump judge, one is a Bush judge of some sort  and I think one was a Fort or somebody.  So yeah, so this was something  where even conservative judges looked at it  and said there's a problem.  Clarence Thomas is the justice

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  who would hear a shadow docket at the U.S.  Oh, jeez. Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So anyway.  Oh, I see what your point is.  Yes, you get what I'm saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who's the alito for the 11th Circuit?  It's Clarence Thomas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so the other thing though is  so I told you there were amicus briefs  that went in in support of this emergency application.  Most of them went in in support of the amicus application  but there's a couple, two went in in support of Texas  because Texas had to say,  no, no, no, our law is totally fine.  Leave us alone.  Nothing to see here, go away.  And they had two amicus briefs,  one of which was by Florida  and I think a bunch of other very red states  that showed up to say,  this is totally fine.  We should totally be able to regulate the internet  the way these laws are articulated.  So they've kind of already presented themselves  to the Supreme Court a little bit.  And I don't think it's a mystery to the court  what Florida thinks about it.  But the procedural posture of this is very strange.  It's always strange a little bit  because there's always options  and sort of like chess strategy that you get to play out  in terms of how do you litigate something  from beginning to end.  But it's definitely extremely strange  because we're in shadow docket land  and normal rules are not applying  and what the Fifth Circuit did  to in that one line order unleash a law  that there had already been a very articulate decision  saying was unconstitutional  and they just let it go out into the world anyway.  That's very strange from an adjunctive standpoint.  Let me ask you,  if these laws were about a newspaper

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  instead of social media,  would there still be the same back and forth over this  or would it just be, no, obviously, you can't do that.  There are some open questions about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what is the right analog to apply to the internet.  So to some extent, this is not completely ridiculous,  but on the other hand,  there's some really weird analysis of precedent  going on with this.  So I wouldn't even trust  that newspapers are necessarily safe.  We're kind of making it up as we go along.  That's where we are.  Can I ask another question, Kathy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I make the First Amendment argument obviously constantly  and that compelled speech is not free speech  is a tattoo of freedom.  Free speech is not free speech is a tattoo  I'm going to get put on my chest.  But I have a different basis for this question.  If a bar can say, I don't want to serve Leo,  I don't serve people in white shirts,  I don't like them,  you can't come in here, right?  They have that right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I should explain.  I am wearing a white shirt today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, sorry, for those who can't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The narrator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not some sort of euphemism for anything.  I just happen to be wearing a white shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The secret McKinsey consultant.  It's a white polo shirt.  But a bar as an establishment,  as a private establishment could say,  we choose whom to serve as long as you don't do it  on the basis of race and other protected classes.  Why is that not also the same for a Twitter  that we choose not to serve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I was getting at with my question too.  Are we tweeting social media as different somehow  from what standards would be for other businesses  or journalism, but apparently not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I lost the thrust of that question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's saying basically a business can say no to Leo.  I would say you can't tell a newspaper  what it can or cannot do.  And that seems like established law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how can you suddenly tell Twitter  whom they must serve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the argument that Texas and Florida would make  is that they start to throw out two ideas,  both of which were fully rebuffed by the 11th Circuit  and correctly so.  One of them is this idea that social media is,  quote unquote, and I use it in quotes derisively  because I don't buy this at all,  but it's the new public square.  And that if you are the new public square,  you have a different sort of duty to all comers.  And this is the second idea that they throw around  which is, oh, and you are a common carrier,  so therefore you must take all comers.  So they basically try to look at these businesses  and say, oh no, no, you're not the bar anymore.  You're something special because you're different  and you're so integral to the functioning of modern society  that you are now subject to additional regulatory burdens  that strip you of editorial discretion  and now you have to serve all comers.  Which leads you even farther down the path

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that you would have to accept everything,  everything legal.  Yes, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, one of the things that's been argued  in these appeals is,  and it came up like Wallace was getting litigated,  the emergency application to the Supreme Court  was pending when we had Buffalo.  And there was the issue of the culprit had live streamed it  and Twitch took it down.  And there's a very arguable case  that under the Texas social media law,  it was not legal for Twitch to take it down.  That's a really terrible situation we're in.  If platforms really have their hands tied  with some really awful content,  cannot be removed because there's liability associated  with removing content.  Like this is not the world we want to live in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But again, it's very clear that neither legislature  was thinking about things like that.  They were thinking about Donald Trump.  And these are very purpose-built,  jerry-rigged,  with the most ridiculous arguments,  laws, that baffles me  that they are getting any  protection at all from the courts.  Well, I mean, the only protection  they brought in is the hit-surf.  If Apple says Leo can't come to an Apple event,  there's no one to say that's,  I mean, no one would reasonably say that's illegal.  Not you, Leo, it's your wardrobe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it seems to me that's well-established precedent.  And the fact that they're coming up with these  Fakatka ideas that it's a public square  or it's a common carrier,  it's BS.  And I'm amazed that the Fifth Circuit  could even countenance that.  Well, yeah.  And it's not entirely clear to what extent

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the Fifth Circuit, how badly it got it wrong  because it hasn't shown its work.  So we don't know quite how badly it got it wrong.  But I think that's the problem.  I don't know quite how badly it got it wrong.  Why is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that a new thing, too?  I mean, I guess if you have a full ruling,  you write an opinion.  That's the problem with the shadow docket, too, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That there's no opinion.  Yeah, there's a very...  Judicial processes,  we've known it has...  I mean, it evolves over time, but it's definitely  been taking some very sharp left turns.  I don't mean left-right in a political sense,  but just sort of like all of a sudden shifting from  stayed boring, evolving slowly,  and to all of a sudden some pretty  radical changes of how things happen.  Which is ironic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These are originalists  and constructionists doing it.  That's what's hysterical about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, and originalism is like...  So-called originalists, yeah.  I mean, and the originalism runs into a problem because  they're all like, well, this is what was true in 1780.  It's like, yeah, but we also had the Fourteenth Amendment.  But they're not originalists.  We had to tune things up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're not constructionists. It's obvious.  They just use that as cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The judicial process itself can change  without really offending the Constitution.  The problem is, it depends what it's changing into.  And right now it's changing rather radically  where they're changing the rules on the fly  in a way that forecloses the end  they want to actually achieve.  Process tends to beget substance.  And so very sort of,  oh, this is just a change in how we  judicially process this case.  All of a sudden is having huge substantive effects.  And the Fifth Circuit in particular  has been very troubling in sort of  how it's been handling itself.  And it's then feeding into the Supreme Court,  which then also has been changing the rules  about how it processes cases.  And all of this has been having tremendous  substantive effect. And all the lawyers  who like litigating these courts are kind of like  throwing up their hands of like, I don't know what the rules are anymore.  This is, and I will get back to it  because I think it's a fair accusation,  it's turning the courts into Calvin Ball.  And this is not a great way to have rule of law.  The fact that like, you know, I can train as a litigator  and I'm still in the dark about what it would actually take  to press a client's case.  That's not an okay position to be in.  Like all the skills I have are kind of like,  yeah, maybe they're useful, but it's a whole new ballgame now  and it's not supposed to be a whole new ballgame right now.  Kevin, do the Brits think we're crazy?  Every 15 minutes we'll just ask Kevin this question.  Kevin, do the Brits think we're crazy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  You have your own, you have the Snoopers charter.  Your own worst thing going on right now is a party  at number 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what's turning the country apart now.  That's better.  Yes, well, I don't have this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A party that happened, yeah, a year ago.  There is no First Amendment in the UK, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or in common law, is there?  I mean, it's not a...  It's a U.S. constitution.  It's not a...  It's a U.S. concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there isn't an equivalent of a First Amendment  in the same way.  There's a reason people sue for libel in London.  There's a reason people sue for libel in London.  Because the libel laws have got a different basis here.  Because the libel laws have got a different basis here.  And if you're being sued, you've got to prove  you didn't say something defamatory, which is tricky.  Right.  And the defenses are different.  So you can make a defense of truth, but you can't make a defense of  public interest in the same way, I think.  Which is why you have such fabulous tabloids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is why you have such fabulous tabloids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although in England's credit, England  had Blackstone  that came up with some common law rules  that actually were protective of free speech.  So for instance, in America, under the First Amendment,  prior restraint is not supposed to happen.  And we got that actually from England.  That predates the United States  that Judge Blackstone had articulated  that restraints on speech prior to adjudication  is not something that  the concept of free expression is not supposed to be.  That the concept of free expression could tolerate.  And we took that and  we've had other decisions that are consistent with it.  Which in my Supreme Court brief  is a point that we made  that this order that all of a sudden lets  a law challenge  the free rights of free expression  is all of a sudden being let loose  with no real adjudication  about whether it's okay or not  starts to have qualities of prior restraint to it  which really shouldn't be allowed.  This is First Amendment free speech.  You've got to take care of that.  Because you can't ring the bell  once you've chilled speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Judge Blackstone's commentaries were published in the 18th century  in the UK on British law.  And presumably were read and understood by the founders.  So that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other person read and understood by the founders  was my hero John Wilkes.  The great troll.  And if you really want to have fun  study his history.  And some argue that the Bill of Rights  was a great measure inspired by Wilkes.  And the rights he fought for  being frankly quite a jerk in print  but it was his right to be so.  Okay let's take a little break.  I hope you've enjoyed our little

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  law class here.  This is fun actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love having Cathy on.  Later on you'll watch me bag Leo  to show you a charming moment from TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's after a few minutes.  Still to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Charming moments from TikTok?  That's Jeff's favorite.  That's Jeff's favorite thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's a troll in his own right.  Hey.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got a topic for  I'm sorry I've got a topic for Kevin too.  Good. That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin you started as a coder.  You were at the BBC writing code for them.  Went to Apple.  Worked on QuickTime there.  Do you get to code at all anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I was doing some coding.  I'm actually writing some code for the BBC at the moment again.  Nice.  I'm doing a bunch of freelance things at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you write it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What language do you like to write it in?  Whatever I need to write it in.  Currently I'm writing stuff in Node,  PHP, Python.  JavaScript.  But also I've done  C and Java.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you remember the first language you learned?  What was it?  Basic.  Basic on the Timex or the BBC Sinclair?  Look at that.  Not only does he have it,  he's got it at his feet.  Oh look at that.  Is that the Sinclair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Illustrating Basic  which was a handwritten book  about how to write programs  that was published in 19...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He went all the way back to the pre-Gutenberg manuscript area.  You know what's funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have my Kernahan and Richie  the C programming language  from pretty much the same year I think.  Annotated in  ink by me from way back...  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, do I have to go get mine?  Because I got one too.  I have a Kernahan and Richie.  You do? Do you write code?  Well I was a web developer  so I wrote a lot of front-end...  Oh yeah, this is what I did before I went  to law school.  I mean I didn't do as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You reasonably figured out that the internet  and the web wasn't going anywhere  so you were going to go to law school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was alarmed by people  who didn't understand the internet  or how people used it  nonetheless regulating it.  So I went to law school so I could

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  help them not regulate it badly.  We need you. That's great.  I'm so glad you're doing that.  The reason I ask is our sponsor today  a lot of us learned basic  or C in the early days.  Our sponsor today, Code Academy  back then  might have been the way to learn.  If you've wanted to learn how to program  if you wanted to change your career  with Code Academy  you can learn to code  on your own terms.  And I've taken their Python courses.  They're great. Over 50 million people  I'm not alone already know that Code Academy  is the best way to learn to code  because Code Academy not only teaches you  job ready coding skills  it also helps you build unique projects for your portfolio  That's very important to get that first job.  You get a certificate. You can put on your LinkedIn  or in your resume.  You can even prep for technical interviews with Code Academy.  When I  wanted to brush up my Python  I went to Code Academy for a couple of reasons.  One, you're coding from day one.  Right away.  The very first thing you do is write  and submit some code.  They have Python. They have Javascript.  The HTML, CSS.  They have SQL.  Go there and you say, well I don't know. Do I want to be a full stack engineer?  Do I want to do front end, back end?  Am I interested in computer science?  Am I all about statistics?  I've got a great suggestion for you.  They have a programming personality quiz  you can take.  It will give you tailored career advice  not based on what you know or your mathematical ability  or anything like that.  But on your strengths and interests.  On your personality. I took it. They said  computer science is the way to go for you.  Lisa took it. It said statistics.  You're a number.  It was absolutely right.  Code Academy can point you in the right direction.  Get you coding fast.  You choose what you want to learn from basic websites  to artificial intelligence.  Everything in between.  And no matter what your experience level  you'll be writing real working code in minutes.  In fact, if you've never written any code  I kind of envy you.  This is the, you know, really the best  I cannot really recommend learning basic first.  This is the best way  to get started.  Not typing in code from a magazine.  We were talking about that earlier today.  You'll learn how to code right.  With an interactive platform that helps you learn by doing.  You'll get a certificate of completion  which is a really handy thing to have  to get that first job.  Web development, programming, computer science  data science.  If you want to learn a new skill. If you want to just have some fun.  If you want to troubleshoot tech issues.  If you want to transition into a new career.  Code Academy is a great place to do it.  Join over 50 million people  learning to code.  That's kind of amazing.  What a number.  At Code Academy, see where coding can take you.  Get 15% off your Code Academy Pro membership.

There's the old Japanese proverb  that the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago.  The next best time is today.  And I feel like the best time for me  to have learned Emax and Lisp  was 40 years ago.  But I love it now.  And I figure this is a lifelong, for the rest of my life  I'll be learning Emax because  you never stop. But I really  I love it. I almost just want to not  use a GUI at all anymore.  I know it's crazy. It's nuts.  But  so be it. I'm a geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What can I say? I never quite got into the  whole Emax thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No I know. You're smart not to. Because it's  kind of a  it's a way of life.  It's a steep learning curve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Kevin, VI or Emax?  Which would you pick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd pick VI because I can actually use that one.  But I wouldn't pick it on purpose.  I'd use BB Edit or  VS Code is very good.  VS Code is great.  I use VS Code of the time but  I still use BB Edit as well because  it does a bunch of things well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love BB Edit. Actually the grep  is really good at deep diffing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, diffing is very good and grep  I use their grep all the time. If I have a large  text file that I need to massage  it's really great.  But I bet I could do it in Emax  if I only knew the chords.  Wait, Emax  you can actually use grep right?  Yeah, or you can use grep.  There was a  nasty  advent of code problem last year.  Where it was just  a massive, I solved it with a  massive grep problem. Smarter people did it  a little bit better.  Man, it was kind of fun to get deep back into grep.  Grep is such an  inscrutable language that  you probably shouldn't ever use it.  But if you can, it's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like the next question is  and what is your favorite shell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I use fish. What do you use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh me? I don't know. I think I was  yeah, I think I was tish or  sish but it's been a while.  I use oysters myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple's abandoned bash and uses z shell now  as the default.  Yeah, I'm using z shell because Apple switched it on me.  I like z shell. I use z shell for a long time.  But fish is a little, I don't know,  it's a little more modern. I like the way fish works.  Nothing's modern.  I think fish's motto is something like  shell programming the way it's supposed to be  in the eighties or something.  I can't remember that. It's ridiculous.  Alright, enough geeking out.  Back to the news.  VyCon, we were talking about this before  the show began.  Gary V, Gary Vaynerchuk,  who has been on the show  as a friend of the show.  He started as an early  podcaster with Wine Club TV  where he would make wine recommendations  because his family owned a wine store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I go to that store to this day.  That's where I get my sins met.  What's it called?  Wine Library.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Wine Library TV was his show  and then he somehow turned himself into  some sort of marketing guru.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody loved him because of the show  and he did a daily show  40 minutes a day  doing wines, which of course everybody loved.  And then they kind of came to him  and he ended up showing up at all these conferences  like, look at this guy who's doing this neat thing  who understands the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was kind of what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I know that, I must know everything on earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People say he's very popular

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because you bring wine to the conference.  Yes, that's true.  He would turn up at the conference with several cases of wine  and organize tastings for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To his credit, he took  his notoriety as a podcaster  and he created an agency  that does big stuff now.  A big advertising agency.  He created a restaurant reservation app  called Rezzy.  Sold that to American Express.  So he's done quite well.  And of late  he has become  I'm sad to say, like so many of my friends  he's fallen down the NFT rabbit hole.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, big time.  He is Alice in Wonderland  of NFTs.  His conference

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  four days in Minneapolis  was called VCon  VEEcon.  I mean he's now  VEEcon.  At the US Bank Stadium  our friend Shira Lazar was one of the  moderators there.  Kevin Rose who has  done very well selling  NFTs.  So it's really interesting.  Kevin bought in early into the  Zombie series. These are just little cartoons  you buy  and you kind of have some sort of  weird digital ownership of this  of this zombie.  And he bought it early.  It was one of the very first, I think it was the first  collection. He bought it early for  500 bucks.  At last count it was worth like $400,000.  So  then there was the Board Apes Yacht Club.  Similar idea.  They hire, I feel bad for the artist.  Because they hire some artist  for hire. Pay them a flat  fee to draw a thousand  Board Apes. And then they're worth  millions.  Kevin got together with  Beeple who's a well known NFT  artist and a few other.  And I think Gary was involved in this.  Created a group. They created Owls.  Right? Cartoon?  Owls.  Kevin had to post a video on YouTube a couple  of weeks ago saying, yeah I know  we made $50 million.  Notice he mentions it in dollars not  Ethereum. Not Bitcoin.  $50 million.  But we're going to do good things with it.  I promise you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At this point I'm feeling.  They also say like Gary says,  we're going to have cartoons with  this character. Like just thinking of  the funny snail  character is sufficient.  And you hear the Seth Green story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is going to end with a great story.  So at this conference  VCon Minneapolis last weekend  to educate  I'm using from the  racket Minnesota dot com  educate, evangelize,  shill and convert  people into true believers of NFTs.  Spike Lee, Pharrell Williams,  Kevin Smith,  Mila Kunis,  Eva Longoria, Seth Green,  Deepak Chopra,  Steven Ioki,  DJ,  Logan Paul, video  V YouTube star,  Liam Payne, don't know who he is,  and Snoop Dogg.  Six thousand  token holders from around the world came  to the seventy three thousand  seat US Bank Stadium.  Tickets to the event.  You had to buy a VFriends token,  crypto token,  which gets you into three years of Vcons.  The average token price  still around. Average token  price seven point seven six  ETH, which is one  thousand four hundred ninety six  one thousand four hundred ninety dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that now about forty dollars or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you never know. That's the  problem.  So let's talk about Seth Green as  a poster child.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I realize I'm going to need to say something  because the camera can't pick up me  rolling my eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Rolling eyes, rolling eyes,  rolling eyes.  Seth Green bought  a bored ape.  And now  that he is the owner of the bored ape,  decided that he would like  to make a bored ape  cartoon show.  Developed the show.  You know,  it was going to, I think, premiere on  where was it?  Some big network in  a few months until  his bored ape  got stolen.  His forthcoming  series White Horse Tabern incorporates  actors, characters from the actors  extensive NFT collection.  But a fishing  scam got him  and the scammer stole his bored  ape, which means he lost his  license to commercially adapt the  monkey. Though one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  actually could debate that as to whether or not  owning the NFT was in fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, here's the fear because it was then  sold on to somebody else. Bored ape  eighty three ninety eight.  Purchased from the anonymous scanner by  scammer by somebody called Darkwing  eighty four  for two hundred thousand dollars.  Then transferred it  to a collection called GBE Vault,  which happened like that.  Green has  located Darkwing eighty four on Twitter  but has failed to make contact  according to BuzzFeed.  Here's the problem. If the  cartoon goes ahead,  bored Darkwing eighty  four could sue Seth Green  because technically he owns  the copyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but counselor,  is that the case or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Eye rolls, eye rolls,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  eye rolls, eye rolls, eye rolls.  Like there's so much going  wrong here. This is not how it  works. And I know that like, OK, obviously  NFT is a technology that didn't really exist  and there's questions of how does existing law apply  to it. But a lot of people who  have no particular expertise  in how law normally work  are throwing it around and applying  it in ways that I don't think  it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't believe the Australian  surgeon who goes by the name Mr.  Cheese? You don't believe  him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I also didn't believe.  So Seth Green had a tweet that like  for 18 years I've been studying  copyright law in the business of law  and entertainment. I'm like, oh boy.  I mean, you know,  I can't throw stones at all, you know,  non-lawyers. Some people actually do develop  very sophisticated understanding. I look  to Mike Masnick as somebody who's not  a lawyer but understands it really, really well.  But one of the things you understand is like  it depends is fundamentally  very often the correct answer.  And if you think it actually comes out to  very strongly one way or the other,  that is kind of a sign that you might  be wrong because there's going to be a  countervailing argument for any argument  you want to make. I mean, but  then again, some of them are just so specious  that, yeah, they are garbage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, so I'm looking at the Board Ape Yacht Club  terms and conditions.  I mean, I don't know  how, I mean, is this legally binding?  This is a contract under which you own  your board ape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does it give you a venue? Does it give you  a choice of law clause in that?  No, that's the first I can tell.  I mean, you have a mess anyway.  Like this is a law school exam because  you've got some contract which may or may not  be binding. You've got copyright.  You've got state law, which tends  to apply to contracts. You have federal  law that preempts stuff, which tends to apply to  copyright. And these parts  don't even under the best days interact with  each other very well. And now all of a sudden you have  an awful lot of people with some nefarious activity,  possible theft, but theft  in a way that we might not actually be able to  describe as theft legally because it's ephemeral  and not necessarily physical. And which  jurisdictions laws are going to be doing the describing?  And like the issue  spotting is amusing. Like, you know,  me and my law friends could geek out on this  and, you know, have some, you know,  lengthy conversations that are very interesting.  But to pretend that there's any sort  of clear path of how this would all get resolved,  this is a, that's not  clear. And that seems like a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Mr. Cheese,  Mr. Cheese,  the eponymous,  anonymous, something-mas  Australian surgeon who owns  the Bored Ape.  Now, he's  Which one? That particular

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bored Ape? Or Ape or all Bored Ape?  The Bored Ape. The Bored Ape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, when it looks exactly like about  four others. Yeah, well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Making a cartoon out of it. He says,  I have no plans for the Ape.  I have no plans for the Ape, Mr. Cheese  added. As you can see, I've  been collecting for a while. I  bought it because I liked it. It wasn't  a cheap buy either, and it was not marked as suspicious.  So I bought it in good faith.  I'm happy to be in contact  with Seth to chat about this.  He spent  $200,000. I think it'd be fair  to give him a reasonable  profit on his purchase.  Although he has been ignoring  Seth's Twitter appeals.  On treaties.  On treaties.  I mean, the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  concept of ownership is something that  everyone's just sort of relying on when it's not  even clear what source of law would  even define ownership.  Whose source of law would define ownership?  And what is the effect if somebody  has purchased it who  wasn't good faith, was good faith?  You know, even the United States, if  you didn't know the thing was stolen  but you bought it anyway, you may not  be criminally liable, but you  might still have to give up the thing.  But that's less true in some other countries.  It's not even clear whose law  applies here, what law would apply  here. I think this is basically  just so lawless. This is just  a very strange way to have  some sort of really significant economic  activity riding on because most of the  time economic activity is protected  by having some sort of rules  of the road and it is not entirely  clear what rules of the road are guiding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every contract says where were you,  if we come to sue each other, in what  jurisdiction will that be?  And so on. The other thing  that gets me about this is that, and I see  I forget some time ago  somebody wrote a post about how this is the  ownership economy, as if this  is the, where it all goes.  I think it's the opposite. I think it's the last  gasp of stupid copyright.  Of the metaphor  of property for creativity.  I think that's  from Statute of Anne until today and then  I think it starts to die off into  something else. I've written about credit  right, about chains of  creativity. There's a lot of ways we could talk about this  but this whole idea that everything gets  owned and what you  own is this creativity  as a thing rather than an act  and a product.  I think it's outmoded. I don't think this is going to last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here is the  bored ape in question.  Well I can see  why you want to fight over this.  He is described as an ape in a skeleton  t-shirt smoking a cigarette  with a halo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not a cigarette Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a funny cigarette. Don't know.  Background purple, clothes  bone, tees, eyes sad,  fur brown, hat halo,  bored, unshaven.  Here's the whole  because it's the blockchain we know  the entire  history of the purchases  and so forth. We know who owns  it currently, GBE Vault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Reported for suspicious activity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Open C then, if there  is something like this and this was not on it when he bought it  but Open C once they heard  about all this has then  disabled purchase and selling  of it and has this  thing on it. Which as you know  now makes it all on the up and up.  So anyway.  You know honestly  it's hilarious. It's hilarious.  I feel bad for no one. This is a dumb way of doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  creativity. It's a dumb way to do  economics and it's a dumb way of doing creativity.  This doesn't vindicate  like this actually makes copyright look good  and I resent that.  Yeah, you got it Kathy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're right.  This makes copyright look good.  Here though, again  thanks to the blockchain.  We know exactly who owns it.  We know exactly who transferred  it. We know what they paid. All of this is  public.  You see Steve Ioki had it.  He sold it to Seth Green.  Seth Green then was  stolen from Seth.  Notice the red exclamation mark.  This account may be compromised.  To CAA090  who then sold it  to Darkwing  immediately by the way.  And Darkwing immediately  transferred it into the  GBE vault.  That's where it sits.  That's Dr. Cheese.  By the way, Cheese is not like  some new age  D.H.I. energy coming up  your spine. It's cheese. It's fromage.  It's  a nice piece of  monster. I'll be disappointed if

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  somebody doesn't write a book about this and call it  the Apes of Wrath.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what is, how much is 106  ETH?  I guess  it's $200,000  at some point. I guess at the point of  sale. And then don't forget the gas fees  which also have to be added on.  But look here, 41, maybe  you should have bought $41.75. I could buy it  now for 150 ETH.  You know what's sad is somebody drew  this. They're getting no  money for it. They got paid, you know, 50  bucks an ape or whatever. And that's that.  It's just so stupid.  We are hit, we have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  hit the... I mean there's  Brian Faisu has  sort of looked  into some of the artistic merits of  this NFT thing. And he's written some  very interesting defenses of  how this might actually further  artistic creativity and funding  and sort of actually put copyright  law to shame as it deserves regularly.  But, and I can accept  a lot of the arguments that he has, but that's  not what's happening. That's not what's getting  vindicated. This is a weird gold rush  mentality, rent seeking,  pyramid schemes, grift. This is  this isn't vindicating anything  of value. And it's  just neither an economic nor a  legal construct that solves an  existing problem. It just seems to create a whole  bunch of new ones. So I'm never a fan of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My attitude is if you want to support artists  give them some money. You  don't have to do this all BS  thing.  Oh hey, by the way,  this is going to be interesting.  This is just in from the San  Francisco Chronicle. Right after the  horrific  events in Ivaldi, Texas yesterday,  the California Senate passed a gun  control bill modeled on the Texas  abortion law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now, Mike Masnick  already said not a good idea. Private citizens

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  can file suit.  That's not a way to do policy, as Mike  said. No, it's terrible.  It's bad in Texas. It's bad  in California. But you know,  it's kind of hard to resist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right? Well, the only thing  so since I have no control  over this and it's  on its own trajectory,  this point, this helps illustrate  the tremendous damage that  the shadow docket on  SB8 had because  it puts states in a position where  they can do this sort of thing, which isn't  the way our federal union was supposed  to work. And that one thing of  like, yeah, go ahead, let SB8 go ahead.  No problems here. This is exactly the  sort of problem it tempted. And  in a way as a single  example, I don't necessarily mind it as  something hopefully salient enough  that can nip this trend in a bud  because otherwise I think we have  fundamental problems about how we're going to stay  together as a country because this really  is so corrosive on the bonds  that hold the states together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes. I presume  this will immediately be  I mean, it's, you know, it's obviously unconstitutional  just as the Texas law is. Oh, well, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's... However, if I  can jump in with other stupid  that's come from the California legislature  or that's working its way through the California  legislature. Like we've already  spurned the red states and their stupid  ideas of how they want to regulate the internet.  But California's got some too.  They're floating a bill about  creating a private rate of  action against platforms for  something alleged to be  called like that kids get addicted  to social media, which is  a highly, highly species  thing not supported by social  science. So it's questionable that there's  actually a legitimate problem to solve.  And the way that there is a pending  bill to solve it is  rather game  over for a lot of platforms  because it would really just sort of just open  them up to unending litigation from  everybody who has  really just no particular claim  at all, but can float a lawsuit to  go try to extract settlement money  from it. This has gotten through the  legislature, but it's now at the Senate.  And I wanted to highlight  that because the Senate really needs  to put the brakes on this. This is not something  that's good. And it's just because we've got...  But think of the children attached to  it. Nobody's putting the  appropriate thought into what the full implications  of this policy proposal are.  So it's here in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that might be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's a tricky one to fight.  This isn't something that children  have... The social science does not  support the claim that there is a problem  or that this would be the solution to any problem  that there might actually be.  This is kind of the  moral panics that come up every so often, that the  rock lyrics are too violent, the video games  are too violent. It's as  untethered to  social science as any of those  things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Snap.  Oh, Snap.  Oh, Snap.  Snap sends shiver  through ad stocks. We're talking about Snapchat.  Can you send a singular shiver?  A single shiver has been...  This is Martin Pierce writing in the information.  It's like a single eith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's one shiver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One single shiver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Snap's stock down...  It says 30 percent.  I think it was even more than that initially.  It was 40. Yeah, it was almost half  of its value gone.  Because it said, oh yeah,  ads are  second quarter revenue and profits  will be below what we projected a few weeks  ago, thanks to a faster  than expected deterioration  in macro economic  conditions.  Nobody's buying ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They allude to supply  chain problems.  And a friend of mine tweeted like,  what's the  breakdown in the supply chain? No more eyeballs?  What is it that they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can address that. Stupid glasses.  We see the same thing, which is companies  are reluctant to buy ads if they can't sell products  that are being advertised.  So if there's a supply chain  problem, it's  a follow on effect  from supply chain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, well their message was not clear  that they were having ancillary  effects to other people's supply chain  problems. The way they articulated  it sounded like they had a supply chain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's no lack of ads on Snap.  If you need one,  we've got a glut apparently.  OK, OK, so  I pay attention to this stuff.  When I see something like that, it sends a  shiver down my spine because  of course we also sell ads.  But we haven't seen the same drop off  by a knock  on  wood. But that's why we have Club  on Twitter, you know, to kind of smooth out  the shiver.  In fact, why don't I do an ad right  now? We've got a great panel. Kathy Gellis is  with us. She writes at Tech Dirt.  Also has a law practice at  cgcouncil.com.  C-O-U-N-C-E-S-E-L, like, you know,  like a counselor.  And is at Kathy Gellis on Twitter.  Kathy with a C. It's great to have  you, Kathy. Thank you for...  You've even got a new microphone just for the show.  So thank you. Just for the show. I appreciate it.  Also, great to have Kevin Marks.  Nope. There.  Kevin.  I threw John. I knew I would.  Great to have Kevin Marks.  IndieWeb.org is the site  he likes to promote because we all  want an independent  web. And we all  want to support web standards. You know,  it's really been interesting, Kevin, to watch Mastodon  take off after all of this Twitter  upset. Our  Twitter social has gone, you know, through the  roof as Mastodon Social  and the other Mastodon instances.  We've seen quite a flow again. Really glad to see  that. I'm a big fan  as I am of independent  web standards and IndieWeb.org.  So great to have you. And of course,  last and  least, Jeff...  Oh, it's just I like to tease you.  I love you, Jeff.  Of course, couldn't do the show without you.  He's the guy who shows up, so I got to give you credit.  Exactly. Yep. Ant's got the day off.  Stacey's got the day off. But Jeff...  Nope. Can't get rid of me. Can't get rid of  him. Petty, here I am.  We love having you on. You're stuck with him

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  insulting your shirt no matter what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a white shirt. I'm wearing, actually, it's a  bit of history. This is a ZD television  shirt, which goes back  to the early 90s  when Ziff Davis, who is no longer  but was at one time a well-known publisher  of magazines,  especially computer magazines, PC Magazine,  Computer Shopper, and  the like, said we should be in television.  And  they  gave me a polo shirt and said,  you're in it. You're in.  You're on. Right now. Go.  Polo shirt that, by the way, you cannot  wear on TV,  oddly enough. But they were new to it.  They didn't know. They didn't know. It's too bright.  Our show today, hey, let me  tell you, I'm feeling good today. I am feeling  really good today, and I can credit it to my  eight sleep...even this morning, Lisa said,  Wow, you were out last night.  Went to bed early, stayed in bed  till 8.30. I said, yep.  It was just too comfortable to leave.  Eight sleep makes  something we have on our mattress  called the Pod  Pro Cover  that has really transformed  the quality of my  sleep. You know, 30% of Americans  struggle with sleep.  And one of the main reasons is temperature.  Too hot, too cold.  Good sleep is so important for health,  so important for state of mind,  your heart, your blood pressure.  Even good sleep can even reduce the  risk of Alzheimer's.  Why are we having such trouble sleeping?  Well, I think, especially, you know,  in the summertime, it's too hot.  Wintertime, it's too cold. Eight sleep  is an amazing cover  that  checks your  biometrics while you're sleeping  and the temperature of the room, and then  adjusts the temperature of the bed.  And man, when I say adjusts, it can adjust it  as low as 55 degrees  or as hot as 110.  That's  pretty warm and that's pretty cold.  What's nice, and it doesn't, actually,  it doesn't swing that much most of the time.  What I do is I set it to be a little  toasty when I get in bed. It cools off at night,  which helps me get into that deep sleep  cycle. Your body really wants it  to be cool for that.  And then to wake me up, instead of an alarm  at 8 o'clock, I just have it go up a little bit  and I'm toasty and I wake up and I go  ready for the day.  Eight sleep users fall asleep 32%  faster and reduce  sleep interruptions by  40% and  overall get a more restful sleep. And they know  that because they've got the  biometrics to prove it.  Good sleep is the ultimate game changer.  Nature's gentle nurse  and I love  my pod cover. You gotta get it.  Pod pro cover from Eight Sleep.  Here's what you're going to do.  You're going to go to eightsleep.com slash twig  right now. E-I-G-H-T  eightsleep.com slash twig.  And because it's Memorial Day,  wow.  It looks like, I don't think I can  say the amount, but just go.  There's exclusive savings through June 6th  for Memorial Day.  Shipping in the US, Canada,  and the UK. Now if you're  hearing this after June 6th, the reason I want to say  is because I don't want you to be jealous.  But you can still get $150 out of checkout  by going to eightsleep.com  slash twig. But go to eightsleep.com  slash twig now or later  and get a great amount of  savings. You will want this.  I'm telling you. Yes, it has  two sides of the bed.  So Lisa, I think Lisa,  Lisa,  see there is an automatic  kind of sleep doctor thing.  And she turned it off and she said, no, I'm going to do it.  And she said it too cool last night.  And she woke up  and she said, I was freezing.  So she did not have  a good night's sleep. Let the eightsleep  choose. Don't override  it. But you do have different sides.  It didn't bother me at all. You have two  different people. Each side  of the bed based on your sleep  stages, your biometrics, and the  bedroom temperature.  Eightsleep.com slash twig to  check out the Pod Pro cover  and save $150 a check out.  Eightsleep.com slash  twig. Thank you so  much for supporting this

Transcript:  The holes. Yeah, people are  saying you have holes. Probably.  I mean, it's pretty old.  No, I don't think it's moths. I think  it's the mic clips kind of poked it in  there. I don't know. Somebody  says the mic clips. You're right. It does have holes.  But I still want to know where it just is.  You know, a bit of memorabilia.  I'm going to send it to Christina Warren  who collects failed  companies t-shirts.  Yes.  Alright.  Let's move along.  Big  Tech is getting clobbered  on Wall Street and the New  York Times is on it. The New York Times  says it's good for them.  I'm sorry. It's a good time for them.  What?  Flush with cash. Facebook,  Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google  are positioned to emerge from  a downturn stronger  and more powerful. Tripp  Milchel writing this  for the New York Times. He's, of course,  the guy who wrote after Steve. I interviewed him a couple  of weeks ago about that book.  He said they've lost 2.7 trillion  dollars in value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My FU money is saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  FU, Jarvis. Yeah, me too.  Now, I didn't invest directly in these companies.  I invested in the S&P 500,  which I have since learned  is heavily invested in Apple,  Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook  and Google. So  they lost  what would be the equivalent of the annual  gross domestic product of Britain.  This year!  Since January!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But...  Britain's lost about 10% of that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  So, but Tripp says  it's a good thing.  He says,  and he's quoting actually analysts who say  large companies  drops in prices  for Peloton, Uber down 45%  job cuts,  layoffs.  But  a little belt tightening  is good. During the great recession  Facebook, Amazon, Google,  Apple and Microsoft acquired more than 100  companies because they were

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  cheap. But now they're not  going to be allowed to buy companies because of antitrust.  Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess that's the  total upshot  of it, right?  They can buy stuff now, I guess.  It's cheap. Anyway.  Let's see. What else?  Jack Dorsey has now  officially left the building.  You knew that when he's...  He's not alone. Oh!  Others who stepped down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at the next line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very interesting.  Twitter shareholders vote  to kick  Silver Lake off the  board.  And what's interesting is Egon  Durbin, who is now resigning from  the board, is a long time musk  backer, a business associate.  Who supported Musk's  acquisition of Twitter.  So the shareholders... That's an interesting  signal from the shareholders.  They have to approve any deal  from Musk. Why are they kicking  Silver Lake off?  The shareholders don't like  Musk. You think it really is  a vote against Musk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what my thought is.  I don't know. Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it shareholders being

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  today? Is that why all this has happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So  Durbin threw Silver Lake  poured  $100 million into Solar City before  it was acquired by Tesla.  When Musk, remember,  famously said that Tesla is going to  go private, he was working with Silver Lake as a  financial advisor. Both  men serve on an entertainment  board of an entertainment company  called Endeavor, Ari Emanuel's  company.  So yeah, maybe this is a little  a little  subtweet signal. Yeah, a little subtweet from the  shareholders.  We don't like this deal. Although, what is  Twitter's stock at? I mean, at this  point, you're getting a hell of a deal.  Elon offered  $52.40. I'm sorry, $54.20.  The stock is at $37.16.  Some things are more

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  important than stock like the democracy.  But it's back up because  Musk is getting more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh.  Yeah, I think some of this was a  vote that Musk would not get.  His bid would not be  supported. And so they weren't going to  get the $54.20. In other words, the stock market  didn't believe it. But now,  and there has been a little bump today,  Musk says  he's got to get $44  million total.  He's got $33  and a half million.  You know what he should do is put a little  thermometer on the lawn at Tesla  that just shows how  close he is to raising. And next to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it is the stock price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This seems odd because he's  very extended in terms of his  Tesla stock and the Tesla  stock is dropping. So his ability  to convert what he owns in Tesla  seems, I don't know,  it  doesn't seem like it makes sense to follow each  little jump because  I don't think we know enough to know how this is  happening. But I feel like  I've seen more stuff saying, to suggest  that this is going to fall apart, than I've  seen stuff to say that everything is fine  and the deal is going to be consummated  the way it was articulated originally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you sad, Jeff?  Because I know you really think  Twitter is all that. And  obviously, this is not  good for Twitter. Whatever happens, and if  Musk gets a hold of it, it would probably even be worse.  Are you sad? Is that a loss?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it really is.  But I think it, you know,  I go back to Jack's tweet  a few weeks ago where he said that  centralizing discovery and  identity in corporations was wrong.  And I think that's  what we're seeing here. And in  fact, so I'm going to  I'm trying to reach out to  Blue Sky because I remain fascinated in that.  And there's two other interesting things. This is where  my story is for Kevin discussion, too.  Adam Asari,  from  the head of Instagram, did a Ted  talk, and normally I don't quote Ted talks,  but which he was arguing, and it's fairly  obvious that he was arguing that  blockchain will enable  creators  on any platform to have  a direct relationship, this is what he's advocating,  direct relationship with their fans,  their subscribers, their purchasers, their  call them what you will, their people.  And so what he's  talking about there is a shift to  protocol. What  Blue Sky is, is a shift  from company to protocol. Even  OpenSea, which was  criticized for still  being a centralized point in the supposedly  distributed world of NFTs,  is distributing now, talking  about a protocol. And so I wonder  whether we are potentially entering a  new phase of the net,  where Twitter may be a  sacrificial lamb to the  ills of centralized  ownership, and showing us  why we really don't want that, and we really want  to return to a world of HTTPS  and email protocols, and so on  and so forth, where we  have a more open  world. Now I'm sure Kevin can  poke holes in that little bit of optimism of mine,  but I'm hoping that this  is what we see coming. So yes,  I'm very sad about Twitter. I think  it's part of the public conversation.  It's a place where I have tons of friends, get tons of  information. I spend a lot of time  and I enjoy it, and I fear  maybe it's not going to go down. And  Andre Brock, the  great author of Distributed Blackness, has said  we're going to stay and we're going to fight, and other people  are too. And maybe we can  still do that, but it just feels like we got  cooties even being around Musk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, there's a couple things there. So  yes, protocols are a great thing.  I'm a big fan of protocols. I'm, you know,  I'm advocating for those, but  there's a pernicious thing now which  has been pushed by  A16Z and a bunch of other  people where they're saying, we're going to make new  protocols and there's going to be money in them and that's going to be  better. And actually that's going to make them worse.  We spent a long time getting money  out of protocols. The patterns  that were blocking us are actually doing interop  in audio and video for 20  years. We basically had to wait for them  to expire before we could do interop again  because the thickets were so thick in that  rules. And we spent a long time  actually reconstructing the sort of  social order of technology so that  we work on an open source basis,  on an open protocol basis now, most  of the time. And they're trying to turn the clock back  to the kind of patent pool nonsense  that dogged us in the 90s.  So that's,  I think that's the antithesis of  what you want when you're trying to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How does... Explain to me a little more,  Kevin, if you would, the money in protocol,  money out of protocol. What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is the Chris Dixon Web 3  thesis. So  Chris Dixon is going around saying Web 3, which  is not the Web, the Web doesn't have version  numbers, but he's saying we can have this great idea  where you have a protocol and  it's lucrative to create  protocols because you will get paid every time someone  uses your protocol. We should mention  that. There will be a huge market of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  protocols. Is a venture  capitalist at  Andreessen Horowitz, and  they are in fact the owners  in effect of Web 3. Go ahead.  Yes, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Web 3 was made up by  Gavin, what's his face,  in 2014.  But yeah, Chris Dixon has been hyping it  strongly. But his  supposed investment thesis is  we can create protocols that flow  value by attaching tokens  to protocols, which means they don't end up  operating at all. You end up having a bunch  of protocols that each got separate  tokens and then he can  sort of pump and dump those and push  them out to Coinbase and then make another one.  It's a non-starter. It's not  a good way to do protocols. The way you do protocols  is very hard and complicated where you actually sit down and  have to agree with people how to do things.  This is the opposite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't have to agree with you. I'll just make a token and  do what I want. Yeah, so it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  having spent  a large chunk of my time doing protocol  stuff. It's not about  we have a brilliant idea and we've written it down  and everyone will adopt it.  Basically, I've  said to people, protocols are not legislation.  Protocols are documentation. They say  here's how to do things.  If you want to work on the same  if you want to move data between these two things,  here's how you do it and here's the rules.  The trouble is we write it like legislation.  So if you actually read them, they say you  must do this and you shall do that and  you may do the other.  Because it's written in that form.  And so after people have  done that a bit, they think, oh, so if I can change the protocol  then everyone will then change the world  and that will do things. And that's when  your standards body gets bogged down in politics  and you have to throw it away and start a new standards body.  What do you think about Blue Sky

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in that context?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Blue Sky, I mean, Blue Sky  I like some of the people involved. I talk to them.  But  they seem to  they've been valuing originality  over utility.  They say we want to do something new and different.  And we say, well, here's how you do it with existing protocols.  Look, we've been doing it for 10 years.  Oh, but that's not new enough.  Yes, that's the point. The point is  that we know how to do interop.  Twitter-like interop with existing protocols.  That's exactly what Indie Web is about.  We've built  six or seven different protocols.  We've simplified  some existing ones. We've gotten through  the W3C. We've done a whole bunch of work on this.  We're getting people to adopt them and so on.  But  they're saying, well, we really don't want  to use DNS. We don't want to use  DNS in URLs. We're going to make up  some new signature thing that's  based on  cryptography.  You can sort of argue for that, but actually  it's really annoying.  You end up with things that aren't names. You end up with  things that are like long strings of hex digits, which is  one of the sort of nightmares of  all the  NFTs and Bitcoin, or  you've got two magic long  hex strings and you're supposed to give someone one and not the other.  And if you give them the other one, then they take your apes.  There's a  we have a way  to do distributed namespaces across the internet.  It's called DNS. It works  very well. There was a time where  we had to put some  political structure in place to deal with it,  which is ICANN. We have that now.  And making new ones is not actually  enormously helpful. Twitter got away  with inventing a new namespace, but  basically their namespace is  put twitter.com before this and then you've got the name.  And they've hit the problem that they're running out of them now,  so all the new names have got  six digits after them as well.  So we

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They address very nicely all of those people, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, you  remember, Jeff, we  link to each other on blogs. It isn't actually  hard to link to someone's blog.  Or even their post, but you can link to their name  and that works. And we've got  protocols now that when I link to your blog,  my blog  can tell you I've linked to it and you can  take what I've done and add it on to the end.  We know how to do that. We're  working with different groups to adopt more  of it. But it's  the challenge is not the protocols.  The challenge is people  trying not to interoperate.  This is exactly the problem I had  with OpenSocial  14 years ago, whatever it was, where  we did the work to get things  to interoperate and then everyone said  actually we'd rather not interoperate, we want to own everything.  Facebook did it  first and then Google said yeah, no, we want to do that too,  which is why it didn't work there afterwards.  And  nobody owns anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you agree with Chris's second point, which is  that the current web is  basically run by corporations  and the value of those. No, I don't agree with that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the web is fine. I think  the structure of corporations is a problem,  but the way you don't fix that  by more financialization and nonsense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. We already  have systems that are  democratized that  work perfectly well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You fix it by finding groups of people who  actually want to interoperate again and working  with them and talking to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  IndieWeb.org.  So that system you talked about is  WebMention, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. That's one of  the pieces of it. Yeah. But the specific  one of to  build a sort of distributed Twitter-like app reply  thing is WebMention.  So if Jeff  writes a post and I reply to it,  I can WebMention him and it can appear under  his post if he has  WebMention supporting software.  And vice versa. He can reply  to me and we've got the infrastructure for doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that. How do we get people to  use this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You get them to  use something that supports it.  Micr.blog supports it.  We're working on getting  other people to support it. We're having an interesting  conversation with Tumblr this week  where we're trying to get Tumblr to support  IndieWeb stuff and we're getting strong  support from Matt Mullenweg and the COO  of Tumblr to do some work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Matt's fantastic. I have to say  there's a guy who's a champion  of Open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Matt's great. And if we can get it on  Tumblr, great. And then we can maybe get it on  Tumblr too and then we've got half the Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Matt Mullenweg is the  creator of WordPress.  I think the  problem with Twitter,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you've definitely set me off  here. Good.  Keep going. The problem with Twitter is  exactly the problem you said. It's the place  where your news buddies are.  Which is why it's great and why I like it.  There's a bunch of other parallel  Twitters that go on. But the  global journalist Twitter is an important  part of Twitter.  And the challenge is  the same challenge that  we had  with Google Reader  and with Facebook's news products is  the problem is news  and ad businesses don't really  go very well together. Especially all  automated ad businesses. Because  running ads against news is  a tricky business at the best of times.  But also people don't want  the classic thing of you don't  want  plain to get adverse next to plane crashes  but the machine will provide that for you if you're not very careful.  So  it sort of gets naturally  rejected by these ad supported businesses.  So the reason  Reader didn't last was they're like well  Google was like there aren't enough  people using it. It's like the people who are using it are using  it like 1600 times  a day and they're the people who actually  want to use it because they're the ones who are writing about  your products but  didn't quite get that.  It's not quite a literal conversation. It's  fairly close to a conversation.  And Twitter has the same problem.  It's like the journalists love it  and they like the attraction of that  part of it but in terms of ads that  isn't where they're  making the money from ads. And you know, and  Technorati was that too. We had that same problem. We built that  tool that was primarily  for journalists and news and we had the continuous  problem of like how do we make money from this  because that doesn't correlate well with advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was a wonderful tool. Oh, it was great.  I miss Technorati. I really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But you know, but yeah, we can  build a distributed Technorati with this stuff if we want  to. Or we can build a centralized one if  we really want to again but I'm not sure I want to take that on again.  But the other half is you spend a lot of time  dealing with spam.  But anyway, so  That's a problem everywhere, isn't it? Yeah.  So the  there's the sort of  the problem of  do we have interoperating protocols? Yes, we do. We've got  plenty of interoperating protocols and we've got  layers of them. We've got choices  at lots of the different layers.  We can do this stuff  but it takes some will to actually want to interoperate.  And then  the other problem is  there is a tension between ad supported  and news and it's not something  that's trivially solvable.  It's a problem for news sites as well. The other  corollary of that is  that the  news that's good  and has had time spent on it is now  behind paywalls and  the propaganda isn't.  And that's the other thing that eats away at it as well.  Exactly.  So yeah, there's a  sort of way of... So one thing that gets back to  Sorry, Kathy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so one thing that gets back to  the 11th circuit  and the First Amendment and the Florida  social media law is stuff  having to do with, we talked a little bit about like  well, why is the  rule different that the bar could kick out the person  that they didn't want to serve but not the platform?  And the argument being thrown into  that is that these platforms are so  integral to how society...  You know, you need to be there  because everybody else is there. So if you want to have  your live function, you better be on Facebook.  Which I think is a specious notion  but they're obviously big and have very heavy  presences. And so that's  been the argument for  losing their ability to  parse out who they let on their platforms  or not. But the thing is  you could in theory get  another. You could get another  Facebook. You can get a www.  notfacebook.com. You can get a  www. nottwitter.com  that in theory you can get an  infinite number of other platforms  to either facilitate  messages or if you want, roll  your own so you can have your own website  and you can put out your own message.  And the more that we rely on protocols  instead of the companies,  then when you put your message up so it's on  the web in a certain way, other people  will be able to interact with it and we don't  need the proprietary methods to be able to do  that. But then to back up,  the concern that I have a little bit is  what are the obstacles to being  able to roll your own, have  your own web server, have your own mail server,  have your own  email server.  What are the regulatory  obstacles? So for instance, we better  keep section 230 because that keeps  the regulatory obstacles at a minimum.  But then we have privacy regulation  sprouting up all over the place. So  if you want to start your own  fan forum, for instance, it's  a much harder decision  to make, a more expensive decision to make  than it used to be, but it's still  makeable. And then what are the  practical considerations? It's going to need  some technical support, it's going to be some maintenance,  now cyber security is  a big thing. So how  do we support it so that people  can functionally provide  their own independent outlets and then the protocols  can make sure that we get the functionality and interconnectivity  between the internet outlets.  So, you know, as a  lawyer, I want to care about do we have the regulatory  space that is making it so  we can get another, we can get another  Facebook or we can even just get your own platform  where you put out your own message that other  people can interact with and you don't even need  another platform necessarily  and certainly not run one run  by a corporation. So from  my perspective, eye on the ball of  what does it take to diminish the barriers  so that we don't need  to use these companies because  we can get what we need. There's  something we get from them, but we could probably  get all those benefits in another way  that does not require giving  up our privacy and that's then  the other thing in order to have accounts on Facebook.  There's other ways that we can speak to each  other online. We were doing that before  Facebook. Let's figure out if we can do that  after Facebook as well.  Yeah, and there is a problem with regulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Regulation is surely a factor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But WordPress does exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  WordPress is still a very large  portion of the web. Blogger still exists.  You can go and use that and  Tumblr too. There's a whole bunch of  places you can go and publish your stuff online  and talk about things and  there are many master instances and so on as well.  It's more that  the challenge is  the group of people I want to talk to there  and then you have to do the work to  cross post things, to publish  on one place and then share it somewhere  else, defeat stuff back. And again, we've got  tools to help do that and things to  make that a little easier, but it still works  and it still takes some setting up. And then  the other half of that is you don't necessarily want to  connect them all together. You don't necessarily  want every Twitter reply to show up on your blog  post. That could be annoying too  because the way Twitter replies have  with both thundering hub  problems and pile ons and things, you  don't necessarily want them all turning up  on your own site. You want to keep that  cleaner. So there's  always some tensions between  my post has taken off, oh great,  oh my post has taken off, now I've got to go and move  house.  Which is a real problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see.  You want a happy  TikTok moment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but okay, I'll do it.  Yes, a happy TikTok

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  moment. You deflate me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which one of the  of the list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's just two moments.  Anna Lapwood, who I've talked about before,  is a young woman who is at Cambridge.  She heads the organ  at one of the colleges there. She directs  a chorus  and she's a  kind of a staff organist at Royal  Albert Hall. So she goes  in and she has to go in the middle of the night  to practice and she's there and  you play this one.  I don't know why it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh shit.  How come I can't play it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There we go.  Oh, I'm sorry, there was a wrong one.  So, keep  going. This was a concert  for Bonobo. Did I say that right?  Yes. They saw,  they heard her. She was playing a couple hours  notice and they heard her and they said, oh, we  have to have you. They wrote a part for  her and she did a five day  engagement with them, wowing  the audience when this organ

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  just... People didn't know  there was an organ in Royal Albert Hall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's there, but they didn't know it was a plate.  It's pretty obvious.  You can't miss it? Right there.  But it was kind of a wonderful moment and I  think she's the greatest. She's a young woman  who's, in the all best sense,  in our sense of the word, a nerd.  She's a pipe organ nerd, but she  just has this enthusiasm  about it that's infectious.  I thought it was a nice happy moment.  That's one. The other one  is Ukrainian soldiers singing a tribute  to their drones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They love their drones  and here they are singing  a tribute.  With full orchestra apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Vader's have come

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to Mother Ukraine with new  ammunition and  but all the nice gear is now burning like tar.  Byraktar,  which is the Turkish drone  that they love.  The Russians have parked their tanks in the bushes  to munch on kielbasa they stole from  Babushka before they could say  suka blayat. They're hit hard  by Byraktar.  I don't know if I should really...  We should be really celebrating this, but  I kind of understand their joy.  They're dragging us back to their evil empire.  Bad move on their part.  We won't let them bring back the USSR.  Byraktar.  Why is Viktor Orban selling  Byraktar  to the Ukrainians?  Is my question.  I feel like Turkey is kind of  I don't know, on the fence.  No, are they?  Wait, Orban or Erdogan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Erdogan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Erdogan, no, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what can be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, good market.  I confuse Hungary and Turkey.  Sorry.  This is hysterical.  Thank you, TikTok.  I guess I can play that. The Ukrainian  army is not going to come after me with a  strike on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They might come after you with a drone, not with a take down order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they do strikes in a different way.  Different kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a different kind of copyright strike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the Ukrainian  government is very happy to have  their content shared at the moment.  They're blinded with this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, their wonderful  young guy who's their  head of digital transition  left Kiev and went to Davos.  And scolded companies  like SAS  to get the heck out of Russia.  So your companies are not doing enough, which I like  seeing when they go to Davos, especially since  I'm not invited anymore. You didn't get to go. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, and Thomas Protocol will join  us on Sunday to give us the Davos  report, which we used to have  from Jeff.  Sorry.  This was actually, I thought, kind of  an upbeat story. Let me see if I can  find it.  They have  created students  at the...  researchers at the University of Texas  at Austin have created  a gel film that  can pull gallons of drinking water  per day  from the air. Even the  very dry desert air.  It's cheap to make.  It's basically  cellulose with a common  food additive. A couple of bucks  to make per kilogram.  And  at 30%  humidity, it can  produce 3.4 gallons of water  per day per kilogram of gel.  Even at the very low  desert humidity of 15%,  it can produce 1.6  gallons of fresh water a day  per kilogram. So the  gel absorbs the moisture from  the air, and then if it's heated mildly,  releases it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that  amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's cellulose and konjac  gum, which is widely  used in food additives.  So it is...  I don't know. I just thought, I saw that. I thought  nice.  Nice story.  Please don't use the DuckDuckGo browser  because they made a deal with  Microsoft to...  Nobody's perfect.  Nobody's perfect to allow Microsoft trackers  on third party sites.  DuckDuckGo  I guess uses Bing.  DuckDuckGo does not store any  personal identifiers with your search queries,  but Microsoft advertising  may track your IP address and other  information. For accounting  purposes.  We're going to make money accounting purposes.  Anyway, the DuckDuckGo guy said,  it's not the search, it's just the browser.  He posted on  Reddit  doing a little reclamation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me point...  Well, I realized we were trying to go upbeat  and now I'm about to talk about the dystopia.  But the degree  to which tracking intimate  medical details  is so easy.  It was kind of something I was like,  I'm aware of this, and I kind of thought,  okay, but that's not a problem. That would affect me.  And then a phone call  I made seemed to have been  reflected in an ad I saw on my  Twitter app. And that just...  No, that's the tether...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see the FTC, Kathy?  I see a variety of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I see a variety of things.  What imp... Oh.  Well, I think Tector said  they're just politely asking not to track  kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're using  F2A phone data  to sell to advertisers.  Twitter, yeah. $150 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Twitter got a big fine.  But this was probably not related to a phone call  you made, Kathy. Twitter's going to pay $150 million.  Because just like Facebook  a couple of years ago, remember they  get your number so they can send you  a two-factor code.  But they've been using it to target  ads.  That's the phone number.  I don't think Kathy's phone call...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I was trying to figure out  what the vector was.  And I'm actually less upset by Twitter  at this because Twitter is sort  of like, what's some data that's usable  for us to give us ads? And if that was the extent  of my relationship where  I wouldn't have been as bothered, but Twitter  didn't know about the phone call that I made.  And yet somehow it had  information about me that suggested  I had made this phone call. So  I'm more worried about who scooped  up information about my phone call  to then pass it on to somebody for whom that information  would be useful. I'm more worried  about the initial scooping up  and trying to figure out what the vector  was. And the only thing I can think  about is it was the  phone call.  But this is why people think like Facebook is  listening to you. Because there's certain things where it's like  the topic you were interacting with was so  esoteric. And yet  somehow there's a very direct correlation to something  you experience later

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  like in an ad. You're sure it's not a coincidence?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't feel like it was a coincidence.  Because I hear all the time.  I almost tuned it out and then I realized, no, this is not normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. I hear this all the time.  My Alexa or my Google  Assistant was listening in, or  Instagram was listening and it's giving me ads  based on something I said.  And I can't say  for sure it's not.  But there  is a lot of anecdotal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me take back that it was Twitter. Yeah.  Because it wasn't just Twitter. It was  I was watching To Be on Roku  and I got an ad. And a part of  me is like, oh, this is the normal ad I would have seen at this.  And then I'm like, hang on a second. These are not  ads that everybody else sees. These are ads that are  somehow being tailored to me.  And it thought I would want to see  this ad. And the only reason I could  think of why it thought I might want to see that  ad was because of this phone call I had made.  So I was trying to figure out what the vector was  of why did it think that was appropriate  and something that I would want. Because  it was the type of thing that in this day and age would be  very, very, very concerning for  people to be able to have that insight  into what I might what might be going on  in my life. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  DOJ  says it's not going  to prosecute White Hat  security researchers, which  will relieve I think quite a few  security researchers who have been very nervous  about the Computer Fraud and Abuse  Act, which has been used to harass  many people, including  of course the late Aaron Schwartz.  We'll see.  I'd still be  nervous. We'll see.  The department's goals for CFAA  enforcement are to promote privacy and  cybersecurity by upholding the legal  right of individuals, network owners, and operators  to ensure their confidentiality.  The EFF  has of course  lobbied to  let White  Hackers do their job.  We need that.  But it's always been  risky.  There are many stories of White  Hats being at least investigated  under the CFAA. So let's see.  Let's hope. Here's another happy  story. Electrify America, which  is the big charging network that  VW is installing across  the United States after their  diesel gate, this is part of their  reparations, will be 100%  solar powered by 2023.  That's good.  Yeah. Already it's 100%  renewable electricity  as of April. So when you  get your electric car and you drive  by the gas station charging  seven bucks a gallon and you go  down to Electrify America, know that the sun  is powering. Where do you charge yours?  At home.  And this is, you know, a lot of  electric car people  or prospective  buyers of electric vehicles worry  about this because they, with a gas  vehicle, you can't fill it up at home.  So they're always worried. Well, where am I going to  charge it? The truth is  most of us never drive more than  you know, 50 or 60 miles a day.  And most cars have 100 or  200 or 300. Mine has 250 miles  per charge. I charge it every night  at home using solar power from  our solar panels.  Were you to drive longer  than that? If then you would use Electrify America  or something similar. I've used Electrify  America. Can you use Teslas?  No, well not as of now. Someday  Tesla says maybe.  And in the UK I think there's one  Tesla supercharger you can use.  In the whole country.  But they're  Electrify America, which is, this is the good news  about Dieselgate, they're going to be all  over the country. They're putting in thousands of  them. So, and they're  fast chargers. They're good fast chargers. But again  If you've got a big power wall  thing as well then? I do. I have two power walls.  60 panels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When we were charging from solar power at night I was like, that's a good trick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a good trick.  And a tech, I mean honestly it's technically  probably not, you know, cause it's  we sell it back to the utility  company, etc, etc. But  we're generating more electricity than we use.  Which is good, yeah.  So, yeah.  If you're worried about it, if you want to buy an electric vehicle  buy one. What's the price  of petrol per liter  in the UK these days?  I don't know.  You have an electric vehicle also, obviously.  I have an electric bicycle.  Yeah, I love my electric bicycles. If we could just  get rid of all the cars I'd be happy  to ride my electric bicycle everywhere. But I don't  I'm terrified of getting creamed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm out of step with everyone  because I have a petroleum powered car  and a non-electrified bicycle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well that's okay.  It's better to pedal.  Muscle power is always better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you South Bay? I mean it's not far down there.  No, I'm North Bay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The biking is good here.  Or, relatively speaking.  Actually, the South Bay is also very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where are you located, Kathy?  North Bay.  We're in Petaluma. Where are you?  Northern Marin.  You're like five miles away.  We should just get together and do this.  Then you wouldn't have to worry about your microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd better off at the parking lot  with Wi-Fi  than where she is now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, if I ran out of an ethernet cord I could plug directly.  Oh, I need an ethernet cord. I need a dongle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I understand.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to cycle if we were in the Bay Area too.  But I didn't have an electric bike there  because they weren't really straightforward then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they are now.  And they're wonderful, Kathy.  Is it an assisted?  Yeah.  By law they are pedal assist.  Although, if you get one with a throttle.  You needn't spend a lot of time pedalling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's different grades.  There's ones that are basically motorbikes that are electric.  But the primary thing is pedal assist.  It just means that  when you hit a hill you're not going to be sweating  and getting bumpy  because you actually get up the hill more.  It's lovely.  That's what I need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have one, two, three, four, five electric bicycles.  One of them is a trike.  Which I keep driving into a ditch  because unlike a bicycle  where you lean to steer,  a trike you turn the handles to steer  and I keep forgetting that  and I'm leaning and the bike continues  in the direction of the ditch.  It's okay.  Why do you have a trike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To pull the groceries back home or what?  Well, I could do that with my other bike too

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because I have lots of panniers  and baskets and things.  Well, it was my theory  because again, I don't want to get creamed  that if I, an old man  was driving a tricycle  people would go around me.  But now I'm still not convinced of that.  We have a ghost bike on the way to work.  There's a bridge I'd have to go over  that has a bike lane this wide.  Yeah, it's tiny.  And there's a ghost bike there  where a guy last year got killed  by an elderly motorist  who had taken too much of his meds  and he was driving  and I realized in a battle against a vehicle  I don't care how many helmets I'm wearing  I'm not going to win.  I have been.  I have had a close encounter with a car  and I was a kid

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but sort of been there, done that,  don't need to.  So unfortunately  there are lots of streets here

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  with no sidewalk, no bike lanes  and very fast vehicles.  We just, this, the last time I went to the  bike lane I was in the middle of the street  with very fast vehicles.  We just, this, like everywhere else in the country  we are not, I'm thinking of moving  to Amsterdam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.  I did a semester of law school in Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. There are more bikes per capita  in Amsterdam, in Holland, Netherlands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they would look down upon you  for an electric assisted bike, wouldn't they?  I don't care. I'm not against it.  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well I do, because I do it myself.  That's what granny gears are for.  I do it both ways, uphill,  in the snow, whatever, like,  and I do it a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well when I grew up in New Jersey I did into the snow  but less of an issue out here.  It's good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't, I, but I,  I'm old.  Does it?  Bike lanes honestly really ought to have  concrete partitions between them.  Yes, they should have separate barriers. That's absolutely true.  Yeah, because it's just too easy to veer into  or turn into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I had an annoying one today where I was  cycling along and  somebody, some guy pulled in the bike lane to park  because he was waiting for his kids to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Happens all the time.  And I worried about being doored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was a separated bike lane. There was a grass  verge and a red bike lane.  And he still parked into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well I guess I'm not  moving to the Moors.  You can ride

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  up nice roads like the one behind me here.  No, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would bicycle there like crazy.  You can see

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  my bike behind me leaning  against the fence there because then I just climbed up the stone road.  From the bike to the bottom of that hill.  A little black dot just behind my back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is your own image.  Your own picture.  I took this a few days ago.  Beautiful.  So this is just miles from your home.  Yeah, there's a hill called Roseberry Topping

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which  looks like a volcano.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of course it's Roseberry Topping.  Of course it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got a slightly weird shape  because a chunk fell off it in the 19th  century because they were mining stone.  It looks like a volcano shaped.  But then you can bike all the way around to  the bottom of it and then the last bit is this weird  not quite a path, not quite a staircase  thing that you walk up to the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It looks a little difficult but it'd be worth the challenge.  And then are there druid graves or something?  Is it a  druid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not this one.  There's a bunch of stone and  a thing you put a field light on  so you can get a trick point.  But yeah, there's  the whole Cleveland Way and there's  lots of nice walking  paths and cycling paths around here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we played a little bit  or talked a little bit about Dali  and Dali 2  which is from OpenAI, the  kind of fun little image generation  program where you  write a text and then  here's a bowl of soup  that looks like a monster  spray painted on a wall.  And you see it's  generating that. I haven't yet  to get permission to go into it.  Well Google says hold  my beer and they've  created something called  Imagine  I-M-A-G-E-N  research.research.google  Imagen. Imagen.  But it's like imagining, right?  Same idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not generating images too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Imagen,  Imagine, three spheres  made of glass falling into the ocean.  So these have never existed before.  Here's a bald eagle made of chocolate powder,  mango and whipped cream.  This is not just looking up  stuff on the internet.  And these are generated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anthor mascot made from bamboo.  Really angry. The one amazing to me is a  corgi on a bike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't get back to it.  Yeah, I had it and I can't get  back to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway, that's kind  of cool. It's pretty amazing.  I wish you could play with it, can you?  Oh, here's the corgi on a bike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to get access to it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you access to it?  No.  No. I'll ask for access.  Did you see the viral one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A centaur except the man part is a jumbo shrimp.  Do you see that one this week?  No.  Let me find that for you again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Centaur,  shrimp,  and vital parts.  Jumbo shrimp vital parts should be enough  to narrow it down.  Nope. Images for centaur shrimp vital  parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Centaur jumbo shrimp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Centaur jumbo  maybe the word jumbo  shrimp will narrow it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought you meant that the man part  was a shrimp, not the  anatomy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is disgusting.  This is really  loathsome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's quite a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This isn't either  of these two. This is another image  generation thing that is  in prototype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jenny Badgslip  Buladna  on Twitter,  also known as horsewizard,  says, okay, the AI  refuses to give me a normal cat, but  when I ask for a centaur,  except the man part is a jumbo shrimp,  it nails it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I asked someone who had access to  the image, and I asked

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Charlie to try the same thing, and it  wasn't as good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  Wow.  So I now want to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the image. I put the link in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  chat.  Okay.  Let's look at the chat.  Which chat did you put  that link into?  IRC. Okay. We have so many.  That's true. Yes.  Think vert, think wort.  Not as good as the viral tweet.  A centaur, except the man part, is a  jumbo shrimp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not as  nice as the other one. Well, not as scary.  This is from Imogen?  This is from Dali.  Dali. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder if it remembers what it produced, and it won't  produce it again, because it's learned. It's sort of like  I got that out of my system, and now I've sort of  incorrect it in some way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does tend to give you  model versions, and you're supposed to pick the good one.  So I want  to see what Imogen does with this prompt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think  Kevin.  Do you think  right now these are just silly toys.  But we are close.  Do you think to  being able to actually say  President Biden  falling down the stairs  and getting an image that is  indistinguishable from real?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the challenge is  that's actually harder than you would think.  I think these things  show them with these  slightly daudorous things, because  that works better.  And they're also  trying very hard to not generate images of people  at the moment. They're all writing  oh, we shouldn't do that type of stuff.  It's stochastic parents' problem  again. They're going to generate images of people, and then  they've got to deal with it. And then you'll find that using  people's faces they shouldn't be using, and it's really

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  terrible. How effective though in the long run are they going to be  doing stuff like that?  Have you ever seen a poll?  Pandora's box closed so long.  Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we've had this with the face generators.  Those have been around  for a while, and those are  plausible faces.  If you look very  closely, you can cherry pick them  a bit, because it also generates like weird  extra heads next to you sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's also what you have to do with  text. You'll have  GPT generate  five different versions of text  and pick the one that's the most... And then you should cherry pick

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the good ones. Cherry pick.  This was the critique we had of Google's  new model  when they were showing that off, and they were doing it again  last week, when they did  was it I.O. last week?  Yeah, I.O. was last week. And they were doing the same thing  of like, well, it makes stuff up sometimes,  but it's still cool. It's like, no, making stuff  up in response to a search query  is not cool. Not cool.  Your entire job was  organisable as information, making the university  accessible and useful. Not make up, do stuff.  And if you just make it up instead, that's not actually very helpful.  That's the opposite of what you  want to be doing. And you're cutting out the middle  of the mound of the spammers who have been doing that  to feed it into your search engine, but  I'm not sure that's actually a helpful  sort of disintermediation, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of the way computer science  is. The first 80% is  easy, but the last 1% is intractable.  Whether it's self-driving vehicles  or face recognition or handwriting  recognition or generating images  or text, it's always  that last little bit. Some of them converge

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a bit better than others. I mean, the stuff they've been doing  with audio processing is actually very impressive.  But yeah, you've got  the translator things  that sort of mostly  work, but they work with the languages  they've got. They're trying to scale them to other languages  and that's not as... Somebody has an amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  simulation of an actual phone  ringing. Oh, okay, it's Jeff.  I know it's a simulation  because no one actually  has a phone that rings anymore.  So,  tough to forge digital  driver's license  is actually pretty easy  to forge. A litany  of security flaws. This is  the government of New South Wales  in Australia rolling out  digital driver's licenses.  They said would provide additional levels  of security and protection  against identity fraud compared to plastic  driver's licenses.  Well, no, not in fact.  You know this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is doomed from the whole way that they decided  that what they were trying to do was even  better because they were  ignoring all the security problems. You don't  put your digital ID on your phone.  You don't put it on something that you might  hand to a cop.  And no,  no, this wasn't something that was broken.  Like the whole bit with RFID chips  in your  passports. Like, oh, this will make us  safer in some way. No, it just provided  another vector for attackers  to suck up identities from.  It was just  this idea that like, oh,  we're just going to add this latest  buzzword and everything will be miraculously  wonderful. And this magical thinking is  just absolutely terrible when it comes to  particularly changing any  system that worked in an  offline analog into  something digital. Like, it's so under-theorized,  it's so undercooked, and  making something digital does not  make it better. It tends to introduce  a thousand more problems that you never bothered  to anticipate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is why, thank God, we're not voting on the internet  yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. Like, that is a system where  no, this is  not a thing  that will help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Pixel Watch is going to have  But it's kind of like, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bitcoin. Like, oh, we're just going to add the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  blockchain. That'll make, blockchain makes  everything better.  Like bacon. Pixel  Watch will have  a two-year-old Exynos  9110 processor, but  will also have a physical  USB-C port.  What?  It charges some avenues.  Yeah, well, I mean, yeah, but usually  they charge it with some sort of pucker.  You know, wireless  charging thing.  I don't really credit this. It'll have  32 gigs of storage. This is rumors.  Even if you've announced something,  apparently it's possible to have rumors.  32 gigs of storage is a lot.  It'll have  a lot of RAM, as well.  More RAM than any existing smartwatch  today, according to 9to5Google.  And apparently,  it will have  a USB-C port.  Maybe that's just a diagnostic port.  Early Apple watches, I think, had something like that.  So, maybe that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How is it they still haven't managed to  integrate Fitbit with Google?  I mean, when he, so for engineers they're employed,  why is it still a third-party app  called Fit2Fit that moves between the two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You own it. I guess it may.  It's a hard computer science problem, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can see it  being a regulatory compliance problem  that you've got to integrate these things, and  they may not be easily integratable, like even  just from the privacy policy standpoint,  that's going to take a lot of lawyer hours  to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Has that deal actually closed? I think that was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah, they own Fitbit. Yeah, yeah, they are.  They own Fitbit, so it's like...  It's like, what?  I suppose they want to make something new instead.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see.  You don't get prone to goof making things compatible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the problem. Facebook is paying, if you are  a resident of Illinois,  Facebook is paying each and every one of you $397  because Illinois is one of the few states  in the union that has  a good  biometric,  anti-biometric  law.  It was a class action suit  started in 2015, a lawsuit  against Facebook because of a facial  recognition feature the social  media network used.  It would recognize your face and  tag you in photos, you may remember that.  However, it is a violation  of the Illinois state privacy law  which forbids any company from collecting  biometric data from its users  without consent.  Big victory.  $397. I'll take it.  I wonder who gets it and who doesn't. I think everybody.  I don't know. Well, not everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You probably have to be an Illinois resident. You're in the class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to be an Illinois resident. You have to have used  Facebook, I guess.  You have to sign up  and file your claim and all that.  But you'll be getting a check  in the next few days. Look for an  email. Illinois residents.  Kellyanne Conway,  my husband George, abandoned  me for Twitter.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they getting divorced?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the strangest thing.  Her book is apparently fairly  vicious about George.  But they're still married, so I don't know.  No one knows what really goes on in a marriage  to each their own.  I am not going to do  a change log. Sorry. Nope.  Not going to do it.  I'm just scanning through looking for fun.  What is the Grubhub fiasco?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was the one we talked about last week  where they did a $15  thousands of orders came in. So this has more  reporting about that.  What an incredible  screw up it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Especially since it cost Grubhub  nothing. And it cost the  restaurants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well now they're going to offer further coupons to people  who didn't get their food and all that. But the poor restaurants  just suffered terribly.  I'm taking it that you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  pasted these in like the introduction.  I know I didn't paste in the introduction  of Microsoft Excel in 1992.  Have you seen this one?  No. But I'll play it?  It's fun. Sure.  It's on YouTube.  This is apparently  when Excel came out.  It was on the Mac first, wasn't it?  I feel like it was.  Tough woman goes by, clearly the boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  All right. All right. Recording  obsolete sounds. I found this one  interesting. I like this. By the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  in case you didn't notice,  we're going through Jeff's  submissions. Jeff's weirdness. Jeff's  weirdness. But I do like this one  because there are  what are obsolete sounds? What would  you? What would be the example? The sound of a VCR

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  rewinding.  The sound of  a  300 baud modem. Yeah.  They want people to record these  sounds so we have them. So we hold on to them.  It'll  soon be the sound of a dial tone,  no doubt. Or rotary phone  or all these things. So they just want people to record.  They don't have them yet.  But it's one of those open projects  where they want everybody to record sounds.  So go find all of your... Right there  at Twit, you could do a hundred of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have a lot of obsolete sounds here.  Oh, do you ever? Cities  and memory dot com. Cities  and memory dot com.  Which is... It loves sounds.  I guess. It's the world's  biggest sound project, global collaborative  sound art and field recording  program with the aim of remixing the world.  One sound at a time. This is my...  You want to hear today's featured sound?  Sure.  It is an early morning bird  song. It's St.  Leonard's Gardens, St. Leonard's on Sea,  England.  This sounds like Kevin Mark's  house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is my California house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, we used to get birds  You'd be out by your orange tree, we'd get all  sorts of birds.  Well, the birds are asleep now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why does this bird sound obsolete? That makes me  sad. No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's something new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The obsolete sounds is a new  project. Right. Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah.  The BBC sound archive,  the sound effects archive...  That's an amazing, amazing archive.  They will have lots of obsolete, weird stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in there. Yeah. That's  very good. It's very useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have actually  browsed the BBC sounds archive.  That was created for the radio  division, I guess,  for radio plays and things like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they just gathered it over  time. They used to distribute it on record  and CD. I remember  getting a sound effects one out of the library when I  was about 14 and playing  at home, scaring the crap out of my  mother because it was a huge explosion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now you've come up with a good use  for these, though. That's good. Yeah.  Let's take a little break. We are going to get some picks  and ideas and stuff like  that. I love you guys. Kathy  Gellis. It's always great to have you.  CGCountsale.com  and you'll read your stuff  on TechDirt on a regular basis.  Jeff Jarvis.  Frank Sinatra called  him a bum. He is a nickel  millionaire according to Ray Kroc  and a beloved  member of our team, the only one who showed  up today. Kevin.  Kevin Marks. Also always  glad to have Kevin on  IndieWeb.org.  I showed you. They brought to you by Policy  Genius.  Policy Genius.  You know, when you have kids,  the first thing that goes through your mind is  I've got some responsibilities  now.  And that first, very first thing  I did is went out and got life insurance.  Life insurance is  I think one of those things  it's like being a grownup.  Gives you peace of mind. If something  happens to you, your loved ones would  have a financial cushion.  You may have some life  insurance through your job. I know we have some,  but it's not a lot. Most people  need up to ten times more coverage  to properly provide for their  families. And of course, life insurance  gets more expensive as you get older.  So it's always a good idea to get your policy  as young as you can.  And if you're going to do it, you should shop around  because not all policies  are created equal. That's how Policy  Genius works. Policy Genius  is one place to go.  A one stop shop to find  the insurance you need at the right price. You click  on the link on the show page.  Or you go to our website,  the site we're talking about here, policygenius.com  slash twig. Our show notes will have it too.  Policygenius.com slash twig  to get started.  In minutes, you can compare personalized  quotes from top companies  to find your lowest price.  And when I say low, you could save  50% or more on life  insurance just by comparing quotes  with Policy Genius.  Now because you're going to end up  buying life insurance, they have to be  licensed agents. So there are licensed  agents at Policy Genius who can help  you. They're on hand through the entire process  to help you understand what the options  are. In fact, I would recommend you take advantage  of this so that you know you're getting the  right insurance. Make your decision  with confidence. And it's important  to know that the Policy Genius team  is not working for the insurance companies.  They're working for you. So you  can absolutely take their advice.  You can trust their  information.  It's really great. They don't add extra  fees. You'll be glad  to know they do not. They do not sell  your info to third parties.  In fact, if you go to Google or TrustPilot,  you'll see thousands of five-star reviews.  You can get your coverage fast  in as little as a week.  You can also get coverage that does not  have medical exams. That's  nice if you want it.  It just depends on the policy, obviously. Since  2014, Policy Genius  has helped over 30 million  people shop for insurance.  They've placed over $150  billion in coverage. It's not a fly-by-night.  They've been around since 2014,  and a lot of people  have used them. Now, it's not just for life insurance.  They have home, auto, disability,  renters, all the insurance.  But I just want to hit  the life insurance thing. I've been  thinking about that lately.  And it's so important,  especially when you have a young family.  Policygenius.com  slash twig.  And I have to say,  my daughter is 30, my son is 27.  And they still, I feel  like I still have to have a little responsibility  to them. Policygenius.com  slash twig.  Someday, though, they'll have a job  to get free life insurance quotes and see  how much you can save. Policygenius.com  slash twig. Does TikTok  count as a job? I guess it does.  It makes money, Adam.  Policygenius.com slash twig. We thank  you, Policygenius, for supporting  this week in  Google. Now,  Kathy and Kevin, I'm not going to put you on the spot  unless you want to participate.  But here's your opportunity.  I know you're a Huey Lewis  fan, Kathy Gellis.  So go ahead.  Give us your Huey Lewis  pick of the week. Well, you should

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there's two tweets there.  You should click on them because this is about the picture.  So click on the Huey one first. I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here he is at the Andy. Now, Huey,  can he speak? I know he can't sing.  Yeah, he can speak. He just can't sing.  Yeah. Okay. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So he was out in Pittsburgh because he  participated  in some way with a film  about  endangered birds and bird conservation.  And that film debuted at the Carnegie  Center in Pittsburgh. So he was  out there. And while he was in Pittsburgh,  he apparently toured the Andy Warhol  Museum.  And this, I decided, meant that he  was trolling me because if you click on the  other tweet, the one that from me,  yes. Okay. Click on that and look

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  at the picture. Okay. Yes.  Oh, you did that.  That was my birthday cake.  Campbell's soup can on your birthday cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Because my birthday  happens to be World Intellectual  Property Day, according to White  Bow. And I've decided, well, they could see  me coming. So they made my birthday  the day that we are going to celebrate  intellectual property.  And so every year for the last couple  years, I've tried to come up with a thematically  appropriate cake. And in this particular  instance, because of the terrible  decision from the Second Circuit  involving Andy Warhol,  which kind of ruined Fair Use,  which is now going to be heard by the Supreme  Court, I decided  that to celebrate world intellectual property,  I had an Andy Warhol themed cake  and I had to figure out how to do it. And I got,  you know, my Campbell's soup can. So I did  that. That was like a month ago. And then Huey  shows up, you know, at the Andy Warhol  Museum, while Andy Warhol is so relevant  to my life. So, you know, this is  just a synergy I have with Huey Lewis that  like he plugs into the legal issues  I'm thinking about and just, you know, makes  his own derivative works consistently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're going to better watch out. You're going to start getting ads for Huey  Lewis merchandise in your Twitter feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This would be bad. I really don't understand.  That would be fine. That would be  fine for everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is the terrible decision?  I didn't hear this about Warhol  and his, is it about  his Campbell's soup can?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not the Campbell's soup can.  It was about his prints pictures  where he had the prints, prints  PRINCE, PRINTS  and  he, they were famous pictures  where he had taken a photo and then he  had kind of stylized them. And in the way that he  stylized them, they became quite famous because  they captured a certain essence of the  artist prints in a way that the original  picture hadn't. And so these were,  you know, prototypical Warhol  works that existed for a long, long  time. And then the original photographer  eventually  discovered this, that it was her picture  that had been used. And so she  sued. And  somehow the Second Circuit decided  that she had a leg to stand on and that  it wasn't fair use and  she had a claim against  his estate now.  There's some irony because the Warhol  estate, I believe, has also sort of  gone after other people for their potentially  fair uses of Warhol works. But in this  case, it really broke  a lot. And it also ended up a decision  that was inconsistent with  Google versus with  Oracle v Google, which also addressed  fair use. So there was  a cert petition to the Supreme Court and they agreed  to hear this case. So  hopefully it will straighten this case out.  And the one that actually concerned me more was  one from the Ninth Circuit, which I think  was even worse, which had to do with  the mashup of  the Oh, the Places You'll Go, which  was the Star Trek and Dr. Sue  mashup. And there was a  and it was defended  successfully at the District Court.  And then the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  just sort of tore up  so much fair use, wasn't fair use,  you'd be liable. And  that case ended up settling. But after  this terrible decision, that would have kept it going.  And I think that one was even worse  because at least in the Second Circuit case,  you had a living  copyright. The  original artist was at least still alive  and then going after  art produced by somebody who no longer was.  Whereas in the Ninth Circuit, you  had the estate of a dead person  shutting down future  creative expression of a live  person. And this is an  awful lot of power that the dead would have over our  lives if this is the way that fair use  works. So I'm really hoping that we'll get  some clarity from the Supreme Court  to sort of make fair use  be usable because if it's chilling  other works that bring new  ideas and new thoughts together  but are built on the shoulders,  you stand on the shoulders of giants,  you use the works that came before to  informed your creativity now because  that's how art works.  This has to be something that  you have a safe space to do.  And if you don't have a reliable fair  use defense, then you're not going to be able to do it.  And that's an awful lot of new expression  we're not going to get to experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a good case because the photographer  was licensed to Vanity Fair,  he used it, then he continued to use it.  She was unaware of it  until she saw a Vanity Fair  article in 2016 after  Prince's death.  The Warhol estate preemptively  sued her.  So she didn't even bring suit, they sued her  preemptively and  won.  And then now she says, well,  I don't think that's fair either.  The judge said  the transformation was sufficient  that the Prince  series works can reasonably perceive to have  transformed Prince.  So, you know,  none of the pieces, none of the parts of the original  photo are still there  even though it is recognizable as  an altered work of the original.  She is now  counter suing, not counter suing, she's now appealing  to the Supreme Court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So she won and now that  way get reviewed.  So, yeah,  I think the Warhol state probably did  a declaratory judgment. They won  for finding a fair use. She appealed  that the Second Circuit undid it and now  that's being reviewed by the Supreme Court.  It's transformative,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  right? That's your position.  This is sufficiently transformative  that it doesn't  have to, they didn't have to  license it from her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Second Circuit decision is it really conflated  two things where if this conflation could happen  then a lot of transformative  works are in trouble, which is  you do have the exclusive right as  the copyright owner to control derivative  works.  But at the same time, fair use  is found  to be fair use when it's sufficiently  transformative. So  what does it mean if you've transformed something into  something new? Have you now changed it and that's  fair use or have you essentially made a  derivative work? And the way the Second Circuit  decision reads is  you made a derivative work of the original  but that would just obviate  all sorts of transformative uses  because in theory they're inherently  derivative. So there's got to be some other  delineator to make the  new things that people are building  not something that the original  the original  copyright owner would have been able to  control because if they can control everything  then there's an awful lot of new stuff  that can't be developed and this is particularly  onerous as copyright terms are  just enormous and you know generations  long. And we have an internet that's built on collaborative

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  building upon  all creation has been built on prior  creation, especially on the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, especially. Yeah. So  both cases from the Ninth and the Second Circuit  are really troubling because  you can't do  anything new. The original person who  may be dead gets  veto power and that's no way  to run a railroad. The whole point of  copyright law is because we want to keep getting new  stuff and so these  decisions are standing in the way  of getting new stuff because they're making it legally  unsafe to make the new stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interesting.  Very

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  interesting. Little did Huey  know that that's the issue he wondered into.  Maybe he did know. I should give him credit  because he's Huey Lewis. He's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's got a bunch of software in there.  But also the thing you can do with it is you can  drag in ISO images  for CDs so I can actually  play the old CD-ROMs that I made.

And now  Jeff's stuff of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff. You know how I love technology  technology, its ability to solve problems.  I was in dos  toros, which is a knockoff  of Chipotle  in New York where I get to get my lunches  when I'm in the city. And I watched  the take on the  delivery line. Woman doing a  phone order, an online  order, putting on absolutely  everything on this burrito, right?  I think there's no way  she's going to get that folded into her burrito  and she mushes it over and mushes it  over and rolls it up tight  as can be and then gets the foil around  and quickly tightens it up before it explodes.  Right? So there's a problem  here that needs technology. Yeah, because as soon as  you unwrap that foil, it is going to explode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's going to explode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So students  at, oh God,  where is it? The

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Johns Hopkins, JHU  undergrads. Have created

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  an edible burrito tape.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  To hold your burrito together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's actually clear.  They put some blue dye on the one on the right,  but it's actually clear.  And it's edible. You don't even know you're eating.  No. It's edible. Yeah.  So Aaron Walsh  told NBC  Washington,  I'm a student athlete, so I'm not looking  to make a skimpy burrito.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They are applying for a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  patent, so they have not disclosed  their formula.  And you know what? I hope that  Aaron Walsh, Marie  Eric and Rachel Nye become  crypto billionaires by inventing  burrito tape.  All they can say is, the ingredients  are safe to consume, are food grade,  and are common food and dietary  additives. You know, you could actually  probably use seaweed strips to do  this, but that would add a little  flavor. Is it adhesive?  Yeah, if you, yeah, it's gluey.  It's what they hold sushi together.  Yeah. Well, but that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the rice, right?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You started it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just gave you a nice  burrito tape, but you've got to say, no, no, no.  You can use seaweed to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you want to do any of these other wonderful ones?  No, that's good.  Not only is crypto going down, but Rolex's are going down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People are panicked about that.  I found that, a little bit of shot in  Freighter for that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're not going to wear your Rolex if you're busy wearing  your Google watch, Apple watch,  Fitbit, Armin.  How many hands do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Probably why  the Rolex, apparently there is an index.  The Rolex  watch market price index.  And over, oh, I have to buy it  to get five years of historical data.  But it's been down, down, down  last month.  Plummeting, plummeting  since its peak back  in April.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was the NFT before there were NFTs.  Yeah, that's really true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The average market index  of the 30 most popular  Rolex models over time.  Wow.  Well, that concludes  this edition of  this week in whatever the hell we want to talk about.  Kathy, Kathy, great to have you.  As always, Kathy Gellis.  Next time I'm going to make you come into the studio.  That's what I'm going to make you do.  You're going to sit right next to me in the hell with.  New bike, yeah.  Bicycle on up. You'll see her on Tech Dirt.  CG Council.com.  Kathy Gellis on the Twitter.  Thank you so much, Kathy. Always great to have you on.  Thanks for having me. Really appreciate it.  Kevin Marks, always a pleasure to see you.  IndieWeb.org.  IndieWebCamp.  regular meetings. I guess they're all virtual these days.  So you can go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's one in about an hour and a half.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it doesn't matter where it is.  How well attended are those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We get like a  half dozen to a  dozen people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I really want, you know, I have  the weekly things.  I have a static Hugo blog.  I recently added the ability  to comment on it, but you have to comment on Mastodon,  which is nice. But I want to add web mentions to it.  So that's going to be my project  for the weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, come to chat.indieweb.org.  People have already done it, so you'll find people  to talk to about it.  So there's two ways to do it with a static one.  You can have a JavaScript thing that will  load the comments, which I do on mine.  Or you can  bake them into it at rebuild  time, but then you've got to rebuild it  each time you get a comment or something.  Which makes it a little trickier.  The nice thing about Hugo, it takes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  no time to rebuild it. I might  just make a cron job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People have done that,  but on my side,  I have the comments  coming dynamically from an  external server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The only bad thing is I know no one's commenting  about my blog.  It'll  just be depressing. But I still  want to do it in spirit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you wire it to Bridger, you get tweets as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's nice.  I'll use Bridgy.  There's some really cool technologies.  I wish more people would...  Do you feel like there is more awareness, or is it  just kind of a group of people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's happening.  We were having a conversation with Tumblr about  integrating with them, which would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's huge.  That's really huge.  It all starts at  indieweb.org.  Anything else you'd like to say?  You can use this  moment in front of the microphone.  And then, of course, there's  Jeff Jarvis, the director of the  Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism  at the

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Craig Newmark Graduate

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  School of Journalism at the City  University of New York. Our good  friend. What are you having tonight  for dinner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  D'Arthy Parker said, eternity  is a ham and two people.  And on that note...  I thought it was a fruit cake.  Fruit cake works as well.  Thank you, Kathy. Thank you, Kevin.
