Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google.  Stacy Higginbotham is joined by Kevin Topol.  Jeff has the week off.  We'll talk about Huawei.  What is going on?  Is the United States just trying to destroy the company  or is there really reason for concern?  Google's internal civil war.  We've got a lot of stuff in the changelog,  including an improvement in Google Duo.  We'll talk about that a whole lot more.  Coming up next on Twig.  Netcasts you love.

We'll talk about that in the next episode of  And all the rest with us today as mostly always,  certainly always as often as we can get her.  Stacey Higginbotham of stacey on iot.com,  this iot podcast gig of Stacey.  Final week in her temporary home before she makes the move  coast to coast.  Third coast to West Coast?  Do you call the Gulf the third coast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is what people in the Gulf call it.  Although I'm not really on a coast.  Austin's pretty landlocked.  It's true.  We're so landlocked we have a river that we call a lake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  That's right.  I really amused me when I first saw the Austin Lake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, there are three of them.  We've turned our single river, which is the Colorado River,  but not that Colorado River, into three lakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  It's a Colorado River.  I may be joining you.  Someday when we retire, we want to retire.  We're thinking of retiring to Seattle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you visit, I will have you over.  Get to know the area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  There you go.  You could be our welcome wagon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ta-da.  I am welcoming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  We extend the welcome, Matt, the red carpet,  to Kevin Toffle from aboutchromebooks.com,  Stacey's comrade in arms for the iot podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And just for now, I mean, if she's not going  to call people from a plane, I can't work with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This could be the show where we end the podcast.  Oh my god.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Because a week from today, you're flying out  to Seattle for the move.  But does that mean you won't be able to do this show  or his show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our show, we're recording earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  You're doing it early, okay, good.  We are?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm just like, ah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin, we talked about this.  And then this show is a maybe.  Carson has me as a maybe.  We'll figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  We'll figure it out.  We like to get you whenever we can.  So, Huawei.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there anything else to talk about, man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, there is, but this is-  This is big.  A big one.  And mostly because it's an evolving story.  At one point-  Devolving.  Devolving might be a better term for it.  This has been going on since the Obama administration.  I think it was 2012 or 2013  when the Commerce Department warned American companies  about using equipment from Chinese companies,  including Huawei, but also, as I remember, ZTE,  which they've since basically put out of business  with these kinds of accusations, and maybe Xiaomi.  So, as far back as seven years,  there have been people saying Huawei,  we don't know who owns them.  We know the guy who runs it is former Chinese military,  former People's Liberation Army.  Huawei says, we're owned by our employees, our workers,  but it's hard to prove that.  And even if not, there's definitely the feeling  that the Chinese government would have some sway on Huawei.  So, President Trump signed an executive order banning,  which is kind of dramatic, Huawei gear.  God, you know, I have to get the timeline right  because this seems like ages ago, but this was May 15th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I was like, it was so recent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  One week ago, I forgot that he declared a national emergency  in this executive order and said,  the United States, companies in the US  cannot use telecom services that are solely owned,  controlled, or directed by a foreign adversary.  I'm not sure who defines foreign adversary,  but that began the ban on Huawei gear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and somebody has been whispering in Trump's ear  for a while about national security, 5G,  and the telco networks.  So, I don't, this isn't like totally surprising.  The timing was kind of like, what just happened?  And as we can see from all the stories on the rundown,  the fallout is tremendous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Domino's fell, including Google saying,  well, Reuters said Google's going to,  I never saw a confirmation from Google,  but Reuters said Google was gonna withdraw  Huawei's Android license,  which suspending business with Huawei.  So, without Android, Huawei phones will have to run  some other, well, they can run Android, it's open source,  but they can't run Google apps.  So, they don't have the Google version of Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Real quick, I was gonna say when this news hit  or was reported by Reuters,  the first thing I did was go back to a website  that my team worked on inside of Google.  It's the Android Enterprise Recommended Devices List.  There were about 240 Android devices on there,  24 of which at that time were Huawei.  So, I tweeted out, if this report pans out,  or if you wanna watch and see if it's going to pan out,  watch this page, and sure enough, I went back today,  granted, we already know at this point  that Google has said what it said,  but all the Huawei devices are gone from that page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  That's confirming.  They don't sell Huawei on the Google Store.  Microsoft pulled Huawei's laptops from the Microsoft Store,  but did not say anything about  withdrawing the Windows license.  That would be the kiss of death, I think, for Huawei laptops.  ARM, according to the BBC,  has told its staff to stop working with Huawei.  Huawei's phones are running on ARM chips.  Qualcomm says, we won't sell you chips.  So, that means Huawei can neither buy chips from Qualcomm  or make its own ARM chips, or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's probably the bigger roadblock here.  And yeah, Stacey, I was gonna say, you're the chip girl,  but in my mind, without having an ARM architecture license,  they can't make those Kirin chips

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and they can't make, yeah, a lot of their chips.  They're using ARM-based chips in their telco gear.  They're using it in some of their server stuff.  They're using it in their smartphones.  I mean, this is not, that is kiss of death stuff.  And to say, okay, we're not working with you anymore  means to develop your own architecture for silicon,  it's a process.  So, their option would be to like try to license  what MIPS is imagining.  Well, MIPS is the last company left

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  because Intel and Broadcom both followed suit.  Right.  And so...  And Xilinx, by the way.  So, it's really, they've been isolated.  Then, by the way, this story's not over.  Then, Huawei was granted a temporary reprieve  and Google resumed patches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, well, that's patching.  So, that's basically anyone,  because if you have and if you have bought  Huawei-based phones and they're Android-based Huawei phones,  if Google doesn't support patching for them, you're like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Somebody told the government,  if you cut all that off, that's bad for us.  Yeah, don't you have a Huawei phone?  I have a P20.  I mean, obviously, I'm not going to use it anymore.  You know who has a Huawei phone and loves it is Paul Therod.  I forgot to ask him about it  because we were talking about this.  I forgot to ask him what he plans to do with his Huawei phone.  But people, the Huawei, the latest Huawei phones  have Leica lenses, they have amazing cameras.  They're really incredible phones,  according to people who use them.  I didn't like Huawei's flavor of Android.  The, I can't remember the name of it, the Miao.  I want to say the Mui.  EMUI or...  EMUI, EMUI version of Android I did not like.  But that was because I think mostly it was Chinese centric.  It really was, it was made for their market,  not for our market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  See, this doesn't really hurt them in the US  because they don't really have business in the US.  Obviously, it hurts them now globally.  Oh, they sell laptops here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  They do sell a lot of laptops here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  True, but well, I was going to say,  they also, under their Honor brand,  sell some low and mid-range phones in the US market.  And a lot of people have those  because you could get them unlocked on Amazon  or direct from, I think it was consumer.wawei.com  or something in the US, you could actually purchase them.  So there's a crap ton of those Honor devices out there,  which are a brand of Huawei.  This also, not that it's a huge deal,  but this also means we've gone from two breakables,  I mean foldables down to one.  Because now the Huawei made X.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  They had a trifold.  Yep.  So the Department of Commerce yesterday  announced a 90-day reprieve  on an import ban against Huawei.  It's a temporary general license on a limited basis.  So partly it has to give telcos time  to find alternative solutions.  Partly it's to get updates for those Android devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if there was some sort of political thing  happening here because the declaration  of a national emergency is weird.  And for any country to make, to ban something  that is both embedded in the businesses  of a lot of its own companies,  this does not, this seems not well thought out.  Oh, what a shock.  I'm shocked, yeah.  I know.  But it also seems like, I mean, it's basically like,  go ahead and do this without thinking about  the implications.  So the fact that, I mean, a national emergency  gives Trump powers to do this that he otherwise  wouldn't have by like going through Congress  for like trade agreements and that sort of thing.  I'm not, you know, this is not my-

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  It feels a little xenophobic.  It feels like a trade war, a shooting war  has broken out over trade.  Remember that Huawei's CFO, Meg Wan-Joh was arrested.  She was arrested in Canada and is being held  prior extradition to the US because apparently  she oversaw dummy corporations that Huawei used  to sell against our sanctions to Iran.  So that could be part of it.  What has yet to happen as far as I know,  Meg, correct me if I'm wrong, none of the,  even though the US defense intelligence agencies  have apparently briefed our allies and briefed,  I don't know if they briefed Congress,  but we have yet to see any evidence that of Huawei spying,  either industrial espionage or cyber warfare against the US.  But that's the presumption or maybe it's proactive  in case they do, but there's no evidence they've done it.  They've done some shady things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have been looking for evidence for seven years or more.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I mean, I-  They've done some shady business things,  but they've been business practices, not espionage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So my guess is in all that investigation,  they've either done nothing and nothing was found,  or they've done a heck of a lot that's gonna scare  the bejesus out of people and they don't wanna tell us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  You can think of reasons why they wouldn't tell us.  Besides that, you could think maybe revealing what they know  would reveal sources, which you, of course, in spycraft,  you don't want people to know how we know what we know.  So maybe the intelligence agents are saying,  well, we know, but we can't tell you why or how.  You would think Google, Qualcomm, Intel,  one of these, Microsoft, one of these companies  would at least say something like,  we have it on good authority or we've seen evidence  of malfeasance by Huawei.  They haven't.  They've actually said very little.  And which makes me think they've been compelled to do this  by some sort of national security letter type order  that also orders secrecy, that orders,  it's a gag order as well.  Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That does make sense.  I could see that happening.  Because yes, it's clearly disruptive to their businesses,  not obviously as much as Huawei's,  and they clearly are trying to, I mean,  this is not something anyone wants to deal with.  I mean, Huawei is not an insignificant supplier  or participant in these markets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  So remember the last time this happened, it was ZTE,  which essentially has been destroyed by this.  $3 billion of market value was wiped out.  I mean, and I liked ZTE phones, by the way.  I was a real fan.  They are the second largest telecom manufacturer in China,  17 billion in revenue in 2017.  They were banned in the US a year ago, May 2018,  and pretty much tanked them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm curious what this means for companies like Qualcomm  have actually a lot of joint ventures in China,  because that's how you have to operate there.  And I know Google doesn't, but Qualcomm does.  I don't know about Broadcom.  But so there are actually several  very close-knit collaborations that companies have done  in this space with China that I'm sure they're sitting,  they're going, ah, what do we do now?  What does this mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Huawei itself is saying, you know, they're very bullish.  They're saying, we can handle this.  We can make our own chips.  We can make our own operating system.  We've been planning this for months.  We've been stockpiling parts from US companies.  We're not worried.  We value our close relationships with our partners,  they said, but recognize the pressure  some of them are under as a result  of politically motivated decisions.  We're confident this regrettable situation  can be resolved and our priority remains  to continue to deliver world-class technology  and products to our customers around the world.  I remember talking to Huawei's US marketing representative  at an event last Christmas.  She was adamant that data did not get fed back  from Huawei devices to China.  She said, our data center for US devices is in Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But how do you prove a negative?  You can't prove a negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I would throw out a couple things.  One, building an operating system takes time.  I don't know how long they've been working on it,  but they have been working on it for a while.  Building a chip and designing a chip from scratch  is a two to three year plus  you've got the new chip problem process, right?  Look at what Intel did with its designing modems,  for example.  They do have, RISC-V is an option.  That is a chip architecture that's open-sourced.  It's a risk-based architecture, just like ARM.  And so you could see them design under that a new chip,  but you still wouldn't expect to see it  for two years at least, probably three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  It's interesting because ARM is not a US company.  They're owned by a Japanese company, SoftBank.  They were started in the UK.  UK?  Its designs contain technology originated in the US.  It was originally Apple was one of the big investors in ARM,  but they sold their part a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have a lot of designers.  A lot of design work happens here in the US as well.  This is why this is so difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  There aren't these, there's not like everything in the US.  The number one American made car is a Honda.  It's not, it isn't, these borders don't exist  in many ways in business anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  There's no walls around the countries,  is that what you're trying to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  You could build a wall.  Sorry.  It doesn't keep them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No, you're right.  And here's a whole nother thing,  not to get off the track of Google with this aspect.  If this is a trade issue,  and that's why we're being heavy handed here  and we are being very heavy handed,  what about China?  What does China do that says,  hey, well we manufacture all those.  We're talented, that's the scary thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  The last thing you wanna see is a hot trade war  because we are, all of us interconnected.  And anything unilateral from the US  could very easily be responded to by China  in ways that would be scary for technology.  That's why this is really a story  that resounds through all of technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although some, I mean, China has been cool  to our technology firms for a decade or more,  which is why everybody who goes over there  does these weird joint ventures.  When you say cool, what do you mean?  They have laws in place to prevent US companies  from coming in and building their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to work with a Chinese company.  It has to be Foxconn building the iPhone,  not Apple in China building the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they have enforced rules that have led US companies  to decide not to locate there  or compromise in significant ways  that people at US companies are not comfortable with.  Is that cool to the tech companies  or just cool to our laissez-faire free kind of democracy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I would never, well, okay.  First of all, we have every right and a duty  to protect ourselves.  And if we feel like a Chinese company is gonna harm us,  we have the right to kick them out.  I don't dispute that.  I feel like they should at least give us some reason  to believe that instead of just saying trust us.  And I am concerned about the reaction.  And an escalating trade war is gonna be problematic  in a variety of ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  If it wasn't for the chip issue at this point,  when I heard about this on Friday,  I'm like, they're just gonna pull on Amazon.  They're gonna use AOSP, Android Open Source.  They could probably do that today, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  They've got Chinese stores already because you can't,  Google wasn't able to sell stuff into China, right?  Google doesn't sell them the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They don't sell the services, correct.  But because they were a licensee of Google Android,  they couldn't create by definition AOSP devices to compete.  Now they can.  Now they can.  But not if you don't have chips to run it.  So that was to me,  that was the nail in the coffin right there.  Cause I figured, oh, they'll be fine.  It's just gonna be like an Android Fire OS type experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  But I remember reading that they use a lot of US parts  in their phones.  You know, there's, I mean,  admittedly there's a huge trade deficit.  Most of the trade is going the wrong way.  But they do buy US parts and put them in their phones.  They won't be able to get those anymore.  I presume, I mean, China can manufacture most things.  I imagine they could figure out a way around that.  But you're right.  Without ARM, the Kirin chips are ARM based.  The chips that they use, Huawei uses are ARM based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They're good chips too.  Are they?  They're good.  I mean, ask Paul.  I mean, the Kirin 980 and all the latest ones,  fantastic.  They're really done well.  It's not just a straight,  let's just use ARM's architecture and build a chip.  They tweak things.  They've got their own AI stuff.  They got the DSP stuff.  And they've done a fantastic job,  especially in the imaging, the cameras.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have an architecture license  just like everybody else.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I think the main thing to understand is  it's not like there's a Chinese product  and there's an American product.  As somebody in the chat room just said,  without Chinese parts, your F-150's  not getting out of the driveway.  We are tightly interlinked at this point.  We're tightly interdependent.  I feel like if we're worried about espionage,  if we're worried about cyber warfare,  we need to address that directly.  But I don't think saying,  well now we're gonna draw a bright line and say,  these are US products, these are Chinese products.  I don't think you can do that anymore.  I think that horse has left the barn years ago.  Am I wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but I don't know how well  our commander in chief maybe understands that.  I'm also curious,  why haven't we seen follow-up from our allies in Europe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  They're just as confused as we are apparently.  Some, like the closest allies like Canada say,  okay, we'll take Huawei gear out of our 5G network.  Okay.  Some are saying, what are you talking about?  Australia says, what, no.  So that's the problem, I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Australia is right next door to China.  If I were Australia, I'd be like, yeah,  we'll get back to you on that US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You'd think if we had evidence of spying  and wrongdoing here that that would be shared  with some of our, exactly,  it would be shared with those allies.  So I'm kind of like, when Leo,  you started talking about the lack of evidence,  I've been shaking my head ever since this all started  six, seven years ago.  I'm like, okay, let's see it.  Where is it?  I mean, I'm not saying it doesn't exist,  but we need to know.  Actually, I take it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Australia did throw Huawei out.  In fact, some say it was Australia  that led the war against Huawei.  So I apologize, I got that wrong.  Who is it that's still using Huawei gear?  I mean, it's a promise.  AT&T.  It changed, yeah, right.  Not anymore, not anymore, right?  Not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure they're working hard on that.  It's not like, I mean, can you imagine if,  you're telling AT&T to pull out,  I don't know what percent of their network here  is Huawei based, but it's not like they can just say,  oh, as of Wednesday, we're shutting it all down.  I mean, you'd have chaos because people's cellular  connections would go down.  I mean, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, and then the other thing to remember  is even though we've given them 90 days,  and I wouldn't be surprised to see the policy change  because we seem to have kind of a zigzag  foreign policy anyway, but the damage is done.  It is now very clear that at the whim of the US government,  any company can be cut off.  And maybe that makes you think,  well, I'm gonna make sure, I'm darn sure  I'm not dependent on the US government anymore.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Hey, Stacey, you may know this.  I'm thinking this really hurts the phone aspect  and the tablet aspect far more than the networking aspect  because there are more network vendors to choose from  as opposed to this whole use arm on Android or you're out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Nokia is one of the big network gear providers  and they're running, they're not as advanced at 5G.  They're still having some challenges.  So Huawei is, it's either number one or number two,  I can't remember.  So you've got Ericsson, Huawei, and Nokia,  and right now you only have Ericsson and Huawei  with credible 5G solutions is my understanding.  And so it's great for Ericsson.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  At least there's choices there,  as opposed to Huawei's back on the corner  on the phone tablet side, the mobile device side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, and the Verge interviewed a professor  at Georgetown's School of Business, Charles Scuba,  who said, if I'm a US company,  I look at this national emergency ban.  It says, I should be very careful to do business  with any companies that have significant  interlocking relationships with China.  The chilling effect reaches very far.  It throws up a big wall against inter-country operations.  And that's the way the economy has been based for years.  Yeah, but this is exactly, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this fits with the rhetoric  and possibly the goals of this administration.  I think this is something President Trump said

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  from the beginning of the campaign.  He said, China's an outlaw nation.  They steal from us.  And I think this was his goal from day one.  Do you think it's the trade imbalance

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  that he's worried about with China?  The imbalance that he's worried about  or it's the stealing of the IP,  which has gone on for years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I don't think Donald Trump really understands  how tariffs work.  Nevermind, what was I thinking?  No, I mean, he said things time and time again  that show that he really doesn't understand  how tariffs work and who pays tariffs, for instance.  But this goes way beyond tariffs, doesn't it?  And maybe this is the goal.  The problem is you can't just do that.  You also have to build, you have to create those.  You have to build a 5G company in the United States.  You have to replace what we're cutting off  or you completely disable the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and I should add,  because someone in the chat room pointed this out  and they are correct,  that Samsung is also doing 5G network equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I forgot about that.  Samsung is a player, yeah.  And they're an ally, they're South Korean.  But you probably shouldn't buy an iPhone  because it's made in China.  Get a good quality Samsung phone  because it's made in South Korea.  Just imagine, just imagine if the next tweet  from the president is,  yeah, I don't trust these Apple iPhones.  They're all made, you know where they're made?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he's already tweeted against Apple iPhones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Oh yeah, he wants him, he's asked Tim Cook  to move manufacture back to the US.  Tim Apple, not Tim Cook.  I'm sorry, Tim Apple.  But of course, that's really a non-starter anyway.  At this point, this is the kind of thing,  I think it wouldn't be an unreasonable policy  to have a national effort to build up these skills  and these technologies  to create the manufacturing capability in the US  to say we wanna bring these jobs back,  but we also feel it's safer.  So we're gonna start this process  because it's gonna take 10 years,  but 10 years from now, just as we did with foreign oil.  Remember how great that worked?  Oh, wait a minute, nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Voxcon is working on setting up factories  in Malaysia and India.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah. India, yes.  Well, they have to in India  because they can't sell phones in India.  Same thing with Brazil.  Unless they're made there.  They make iPhones in Brazil  because Brazil has very strong tariffs  against phones not made in Brazil.  So we can build up that capability,  but what we can't do is do it today or tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Right.  We should just have everything made in Switzerland  since it's neutral.  It's neutral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Who can you trust?  Certainly, no one can trust stuff made in the US.  We spied on Angela Merkel's phone, our German ally.  It looks like E, the British phone company  has dropped Huawei phones  from its 5G network launch lineup.  So this is spreading across the globe now.  And it's what we don't know.  Is this prompted by fear of the United States?  Is it prompted by US intelligence  being shared with these countries and companies?  We just don't know  because it's not being shared with us.  We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The real shame of it all is it took me seven years  to learn how to pronounce Huawei.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now that you know, you don't need it.  Actually, you don't need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I don't need to know.  There's been a lot of calls to pronounce it correctly.  It's funny.  Remember we used to say, Huawei, what is that?  Huawei?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huawei.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We did?  If I were any American company working  closely with China,  I would start building more relationships  with India right about now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah.  But honestly, I don't know how long India can be trusted.  The whole thing's a mess because you know what?  Nationalism doesn't work anymore.  It's a big wide world out there.  And many of the problems we face  can only be addressed globally.  Climate change can't be addressed by any one country.  It's a global situation.  So building walls, building up nationalism,  closing borders is just putting your head in the sand.  It's not a long-term solution  to many of the problems we face.  I think we are now economically, we're a global economy.  We know that.  All right, I don't know.  There's nothing more to say except that's what's happening.  That's the news from Lake Wobegon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That is, yeah.  Until the next one hits in five minutes  with another headline on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, I have to say, it is boring.  It is not boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  May you live in interesting times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the worst Chinese curse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yes, we do.  Wow, wow.  Yeah, I just don't know what to think.  We obviously have the right to protect ourselves  against cyber warfare and espionage.  And we should.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if we're doing that  and we have had these doubts for so long,  we probably should have had better safeguards  and channels in place to steer people away  from Huawei equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  It takes time to do this.  You can't just do it with a stroke of a pen or a sharp.  You can't just go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently, someone thinks they can and has done so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's almost like saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  oh, hey, Stacey, your house has termites.  Good, let's burn it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, if my house had termites,  that would probably be the solution.  Or bed bugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Bed bugs, burn it down, definitely.  Definitely.  And burn the neighbor's house down too while you're at it.  Burn the whole block down.  Bed bugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, I hate them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I slept in a bed that had bed bugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  You did?  I've never encountered bed bugs in my life.  But this is the-  It was in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was the Sheraton in Anaheim.  And I woke up with bed bug bites.  I was like-  They're calling them out.  Should I?  Well, I got bed bugs.  I understand that, but jee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Can you, how do you,  you don't wanna take them with you, so what do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that was my thing.  Do I burn my clothes?  But I didn't wanna burn all of my clothes.  So, and I didn't, I never put my suitcase on the bed.  So I just was like, well, I'll just leave the t-shirt  I slept in here and shower and run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  You run far away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  No, no, you haven't, was that recently?  Yeah, that was like two weeks ago.  Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So.  All right, I'm crossing that hotel off the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's why I'm not trying to shame them,  but it is a public service.  I feel that people need to know.  Did you leave a Yelp review?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No, I don't leave Yelp reviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leave your clothes outside  in a sealed black garbage bag for about a week in the sun.  And that will kill me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Sounds like you know how to get rid of bed bugs, Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Man speaking from experience.  But I'm ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I'm stocking up on biohazard tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm a bed bug survivalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  You know, that's, people worry about zombies.  There are no zombies, there are bed bugs.  Yeah, no, bed bugs are.  Why worry about zombies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm prepared for the zombie apocalypse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, good luck, it's not gonna happen,  but bed bugs, it happens.  Bed bugs happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true.  Well, I was feeling pretty relaxed.  Pretty relaxed since I'm not actually in my home.  I'm in a temporary home.  So I was like, well, if I bring them with me,  we're just gonna leave everything here.  Burn it down.  To Seattle.  Burn it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Did they teach bed bug remediation at Harvard?  Was that a class?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, yes, that's, well, you can only take it down  when you're too young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Second, second, yeah, yeah,  you have to be an upperclassman to take that, yeah.  Our show today, we'll have more with Stacey and Kevin.  There's gotta be Chromebook news.  There's gotta be, I'm gonna ask you.  I put it on there.  Get ready, Chromebook news, coming up.  But first, a word from CapTara.  If you're in business, you know that software  is critical to business, but I think a lot of businesses,  here are running software that's really old,  and here's how you know.  If you've got a machine that's kind of old,  kind of dusty, it's got a CRT monitor,  it's running anything before Windows XP,  it's got IE8 on it, Internet Explorer 8,  you're using old software.  That's not good.  Stop.  Go to capterra.com to find the right software  for your business.  It is software selection simplified.  CapTara has 700 categories of business software,  CRM, IT project management, e-commerce,  link management tools, web conferencing,  just to name a few.  We've been using CapTara ourselves.  We had a sales system one of our employees wrote.  Not to name names, crashes a lot,  requires, I think it requires ActiveX.  We realized finally, CapTara, so we're going  and we're gonna get a modern CRM system.  There you go.  So how does it work?  You go there.  You can pick the category you want.  I mean, even like Yoga Studio software,  veterinary management, that kind of thing,  any business, pick the software you want  and then check the filter boxes you want  based on product rating, number of users you can support,  the deployment, whether it's on the hard drive  or in the cloud, features, that kind of thing.  You could compare up to four side by side.  They'll show you a list of related categories  for further options.  And then, the best part, read the reviews.  875,000 vetted reviews from actual users on capterra.com  and they get a thousand new reviews every single day.  So you know when you're looking at software,  you're hearing from people who are actually using it,  you're getting the inside scoop.  I love that.  No matter what kind of software your business needs,  CapTara makes it easy to find the right program  you need fast.  If you've got a program that high school kid  wrote 10 years ago, now he's moved,  you don't know where he is,  it's time to go to CapTara.  And by the way, once you find that program,  leave a review after you use it for a while,  share your knowledge with other buyers.  That's what's so cool about CapTara.  Well, there's one more thing I didn't mention.  All of this free, free, free free, not freemium, free.  CapTara, C-A-P-T-E-double-R-A, capterra.com slash twig.  Millions of people have used CapTara  to find the right tools for their businesses.  We use it, you should use it.  Simplify your software selection.  It's complicated, but it doesn't have to be.  Don't Google it, don't call the radio show and say,  hey, Leo, I need yoga studio manager software.  What do you recommend?  No, go to capterra.com slash twig.  C-A-P-T-E-double-R-A.com slash twig.  CapTara is software selection simplified.  Thank you, CapTara, for your support.  Thank you, because we've been using you  for doing a great job.  Stacey, are you bringing your reformer,  your Pilates machine with you?  I hope you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am, I brought my reformer, my elliptical, my weight bench,  and all of my crazy weight things.  So you have a little gym.  I do have a, I have actually a substantial gym.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Nice.  I take Pilates every day I can.  I love Pilates.  It made the yoga studio software made me think of that.  My trainer said I should take hot yoga.  Now I don't wanna, oh, that sounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They squeegee the floors after hot yoga.  Squeegees are involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  And they probably have to.  Yeah, that's gross.  Ooh.  How hot is it, like 100 degrees hot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can get it from like 85 to,  I don't think people put it at 100.  That would be, but maybe they do.  But 85 is hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I have to question my trainer,  because he says he feels nauseous the entire class.  He's like, this is, I should do this?  This doesn't sound good.  Yeah, you should not do that.  It's not a, I mean, you can, but.  He says you'll love it, Leo.  You can wear short shorts.  So that's not a good reason.  That's not a good reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's distressing for everyone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Everybody else has to suffer  because I wanna have ventilation.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So I would recommend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm gonna give you a recommendation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I love Pilates.  I am a huge Pilates fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pilatesology is traditional.  It's a subscription software.  But you can have it on your phone.  You can have it on your roadkill.  You can have it on your tablet.  It's like $20 a month or something.  It's not crazy.  And it's classical Pilates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  It's Joseph Pilates' original.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the trainers are really good.  And it's a, like, I have that in addition to everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  And it's not just Matt Pilates.  Oh yeah, they use a reformer, right?  They've got reformer chairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They even have the foot corrector,  which I don't even know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I don't have a foot corrector.  I do have a chair.  Oh, I'm jealous.  Oh, I love my chair.  I was doing chair work today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So let me give you guys another option real quick.  We're Pilates nerds.  That's okay.  That's okay.  And I don't know if they have Pilates,  but you know that Peloton makes the treadmill  and the bikes and all that.  I have a Peloton bike I love.  Okay.  I do not, even though I love those pieces of equipment.  But what I did about two months ago  was I subscribed to Peloton Digital  for like $19.50 a month.  And they have the live classes  that you can just do without.  Just do on a regular bike.  Exactly.  I've actually been using,  I have not used the yoga, my wife has,  but the meditation.  I've been doing the meditation bits with that.  And sometimes the money and the power.  They have really expanded their offerings

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  because they now have stretching  and they have all sorts of stuff.  That's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  High intensity, interval training, all kinds of stuff.  So you don't need the Peloton equipment  if you don't want to drop four grand or more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's really expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, but you get the live stuff,  you get the on-demand stuff.  I have access to like 10,000 videos  and all the classes.  It's fantastic.  We're healthy nerds.  I don't know if they do Pilates though.  I never looked for it.  Healthy nerds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Pilates is awesome.  And it is stretch you out and make you strong.  And it's like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Flexible balance also for old folks like me.  That's important because we tend to teeter and totter.  You could just stop taking the afternoon martini.  I think it could be the afternoon martini  that's causing the tottering.  It could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't believe in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Google's civil war.  I don't know.  Do you credit this article from Fortune?  I do like the illustration.  I like Beth.  Beth Cowitt.  Oh, you know her, okay.  Some employees say Google's losing touch  with its don't be evil motto.  Happens when you get too big.  And of course we've seen.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They dropped that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  And they dropped the motto.  Well, they sort of dropped the model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like, wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah.  But they, I mean, I think they dropped it  and brought it back.  But how meaningful is that?  I mean, it started of course with employee protests  and walkouts and so forth.  But it also could be that it's challenging  as a company gets bigger to keep your vision thing going.  You think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your vision thing is predicated on technical genius  above being like a nice human,  which I think is a fairly common thing in the tech world  is like, hey, your tech skills or your whatever,  your reporting skills, your value as a cog  in the employment machine usurps your value  or usurps the value of other people  in that same machine sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  And when any company triples its workforce  in eight years, which is what Google has done,  it's gonna be very hard to maintain.  Apple has an Apple University with the sole purpose  of inculcating Apple's DNA into new employees  because they want continuity in Apple's beliefs.  I don't, does, Kevin, you didn't work for Google,  but you were inside Google, a contractor.  Do they have anything like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So as a contractor, I went through some pretty,  I'd say basic training because it was only like three hours.  And they were, for day one people that are contractors,  you could be a temp, a vendor or a contractor  and you would go to this training.  And it was more around protecting Google's information,  being security conscious, what your NDA meant,  what could happen if you broke the NDA  or did something you shouldn't do,  which is typical and unexpected.  And even regular Google employees  would go through that as well.  I didn't really see much on values  or the don't be evil or any of that.  And one experience doesn't mean  that's the way it is for everybody,  but I didn't see that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  The other problem that Beth talks about is leaks.  And she says a lot of activists,  including Liz Fong Jones who quit Google after the walkout,  don't like product leaks  because then it gives management a reason  not to tell people, employees what's happening.  And so that's another problem.  Programmers are getting more and more powerful.  They tend to be difficult to manage anyway.  I think it's really interesting that these massive companies,  which really used to be able to set their policies  and then ignore the workers,  because if you don't like it, we'll hire somebody else,  can't because workers in some classes,  some knowledge workers are hard to replace.  So they have to listen to engineers who say-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sometimes I think that it's not just,  you just have to invest more upfront.  And we saw this at actually at GigaOM,  we wanted to hire people who were senior.  We never wanted to train anybody  because that slowed us down.  And I would say I have become very skeptical  of the talent argument in the sense  that someone is irreplaceable,  even if they're a terrible human being.  It's just, it's hard to replace them.  It's going to, it might cut into your margins perhaps  or slow your delivery.  And those are real problems.  But I think part of it is that companies  aren't building a pipeline.  And they kind of, and I think that's,  that's a really important thing that companies aren't doing.  And yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  The other way of looking at this is,  oh man, these entitled techies,  they go to work for a company  and they act as if they're in charge.  That no one ever told them no when they were young.  And now, and by the way, it's ruining,  San Francisco for instance,  is no longer a place anybody wants to live.  And there was an article in the New York Times on May 21st  about how people who don't have college degrees  are leaving the big cities, including New York,  San Francisco, Santa Clara County,  Silicon Valley, Los Angeles,  because they can't afford to live there anymore.  And in some ways, I think there's going to be a backlash  against entitled engineers like the Google employees  because they're making a lot of money  and they're changing the way cities work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could argue that we're seeing a backlash against the,  I don't want to call it gentrification.  There was actually an article, possibly the New York Times,  or no, I think it was the New Yorker  on the Airbnbification of cities.  Yeah, it's terrible.  But there is something to that.  When I walk in downtown Austin,  it's very different as a city than a city like New York,  which has practical services intermixed with  crazy, awesome restaurants or clubs or things like that.  And I think there is merit to this idea  that when you have an upper middle class, a wealthy class,  I don't know what exactly to call it,  because it's more than just the 1%.  But the very wealthy who are able to live in a place  and then outsource all of their services,  your city becomes basically a playground for those people.  Kind of boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  That's kind of sad what's happened in San Francisco,  although there are also estimated 7,500 homeless people  in San Francisco, so much so that the city council  has had to hire a poop patrol to patrol the streets  and clean up human excrement.  And as somebody who used to live in San Francisco  and now goes back from time to time,  there's some real problems downtown.  It's really sad.  Yeah.  And there are, another problem is Ubers.  People are pointing to Ubers for traffic,  part of the traffic problems of some of these  major urban areas, New York and San Francisco,  because there are so many rideshares on the road,  because apparently this upper middle class 2%ers,  they don't like to drive.  They like to take a nice black car service  whenever possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  In terms of the leaks, I just wanna be clear  so that people understand.  I assume most people know, in case they don't,  that every, I think it's Friday, it might be Thursday.  No, it's Fridays.  They have an open forum with Larry and Sergey,  although I think only one of them has been showing up  for the last while now.  And it's basically an all-hands meeting.  And there's discussion about what the company is doing.  There are no TVCs, no temps, no windows,  no contractors that are allowed to go to that.  I know that for a fact.  I mean, it was never allowed.  You can't go, because even, yeah.  No, and obviously it's held in the main building  at the Googleplex, and then it's broadcast  all over the world so people can tune in and whatnot.  But it's broadcast in specific rooms,  group rooms, like auditoriums.  So I could not enter.  It would be impossible.  My badge color would not allow me entry.  So the leaks are coming from actual Google employees,  just to be very clear there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, and in fact, Google's clamping down  on information that can be shared into internal information.  They're really trying to stop these leaks.  And I understand why, honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I'm going to try to avoid any techno panic stories  without Jeff to hear.  How about more Chrome OS tablets on the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I heard something about that.  I'm glad you asked.  Flapjack.  Flapjack, yeah.  This has been a project that's been in the works for a while,  but I kind of consolidated.  Is this from Google?  Well, that particular picture right there  is the ASUS, which is the same as the ASUS.  I'm sorry, that's the ASUS, which  is the same as the ASUS.  There's really only one Chrome OS tablet out there  other than the Pixel Slate right now.  And that's been around since April.  These are in still in progress, so I  don't know what they look like.  We just know some of the capabilities, the sizes.  It looks like 8 inch, which would actually  be new, because the current slate by ASUS and ASUS,  that's 10.1.  I missed my 7 inch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  What was that?  The Nexus.  Nexus.  I loved that.  The Nexus.  That's just the right size.  8 would be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'm going to get back to that,  because I actually don't think so, and I'll tell you why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, I feel like 8 would be the same size as the Nexus,  because the bezels will be smaller,  so it'll be roughly the same form factor.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  We'll talk about it.  Let's talk about it.  Let's talk about it now.  So I have learned something, and I kind of  made a theorem on this, that the smaller a device screen is,  you lose functionality equally from it  having a desktop browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  It's kind of a linear graph of usability over size.  And I don't know how linear it is, but I'll agree with you.  I mean, the Apple Watch is a perfect example.  Usability has gone way down, because that screen  is so tiny, especially when you stand it  next to a 30 inch surface studio.  There's a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, a small Chrome OS tablet sounds great.  And I actually had drinks with one  of the folks that watches the show on Saturday,  this past weekend.  And we had a long talk about Chrome phones, perhaps,  and Chrome tablets, smaller Chrome devices.  And I just, after using the Acer, which came out back  in April, granted, it's not a performance powerhouse.  That's the first issue I had with it.  But it was hard to use a desktop browser on a screen that  was 10.1 inches.  And now they're looking at 8 inches.  And I'm like, no.  And people want Chrome phones for some good reasons.  Google can control the update cycle, for example, and so on.  But no.  It sounds great in theory, but if you've used a small tablet,  it's pretty limited when it has a desktop browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, and to your point, I mean, the Nexus 7  was Android, not Chrome OS.  Exactly.  So your point would be that Chrome OS is  aimed at smaller screens, so it has more affordances  for smaller screens.  But Chrome OS really is a desktop operating system  that needs a bigger screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's my opinion.  If we were going to see Google do a Chrome phone, what  I would like to see is something along the lines of the Samsung  DeX, where it's an Android phone.  It runs Android.  And then when you dock it, it then runs Chrome OS  on your monitor.  That's a good idea.  Yeah, that is a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  The Samsung DeX isn't great, because it's  a Samsung OS that's weird.  But the idea is great.  I mean, this thing, this is the S10+.  This is a desktop-grade processor.  It's got a terabyte of storage.  It's got 12 gigs of RAM.  I mean, that's a computer.  All you need is a screen and a keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How have we been talking about this for a while?  I mean, I feel like all the way back in 2008,  we were talking about docking our phones, granted.  They did not have the processing power back then.  But I mean, there's reasons why we don't do this.  And I'm not sure what those reasons are.  That's why I'm here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Reason one is Android does not scale.  So I like your point of view.  I like your point of view, which is Chrome OS for the desktop,  Android for the portable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, see, DeX, Stacey, if you haven't seen DeX,  it's basically an Android.  Yeah, it's like an Android desktop.  And Android is not a desktop operating system.  It's not meant for that.  Yeah, you can use it that way, but it's not ideal.  Chrome OS is definitely a desktop system,  definitely not geared towards using as a mobile interface.  So my thought was, hey, why not have the two in a sense  and run one or the other?  And the nice thing is, granted, with Chrome OS on that phone  or device, it always has internet connectivity  for starters.  You also have access to all of your stuff in the cloud,  all your Google stuff.  But if you have local stuff in Android,  today on a Chromebook, you can move and access  Android information between the Android container and Chrome OS.  So now you've got all your phone data right there as well.  So to me, it's like, once the right design comes in,  the right processing power, because I'm not  convinced that ARM Chromebooks are the way to go,  just having used so many of them.  But again, my needs are probably more than most people.  Then maybe this could happen.  But I don't want to see Chrome on a phone by itself.  Because then Android's running in a container.  There's a small performance hit.  Just have it be like a not a dual boot system,  but almost like the Motorola Atrix.  Remember that?  The laptop?  Why did that fail?  You put your phone in the laptop,  and it would boot up to some obscure Linux UI.  And everyone's like, what is this?  But people know Chrome.  So if that phone booted up into Chrome OS on a monitor,  that's familiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true.  That might be good for kids too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  So just to be clear, you haven't seen  any hardware called Flapjack.  What you're looking at is the Chromium commits  that contain this string, Flapjack,  and additional information related,  including some designations, C18 and C19.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yep.  Yep.  So now you know that the panels that are there,  and I've already looked up all the specs on those.  It's going to have a digitizer.  So it will have a pen.  Say a Wacom digitizer.  Wacom, yes.  Took me a few years to learn how to say that too.  Did I get it right?  You did well.  In fact, we even know the processor.  If you scroll down, I believe we can  see that there's a MediaTek processor in there,  8183 if I recall correctly, with wireless charging support,  which that would be a first for a Chrome OS tablet.  And yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  You don't know who the manufacturer is,  but you think it might be Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I wondered.  I thought so because it said there were references  to Project Flapjack.  And to me, that's like a typical Google thing.  Project Crostini, and Project This, and Project That.  But there are other Chromebooks that  do have the word project in them that are not Google.  So I'm going to go with a backup guess just for the heck of it.  And this one's going to come out of left field.  But I think Lenovo.  They are one of the few folks that still make Android  tablets, kind of low end stuff.  But they also make a high end Lenovo Chromebook  with a 4K display and so on.  They're not in the Chrome OS tablet game yet.  So I'm thinking, huh, could be Lenovo.  But that's just my gut.  I've seen no evidence of that whatsoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  So any time frame you think for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Based on the code and where they're at,  I would be shocked if it would be before October.  I'll say fourth quarter of this year.  And I'm judging that based on what I see them working on.  I mean, you can tell when they're almost  done designing a product when they're just fixing minor bugs,  but when they're trying to get the LEDs to light up  or the battery power to.  So you're probably a good four to six months away minimum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  OK, Flapjack.  Flapjack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I want pancakes, you guys.  It's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  If you like Flapjack, you'll like our new operating system,  Syrup.  It's lickable.  The geek benches you're seeing on this, are they fast or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Not so much.  And that's why I say don't expect this to be  like a Chrome phone kind of chip.  They're roughly comparable to like a Celeron, maybe a Pentium,  maybe.  And I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that,  because there's a market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  That's all you'd expect from a MediaTek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no.  MediaTek has been doing some really good silicon lately.  Really?  They have.  They have.  OK.  Yeah, they have.  They're coming up in the world, man.  I mean, like anybody, they started out low,  and now they're doing bigger and better, and they'll get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Let me ask Mr. About Chromebooks, in fact.  Do you think Chrome OS runs better under ARM or Intel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, define better.  I mean, faster?  No, I'd say Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Intel's, well, that's better, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You might say, well, the Android apps  run better on the ARM chips, because they're natively for ARM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  You have an advantage with Android apps,

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's a minimal advantage,  but I could see that being a differentiation.  But in terms of performance, I mean, let's put it this way.  There's a Chromebook in the works called Chezza.  I think we've talked about it before on the show,  that's going to run on the Snapdragon 845,  although maybe they'll switch to 855 at this point.  And it'll have LTE.  I presume a tablet, based on what I've seen.  But I am not sure that a mid to high-end Chromebook user  is going to be happy with an ARM processor like that.  Chrome OS is built on Linux just as much of Android is,  but it's not light like Android.  So I skew towards the Intel processors.  Perfect example.  And again, not everybody's a developer, I get that.  But I want to use Android Studio in Linux on Christina,  which I can do now.  Google says the recommended minimum hardware is a Core i5  and not the Core i5 that's in the Pixelbook  or the Pixel Slate,  because those are Y-series processors  that use less power.  They want the U-series.  So I'm testing a U-series Chromebook right now  with Android Studio because it runs on the slate,  but the builds happen three times faster on the U-series.  So ARM, for me, is just not an option.  For basic Chromebook use, absolutely, no problem.  But it depends on the type of user you are,  what you need to do, quite honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  And based on what you said about screen size,  what's the minimum Chromebook screen you would recommend?  13, 14, 15?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm kind of partial to the 12 1 1 2 of the slate and above.  I'm testing a 13 1 1 2 right now,  and there are 14 and 15 inch displays up to 4K.  Some people are happy with the 11.6,  which is a pretty standard.  That's like the smallest typical Chromebook display.  I'm just happy that they're moving all towards 1080p displays  because the 720p displays on the older ones,  and that's just kind of lame at this point,  considering all the video people watch on these things  and whatnot.  So I think it's personal preference for me.  It's gotta be at least 12 1 1 2 inches.  Now, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  And then you may want even more  with this new virtual desk feature.  I'm excited about this.  This is something I love in Linux.  Use it all the time.  Use it on Mac OS.  Use it all the time.  Use it on Windows.  I have to learn different key commands for each one,  but even Windows supports it in a little janky way.  The idea is that you can go full screen with your apps,  but you can have different workspaces.  So it's easy to slide to the next app,  the next full screen app,  or have multiple windows open in the same workspace,  the multiple related windows.  So is that coming to Chrome OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It is, it is.  If you scroll down,  there's an actual video from the developers that I found  because they're testing this internally.  They're developing it and testing it.  And if you click that, there's no sound, so that's fine.  And you'll see he's actually demonstrating  where they're at in the project.  Oh, I love this.  You can see he's moving to another desk, moving his apps.  And the funny thing is, I mean, Chrome OS has a desktop,  but you can't put anything on it.  You can't use it.  So this, to me, this is like the first time  we're actually getting some value out of having a workspace  or a desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  The desktop's always just been like the wallpaper  for the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, that's it.  You can't pin anything there or do anything with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I like that.  That'll be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  It looks like they were targeting Chrome OS 76,  which is due out in beginning of, middle of June,  but now I'm thinking 77 because the freeze date for code  has passed for 76.  So, but by the end of the summer, I think you'll see this  and I can't wait because I can group my things,  my desktops by video consumption and social media  and development and just three finger tab and overview mode  and switch, switch, switch.  It's so much easier and so much faster.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, that's our Chromebook segment.  Whenever we can get Kevin Toffel on,  we're going to get the latest Chromebook news.  Thank you.  Update on Chromebooks.  About Chromebooks.com.  Yeah, and I have no take on Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm like, my daughter may use one next year.  And if that's the case, I will have questions for you.  Yeah, she will.  No, they've got Macbooks actually right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Really?  Wow.  Yeah, that's highfalutin.  That's pretty fancy.  Nice.  Pretty fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're 2013 Macbooks, so.  Oh, nevermind.  So.  Fracking off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you want to talk about Qualcomm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  You know, you sensed that I was kind of ambivalent  about what's next.  I don't see anything that really grabs me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Qualcomm, the FTC today ruled  that Qualcomm's licensing practices are not 100% kosher.  Stock price went down 10%,

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  the most volatile stock on the market, Rowan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a US District Court judge, I'm sorry.  Okay.  The US District Court judge in San Jose,  they sided with the Federal Trade Commission.  So the Federal Trade Commission  had brought an antitrust lawsuit  against Qualcomm two years ago.  Yeah, it's been a long time, yeah.  Yeah, and they basically were like,  Qualcomm appealed, this judge was like, eh, no.  I agree with the FTC, which is pretty rare actually,  that judges do this, especially in something this big.  But basically they said that Qualcomm violated  the antitrust law charging high royalties for its patents  to eliminate rivals.  And she also said, yeah, you shouldn't charge royalties  based on a percentage of the smartphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  That was, these were exactly Apple's complaints.  Yes.  But Apple settled.  But they weren't getting friend licensing,  but Apple's out of it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple's out of it,  possibly because they realized that Intel's modems  weren't gonna work as well as Qualcomm's.  Yeah, no, it's pretty clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Apple said, if we're gonna have a 5G phone,  we're gonna have to do a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So basically the judge is saying Qualcomm has to negotiate  and renegotiate its licensing agreements  and stop threatening to cut off access to chips  for customers to get upset.  And it must license its patents  to rival chip makers using friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Apple, if you could have just hung in there  for a few more days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, they are, Qualcomm is going to say,  they're going to seek an appeal, or seek a stay and appeal.  So we'll see.  This is like the Oracle Android Google thing that just,  you know, in five years,  maybe this will be in front of the Supreme Court,  but who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Did either of you read about Qualcomm?  I thought, and I don't wanna spread misinformation,  so I'm gonna ask if you saw this.  I thought I saw something that Qualcomm was entitled  to payments or royalties, even in certain cases,  even if their chips were not used.  Oh yeah. Yes.  That's absolutely true.  Okay. That is absolutely true.  I don't remember where I saw that,  but when I read it, I'm like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Because they have, in fact, that's really the problem  is they have the key patents  that make almost every smartphone work,  regardless of the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So the patent royalty payments then, okay.  So yeah. Okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  But I mean, they did invent those things.  It's not like they-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but they also participated in standards organizations,  and when you participate in standards organizations,  a lot of times you're gonna-

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, we want that CDMA standard to go forward.  We like that standard.  It's a good standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but they have LTE-related patents as well.  I mean, they knew that CDMA was not gonna-  They even have 5G patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yes, they do.  They do.  Did they make those inventions  or do they acquire the patents?  Do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've done both.  I mean, it depends on the patents.  I'm sure there's probably a mix.  It's not like one 5G patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Some of our hosts, some won't name names,  have accused Qualcomm of basically turning into  a patent acquisition firm, or they have two businesses.  They have the chip business,  but the far more profitable business is the patent business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Qualcomm licensing.  Yeah, no, I would agree with them.  I mean, remember back when we thought  WiMAX was gonna be a thing?  Qualcomm bought a bunch of companies,  even though they were like,  screw WiMAX, that's terrible.  But we're gonna hinge our bets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Not everybody thought WiMAX was gonna be a thing.  You know who really liked WiMAX?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  A little company called Sprint.  And you know what happened  to that little company called Sprint?  Whatever happened to that little company called Sprint?  They really hurt them for years,  and they're still laggardly.  The FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, has now said,  I like that merger deal.  And you know what I do too,  if they do what they said they will do,  T-Mobile, which has been trying to merge with Sprint,  despite some kind of shade  being thrown by other government agencies,  has promised to deliver 5G coverage  to up to 97% of the population within three years.  That got Ajit Pai's attention.  99% of US population coverage  within six years of the mergers close.  90% of rural Americans.  That's actually, to me, a really important number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to do that  to get any deal through in the go.  When I go to Washington and talk to people about,  you know how we're all freaking out about net neutrality?  You know what gets them all excited?  Rural broadband access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  And I agree.  I mean, you can do both.  Right.  You don't have to reward companies  that are fighting net neutrality  just because they're gonna give us rural access.  My real problem is, we've seen this time and time again  with big ISPs make promises like this  and get their merger, get their license, whatever,  and not do it.  So I would, there are severe penalties if they don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's always severe penalties, but you know what?  Those are enforced also by the FCC,  and the FCC is like, eh, eh, you're doing all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Billions of dollars in penalties.  I agree.  Yeah, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Whose 5G equipment are they gonna roll out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a question.  Can you trust the Finns?  They're awfully close to Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They are.  Now, what does it mean that the DOJ?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, there's the other side.  I think that was, I have good news and I have bad news.  The chairman.  Wait, Eric's a Swedish company.  Sorry.  They're Swedish?  Okay.  Isn't Eric's in Sweden?  They're not in Finland.  Correct.  Nokia's in Finland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, sorry, go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, so the chairman was all, ooh, nice, I like it, sexy.  A guarantee that 90% of Americans  will have mobile broadband access, 100 megabits or more.  99% of 50 megabits or more.  All and two thirds of rural America  will have access to high speed mid-band 5G.  All things we love.  And then, whoops, the DOJ staff recommends a lawsuit  to block the merger, one day later, one day later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I would also say, if you're gonna condition this deal,  which it looks like they're trying to make happen,  having mobile broadband access of 50 megabits per second,  you cannot have that and have it be functional  under the current data cap regime for mobile broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when we start talking about  how this deal actually goes down,  those are the sort of things you wanna look at.  It's fine.  I mean, I am like, wireless with 5G  in the right spectrum bands,  you could recreate the quality of wired broadband for most,  but you cannot charge them 10 bucks a gigabyte per month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  By the way, it's interesting  that you say the right spectrum bands,  because the National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration is warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, we have to stop this right now.  I just did a, so when I was in Anaheim,  when I got my bed bugs,  I was actually doing a presentation on 5G,  and this is actually a story that I slated,  or not that particular story,  but this, it was an article in Nature  from a couple of weeks ago.  We, okay, when we talk about 5G,  we're talking about three different possible things.  And I just have to say this,  the spectrum bands that they're talking about,  we have allocated in the US,  we have just done a 24 gigahertz block,  but many of the operators are not gonna be doing  most of their deployment in those bands,  because they're really crap when it comes to propagation.  They're crap bands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  So let me explain, let me explain what's going on.  Weather satellites, and I think this is really cool,  it's a cool hack,  use this 24 gigahertz band to passively measure,  what is it they measure in 24 gigahertz?  Water vapor, that's right.  So they're passive sounders on these satellites  and they use it to predict,  and in fact, NOAA warns that if this 24 gigahertz band  is given over to 5G,  it would give them a 77% data loss  on these water vapor,  and they said our prediction abilities  will go back to what we had back in 1980.  But Stacey, I would point out that that's not the only band,  because there are other bands used  for similar passive monitoring of other weather phenomena.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yes, but those are at 36 and 37.  Are you looking at the nature story?  Because they have a wonderful sharing spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I will get the nature story up on my radar, so to speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So those bands have terrible spectral propagation.  So basically they don't pass through walls,  they don't pass through water,  this is why they use it for that.  So when it rains, these don't work.  And we're working our way around it by using beamforming,  by using MIMO, by using a lot of other technologies.  This is actually where Facebook is doing,  Facebook and Google both have projects.  So Facebook's terahertz efforts are right in these bands.  But when we talk about 5G from the carriers,  they're talking about using these bands,  they're buying these bands,  but when you talk to them in their engineering departments,  they're going to move, migrate for mobile use,  they're gonna migrate down to whatever spectrum they own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  These microwave frequencies are too high,  they don't propagate well, is what you're saying.  So 23.8 gigahertz is used for water vapor,  36 to 37 is used for rain or snow,  50.2 to 50.4 is used for atmospheric temperature,  and 86 to 92 gigahertz is used for clouds and ice.  So there is concern because in every one of these cases,  or at least adjacent bands,  are considered for 5G internationally.  However, your point is that no one's gonna use them  because they don't propagate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're gonna use them highly locally.  So this could affect things.  But the other aspect of this is we've actually done  really well with learning how to guard against disruption  in various bands.  So because it's all digital, we're good at that.  And I don't know if you guys remember  White Space's broadband,  but one of the challenges there was that we were going  to cause interference.  And now we've got these cool spectrum sharing databases  that are awesome and work really well.  So you could also deploy something like that  in these upper band areas  so you don't interfere with the weather.  But yeah, we're gonna have to adapt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  The thing that's frustrating is they've known about this  since at least 2010.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, we've known about- That's where I was going.  Why did we auction these off, these bands,  and not see this coming?  That's what I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's what the FCC does.  I mean, remember how we-

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I might add, do it quite well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, White Space's broadband, we're like,  oh, that's where we're using all of our wireless microphones.  We can't use that for something else.  And then they're like, yeah, we can.  We'll work it out.  And the industry worked it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  And then you saw it with-  Well, but I will point out there was another one  that I was vividly involved with.  Are we about to talk about-  BPL, broadcast over power lines.  And this was Michael, the FCC chairman-  Powell, Michael Powell.  Michael Powell was really pushing this.  In fact, I remember I interviewed him in 2004  and he took us back to the labs.  He said, look at this, we're able to use power lines.  And what we do is we notch it.  Because hams and emergency radio folks were very worried  because one of the things that happens  when you start pushing broadband over power lines,  you generate huge amounts of interference  at certain frequencies,  which happened to be ham frequencies  and more importantly, emergency radio frequencies.  That got killed.  Right, and so did the-  Michael Powell was of the opinion,  oh no, we can fix this.  We'll notch it.  Honest, it's not gonna be a problem.  And it got killed, probably rightly so, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, well, we had that with LTE,  a satellite-based terrestrial  and satellite-based LTE network called LightSquared.  That died because it interfered with GPS.  And the FCC was like, we'll figure it out.  And then everybody who uses GPS was like, nope.  So basically, it depends on how much lobbying  you're willing to do and have the power to do.  And I don't think NOAA has a lot of lobbying power,

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  unfortunately.  But we do need weather forecasts.  You know who needs those?  Farmers, cities.  But there are ways around this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good that we're talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Don't say that if it's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Meanwhile.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We can do, it is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I believe you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  because you're Stacy Higginbotham.  She would know.  Able to leap tall processors in a single bound.  I used to have a spectrum,  an ITU spectrum chart on my wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She used to have an ITU spectrum chart on her wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Like, come on.  I love spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's my favorite thing in the world.  I eat spectrum for breakfast.  But you can't eat spectrum for breakfast.  But yes, it is gonna cost money.  And we will have to figure this out.  It's good that they're bringing this up.  As our chat room,  Eamonn in our chat room says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  NOAA didn't need a weatherman.  You don't need a weatherman  to know which way the wind blows.  So back to T-Mobile and Sprint.  You got the chairman of the FCC all hot and bothered.  He's excited.  You got the DOJ ready to sue.  And basically, people are saying it's a push.  People are saying it's a push.  50-50.  We don't know what's gonna happen.  I'd like to see a merger.  I use T-Mobile.  I think Sprint is pretty much useless in our area.  Be nice to see a merge.  Especially if they live up to that pledge.  To get 97% 5G coverage in three years,  that would be awesome.  You don't think they'll do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, even if they did do it,  there's no guarantee on pricing.  There's no guarantee on the quality of the network.  There's a lot of things.  It's one thing to say I'm building something out.  It's another thing to say I'm building something else.  It's good.  And coverage doesn't mean quality speeds.  Coverage just means you can get a bar possibly there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  You remember when AT&T and Time Warner, the merger,  and they told everybody that once that merger happens,  we are gonna hire thousands of new employees.  What happened?  They fired, they lost 27,500 jobs.  So it just shows you can promise regulators  whatever you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you can actually lie to the FCC.  You cannot lie to the SEC.  So I always find it interesting to look at what companies  say in their 10Ks, their documents with the FCC.  Sorry, SEC.  Because the FCC, they can just do whatever they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  AT&T promised 7,000 new jobs.  Actually, that wasn't the merger.  That was to get a tax break.  I apologize.  They cut 20, that was for the big federal tax break  we did get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you remember they gave the 1,000 or $3,000 bonuses  to people as part of the tax break?  Oh yeah.  Yeah, that was nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  And then they fired 27,500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.  You're both right, but I'll tell you what.  And I think T-Mobile has done a tremendous job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I'm a John Ledger lover, not a fighter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, well, even beyond him, I like him as well.  But I remember I had just started at GigaOM  and either at CES or some other event,  I had an interview with Neville Ray, who was the CTO.  And he was trying to convince me up to yin yang  about how they're gonna expand, they're gonna do this  with all the spectrum, blah, blah, blah.  And I'm like, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  And I walked away, I'm like, you're done, buddy.  I just don't see it happen.  I just don't.  So they did.  Ledger came in, they've made changes, they've cut prices,  they've pushed the prices of competitors down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, more than just their own prices.  They have.  They've put the screws to Verizon and AT&T.  Absolutely.  And it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Right, and disclosure, I switched from AT&T  to T-Mobile about three years ago.  Me too.  And I'm a happy customer.  Happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, mostly happy.  It turns out that when we moved to our new studio  here in the beautiful Eastside studio,  there was zero T-Mobile coverage.  So we had to get a Femto cell,  which we have in the other room, connect to our connections.  Sure, through your broadband.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And again, this doesn't guarantee anything.  Stacey, you're absolutely right.  They could lie to the FTC, et cetera,  there's no guarantees.  But if I had to pick one of the companies,  one of the major US carriers to actually pull this off  and make it a good thing for more people than not,  it would be T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I agree.  I think they've been, I mean, all carriers suck,  but they suck the least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yes?  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's fair.  Stacey, I don't want to say who she's, what her carrier is,  but I know, so maybe that's, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, I have, no, I don't love my carrier.  My carrier is just my carrier.  I have no, like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  you'd be foolish to love your carrier  because your carrier does not love you.  They just love the color of your money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like, my carrier loves charging me lots of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I have Verizon on this, on this Galaxy S10,  and it's ridiculously expensive,  but on the other hand, the connectivity is excellent.  It's very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Stacey, you're moving to T-Mobile's backyard there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I mean, it is something I am going to evaluate  when I finish doing that.  Although I'm switching from Spectrum to Comcast,  so we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Oh, we'd like to welcome you to the Comcast family, Stacey.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Comcast has already sent me an email  offering to set me up with kinds of things.  Let me just say, it's Comtastic.  Well, we didn't sign up under money.  Can you get Sonic where you are?  In San Francisco, or in Seattle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't believe so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because they're-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll email Dane.  I'll be like, Dane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Email Dane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I'm kind of nutty because-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm a happy Sonic customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Sonic is the best by far.  Sonic is awesome.  If you can get Sonic fiber, you-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't even have fiber and it's still-

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I want to move somewhere else in Petaluma  just to get the fiber.  We have fiber here.  We have 10 gigabits symmetric.  So sometimes I'll just come to work and-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, their fusion non-fiber solution works.  Yeah, that's an ADSL2 solution.  That works just fine for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  You get two lines and-  You get two lines and it does the job.  It's the best you can get with ADSL.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My options are CenturyLink.  Ugh.  Infinity.  Ugh.  Viasat.  Ugh.  Or the Kitsap PUD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Do you-  Oh!  But Seattle is so techie.  There might be something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is AT&T an option?  Because if AT&T is an option,  then you can get Sonic.  Oh, really?  AT&T is not an option because they use AT&T's ADSL.  If you can't get AT&T, then you're-  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I meant CenturyLink.  Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  So I cannot get Sonic.  Residential gigabit broadband service  is available in more than 170,000 households in Seattle  from CenturyLink and Wave.  They are deploying fiber.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I will-  Do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just do that.  Don't ignore me.  Do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Comcast doesn't have fiber in my area yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Do not get that X1 piece of crap  that Comcast pretends is a DVR.  Just bite the bullet and get a TiVo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't have cables, so I don't care.  Oh, you don't care.  I haven't had cable in like over a decade.  You don't care.  Yeah.  I just plug in my Roku.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, really that's all I need.  I'm curious, because I have Verizon FIOS here at the house  and I've had it for a couple of years.  What does Sonic provide and what's the monthly cost?  Just curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  $60 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  No, it's cheaper for fiber, believe it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's cheaper for fiber, but nobody can get fiber.  It's for their two lines of ADSL  merged into one, it's like 60 bucks a month, I want to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And what's the upload and download limit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get between 10 and 20.  So this is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you're also supporting Dane Jasper in his company.  He was the greatest independent internet service provider

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  between 10 and 20 up and between five and 10 down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were-  There's no caps, he's very pro net neutrality.  Oh, he's fought the good fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, Dane's an old friend.  I've known him for years and years and yeah,  he is the best.  I'm thrilled that you know him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I've served him drinks on my rooftop deck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I love Dane. That's more than I can say.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So caps are the key, Stacey,  because if you're going to have fast internet-  No caps on Sonic, zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  So get this, this is their fiber, if you can get it,  $40 a month for, I think it's $50 a month.  Gigabit fiber, I can't remember.  It's not symmetric.  No data caps, 15 email accounts, gigabyte of storage,  personal web hosting, fax line service,  and that includes home phone as well as internet.  But did I mention that?  I mean, that is amazing.  50 megabits, not gigabits, right?  Yeah, did I say gig? I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, it's okay.  I'm like wow.  I have gigabit fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yes, no, no, no, no, no.  I thought it was gigabit fiber.  Well, there you go, they have-  Oh, it is gigabit.  It's just gigabit down.  It's gigabit down.  But it's, I don't remember what it is up.  It's enough up, it's 30 up or whatever.  Not probably, sure.  Yeah.  I pay about 100.  You can't get symmetric.  I mean, we have symmetric here, which is awesome.  Yeah.  So 40 is a great price for gigabit.  Absolutely.  Oh yeah.  Including phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think even, I mean,  there's a lot of municipal providers who can't offer that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  When I interviewed him, I said,  what are you gonna lose your shirt, dude?  He said, no, we figured it out when we put it in,  if one in five home owners subscribes,  if we can get that 20% penetration,  it is a profitable business.  Wow. It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no.  I've gotten one of my neighbors to sign up.  Yeah, that's a good thing.  I'm working on the rest.  Yeah, smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Kevin, in a giga-ohm, I was on the broadband beat  and Dane was like right there.  I did so many interviews with him  talking about profitability and infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, we had a triangulation with him.  And I guess really we should say he's still a sponsor  because he sponsors us with his 10 gigabit symmetric fiber.  Shh, don't tell him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're running over his wires right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Right now, we're running over his wires.  No cap.  No cap, I love it.  We wanna do the change log.  Let me do an ad and then, well,  there's a couple more things.  I wanna address this works with Nest thing  because we were talking about this last week.  Oh yeah.  Yeah, that, yeah, there was something else  that we just talked about. That's changed.  Yeah, I think Google has...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have that in the change log.  You wanna just start the change log?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Okay, let's change the change log.  The Google change log.  Concern after Google I.O. about what was gonna happen  when the works with Nest program was deprecated August 31st,  replaced with works with Google Assistant.  The issue, of course, and Stacey,  I think you calmed everybody down a little bit,  but the issue was, well, is this gonna break my whole,  you know, home network?  And they say your existing devices and integrations  will continue working with your Nest account.  You won't have new features that will be available  with a Google account.  And we're gonna stop accepting new works  with Nest connections on August 31st.  But it sounds like they're really gonna commit  to making sure all the integrations you're using  will be replicated in the new setup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, and they're also saying  if you don't wanna switch it over, you'll be okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  At least for a while.  I don't know if that would be forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You won't get any cool new stuff,  but your home won't break, which is nice,  because people do not wanna keep setting up  as the one who's about to have.  We got a call into the show.  This guy lost his whole hub settings,  and he said it took him seven hours to replicate everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But this is what Google should have done the first time.  They should not have done it the way they did  and walked it back.  They should have done this the first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, I think the good news, look, people make mistakes.  The good news is Google heard people  and very quickly acted to fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm now just realizing we didn't talk about this  on our show, Kevin, and that was kind of stupid of us.  Fair enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It was.  I put a hundred words in the newsletter.  It's fine, it's all good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I have to say, I woke up with a strange man  in my bed this morning, and I think it was, I blame Google.  Did this happen to you?  Has this happened to you?  I asked, I said, hey Google, what time is it?  And some guy said, it's 7.30.  I said, who are you?  He said, I'm John Legend.  Has your Google Assistant started talking  in John Legend's voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mine is packed, so no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Mine has not.  It is not packed, but no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I did have to offer, it actually offered me,  I had to turn it on though.  I had to opt into John Legend.  I don't think I turned it on,

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  or maybe Lisa, she does love John Legend.  So here is John Legend's voice on your Google Assistant.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Here are the voices you can pick for your Google Assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hi, John Legend here.  I lent my voice to your Google Assistant  so you can hear me do things like answer your questions,  brief you on the weather, and tell jokes  while the regular Assistant voice handles the rest.  Let's have some fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Okay, John.  Okay.  Not that I don't like John Legend,  but it would be nice to have other celebrity voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, and this is something,  I'm looking this up because I believe what they did  is they made a big deal of having John Legend come on,  and they actually recreated his voice  from like a limited subset of his comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yes, that's exactly right.  And they use, what is the term they use?  They use his phrasing and his inflections  to then, and of course the sound of his voice  to then inform the Assistant.  This is the one I chose.  I think I chose green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here are the voices you can pick for your Google Assistant.  If you like this voice and want me to keep using it,  just stop here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  You know what?  There are a bunch of other choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here are the voices you can pick for your Google Assistant

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  so if you like this voice and want me to keep using it,  just stop here. British racing green, purple, pink,  but I really like, I'm just gonna say I like the green,  and I figured out why actually after I picked it.  Cause it sounds just like the voice  on the old Apple Dina book video.  Do you remember seeing that?  No.  No.  This was, God, it was like,  I wanna say like the 90s, early 90s,  it was their vision of what the future was gonna be like.  I think it was at a TED conference  back when they were in Monterey.  I can't find the video.  But it was a really cool vision.  There was a guy in a bow tie.  It was on a laptop, but it was called a Dina book.  And he'd say, you have five appointments  and your mother is calling and stuff.  And it was that voice.  I swear to God, it was that voice.  So I feel like Google, it's an Easter egg, I would think.  That Google maybe tried to duplicate that old voice  for people like, for old timers like me.  Here it is.  This was 1987.  The Knowledge Navigator from Apple.  And it forever seemed like this is never gonna happen.  But we're kinda getting there.  This is all, forget all this froufy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Masterpiece theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  It is.  Welcome, there it is.  There's the Dina book  with a completely superfluous metal weird handle.  This is our human protagonist  who is apparently a professor entering his office.  He opens the book and speaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have three messages.  Your graduate research team in Guatemala just checking in.  Doesn't that sound like the same voice?  Robert Jordan, a second semester junior  requesting a second extension on his term paper.  And your mother reminding you about your father.  Surprise birthday party next Sunday.  Today you have a faculty lunch at 12 o'clock.  You need to take-

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  This is very much like the Google Assistant, isn't it?  Yes.  It is.  We didn't know it was gonna take 30 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me see the lecture notes from last semester.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  This is exactly the kind of thing,  I could see this demo on Google IOs stage this year.  No, that's not enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I need to review-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And did you notice it was a foldable screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yup, it is a foldable screen  with a lot of weird space age-  Your friend, Jill Gilbert-  Fezzles. Fezzles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Published an article about deforestation in the Amazon  and its effects on rainfall in the sub-Sahara.  It also covers droughts effect-

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  By the way, somebody pointed out the camera on this thing  is the size of an actual digital camera.  It's not like we can't figure out  how to get that lens any smaller.  I don't think it's physically possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, let's see.  There's an article about five years ago,  Dr. Flemson or something.  This we haven't got.  We disagreed with the direction of Jill's research.  John Fleming of Upsala University.  He published in the journal-  Although Google's pretty good at correcting my typos.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you can actually type something like that into Google.  You just can't say it.  You can't say it yet, but soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Anyway, I just, I heard that voice.  Anyway, John Legend, I guess that's not new,  but you can pick it along with a bunch of different colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I told you about the colors once.  Do you remember-  Yeah, no, I remember that.  No, why did they do the colors?  Because, yeah, they do it because they didn't want it  to be racist or sexist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought that was nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Have you heard about the translatotron?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I read about it in our newsletter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Okay, well good, Stacy.  Explain what the hell an end-to-end speech-to-peach  translation module is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't heard that one.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Shh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  It seems like-  Actually, it's better to demonstrate it.  Okay, well we have some demonstrations.  Actually, that was what my plan was.  So, which one?  I'll go a little farther down.  Yeah, so here's the Spanish input.  This is a real human speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Larry me pregunto, como me sentia?  Y creo que es cuando empecé a llorar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  So the first thing they do is translate it to English,  the old fashioned way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Larry asked me how I felt,  and I think that is when I started to cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Larry asked me how I felt,  and that's when I started to cry.  Then they did a base,  this is the baseline cascade translation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wondered how I felt,  and I think that's when I started to cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  But wait, we can do better.  What if we did a translatotron translation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Larry asked me how I felt,  and then I think that's when I started crying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  But better yet, let's add the original speaker's voice,  and this is the cadence matching  that they do now with John Legend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Larry asked me how I felt,  and I think that's when I started to cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's the Spanish.  Larry me pregunto, como me sentia?  Y creo que es cuando empecé a llorar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Here's the translator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Larry asked me how I felt,  and I think that's when I started to cry.  He sounds kind of like he's got it stuffed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They're getting there though.  I mean, you know, it's not a bad attempt at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're getting there if you're like,  well, that guy's a guy,  and the translation voice is a guy.  That doesn't sound like him at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, here, let's try another one.  This is the original Spanish source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Por lo tanto, mirar alrededor del país lo que ves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  And here is the source voice after translation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, look around the country,  and what you see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Long pause.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So, look around the country and what you see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Okay, this doesn't sound that bad.  Good, actually, I take it all back.  Forget the translatotron.  Work in progress.  It's a work that's coming along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a baby.  The ideas, I guess.  I don't know.  I feel like that could be the beginning  of more hoaxes and misunderstandings,  but that's just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Oh, get ready.  That's just the way the world is.  I mean, you know, it's-  Yeah.  I played the fake Joe Rogan last week, didn't I?  I don't know.  I hate Joe Rogan.  Do not, I don't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's your pick for the end of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Okay.  Oh, I did it on Twitter.  Is that when I did it?  You did it on Twitter.  Okay.  But now I know Stacey hates it,  so I'll get a different pick.  Here's some good news for those of you  who spent $1,500 on Google Glass 1.  Google Glass 2 is out,  and it's only, what was it, $9.99?  It's a lot cheaper.  It's 33% less.  It's a lot cheaper.  Google Enterprise Edition 2, faster, more helpful,  and only half as geeky looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Kevin spent the $1,500, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  So did I, but I didn't even get the glasses.  Jason Howell has them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I got custom lenses for them in my head.  Oh, you got the, ooh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  So you can wear them instead of your-  The eyeglasses, because I can't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I have progressive bifocals, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.  Yeah.  So, do you still wear them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  All the time, you know.  I'm a chick magnet with those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi.  Do you mind if I record this conversation?  Hi.  I see you're on LinkedIn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, that would not go over well.  Wait, oh, you're gonna, let me buy you a drink.  Your favorite is on Facebook.  Oh, I see, a martini, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is this?  You like the wrong kind.  No, I don't wear them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, anyway, they're back faster and more helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Really, for enterprise.  I mean, this is like AR for,  like the HoloLens, for example.  This is not consumary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Now, apparently, I missed the boat,  because I got John Legend on my Google Home Hub,  but the Nest Hub, when it comes out,  oh, it's gonna have character alarms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if you pay for that.  I wonder if that's like a licensing deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, if you got the Teenage Minge and Newton Dirtles.  Somebody's playing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  T-M-N-T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Tim and Ed, if you got Leonardo in your alarm,  also you could choose from Lego and Hatchimals.  So it sounds like it's really aimed at kids.  Here, let's watch.  Cowabunga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That would wake me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  That is annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hey Google, stop.  Yeah, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Never play this again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  So it's for an eight-year-old.  Okay. Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah. That's nice.  I mean, for kids, I could see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  We middle-aged ladies have John Legend,  they've got Ninja Mutant Turtles.  And Legos. And Legos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, Legos don't talk.  How are they an alarm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Oh, you've clearly not seen the Lego movie.  Oh, the Lego movie.  Okay. Yeah. I have actually.  Everything is awesome, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything is awesome.  Okay. I'm not going to sing the rest of the song.  I wish you would. But I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Then after that, I want you to do the,  let it go from Frozen. Okay?  Go. Excellent. Yes.  Yes. I think you know that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I do. All of the words.  All the words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I get to work with her every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin never sings along. It's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  So I think Rhett Conner Charham has it right on.  They need adult ones like John Belushi from Animal House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Food fight!

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  That'd be a great way to wake up.  A little caddy shack.  So I got that going for me.  The hangover.  Bridesmaids.  I know what scene from Bridesmaids I'd like to wake me up.  And office space. That'd be good.  That'd be good. Good choices.  Excellent choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would like a little Tiffany Haddish from Girls Trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  It's good enough. I know what Kevin wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey Kevin, it's time to wake up.  Wake up man. Peace and love.  Peace and love. Peace and love.  Wake up man.  We've got a record to record.  That would be cool. Wouldn't it?  Absolutely.  Hello Kevin Taufele.  Hello.  This is Paul McCartney saying, wake up buddy.  Come on mate.  Come on mate, wake up.  What a prelly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Wide color photos are coming to Android.  Wide color is not exactly HDR.  It's a color profile, not sRGB.  It's something better like P3, Adobe RGB.  So sRGB is kind of the lingua franca,  the lowest common denominator.  A lot of cameras, everything does sRGB.  But you can see the difference if you look at sRGB  versus P3, which is used, I think it's a lot used  in the motion picture and television industry.  And that's a much wider gamut.  Or here for instance, display P3.  I like the umbrellas.  Huh? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the umbrella photos.  Yeah. Oh, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  And you see how rich those colors are compared to sRGB.  Oh yeah, very saturated.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So you needed a display that can show them  on your phone to really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  A lot of phones now can do P3.  That seems to be the standard.  So you can see, obviously, you'd have to have some  P3 screen to test it.  And they have a little wide color gamut test.  So for those of you watching at home,  if you see a little Android guy, you're P3.  If you don't see anything, which is what I see right now,  just a red blob, right?  Or do you see an Android guy?  I see the Android guy.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I see the Android,  well, I see the Android guy on your screen.  Yeah.  I see it on my Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Your Chromebook must be. What's happening?  Wide gamut, yeah.  It is.  What should you do to prepare?  Gather as much water as you can.  I don't know.  I don't know anything more about this.  I'm going to go to the next story.  Thank you very much, everybody.  Enjoy your veal.  Google Duo has increased the group call capacity.  Now remember, they're playing catch up to Apple,  which allows you to have 32 people in your FaceTime.  Google now has eight.  I think that's enough.  Eight is enough.  That sounds familiar.  Eight is enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't even know eight people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  You know what?  I will say this has kind of frustrated me  a little bit about Duo,  but if I have a source, which I have lots of them,  I now see when they're on Duo.  So I get these like, CEO of major company has joined Duo.  I'm like, that they don't really want to be,  Oh good, let me call them.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Now here's the problem though.  Duo, two.  Do we rename it Ocho?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  Octo?  Please, Ocho.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ocho.  Los Ocho.  It should be Octo technically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Octo, cause Duo is Latin, it'd be Octo.  But Ocho, I like a little better.  My son would totally say this.  El Ocho.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  El Ocho.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't even know if I have eight people on Duo.  Let's see how many Duo contacts I have now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  But now, so when that new Nest Hub comes,  that supports Duo.  I guess your Home Hub does too,  but you don't have a camera, so it's stupid.  But with the camera, or your Lenovo, or your JBL, right?  You can use Duo.  I use it on the Lenovo.  I'm thinking, when the Nest comes out,  I'm sending one to my mom,  cause I think right now we FaceTime,  but I think it'd be a much easier way for her to communicate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I love communicating via the Echo Show, sorry.  Do you?  It's really handy when I'm out of town  to connect with my family.  The kids love it, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  It's like mom's really there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I had a Google Home Hub,  my son would use it constantly.  He'd call you all the time.  He wouldn't call me, he would just call his friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, that's who El Ocho is for,  because that's what happens.  They get home from school, they get their group together,  and they're all on the Ocho.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are.  Well, yeah, my daughter hangs out  with her friends on Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's going away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  That's good to know that that's still around.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, she's sad about that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, she can use El Ocho.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think, and you know what?  I tried to actually call my Google Home using Duo,  but I couldn't call my home.  Like I can call my Echo show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  You can't call a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  No, and I couldn't call my home hub.  Oh.  What I wanted to do, because it's sitting there  and I'm on my phone, and I couldn't find  on Duo my home hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You can't specify the device.  That's a thing.  You call a person, not a device.  Right, but my person is me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I was on the phone trying to call me on my home,  if that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No, that doesn't actually.  Why would you call yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the point.  Like on Duo, if I wanted to call my...  If you wanted to talk to your kids.  If I want to talk to my kid at home  on the Google Home device, I didn't have a way to call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I gotcha.  Yeah.  Maybe through voice match.  I don't know because I'm the only one who uses  all these Google Home things in the house.  And my son's the only other one on the other end  of the line.  So, and he uses his phone.  I don't know.  If you don't have a camera on your smart display,  you can still use Duo.  It's an audio only call, by the way.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  So there's this kid, Michael Saman.  He was a teenager, 14 years old, I think.  When he created a bunch of apps,  got Mark Zuckerberg's attention,  Mark brought him onto the stage at F8,  and hired him as the teenage intern at Facebook.  Teenage in residence.  Teenager in residence.  Oh man.  He created-  Is that a white guy?  Of course he's, well, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm just asking.  There he is.  Yeah, he's a white guy.  What did you want?  He's a clean cut white guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't care.  I want anyone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Anybody but white guys.  Okay, Kevin, let's leave.  So he created a whole bunch of apps,  including one called Life Stage.  This was a Facebook app.  It turned bios into video profiles.  So it was an iOS app for people 21 and under.  Facebook launched it three years ago, then killed it.  Saman left and went to Google,  where he is now, I don't know what, an adult in residence.  And he has created, by the way,  he did not, his parents are from Peru and Bolivia,  raised him in Miami.  He taught himself to code with online tutorials  at the age of 13.  His first app was a $1 app with tips  from the Club Penguin game,  and he earned him thousands of dollars,  which kept his family afloat during the recession.  So it's actually a nice story.  He might be white looking,  but he comes from the streets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, well, that's good.  I'm like coming from a disadvantaged background,  always nice, given different perspectives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  The recession, their house was foreclosed on.  He kept him afloat.  His big break came when he overheard his sister  on the phone sending photos to a friend  and tried to make her guess what word they represented  that inspired him to build four snaps of Photo Charades app.  It was number one on the word games chart  with a few million users,  then Facebook found out about him  and replaced him with a bot.  He left Facebook, went to Google,  and his new game is Charades.  Once again, he's back to his roots with Emoji Shot.  Emoji Charades with friends.  So instead of sending pictures, you send emojis,  and then by doing so, you can then play the game.  And what am I trying to say?  It's like a rebus, I guess.  That's what we used to call it when I was a kid.  Clever.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Nice story.  Just telling you.  It's iOS game though, unfortunately,  so it really shouldn't be on this change log at all.  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are we still on the change log?  He's at Google though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  So he's at Google, but he's making it for iOS.  There's a link.  There's the link.  Google Assistant now works with the Wyze Cam.  We all love the W-Y-Z-E Wyze Cams.  And some guy named Kevin C. Toffle tweeted this video  of Norm.  Show me the driveway.  Show me the driveway.  And here it is.  Streaming the driveway on our driveway.  And this is your Wyze Cam.  It is my Wyze Cam.  Awesome.  And that's his driveway.  That's my driveway.  That's my vault.  It's a lovely neighborhood.  So that's the only drawback.  They don't have a outdoor camera yet.  So you have to put it inside through the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, I put it through the window.  I had a Nest Cam there,  but I didn't want to pay a subscription fee.  So I bought a $20 Wyze Cam and use an SD card.  And now it works with Google Assistant.  I will say in the time I've tried it since then,  it's hit or miss on the connectivity.  There's a lot of latency sometimes,  and other times it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I've had that problems with Nest cameras on Google as well.  I think it's just an issue  with Wi-Fi connected cameras mostly.  But I have to say, now that I have John Legend in my home  and my bed, I am going to replace my ring doorbell  with a hello.  I'm going to replace my Amazon stuff with Google Home Hub.  I think I've decided to...  I'm not going to kick Amazon out  because I still buy stuff, I guess, that way.  So I might keep that.  But I think, for instance, on the Sonos,  you have to choose, right?  I think I'm choosing the Assistant.  I really think Google Assistant is the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I did the same already.  And Stacey and I, it's like we cover everything with IoT.  So it's kind of hard to go and kick everything out.  But literally I just have like one test Amazon device  because I'm all Google.  Okay, so you-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he does that because he doesn't want to do the reviews  that I ask him to do.  He's like, oh, I don't have that device anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  So I also am a big audible listener  and there's no audible on...  It's only on Echo, it's not on Assistant.  So that might be another issue.  On the other hand, Sonos has audible support.  So maybe that'll solve that  because they do have Sonos's everywhere.  Yep.  Google Calendar and Keep.  I know you love the dark mode.  There you go, Google Calendar and Keep.  Dark mode all the time.  Dark mode all the things.  If you go to Android Q, dark mode is in Android Q now  and I guess they're gonna just make all the Google apps  in dark mode, I guess.  Yeah.  I do like that.  The brightness hurts, it burns, it burns the eyes.  If I wanted bright things, I'd go outside.  And that's the Google Change Log.  Yes, Ms. Higginbotham, you spoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was gonna ask for our things.  I'm not doing as well as I thought I was doing.  So I'm like sitting here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Let me do a quick ad and then we'll do the things.  Can you stand it?  I can, I just was like, oh.  Because he adds the thing you know and love.  It's Grammarly.  Who doesn't love Grammarly?  Use it.  It's funny because I, for a long time,  I was a grammar snob.  I said, my grammar's perfect.  I also was a spelling snob, my spelling's perfect.  And then I started using Grammarly,  I realized, A, my grammar is not perfect,  nor any more than my spelling is.  B, Grammarly is more than just spelling and grammar.  Grammarly is all about communicating more effectively.  So for instance, knowing the reading level  of what I've written is very useful.  And what I've found is a lot of the people I know  who write for a living like you and Stacey  love Grammarly.  Paul Therotte loves Grammarly.  You can use it on almost everywhere.  It's available as a plugin for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.  It's got an iOS keyboard, Android, Windows, Macintosh.  Yes, there's Grammarly free that does spelling  and basic grammar, but you're gonna want Grammarly premium  because you get spelling, grammar,  plus advanced punctuation, structure.  That's a hard thing to do, right?  It does it right, style within context.  So for instance, if you're writing a business proposal,  the style would be different than an academic essay,  than a blog post or a social media post.  And so it understands that.  Vocabulary suggestions, always welcome.  Conciseness, readability for different occasions.  And occasionally I'll write something,  an email that's maybe a little too brusque  and Grammarly will actually say,  you wanna soften that up and make that a little nicer?  And you can ignore it, but it's always,  it's like having a good friend over your shoulder  with some suggestions.  Accomplish your goals with help from Grammarly.  Stop making email typos, close more deals  that work with your emails,  polish your resume to get that new job.  Grammarly can help you with it all.  And no more ungrammatical tweets, please.  They're offensive to the eye and spirit.  Go to g-r-a-m-m-a-r-l-y.com slash twig.  Get 20% off your Grammarly premium account  if you do that right now.  Grammarly.com slash twig.  We appreciate you're using that URL  because that tells them you saw it on Twig.  And we definitely appreciate Grammarly  for making my writing better and supporting our show.  Pick of the week, Stacey Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, okay.  I promised I would show you this.  Two things.  One, Wyze, who we just talked about today,  actually it was last night,  they sent out an email to all their users and they said,  hey, we've got cheap light bulbs.  Oh.  You can have tunable white lights for four pack for 30 bucks.  Which is crazy cheap.  Oh, nobody said cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there are other things that are that cheap.  I think Kevin, your three light bulbs are that cheap.  But they are cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The cranes are a little,  Leah, they're a little more expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Now white is cheap because white, you know,  but honestly a smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But tunable, tunable though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tunable's pretty good, yeah.  Oh, they are.  Tunable's not.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  These are nice.  These are nice, yeah.  So in honor of this announcement  because you can pre-order them,  right now you have to go through the app  as part of their beta shopping program.  I love that they call it beta shopping.  I'm like, dude.  Anyway, but I decided I'd show you guys the sensors,  which I couldn't show you the other day  because I was under embargo.  Oh.  So here's my Wyze Sense box.  I want you to notice how freaking tiny this is.  This is my Wyze camera.  Yes.  This has four or three sensors and a bridge.  Okay.  Wow.  This is the motion sensor.  Seriously, you guys, these are like an inch.  That's ridiculous.  My other motion sensors are like this.  And.  Do you have the bridge there?  Do you have the bridge?  I do.  Here's the bridge.  So this right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Oh my God, it's just a little plug-in.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There it is.  Ta-da.  So I wanted to share that with you.  This package, if you have the Wyze camera,  well, you need to have the Wyze camera.  That's either $20 or $30 if you want the Pan cam.  This package right here with the two open,  closed and one motion sensor, that is $19.99.  Super cheap.  It does run on its own proprietary radio.  So, oh, and that the package also contains the bridge.  So what you're going to have is a sub gigahertz radio  that doesn't talk to anything else,  but does a bang up job for very little money  talking to its own little ecosystem.  So that's the Wyze gear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Nice.  See, this is, they're smart  because everything's very inexpensive,  but there's so many things now you can buy  that I feel like I'm going to spend  hundreds of dollars on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and they're profitable.  They are for Amazonians started this, Amazon people.  Amazon people.  Because they're up in Seattle, that makes sense, yeah.  And they,  their idea was to become profit  or to build very cheap stuff and sell a heck of a lot of it  is their whole business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  But I, you know, it wasn't just growth for growth sake.  They did want to be a profitable enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, yes.  They're not venture backed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Nice.  Really?  They're doing this all on their own?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were for a while.  I don't know if they've raised money since, but yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I'm shopping right now.  I'm going to buy bulbs.  Oh, better hurry.  32% sold already.  Oh, it was 16% last night.  How many can I buy?  I can buy three.  Three, four packs, that's 12.  Yeah, that's 12.  That's a lot of bulbs.  At that price, I'm buying, yeah, 12 bulbs though.  I mean, I don't have to ever buy bulbs again, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know what my thing should have been?  What?  I don't have it physically.  I'll have it physically next week.  The Lutron Aurora.  Next week, I'll show it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Next week or the week after.  And maybe I won't get the pan this time.  I'll just get a couple of the regulars.  Cause I think I don't use the pan that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What do you think?  I don't have the pan,  so I just go with the straight moist camp.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I had a couple of the pans.  Okay.  I bought three cause they were so cheap.  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Kevin Toffle from all about,  if you want to go Stacey, go ahead.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Thank you dear.  Nope.  All about Stacey.  It's all about Stacey.  Stacey on iot.com.  She's gone.  Stacey on iot.com and the podcast you do with Kevin Toffle.  Yeah.  IOT podcast.  Must listen.  Subscribe to the newsletter too.  Thank you Stacey.  Yeah.  And you sir, Kevin Toffle,  what do you have to show for yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So I get this question all the time.  What Chromebook should I buy?  And the first thing I do is say,  well, what are you going to do?  How much do you want to spend?  Are you like a low end Chromebook user or high end?  And no matter what,  I almost always get the universal answer of,  well, I don't want to cheap out,  but I don't want to spend too much.  I don't want to use basic stuff.  I don't need Linux.  So it's always like,  you just need a mid range Chromebook  and you don't want to spend 600 bucks.  Okay.  This is the first time I can remember  that both the HP Chromebook X360 14,  which is a mouthful,  and the Dell Inspiron Chromebook 14  are the exact same price  because they're both discounted 100 to $130  at Best Buy this week.  So what I did was I put a little chart together  showing you what the very few differences are  so you can decide if you've got 450 bucks,  which of these two you want.  There aren't too many differences.  If you want more memory,  which I always recommend,  you can't go wrong with adding more memory,  you go with the X360.  But if you want more storage and you want a pen,  you go with the Dell.  Same processor, same graphics chip, same displays,  backlit keyboards, everything else is mostly the same.  Maybe get a little better battery life out of the HP.  It's a little lighter, little smaller,  but for 450 bucks,  you can get yourself a nice Chromebook right now,  your choice.  I have links to Best Buy, they are not affiliate links,  so I'm not making any money off this, it's not promotional.  This is just, if you want mid-range,  you cannot go wrong with either one.  Pick which column is better for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Great choice, I agree.  100%, now that Stacey's gone, let's do a little Rogan.  Do you hate Joe Rogan yourself?  I'm ambivalent.  I am too.  My son loves him.  Of course, he's a very famous podcaster,  MMA guy, commentator, comic,  and a company called Dessa, which does AI voices,  built a model to replicate Joe's voice  to show AI techniques,  and they've got a little game at fakejorogan.com.  Probably they did that because they hoped Joe would mention  it on his podcast, it's my guess.  So I'm gonna play a sample,  pick a sample from one to eight  and see if you can play the game here.  One to eight, Kevin.  Oh, how about six?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You are much less likely to injure yourself  if you do it correctly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I do not think that is Joe Rogan.  You think that's faux Rogan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I think it's Joe Rogan. I do.  Nope, it's real Joe.  Carson wanted to weigh in.  Isn't that amazing?  All right, no, actually, that's not amazing yet,  because it was the real Joe.  Pick another number.  Three. Three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, it's goofy. The world's goofy.  There's a lot of goofy shit out there,  but just go with it.  That's real.  That's gotta be real, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I don't think so.  You say faux Rogan.  You would be correct, my friend.  Fooled both me and Carson.  Okay, we're telling you. That was faux.  Pick another number.  Carson can pick. Carson can pick.  Carson picked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Four. Four.  obscene walks.  But actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  when they took Colby ச grants with the  same sticker,  they felt almost as if it was some sort of

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  fake Joe Rogan sometimes.  There's a lot of goofy shit out there,  but just go with it.  That sounds like AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  It's a good fake.  It's a good fake.  Better than translatotron.  I thought for now,  but you know,  he's speaking English.  Yeah.  Impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And that's him as the Google assistant voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I do not want Joe Rogan waking me up.  That just sounds painful.  Do you want to play your video?  Karsten?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I have a thing this week.  I have a video that a viewer sent in.  Yes.  One of our,  one of our,  you know,

Transcript:  Julian Assange is arrest.  Can you defend him as a journalist?  Is it free speech?  The bad news for Facebook just keeps on coming and how  he's looking out the window.  Help.  Say what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  He's got range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hate it.  Don't play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  His,  uh,  his Rufus is,  uh,  Rufus is a pet claims that he loves the show,  but doesn't sound like it does.  I'm glad cause Rufus was in studio and we couldn't,  we couldn't quite get the howling right.  But,  uh,  clearly that's,  that's to prove it.  That was impressive.  Very impressive.  Thank you,  Kevin.  Great to have you about Chromebooks.com everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's all about Chromebooks.  I don't know what else to say.
