Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google. Two big stories this week.  Jeff, Gina, Kevin, Marks will join us to talk about the passing of Aaron Schwartz and his legacy.  Mighty that it is. We'll also talk about the new Google social graph search.  Might even explain what that means. It's all coming up next on Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google.  The show and I gotta caution you because this show is not going to be much about Google.  The show that covers the cloud, the internet, media, society, larger issues as well as just what's new with Google.  Let's introduce the panel for today. As always, the wonderful Gina Tripani from SmarterWear.org and Think Up.  Great to have you, Gina. She's in Brooklyn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great to be here. I'm in Manhattan at the moment. I'm generously being hosted by 20x200, which is subleasing a space in the Foursquare office.  That's a nice office. I've seen that. Beautiful office.  It's really, really nice. And there's something very satisfying about being able to check in at Foursquare on Foursquare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just very meta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is also offsite. Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com. Hi, Jeff. You're in Rhode Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm in Rhode Island at Bryant University. I gave a talk to the Helen Library Consortium today following Dave Weinberger, or David Weinberger, very hard.  David, not Dave. And the great thing is, you know, you go anywhere in this country, in this world.  I go downstairs. Two people come up to me. They're Twit fans. They're Twig fans. Dave Gannon here at Bryant happens to be, he teaches technology and he also did tech support.  So he answered my questions about the network. This is the wonder of Leo Laporte and Twit. Your network is everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yay. Well, I grew up down the road from them, so I know the area pretty well.  That's great. Good to have you. And thanks to the folks at Bryant University for letting you use their facilities.  And from his garden, where he always appears, like a garden gnome, Kevin Marks.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hi there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tummelvision.tv and Salesforce.com. Hello, Kevin.  Kevin asked to be on today because he knew we would be talking and they're really, they're really only a couple of big stories today.  One, of course, the Aaron Swartz story, but the other, the Facebook social graph story.  And in both of these, I think Kevin Marks will certainly have a lot to say.  I'll try and join in.  Yeah. They're kind of right, right in your wheelhouse, as we Americans are wont to say.  But before we do that, I think it'd be a good time to play the trumpets and announce the changelog.  Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google changelog time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Those of you into the oogle, by the way, I might mention Google has a good search front page today with the.  Oh yeah, the Google Doodle is exciting today.  Yeah. Should we just show this before we get into the changelog?  Yeah.  It's got a little Zamboni machine.  And if you press play, you get to play the Zamboni game or something.  What am I doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That tells you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love games where there's no text.  OK, got it. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Ikea of games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, you're supposed to clean up the mess with a Zamboni.  See somebody's some of those damn skaters.  They make a heck of a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get off my ice.  Get off of my ice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is this to commemorate, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mr. Zamboni would be very old if you were alive today at his birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whoa. Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is this? I'm looking for the mouse over.  What is this to commemorate?  I'm honestly not sure, but I think I could have a career in Zamboni running.  It is Zamboni's birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's even got an 8-bit sound.  I beat you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, Chad's going to play now.  Good luck, Chad.  Sorry, I'm not getting your audio from your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know, I know, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you have to do yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Frank Zamboni, I'm sure it's Francis Xavier, but Frank Zamboni would be 112 years old today.  Holy cow.  Which makes me amazed, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Zamboni Machine, for those who don't know, is used on skating rinks.  I remember going to ice hockey games at Brown University just down the road from you there, Jeff Jarvis.  And it's an amazing contraption that involves levers, steam.  It comes out, it runs over the ice and makes it fresh and new again, melting and refreezing it as...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem with the game ones is that you can't...  Normally you can click on the doodle and get search results for the thing that it represents,  but with this you click on it and just the game starts and it's hard to tell.  We don't know.  Yeah, it was kind of like that the doodle is sort of educational.  You're like, oh, today is this crazy holiday I've never heard of.  But with this one it's hard to tell what it is.  And you're just like, oh, it's a Zamboni.  Exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You got a certain amount of gas.  That's kind of... I don't know, it's just crazy.  I think they've realized these are a big selling point.  And the only reason the Zamboni is popular is because it's got a great name.  Yeah.  Because it is kind of a contraption.  It's a cool machine.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But when it went to the US Open and it rains, they've got the dry...  They got the hot weather version of it, which shows and vacuums up all the water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Frank Zamboni and the ice resurfacing machine.  Eight years of...  It's every Minnesota kid's hero.  He's an Italian American from Minnesota, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he's a Paisan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  He's a Paisan.  That's cool.  What else is new at Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We got a couple of new things this week.  Google added high res photo zoom to Google+.  I mean, more and more it feels like Google plus is really becoming a photo sharing network.  So if you go to a Google plus post that has a high res image in it, you click on the high res image,  you get the regular kind of light box, but then you can use your mouse wheel,  a scroll in, you can zoom in pan on an image.  So I think I dropped a link to an example post there that has a high res image in the dock.  And yeah, click on one of those images and you'll see.  You can zoom in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.  So are these like gigapan style images or?  Yeah, if you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So on my Mac, I have to sort of do the two finger scroll on my trackpad to get it to work.  Let's see.  It's...  Or you can click.  Should I do it, Chad?  Yeah.  All right.  Sorry.  I was watching a video about this.  Sorry, I should have prepped you for this demo.  Wait. Oh, I just got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just got it.  There it goes.  Here we go.  What's weird is on my Mac, it looks like I'm scrolling to the left and to the right,  which is problematic because that's how you go forward and backwards.  Yeah.  That's pretty neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pan and zoom.  So that box shows up in the top left and you can really see detail on high resolution images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is there a checkbox you have to do or did it just automatically...  It just did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just the trackpad.  You have to kind of drag and zoom on your trackpad.  Maybe I can come over here.  I'm trying to see if you have a mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There we go.  There's the thingy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  The thingy.  I had trouble getting a thingy to... initiating a thingy at first, but once you start to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it...  You can't stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it when you talk technical, Gina.  Yeah, I know.  I'm getting very technical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  These are the technical terms.  Yeah, two fingers on a Mac trackpad works great.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or you could use your mouse scroll wheel.  That's probably what you're supposed to do.  Yeah.  Yep.  Yep.  So what else?  Oh, Chrome Beta for Android has been released.  Yay.  Love it.  So this is actually difficult to find in the Play Store.  If you search Chrome in the Play Store, it won't show up.  But if you search for Chrome Beta for Android in Google itself, you'll get the Play Store  link.  It's just a few versions ahead.  It's basically the equivalent of subscribing to the beta channel in Chrome on your desktop,  which I do anyway.  It's a little unstable.  A few more bug fixes.  You kind of get to test the new stuff before it comes out in the stable release.  Does it auto update?  It does auto update.  It does auto update.  So it will always be a few versions ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  And I've actually switched to the Chrome Beta as my default browser on my Galaxy Nexus.  And I haven't had any problems.  I had one problem with ThinkUp, which is the site that I build.  Now, I have her reports all about the Android community that it is crashing some devices.  But the nice thing is you can have both the stable Chrome and the beta installed on your  phone and switch between them.  The beta has this little kind of sash that says beta across the icon.  So you can test it out if you want.  And also on the desktop, there's a new stable release of Chrome.  Not too many big new features, just mostly stability and performance improvements.  And the Chrome 25 beta is also now available.  And it's in the Web to Speech API, which is the thing that lets you talk to your browser  and give it voice commands.  That's now available.  So that's kind of exciting.  On Android 2 or just on the desktop?  No, this is on the desktop.  This is Chrome 25 beta on the desktop.  OK.  My other favorite Android app, although I have lots of favorite Android apps, but Google  Now gets boarding passes.  So this is really cool.  If you've booked a flight and in your Gmail you have the confirmation number on a flight  and then you arrive at an airport, I'm actually really excited to try this because I've got  a JetBlue flight back to San Diego.  And when I show up at JFK, in theory, if it's all working, Google Now is going to pop up  a card that says, hey, here's your boarding pass and gives me my barcode to scan at the  gate.  What's a little weird about this is Google has announced that this feature is shipping,  and they said that it works with select airlines, but they haven't said what airlines it works  with.  So it's kind of a crapshoot at this point.  But I'm excited about that.  In fact, I think we talked about this a few shows ago.  If you have, if you've booked flights and the confirmation is in your Gmail, if you  search on Google.com for the phrase, my flights, the one box comes up and says, hey, your  flight's on time.  Here's when it leaves.  Here's when it arrives.  That totally works for me now.  Like my upcoming flight is showing up there.  So this is just the Google Now card is sort of an extension of that.  And finally, in Gmail, signature tweaks, which was a labs feature that let you put your  signature above the quoted text and, but, and, and erase the little, the two dashes  that show up by default that used to be Gmail labs.  It's graduated.  It's now in just general settings.  Right.  So it lets you, lets you customize your signature a little bit more.  So if you go to in your Gmail account, if you go to settings, general, you'll see the  ability to put your signature up above the quoted text and without those two dashes.  So signature tweaks graduates.  Congratulations from labs.  That's all I got.  And that's the Google change.  Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh boy.  So let's, let's start with Aaron Schwartz because it's almost, it's not quite old news,  but it's almost old news now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As, as many know, Aaron, 26 years old, a young man who really had made a huge difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and was unique in a number of respects.  One of which he was apparently a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,  very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,  he was apparently a, a technology genius who instead of trying to make a billion dollars  in betting the next YouTube devoted his time to the public wheel.  And in fact did quite a bit of good.  Kevin, I gather you, he, he, we should mention he, he passed away on Friday, killed himself  on Friday.  Karen, I, Kevin, I gather you knew him fairly well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I met him, first met him back in 2002 when he was 15 or so.  Wow.  And he was working on web standards and, you know, we, and I think he was one of the first  people who sort of appeared out of the net and, and, and said hi.  Because we were, we were chatting online in various web standards groups, RSS and, and  the, from the web staff.  And he mentioned he was visiting California and could he come and visit me?  And I was at Apple at the time and said, sure, come for lunch.  And I was, you know, I was surprised when this, this young kid turned up.  You know, he was, he was, you know, he was, he was always fairly small when he was younger.  He got a bit bigger later on, but he was like, oh, but it was, you know, but he's, he was  always very, very sharp and brilliant.  And it was one of those, one of those experiences of, that we had in the early days of blogging  where we felt like we were a small community anyway.  And we were all, you know, talking about the web and standards.  And Aaron was making significant contributions to that.  And he was, he'd, he'd moved to being homeschooled or unschooled rather than going to high school.  And so was therefore working on stuff at home, which meant the net was his connection to the rest of the world.  And he took advantage of that.  He rewrote a very good piece, well, several good pieces, one on how to get the job I have, where he talked  about his history of that and where he said that the main thing is curiosity.  And he spent all his time reading everything he could.  And what he felt that not going to high school meant that he didn't have the curiosity knocked out of him being forced to do things he didn't want to.  And so he was able to focus on the, on the things that's inspired him and keep working on them.  And he, and he did lots of really, you know, really useful stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of his, one of his early credits was working on RSS.  What, what did he do for the spec?  Here's a picture, by the way, while you're talking, I'm showing a picture of him talking to Larry Lessig.  And this is roughly around 14 years old.  That's about when he, yeah, that was about the time when he...  And the amazing thing is here you see a Stanford Law professor, not merely patronizing or indulging a kid, but really talking to him.  And in fact, this, these conversations led to Creative Commons, which Aaron wrote the first iteration of, a 14-year-old for a Constitution,  an acknowledged constitutional scholar, one of the foremost constitutional scholars in the United States.  So he obviously must have had some obvious brilliance at that age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was a genius.  Yeah, he was a genius.  He was a genius.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You knew him too, Gina, did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did, I did. I met him a couple of times at food camp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think I met him, I think I played werewolf with him and now I've forgotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, I followed his work for so long that I, when I met him at food camp, I was actually at a table sitting next to him and I was too starstruck to, to talk, to engage, like to start a conversation.  Like I kind of stared at him a little bit and that was it.  And now I really regret it.  But anyway, he would have never said that he's a genius.  He had a humility about it.  He said, oh, well, you know, it's really just curiosity.  But the reality is he was a genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So tell us about the RSS contribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, he was, I don't want to get into the history of RSS too much, but he was, he was very much involved with the RDF worldview, which was Tim Berners-Lee model, model of the web,  or the future of the web, which is all about connecting things with links.  But basically things are sort of three part verb, three part sentence and the middle.  So you've got a subject predicate and another object.  And each of those things are URLs and it's just a very abstract way of specifying the web.  And it's one of those things that in some ways is over over abstracted.  I think, you know, we've sort of realized that it's actually quite hard to express stuff in that form and keep it consistent.  And things have changed, but it was around 2000.  It was it was very exciting.  And Aaron leaped on this and helped build the iteration of RSS that was based on RDF, which was RSS 1.0.  And then there was a whole bunch of back and forth and with Dave Weiner and others.  And there was a non RDF version of RSS.  RSS 2 became the mainline one.  And then Aaron, as a as a as a prank, almost invented RSS 3, which was one without any XML in it at all.  And it was just plain text.  And so there was he was even when he was playing jokes like that, he actually wrote a very coherent spec that was actually useful and possible.  If you look at RSS 3, you read it and go, oh, yeah, that's almost Jason.  But it was him just sort of playing with the idea of, oh, you think you think that's too you think RDF is too complicated.  Well, XML is too complicated. Here's this thing.  Right. So he was he was like a lot of brilliant people.  He was always sort of dancing around.  How do I explain this to you? But he wasn't nasty about it.  I mean, he could he could probe at you and sort of show you up by by being smart, but he didn't tend to be nasty about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's a great picture of Aaron with Doug Engelbart on the right, the man who invented the computer mouse and on the left, Ted Nelson, who was one of the early proponents of hypertext.  What a look. What a kid. Isn't it amazing?  It's an amazing picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know, and sometimes we want to focus on everyone said he did all these amazing things when he was 15.  It's true, but he carried on doing amazing things.  He went on. He went to Stanford for a year and then dropped out because he decided he wasn't learning enough.  It wasn't intellectual enough.  And then he went in the very first Y Combinator class because Paul Graham rang about and said, I'm doing this thing.  I think you'd enjoy it.  And he built Infagami there, which was a again a sort of public public as web thing.  But then worked with the guys who'd founded Reddit and basically helped them pull it from lifts to Python so it would actually scale on the web.  And then went work with them for the first two years or so of Reddit until they got bought out by.  Yes. And that moved him to they made move to San Francisco and put them in the wide offices.  And he didn't like that very much and eventually sort of flaked out of that and moved away again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kevin Paulson tells a story of when Aaron arrived at the wired offices, newly rich from the acquisition of Reddit and said, I would like to I would like if you wouldn't mind to write an article about an ongoing trial of the Y Combinator.  An ongoing trial about a fairly abstruse topic intellectual property law.  And and Kevin says he wrote a brilliant article.  You know, he was a great he was a great writer.  He's obviously an amazingly talented person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that was the thing. He he he was always interested in the politics and sociology of the web as well.  And he'd you know, part of that was working with with with Lessig and co created Commons to to construct that.  He also got very into reading Noam Chomsky and the theory of the sociology of power and all that stuff.  And so after he he done read it, he founded a lot of political action groups.  He was extremely demand progress was one, of course, that demand progress was the one that he originally built to stop Koika, which is the preceptor sopa, but became a general activism tool and absolutely instrumental in stopping sopa and pipa.  There's there's there's a really good speech of him at if you search for Aaron Schwartz sopa on YouTube, you'll find it which is him spitting to freedom to connect, I think about 20 minutes long, which I recommend everyone to watch because it's it's him summarizing this.  What happened with the history of the sopa revolt and it's it's a wonderful piece of speech making.  And it will give you a feel for them because we've seen all these photos of him as 14 years old.  And it gives you this was last autumn and he gave you a feel for the guy he grew up into and the stuff he was trying to do.  And then, you know, and he spent a lot of time working on how do we create open public resources.  So he built the he wrote the specs for and built the first iteration of the open library thing that they have at the Internet Archive, which is an index of all the books that exist and designed to derive from existing ICP databases and things like that.  So that there's a there's a effectively universal card in it for books that isn't just Amazon numbers.  And that's been hooked up now to the scans that the Internet Archive is doing so that they're trying to collate all books that have been published to in a way that is actually a public resource in parallel with the stuff that Amazon and Google have done with which the publishers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He obviously embraced one of the fundamental hacker tenants that information wants to be free.  He said information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it to themselves.  And he really worked very actively to get these silos of information that should be public released.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There there's Leo, I think that's that's the key to the you know, I unfortunately don't I don't think I met him.  I would maybe have been at the same conference at some point quite possibly.  But but but I learned a lot from him and in what he did with JSTOR.  And of course, that's what led to all of his legal troubles was that he downloaded millions of articles from an MIT closet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was it the first time he'd done it? In fact, it's important to note that he got first got in trouble with the FBI for something that wasn't a crime.  There's there's a database of of court precedents of court decisions called the government was charging for the government was charging a dollar or a dollar.  Even though it is it is it is absolutely public domain material, it's court decisions.  He used I said much of the money that he made from Reddit to buy pacer documents and put them into an open database called recap, which is not illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But all the I still, you know, harassed him and went after him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's and it's sad that that really was the beginning of this antipathy between him and the feds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then he downloaded the stuff from JSTOR, which academic articles in the and you know, I won't recount that whole thing, but that led to a harassment of prosecution, the fear of a huge amount of time in jail, the loss of all the money he had, all this uncertainty.  And and and I think he's being portrayed sometimes as if that was a protest or an act of civil disobedience.  But I think it was an example. I think it was a lesson.  And what he taught me, just to your point that you just made, Leo, is that it's not that information wants to be free.  It's kind of a lesson that I learned from him in this.  It's the way I put it in a post this week is that is the question is, does knowledge want to be content?  So, you know, the content wants to be free is the argument people like me get accused of saying, well, you just want to make it all free.  Well, no, but I do want knowledge to be free.  I want knowledge to be freed up. And I gave this this talk here today at this library conference and I put up a picture of free Willy.  And, you know, he freed the whale.  Well, well, what what Aaron was really doing was freeing the whale of knowledge from the tank of JSTOR.  And we're stuck in our old models of thinking that you can own content and thus own the knowledge that comes into it.  And that's what he was about. When he's when information wants to be free, when knowledge wants to be freed up,  which that's what we should all be about. That's what he was really about.  And it really changed a lot of my view about the basic architecture of media.  And that was from his actions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, you know, his his own family released a statement basically blaming federal prosecutors and MIT for his death.  Now, they acknowledged that he'd had and I don't have any knowledge of this, but that he had long a long time battle with depression anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He'd written about it. He blogged about that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Openly talked about it. But they were very clear that they believed that.  Now, what happened was JSTOR, which is the commercial entity that he downloaded this stuff from, he did it, by the way.  And everybody I've seen talk about this, including Kevin Poulsen and others say this was not a hack in any sense of the word.  He used so he was at Harvard at the time.  He went to MIT where JSTOR is openly available to anybody on the MIT network for free and started downloading vast quantities of material and began a cat and mouse game with MIT authorities who were trying to stop it.  Eventually put a laptop in a closet and downloaded I think it was four million four point eight million documents from JSTOR.  This is that that repository of academic papers.  And this is what he got in trouble for.  Wire fraud and and theft.  And the implication being that he somehow wanted to benefit financially from it is pretty clear that was never the intent.  He did when first confronted apparently run from the police.  But eventually turned himself in gave the disk drives to JSTOR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  JSTOR dropped their complaint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's the interesting thing. JSTOR dropped the complaint.  But MIT did not know MIT has launched an investigation into how they behaved, obviously embarrassed by what happened.  I thought that eventually they had.  No, no, it's a mixed.  It was a mixed message, according to what I've read that maybe they did.  But they but it was sufficient for federal prosecutors continue their process prosecution had both parties said, no, we don't want to press charges.  I don't know if the feds would have gone ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It would have been harder for them.  But the problem is that already got the investigation going.  And there is there's some this the Secret Service was involved.  There was there was a bunch of other stuff going on.  And there's some discussion that it may have been connected to some of the other hacking incidents in the camp checking community.  So, you know, WikiLeaks and connections with and occupy those things and trying to use him as pressure on others and that kind of thing.  There's it's not clear.  And the problem is that it was very hard for anyone to talk about this, because if you do talk about it, you then get subpoena to testify against him.  And so I know when he was first arraigned, I talked to some of some of the people more his closer friends and they said, yes, I'm being called before the jury.  And I don't want to talk to you about it.  So you don't get dragged into.  So there was this prosecutorial intimidation showing that that made it very hard for people to discuss it.  And and it was very hard for him to sort of talk about it in public and try and get people to raise money for his defense, because that was also seen as subjudice, in effect.  So there were there were there was an enormous amount of pressure on him from from that angle as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The you know, this is sometimes called a terms of service prosecution, violating terms of service and being charged with a charge that eventually could have cost him 35 years in jail and several million dollars in fines.  The story went that the feds offered him a plea bargain down to he'd have to plead guilty and six months in jail, which he turned down because I think rightly so.  He felt that he no jail time was appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And also he'd have to be given 13 felonies.  They wouldn't they weren't.  He'd be a felon for the rest of his life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And God knows what else they would require about his connection to the Internet.  Look what the feds have done in other cases.  The company where they keep you off the Internet, short of death to him.  But he was also a depressed young man who, by the way, could basically only eat white rice.  You know, the idea of even six months in prison for any of us would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just honor Zola off and who is a member of Congress from Silicon Valley who went on Reddit.  And I think it's a really appropriate place for her to announce this and said I'm representative Zola off.  I'm introducing Aaron's law to change the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to eliminate these terms of service crimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because part of the problem here, too, is this is a case where we're treating technology differently and we're making the same crime that would be that would be perpetrated in other ways.  Xeroxing or other ways.  It's much worse because it's computers and computers are scary and computers are dangerous.  And we're still in that mode where we thus demonize the potential use of technology for all of us.  And this kind of prosecution affects all of us.  And so we've got to ramp that down.  And that idea that technology is different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Her bill would eliminate criminal fines and punishment for this kind of exceeds authorized access crime, which current which is the crimes he was charged with.  And currently you can go to jail for a very long time for exceeding authorized access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is the CFAA was written a long time ago.  It was written when computers were huge expensive boxes that required people to maintain them and attend them.  They were very hard to connect together and they were, you know, they were fortified in effect.  And now we carry three of them around in our pockets every day.  And this set this law has not been amended since.  And that is so there's there's all these if you actually look at the things he was accused of, they are these sort of bizarre technicalities like exceeding authorized access.  And things that all of us do 25 times a day.  And there are two other people who are currently in cases like that.  There's I can't remember his real name.  His real name rabbi is his R.A.B.I.T.E. is his Twitter handle is has been prosecuted because he exposed AT&T's insecure records of people with iPhones, which he did by incrementing the ID number for each user as you do when you do with a database.  Wasn't so hard was it.  So he has been prosecuted for adding one to a number.  Andrew, Andrew Arnheimer.  And Ron, I'm a that's it.  And there's there are other cases like this.  And in fact, this is we know about this one primarily because Aaron committed suicide and we can now talk about it.  But this same technique is used.  Yes.  All the time in computer cases to intimidate.  And sometimes they're doing this because there is actual fraud going on and theft.  And the Boston Prosecutors Office has courts and people who are hacking into credit card machines and things like that point of sale systems.  And so they're used to that way that world view.  They used to like we have these criminals and we have to treat them as criminals and used to expanding the law that way.  And in some ways, I think, you know, Aaron was like the you know, in Bonfire, the Vannities, they have the great white defendant.  They finally caught someone who isn't poor and they want to they want to show that the law is is even.  So they want to prosecute him, too.  I think there was some of that going on as well as this happening.  There's a there's a there's a piece.  There's a little bit in the I'll see if I can find the clip for you in Aaron's speech to Freedom to Connect where he talks about talking to a congressman and the anger that he has.  I find that clip and dig it out for you and put it in the in the chat.  Hang on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's all we're all in a great tragedy for him and his family and partner, but also a great loss for our community.  Yeah. And the behavior of MIT, probably and certainly of the of the federal prosecutors is shameful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, looking back at his work at his blog and at his talks, you know, he talked about depression.  He you know, he talked about depression. He gave a lot of talks.  He also in 2002 posted his will.  I mean, he was he believed very strongly that you should live in public and you should share information.  In fact, part of his will. I mean, you know, it's kind of a jokey page.  It's like, hey, if I get hit by a bus, like this is what I need you to do.  And he actually asked that he named someone as his person to execute his wishes.  And one of his wishes is that his entire hard drive is published online after his death.  He's a very strong believer in sharing information and living in public and even just reading back through his blog post from when he was, you know, a young kid going through sort of awkward phases of growing up and crushes and and all sorts of things.  And his sort of musings on what it's like to walk into a room and have everyone stare at you because you're 15, you know, being judged from from your looks versus being online.  It's it's it's fascinating.  And, you know, as far as I know, he didn't leave a note, but but he left lots of notes.  You know, there's he left his trail of work behind him.  And, you know, I think that the fact that he this happened on the anniversary of the of his arrest was it says a lot as much of a note as you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. It's just it's so tragic, so hard.  And what's interesting is how how much it rocked the Internet community.  A lot of people who didn't know him were just as affected by those who did.  I mean, it was it was really a shocker and so sad.  And there are a number of tributes to him and the Internet archives.  They're putting together an archive of Aaron SW memorabilia.  There's a tribute to him on Twitter, a hashtag PDF tribute where academics are publishing illegally their academic articles.  Oh, I have the copyright.  Well, if they have the copyright, I don't think they always have the copyright.  I think often the institution is forced to assign it to the journals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, which is I've liberated a few JSTOR documents in Aaron's name this week.  There's a bookmarklet in order to do that.  And the Internet archive did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Mm hmm.  So there are lots of ways to honor him.  A link to the clip in the in the in the chat room.  I'm sure we're the best place for it.  That's good.  Can you see that? Yep.  I look at that clip and him talking about talking to a senator about the law, because this marks the the attitude that he was he was met with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Chad, I don't know if you have my audio yet or not.  Let me play it and see if you do.  And if you don't, then you can play it.  Chad Johnson has control of the helm at the con here talking and I got introduced to a U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Senator, one of the strongest proponents of the original Koyka bill, in fact.  And I asked him why, despite being such a progressive, despite giving a speech in favor of civil liberties, why he was supporting a bill that would censor the Internet.  And, you know, that typical politician smile had suddenly faded from his face and his eyes started burning this fiery red.  And he started shouting at me, said, those people on the Internet, they think they can get away with anything.  They think they can just put anything up there and there's nothing we can do to stop them.  They put up everything.  They put up our nuclear missiles and they just laugh at us.  Well, we're going to show them there's got to be laws on the Internet.  It's got to be under control.  Now, as far as I know, nobody has ever put up the U.S.'s nuclear missiles on the Internet.  I mean, it's just not something I've heard about.  But that's sort of the point.  He wasn't having a rational concern, right?  It was this irrational fear that things were out of control.  Here was this man, a United States Senator, and those people on the Internet, they were just mocking him.  They had to be brought under control.  Things had to be under control.  And I think that was the attitude of Congress.  And just as seeing that fire in that senator's eyes scared me, I think those hearings scared a lot of people.  They saw this wasn't the attitude of a thoughtful government trying to resolve tradeoffs in order to best represent its citizens.  It was more like the attitude of a tyrant.  And so the citizens fought back.  The wheels came off the bus pretty quickly after that hearing.  First, the Republican senators pulled out.  And then the White House issued a statement opposing the bill.  And then the Democrats, left all alone out there, announced they were putting the bill on hold so they could have a few further discussions before the official vote.  And that was when, as hard as it was for me to believe, after all this, we had won.  The thing that everyone said was impossible, that some of the biggest companies in the world had written off as kind of a pipe dream, had happened.  We did it. We won.  And then we started rubbing it in.  You all know what happened next.  Wikipedia went black. Reddit went black. Craigslist went black.  The phone lines on Capitol Hill flat out melted.  Members of Congress started rushing to issue statements retracting their support for the bill that they were promoting just a couple days ago.  It was just ridiculous.  I mean, there's a chart from the time that captures it pretty well.  It says something like January 14th on one side.  It has this big, long list of names supporting the bill.  And then just a few lonely people opposing it.  And then the other side, it says January 15th.  And now it's totally reversed.  Everyone is opposing it.  Just a few lonely names still hanging on in support.  I mean, this really was unprecedented.  Don't take my word for it.  But ask former Senator Chris Dodd, now the chief lobbyist for Hollywood.  He admitted after he lost that he had mastermind the whole evil plan.  And he told the New York Times he'd never seen anything like it during his many years in Congress.  And everyone I've spoken to agrees.  The people rose up and they caused a sea change in Washington.  Not the press, which refused to cover the story.  Just coincidentally, their parent companies all happened to be lobbying for the bill.  Not the politicians who were pretty much unanimously in favor of it.  And not the companies who had all but given up trying to stop it and decided it was inevitable.  It was really stopped by the people.  The people themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Aaron Schwartz talking about the reaction to SOPA.  There's more to it if you want to watch it on YouTube.  Just how we stopped SOPA.  I didn't realize it.  That's almost exactly a year ago.  It was a year ago, a couple of days ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's this Friday.  There's an event in San Francisco to get together about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now maybe all those sites will go black for Aaron.  That might not be a bad way to remember him.  Terrible loss.  Very sad story.  I don't know if there's a moral to be drawn from it.  Except we should just reinvigorate it in our work to continue his work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you're absolutely right, Leo.  There's another angle here.  There was a story I just saw online.  I didn't put it on the run yet.  We all, but also in the technology industry, we have to deal with depression and depression among geniuses.  I'm not saying that depression is what made us lose Aaron.  He was also hounded.  But it was part of it.  What Corey Doctorow wrote was absolutely beautiful.  And also the fact that people like Corey and Dana talked about their own demons they've dealt with and this brought that out.  We've got to let people know they're not alone.  We've got to talk to them.  It's far more widespread than we know.  And that's an issue we have to deal with as well.  And I think that in our industry, there's people by many, many geniuses who have some difficulties with an insane world.  I think we have to show support and be aware of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Danny O'Brien is one of Aaron's friends.  He was on the airplane actually back from Aaron's funeral.  And he just had this just amazing spree on Twitter.  It was very funny.  He's an M-A-L-A on Twitter.  But he kind of ended this long rant saying that we all need to continue Aaron's work and that we have to look at all his public writings and all the things that he taught us and carry on his good work.  But there was this one tweet where he said, everyone needs to make copies of everything.  Civilization does not back up itself.  And I was like, that is spot on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I really love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  I think I've just put the link to Danny's tweets in the chat as well.  The other thing about depression and why it's particularly hard for people who are very logical is that a lot of what depression does is takes away your feeling that you can overcome things.  You're feeling that you are special and the world is not to destroy.  In some ways, it makes you hyper rational and takes away the piece of you that says, oh, that can't be that bad.  It's like, you know, in the Hitchhiker's Guide, there's Douglas Adams has this thing called the total perspective vortex.  And you go into it and it shows you how insignificant you are compared to the rest of the universe.  And people go mad and die from it.  And he did it as a comedy thing so that people did not get it.  Right.  But that's effectively what depression does to you.  It makes you think I don't matter.  The world would be better off without me.  And I also think that, you know, Aaron being as brilliant as he was, was put in this situation where he didn't have a way out.  He was said, you know, you're either going to go to trial and potentially go to jail for 30 years or you're going to go to jail for six months.  And he knew that either way that would break him.  He couldn't manage, you know, working in an office, let alone going to jail.  And he and he saw he probably saw this as another way out.  And, you know, he may have even foreseen how much reaction this would get and publicity would bring to the thing.  We don't know.  But that's the position he was put in by those prosecutors and people put in that every day by prosecutors.  It's just that he was one of us that we see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes. Well said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's a martyr in the classic sense of the word.  And I think his death will have meaning.  I think there's no doubt about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't want anyone to think that suicide is the way to get meaning.  No, no.  And that's really it is.  It is.  So watching that video, there's that video alone, you know, listing all his achievements and watching that video, what we have lost, what suicide robbed from first him and his family and his loved ones, but also from all of us.  And suicide isn't god damn it is not not the way out.  Not the answer.  And yes, that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're going to take a break when we come back.  I do want to talk about the new Facebook search because I don't know whether it's good, bad and different.  And there is some Google News.  We'll find it.  Mr. Mr. Schmidt goes to Gong Yang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a there's a Google connection to that Facebook story, which we'll talk about.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact, this is probably what Google's long feared.  Should it fear it?  That's the question.  All of that still to come.  You're watching this week in Google.  Kevin Marks, I'm really glad you're here.  Thank you for volunteering to come and talk.  We appreciate it.

Transcript:  And thank you for devoting that time to Aaron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, it's not the first we did on Twitter.  We've done a number of shows and I'm glad.  You know, I feel bad because on triangulation right after this, we're interviewing Alex Ohanian, the founder of Reddit.  But he asked not to talk about Aaron.  And I'm not sure for what reasons, but we won't be able to really spend a lot of time with him talking about that.  It may be just too painful.  Yeah.  You may not want to.  Alexis may not want to cry on the air.  How do you go to a commercial now?  I should play some happy music and take your mind off all this.  Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.

He says, hey, I was fighting for the open web.  Don't think it's going to fall on the receptive ears, to be honest with you.  Governor Richardson, former governor of New Mexico, who went with Eric Schmidt to North Korea, says Schmidt was a rock star in North Korea.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you not go?  I mean, you know, you're Google.  You can make a public appeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's you know, this is the State Department said, please don't go.  This generally happens when you're going to a country that is kind of the sworn enemy of yours.  The people who are in the diplomatic corps would prefer that the amateurs stay home.  But Richardson is not an amateur.  Yes, he is.  He's not anything.  Well, he's a former UN ambassador, former governor of New Mexico.  He's not representing the government.  No, no.  I think there's always a risk when well-meaning amateurs show up in these venues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the message was like, get on the Internet or suffer later.  Yeah, I can't imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Slightly threatening.  Richardson said that he believes effective foreign policy requires a mix of government, private citizens, philanthropic groups and nongovernmental organizations.  I wouldn't disagree with that, but I just think there's a little risk.  And we know Eric is a little bit of a loose cannon.  It makes me nervous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that any opportunity you have to put pressure on a recalcitrant, backwards, not open technology, fearing country, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, I'm all for, you know, look, we're its government of the people, by the people, for the people.  I mean, any citizen can go anywhere as long as it's understood he doesn't represent any official point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If he had gone making all buddy, buddy, I'd love you, love you.  Well, that's the risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not a Jane Fonda in a tank, you know, photo op.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you go and you say I'm going to use this opportunity to pressure them to try to open up this connection to the world for these people.  OK, that's a message that I think is OK.  You're right. It's a risk because you can be put in a photo opportunity and the photo opportunities for Eric, of course, were hilarious.  It was it was the mockery of the beloved leader looking at things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it was also the sweater.  Now, I just want to say, Eric, next time you go on a diplomatic mission, can you avoid the pink V-net sweater?  I'm just saying.  And I don't know what the hell Governor Richard, what is Bill Richardson wearing there?  Is that what I'm thinking?  He looks positively British.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were never without their coats.  It's obvious. It is a very cold, cold.  They were never on the coats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He talked.  Governor Richardson talked to North Korea's vice minister for nuclear negotiations.  And said, you should temper your nuclear development efforts.  And, you know, they pressed about who's being detained.  You're right. You're right. I shouldn't be so negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't mean to. I don't mean to.  Your points are fair.  Yeah, they are. I'm just I'm just I had the same struggle.  Is this right or wrong?  I just ended up at a different spot.  But no, no, you're you're you're like Richard Branson went there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, it's at least somebody who's got some dignitas.  It's I mean, it's carrot top going to North Korea to try to cheer him up.  I mean, it's he's fighting for the open web and all of that.  And meanwhile, the Google Google Earth put the North Korean Gulag prison system on their maps.  So, you know, that was convenient.  Yeah, that was kind of like a little response.  I don't know if he showed them. Have you seen this?  All right. Moving on.  Let's talk about I guess we should talk about we only have about half an hour more.  So we might as well. Well, let's let's get this. Let's get this over with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook, Graf search, Graf, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  First of all, bad name.  No one in the real world has any idea what a social graph is.  I only recently figured it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. I agree. But but it's when I said that today, just as a branding thing, geeks went after me.  What? Look it up. And I said, no, no, no, it's like branding point.  Yeah, it's but it's Zuckerberg's favorite word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's always social. What did Google call it? Search plus you or something.  Right. Search your world.  That makes sense to people.  With this weird acronym, Spyworld. Yes.  It's not very felicitous, but at least it's words people understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know why they just don't say social search or just social search. Social search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I got the brand nosy search.  Nosy search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's that's OK. So there's there's different attitudes towards this.  If you're a privacy advocate.  Now, Google, I mean, Facebook is very clear saying, look, you're not going to be able to find anything you couldn't find otherwise.  It's all the privacy controls you've already established.  Continue to apply. Your friends will see what they can see.  The public will see what they can see. But we're not going to breach that barrier.  Nevertheless, I think because you can now search for stuff and because people don't understand Google's face.  I keep saying Google. Facebook's privacy settings.  There will be lots of inadvertent leaks of information.  Certainly now is the time to start searching for that ex pictures of the ex girlfriend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the thing. I don't think maybe it's just I don't use Facebook enough.  I don't like I mean, I don't as a verb like stuff.  Right. I don't either. I don't.  And so I don't know how many of my friends do. Maybe it's just a little fart.  I don't know how viable it's going to be.  And it's still in that closed Facebook world where Google gives you the whole world and it uses it.  The other thing is you've got to do an explicit search for friends from Italy who've seen this movie who have a cat in pictures before 1990.  It's so bully in about life.  Whereas what Google tries to do is to just use this knowledge behind to feed relevance to you and to make some presumptive decisions.  Each one somebody's going to call creepy, but whatever.  I just wonder how useful this is. We don't know yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And maybe I'll be surprised. But it's only as useful as your friends use Facebook and you use Facebook.  That's for sure. So just to zoom out.  So so graph search is the ability to search for people based on criteria.  And now let me just say that I have not used it yet.  In fact, it hasn't been launched yet.  You can sign up to be on the wait list at Facebook dot com slash about slash graph search.  But it's basically advanced criteria.  So just what Jeff said, you can say, show me all the TV shows that people on my friends who are software developers really like or show me all the pictures of my friends in New York or that kind of thing.  So so so likes location.  Show me all the people my friends list who work at Google, for instance.  So it's just like advanced sort of search operators for people within Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It'll be I think it'll be great.  They were giving were really off in particular in the levy story.  It's like single women near me and that's a good one.  Friends of friends who work at Google as programmers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And my business partner tweeted like, what's the you know, what's the worst graph search criteria you can think of?  And someone said people who have just bought really expensive electronics and who are not home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The only thing in the wild thing is is people who like things that I like by Tom Stocky and everyone who'd in the list actually works at Facebook and is a dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, because I'll tell you why.  So so one of the examples they say this could be very useful recommendation engine if you're looking for a restaurant or a plumber or a dentist.  But I and maybe it's just us.  But let's let me ask the younger generation or whatever who uses Facebook.  I don't even know.  Chad, do you use are you?  I don't even use.  No, I don't know who use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's mostly mom.  The worst way to invite me to a party is to invite me on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And so you would have to be that all your friends went through all of their dentists, plumbers and like them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who's going to say, boy, I just had a great truth drilling.  What a pleasure that truth drilling was.  I kind of tell you about Dr. Schmidt with my tooth or my drain was was clogged.  But now it's clear who's going to present that as their life.  Nobody presents the practicality of life on Facebook, which you present on Facebook is your view as if you were a star.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, I mean, having just had those things done, I would share those with friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but you're not you haven't already shared it, though, Kevin.  So so the problem is, so the problem is that all the search guys will ask you to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's the real problem is this is just going to step up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ask you to like them.  You got to like us. You got to like us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just going to get horrible.  Leave us a review on Yelp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, right now, it's leave us a review on Yelp and this will be like us on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's good for Facebook's business because it's lock in, you know, means you want to work on social graph search, even though you don't know what that means.  You got to get somebody to like you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And it's, you know, the my the guy I go and get breakfast, coffees and empanadas from Big E and San Jose.  Great place. Definitely go there.  You know, I've been going there for years and I check in on Foursquare and he was like, you know, he knew I was in tech and he says, oh, what do we need to do with all this stuff?  I said, well, there's lots of them and you can try different ones out.  And then last time when he said, I found this great thing, I found this thing called Hootsuite and I can post all these social media once.  Oh, dear. And this guy makes great coffee and he makes great empanadas and he feels like he has to do all this stuff now to promote his little coffee shop.  So, yeah, we're seeing that people people want that.  And obviously, this is the thing that Facebook wants you to do.  They want you to do those kinds of searches here because those are the searches they can monetize.  The point of the big difference between what Google has been selling and what Facebook is selling is Google has been selling intent.  Most of the ads that Google sells are on. I'm looking for X. I want a new TV screen.  I need a plumber. I need, you know, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I don't think that's going to be useful. This is going to be useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Facebook obviously wants that because what they've been selling is we can sell you demographics.  We can sell you people over 45 in San Jose who have a hot tub or whatever, assuming that you said you had a hot tub.  So they need that data to get richer and they need you to actually mark more things off so this stuff becomes useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So what's going to happen, Kevin, is that the problem becomes the null search results that you're going to get out.  So fine, you're going to go in, it's going to start up, you're going to try it.  I have boring friends on Facebook and I'm not going to find anything.  They limited their search universe to such a small amount of potential data.  They are so highly dependent upon other users to do these things that we don't necessarily do.  They're presuming that we do them unless they have more data about our behavior than I know.  And I'm just weird, which is quite possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know. Isn't there a big risk for Facebook here that if people use it prematurely and it's not good, they're not going to come look at cool and all these other Google wannabes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's premature, Leo? What they're arguing is that basically the database is already there.  We have already spent years now telling Facebook all this stuff.  All we have to do is unlock this data and get into it.  If you start from data from today forward, they're really doomed.  But I don't presume the data is there.  But John Battelle, who wrote the book, the original search book about Google, who's a smart guy, said it changed his whole view of Facebook's prospects.  I don't, I'm not getting this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I got to tell you, I'm a casual Facebook user, but I like pictures of my friends' kids and their pets and stuff.  There's no way to see all the things that you've liked on Facebook.  That makes me crazy. We've talked about this with Google+.  It makes me crazy. I don't press the plus one button as a matter of principle because I'm just feeding their system and I can't get that back.  I can't say show me all the stuff that I plus one.  But this will let you do that now.  This will do that, right?  So at least I feel like at least Facebook is reflecting back the information that I'm feeding them.  They're not just serving their advertisers.  So Lars Rasmussen, who's the engineer at Facebook who presented the graph search.  Lars is the same guy who built Google Maps with his brother down in Australia, which was purchased by Google.  And Lars was the guy who built Google Wave.  Okay, you're a little biased.  This is the Google connection.  I have a deep professional crush on Lars, I have to admit.  He basically said that your favorite search in Facebook, the Facebook graph search is going to be show me all the photos that I've liked.  Then you can save these searches like pages.  I mean, I got to tell you, my favorite view on Flickr are Flickr photos that I favorited over the years because they're all adorable pictures of my friends, kids and their pets and that kind of thing.  Stuff I want to remember, warm memories.  My Twitter favorites, I also favorite stuff on Twitter.  I love to be reminded of those.  So I'm excited about graph search because I feel like I'm getting my data back and I get to see my friends data in a more meaningful way.  More meaningful than sponsored likes or ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And certainly that's one search that's useful that makes Facebook no money.  I can't think of any way to monetize your picture likes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Show me all the songs that my friends have listened to in the past month on Spotify.  That you can monetize.  Make me a playlist of the top songs all my friends have listened to on Spotify in the last 10 months.  Now I'm liking that.  I mean, they've got so much data there.  And I got to tell you, I have a great dentist.  I love my dentist.  She's amazing.  I haven't liked her on Facebook, but she does this thing and this is kind of ironic, but she sends cookies to anyone who refers a patient.  Right.  So if I like her on Facebook and one of my friends sees that I liked her and goes to her and says, like, I got referred to by Gina.  Like, I get lots of cookies.  So sugar in them and then she gets more business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It works.  There's a lot of cookies.  I get cookies.  She gets more business.  Say her name again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want you to get some cookies.  Dr. Ellen Miyashiro in San Diego.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Go see her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And make sure you mention Gina Tripani sent you.  Yes, please.  Gina sent you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina sent you.  Oh, that could be cool.  That could be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  businesses are going to certainly do.  You know, a lot of people are going to get cookies.  going to go to the top of the list.  I'm going to go to the top of the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to go to the top of the list.  Facebook.  You're going to love Graph Search.  And if you hate Facebook, then you will really hate Graph Search.  But one of the things that you talked about was the behavioral changes that we're going  to start to see SEO for Facebook.  I saw that.  Oh my God.  People are going to just like everything because they want to show up in all the search results.  People who would never have a Facebook page before are going to have a Facebook page now  because the tool will affect behavior.  So look, Facebook wants more people to participate in Facebook and more people to engage with  especially with liking.  But at the same time, I hate the idea of an SEO community springing up.  I mean, when Google's PageRank was kind of in its heyday, everybody was worried about  how to optimize SEO their websites.  And people are going to start thinking about this with their Facebook profiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  You just gave me a horrible flash.  So now reputation.com is going to tell you to optimize your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He even used that.  He even used the phrase reputation management like Mike Yelgin did in his article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is good heart's law, isn't it?  As soon as you measure anything, it becomes useless.  And Google has done this to links on the web and they've done it to words on the web now.  And Facebook is about to do this to their own graph.  And suddenly it's the thing that people are optimizing for and then it gets damaged.  It's a problem.  Yeah.  So there's a couple things about this that I do like.  One thing I do like is the find people near X because that's something I need because  it's like, OK, I'm doing an event.  I want to invite people who have a chance of getting to it.  And that's impossible at the moment.  I had this just before Christmas.  I was trying to set up a Microformats dinner in San Francisco on short notice.  I thought, right, I'll invite people in Facebook and G Plus who are nearby and we'll see who  turns up.  And on Facebook, I went through by hand.  It was like, I think they're there.  And did that and a few people saw it.  And on Google Plus, I thought, oh, Google is smart about this.  They only show this to people who are nearby.  I use Google now.  It knows where I am.  And so I just added my Geeks group to it or something.  And it got, you know, it looked like I was inviting them all to dinner.  It looked like I invited 200 people to dinner, half of whom were in New York or, you know,  the UK.  And it wasn't there wasn't any way of saying, no, actually only make this a radius of 100  miles or so.  So that piece is good.  I like that idea.  And that is directly useful.  The nearby thing.  That's good.  But I am worried that this is going to cause a whole bunch of sort of second order effects  that people don't like.  The other thing that strikes me about this is that the way likes are going.  My youngest son, you know, I was sitting with him.  He was on Facebook and I was doing something.  How old is he?  He's 16.  Okay.  And he's he was like, it's the daily delete all your likes thing.  Because he's good for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He has learned his lesson well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, because the ads pop up with things you like.  He's like, yeah, I like that two years ago.  I don't want ads about it.  Right.  And he's like deleting all the old likes and getting rid of the ones because they're just  spamming him now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's tough for fickle people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just looking at my about pitch today and stuff that I liked is like, oh, it's true.  It's like, that's so three years ago.  You know, I, you know, but it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I once complimented my grandmother's carrot cake to her when I was three years old.  So for the rest of my life, I loved nothing but carrot cake.  And it's this strictly sweet stuff that I had to eat every time I saw my grandmother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You said you liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Facebook becomes Grammy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what they've done?  I didn't know this, but now your likes have a timeline.  Did you know that?  You can see what you like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's flipped by year.  You liked this year, last year, the going all the way back to what did I like in 2008?  I'm wondering if there's anything that my problem is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm grumbling.  I didn't like anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, you don't like enough stuff.  Oh, yeah.  See, I I've deleted old likes because I don't see any likes going back that far.  I still like Vi Hart.  I still like Roger Ebert, still like Sonos, Gary Vaynerchuk, Ford Focus like that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gary.  I like myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you like yourself?  Yes, you can.  I like myself.  So, yeah, I mean, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But not Gary so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I like my shirts.  Apparently somebody made a Leo Laporte shirts page.  I didn't know that.  I'm going to like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to get Gary Vaynerchuk after you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know.  Just watch the Twitter tattletales are in force.  Gary, did you hear what Leo said about you on Twig?  Now, you got it.  Scobel did this.  He went through all of the brands that he liked and eliminated.  So Scobel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is a passing thing, though, right?  Like you could feel really passionate and happy about something when you've had a good  experience, but then a couple of years pass and you're like, oh, yeah, you know, just  the memory is less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's very easy to like something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, yeah, there's you don't.  The reason I use Foursquare now is mainly to keep a history of where I've been and  things and also that it feeds back and gives me good recommendations.  But I use it as an archive of, oh, yeah, I went to that place on that day, which is quite  handy.  So I can see Facebook potentially being useful for that.  But if it comes with ads and annoyances and noise in your stream, then I can see people  deleting it again.  Somebody else told me about that they have this little thing they do, which is everyday  Facebook tells the people's birthdays.  And if they go, I'm not sure I want to say happy birthday to them, they delete them as a  friend because that's their way of getting rid of them.  And if you do it on their birthday, they won't notice because they get a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it. Their entire wall is full of stuff.  That's clever.  Birthday unfriending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's this sort of rolling unfriending thing of like how to how to trim your  graph without offending people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And after a year, you'll have gone through everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Happy birthday. See you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bye. Hope you have a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice knowing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't say happy birthday.  They just disappear.  Yeah.  And if you like them, you can buy them a cheesy gift.  I like that.  So Facebook stock price, did it go up after this big announcement?  I didn't.  Probably.  I saw Apple's went up a lot.  I should ask Google now.  Facebook.  Google now will know.  Let's see what Google now knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My Google now doesn't know enough still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm still you still don't have a smart Google now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I went I went through the whole McGill.  I found one other new McGill.  Somebody suggested to me that I had to go into my apps account and as an apps top  administrator say it was OK for my users, including myself, to have history in the  browser. So I did all that.  It's still not doing it for me.  FB with some, but it won't even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kind of flat, huh?  Point a three percent.  The market's not sure what it means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The market's trying to find out what a graph is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's funny because the API has been called the graph API.  So I just I mean, I think is and I work with the API for ThinkUp and I just I'm used to  it. You know, it's just it's a term like that.  I'm just kind of associate with Facebook.  I'm used to it. But you're right.  Like it makes no sense.  I don't know why they just didn't call Facebook search or social search or people  search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is the problem with being a nerd is that you start getting, you know, well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  everybody knows that stupid terminology.  Right. Yeah.  Like like words that mean nothing to the rest of the world.  I know I use the phrase data liberation all the time.  And Neil always looks me is like that's a Google like people who don't cover Google  don't know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like, all right. That at least those are English words that make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you can you can gather contextual clues and figure out what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A graph. I don't think graph gives you a lot of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I did the Ngram View on social graph.  And it was this obscure technical term for most of the for the basic for the  20th century. And then it suddenly goes zoop and shoots up by a factor of.  Look at that. Ten or so.  Wow.  Around 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm surprised there was any noise about it before this.  So must have been some sort of sociology term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a sociology term, definitely.  And it was it was what you use to say this is how people are connected to each other.  But it was it was the data.  Dana Boyd, of course, has a great paper on this.  The difference between the actual social graph and the publicly articulated social  graph, which you do in Facebook or whatever.  And so in sociology, they would they will model this and ask people who their  friends were and get them to draw little bits of paper.  And that was their way of doing it.  And then with the rise of social networking, it was these things exploded and they  became much bigger. And they're actually you know, this is the I need to delete  people on their birthdays. Problem is like, who are all these people who I've  gradually friended over time and now there's here.  Here's by the way, this is so I see this is why Google Books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Awesome. So we have to go back to 1910 and the  Floyd Henry Alport and Gordon William Alport's personality traits, their  classification and measurement.  And you see in this figure, the graph is because they divided  personalities into a range of things, emotions and so forth.  And then they drew a graph showing high and low.  And they literally call this the social graph.  This is one of the first appearances of the phrase social graph, the classification  of personality traits.  This one's an introverted social type.  That Zuckerberg social almost psychopathic, it says, neurotic,  heredity. I didn't say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think this isn't using that term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not the definition.  It does not mean what you think it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Neil says that Brad Fitzpatrick coined the term social graph in 2007 from  Live Journal.  That's what we looked up in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Brad read very good paper on that.  That was a good essay he wrote just like the day before he joined Google when he  could still speak in public and he went on to build the social graph API at Google,  which they killed this year.  But that was that was that was crawling the web looking for these links between  friends and links between yourself and making it available as a public API, which  was a great I thought was a great service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I hope you know what kind of bugs me about all of this is that Facebook spent  millions of dollars lobbying Washington to change a law so that you could share  your Netflix viewing habits on Facebook.  And even though we're in the middle of this this debt ceiling negotiation, there's a  lot of important stuff on Congress's doorstep.  The Video Privacy Protection Act did get updated.  And last Thursday, President Obama signed that bill just in time to add your Netflix  viewing habits to your social graph.  Thank you, Facebook.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  H.R. 6671, the Video Privacy Protection Amendments Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm also glad it's I'm glad it's there.  And that is really the the the Justice Bork law before.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If banned the sharing of any video history information, not Bork, it was wasn't it?  It was Bork.  It was the it was Bork.  Bork got in trouble for his video habits because so did so did the other guy who got in.  And I conveniently blank Clarence Thomas conveniently blanking out his video habits.  Clarence Thomas was Coke cans or was videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  Yeah, you're right.  Am I right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm confusing Long Dong Silver with something else.  Right.  And the pubic hair on the Coke can.  Yeah.  Did you are you going to send Mark Zuckerberg to pay 100 bucks and send him a message?  I like the associate graph.  Gary V is responding.  It's just a joke, Gary.  I love you, baby.  I love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we love Gary.  Where did he where did he respond?  I don't know.  Of course he responded.  Gary.  That's what Gary does.  He's the most responsive human on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why I love him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's always got his ears on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's he says Leo Laporte, I'll always like you, but more importantly, always respect you.  Happy New Year, Gary V.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's he's he's classy.  That dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Twitter tattled tales once again.  Oh, no, he's responding to talking about how he liked you in 2008 on Facebook.  This is the problem is it doesn't 140 characters.  There's no context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No wine for you.  Yeah, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Love you, Gary.  Don't listen to them.  So Facebook apparent, you know, remember, they said for a buck, we can make sure that your message gets in your friends' minds.  It gets in your friends inbox, not the other folder.  And then apparently some people are getting the message for 100 bucks.  If you're if you're not a friend, if you didn't friend Mark Zuckerberg and he has quite a few friends, then you might get a message that says you aren't connected to Mark on Facebook.  Your message would normally get filtered to the other folder.  Would you like to send it to him for 100 bucks?  Send to inbox for 100 dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Facebook is monetizing email.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you could say, you know, if somebody's willing to spend a buck, then it's probably not a spammer.  Well, I mean, I mean, that's the issue with email, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like to send somebody postal mail, you have to pay for postage.  You have to get a stamp.  You have to get a mailbox.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you have to.  So it puts it puts the onus on the sender, right?  They have to pay. Right.  But the problem with emails, it puts the onus on the recipient.  It costs nothing.  So that's why we get spam.  So I've always felt like it should be a little harder to contact someone by email because that would counter spam.  I just something about this just doesn't feel right.  I wish it wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina, Gina, you're right.  Logically, that's the way it works.  But the contrary proof is that the USPS is now an entirely business of junk mail.  And the only ones who pay to send mail anymore junk mail.  Right.  That's really so inevitably what you're going to get down to is they're going to be someone to open marketplace and they're selling our supposed attention and our mailbox.  We have no control.  It goes back to what Bob Wyman told me a long time ago.  But the problem with email is when the sender controlled email, that's what ruined email and Google Plus recipient controls.  And that's the key difference.  That's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How so on Google Plus by saying you're on Google Plus, you only receive messages from people you choose to receive messages from.  The only the only things that didn't work because you used to get notifications and that got spam to me.  They had to kill that.  But now you can decide who can who can communicate with you.  You should be able to do that in comments too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So on Twitter, someone can direct me.  Only people who you follow can direct message you.  Yeah, but that is what Facebook built in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The reason people started using Facebook instead of email was because you choose who could send you stuff.  Right.  You know, the few they're not friends, they cut.  They can't message you.  But they can now if they are willing to pay a buck.  Other folder that you never you never see.  If you go to Facebook, there's a look in messages and click like three times or something.  There's a there's an other folder that has messages from people who've sent you thing to the to that fake email address that Facebook created for you and then synced into everybody's address book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Tip tool.  It could be a tool.  It could be a tip.  It could be anything.  By episode 500, you're going to get that.  Oh, I don't.  I only started pronouncing your name correctly in the last few months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I both pronunciations are OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, all right.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A tip this week is Yahoo Image Search has restored the ability to get images which are  Creative Commons license.  That means that they're reusable.  They Yahoo Search had this for a while, but then they took it away when Bing Search replaced  it.  They have since restored it.  So if you go to Yahoo Image Search, there's an and you and you click on the bar on the  side.  And this works on both mobile and in the browser.  You can search for images and then you can say, just show me ones that are available  for reuse.  This is a huge, huge help to anyone who publishes online, who makes presentations, who only  wants to use photos which are Creative Commons license that can be used.  So I'm really happy that it's back.  I'm feeling very good about Yahoo.  I'm feeling good about Flickr.  And most of these images, obviously, that are CC licensed are from Flickr.  So if you if you're missing that image search, it's back and you can post beautiful blog  posts about sunsets with Creative Commons license, really, really reusable images right  from your phone or in your browser now using Yahoo Image Search.  I think I'm going to change my image search shortcut in Chrome to Yahoo Image Search.  Now this is back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you never went away on Flickr, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, it didn't.  It didn't ever go away and Flickr.  Right.  So this is so this is integrated into Yahoo experience.  It was right.  And then Bing kind of took it away.  But right.  It was always on Flickr.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  By the way, Bing might be the big benefactor of this new social graph search because it's  going to be incorporated into Bing search as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that also they get all the ones that Facebook can't fulfill.  So yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kevin, would you like to throw anything in?  I don't want to leave you out in the cold.  Is there anything you're using on with Google or anything you want us to highlight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would say watch that whole talk from Aaron.  Do.  Yes.  That would be my spend 20 minutes watching that this week.  Yep.  I agree.  I agree with you 100%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep.  Your number of the week, Mr. Jarvis.  Oh, he's muted.  You're muted, Jeff.  You're muted.  No.  You're baffled.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Jeff, you're baffled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you're muted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hello, Jeff.  Is it us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I like Jeff's like, I don't know.  It's not us.  I'm looking at our board.  Everything looks well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is.  It is six o'clock Eastern time.  I think you're hard out when they said when you said hard out, I think they meant we're  going to cut your microphone.  This is like the Golden Globe Awards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would triple check that maybe the button on Skype didn't accidentally get pressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you watch the Golden Globes, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't.  I didn't.  Were they good?  Were they worth watching?  Well, I heard about I heard about my girl, Jodie Foster, of course.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was going to ask you.  I couldn't tell if she came out or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think so.  I mean, it's sort of been an open secret.  She mentioned her longtime partner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was kind of like Anderson Cooper, you know?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then and then and then and she acted as if I'm never going to work in Hollywood again,  which is like Jodie, I think you will.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what, Jodie?  I think it's going to be OK.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a shame that there really is still a stigma.  And there are many Hollywood stars who just will not say anything about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's also partly age, right?  That she's from a time where it was more difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's some pretty well-known leading men who.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, especially that she was a child star, you know, that she had.  Experience fame very early, you know, in a different generation.  I think that she just became protective of her life because she was in the spotlight.  That's what I love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I loved her saying, you know, there's this thing about privacy.  I know, Jeff, you might disagree, but I did like it that she said.  No, no, I get that.  She's going to protect that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  By the way, I still have a crush on her.  Oh, yeah.  Who doesn't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, she's yeah, she's completely crush worthy.  All judges welcome.  Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But she's also had some horrific stalkers as well.  Well, that's true, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  John Hinckley, of course.  And that's a very good point.  Yeah, she had good reason to want to be private.  Yeah.  All right.  I've stalled long enough.  Jeff's microphone came back.  Yeah, I screwed up.  I didn't know that I bonged my little thing here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, anytime I use a bong, that happens to me, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't.  I bombed my little thing.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That also the technical term.  Sound engineers use it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I talk technical, no, Jajina.  Your number, sir.  Well, all right.  I was going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was going to do.  Your number, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, all right.  I was going to do.  I'm going to do this one.  I'm going to do this one.  One donkey is still alive in the world.  If you go into the rundown and look at the Business Insider link there, Leo, Google was  killed, was accused of killing a donkey on Street View.  But the accusers got the order wrong.  And in fact, the donkey lives.  I think it's an important thing.  No donkeys were killed in this Street View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How could Street View kill a donkey?  The truck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the problem was, whoever did it looked at dead spinners.  They looked at the stills in reverse and thought the donkey was dead in the road.  In fact, the donkey was still alive.  Oh, it was the other way around.  And the truck came along and woke up the donkey, and the donkey moved off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Google Street View woke up a donkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Business Insider showed the proper order to the photos of this big controversy.  Google had to defend themselves that Street View didn't kill a donkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They did knock a deer down a few years ago, right?  Somebody has way too much time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Geez, Kevin.  How many images are there on Street View that you would have to comb through?  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But this is the point.  Google can't do this.  This is the can you look at all the images uploaded to YouTube?  But if you go down your own street and there's a deer lying in the street, what the hell?  You post that to there.  And so there are all these spotted on Street View things that are...  Where did that go?  So yeah, why was somebody browsing the street in Botswana?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He doesn't look like a well donkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was rubbing his back.  He was rolling in the dust.  Oh, there he is.  There he is.  He's got to wear the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The donkey lived, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they did actually hit a deer in 2000.  I just put the link to the Guardian thing of that.  I think they actually took the images out.  But there was this like deer lying in the road and then you see it getting up again afterwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, well, he's not dead.  He's just pining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In my neck of the woods, they're tall rats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's pining for the fjords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But there are, you know, there's a whole blogstove.  It's a weird stuff you found in Street View.  I know. I love it.  The guy asleep on his own lawn and the house that burns down as they drive past the street.  Crazy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to suggest that people listen to all about Android last night because you covered about eight different great calendar apps.  And I can't decide which one.  I did download and install Agenda because I love that from way back when when it was an iOS app.  It's just the cleanest, simplest calendar app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if you swipe from left to right, it goes from like it goes from the year.  Now, swipe again.  Yeah. So that's awesome.  The year view.  And then it goes from the month and then week and day.  Yeah, it syncs to Google.  It can do multiple Google accounts, multiple calendars.  And then if you swipe again, it'll go event specific.  So, yeah, it's just really nice.  It's just it's very simple.  It's very simple.  It's very simple question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina, can I stop it from changing the darned time zones?  So when I put in some going to Davos next week where you'll see me next week.  Right. So I put in something that's going to occur at seven at night.  It thinks that it's UTC time.  And so when I get there, it changes it by five hours.  Google does.  Can't you tell Google Calendar not to do that?  I can't find.  No, I can't.  That's a setting in Google Calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you when you enter.  So this is what I do is when I enter the event, I specify the time zone.  So I said, you know, so I would say for Twig, I would say I'm in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the best way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would say Twig 4 p.m. EST.  And then it adjusts for Pacific.  And then when I come to New York, it adjusts.  You know what I mean?  So if you specify the time zone on entry, then you'll be set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it happens when you import a calendar from somewhere else because the calendar file format,  if you don't specify a time zone defaults to local, which is was a rational decision at the time.  But that means if you if you if you if you got an imported calendar that's coming from an obviously place  and it doesn't specify times and that's what you get.  So it's a bargain.  The I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And just really what I really wish is that I wish I could say on these dates, I'm going to be in this time zone.  Show me there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And just listen to the time that I got.  All right. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was my for people who travel.  It's a big thing.  Steve, you know, just you know, Steve Martin was really upset about this and and begged me for a way to just say,  I just want everything in my local time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can tell the exactly that's all I want.  Give me that as an option.  Google, I'll do the subtraction.  And you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They they listen to them on iOS because he was talking about the iPhone and you can do that in iOS.  That's why I thought you might be able to do it on Google Calendar.  You can't, but you can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what I do is when I travel, I don't change the clock on my laptop, but I just let the phone change itself.  So I've got my that's another way to do it.  Sure. If you're carrying both that that and that means that that has blown me up before.  I was in New York and I was thinking I've got plenty of time.  It's like, oh, wait, I'm looking at the computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can I miss the huge reading in California because of this.  Yes, because I was six hours off because I had adjusted and then it adjusted itself and I was I totally missed a meeting.  It's amazing that and I know I know that you have to enter it by the local time.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's there's one that the one that I like in the Google thing is which is explicitly for flights is you can set the start and end time to be different time zones,  which is very handy when you when you're transferring your flights in.  So you can say I'm taking off at this time in this time zone and I'm landing at this time in this time zone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's nice. Next week, you're going to see me from Swiss time zone.  I will be in Davos. Oh, the ever love in Davos.  And I say hi, Stevie. Yes, I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, by the way, it is a feature in the Google version of the calendar.  Thanks to the J Moon in our chat room for pointing this out.  Use home time zone. Where where it's but it's not on it's only on the phone.  It's in the you know, that new calendar app that you can download the Google canonical calendar app so you don't have to use the Samsung app.  Use home time zone displays calendars and event times in your home time zone when traveling.  Traveling.  Thing your home time zone, my time zone, you could specify your home time zone, which for some reason is Seoul, Korea.  Oh, yeah, I should fix that. Probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's my hometown's GMT. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, it's defaulting to where this phone was made, I guess.  Anyway, we're a little late. You guys got to go. I know.  Jeff Jarvis, thank you so much for being here from Rhode Island.  Thanks to Bryant College for letting you use their facilities.  Bryant College, wonderful place. Good luck in Davos.
