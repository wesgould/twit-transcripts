This is the last show I do of the week  And I realized this morning  Oh, I get it all the news stories that I that I couldn't do on Mac break weekly or Windows weekly  We just we slide them down to this week in Google, so it's Facebook this Google the cloud you know  European Commission whatever we can't fit in anywhere else  Which this makes it fun and of course Jeff Jarvis is the leader of the pack he is joining us today from Germany  So no video from Jeff. We think the audio will be okay and either of the pack it is late at night there  Yeah, and I think the latency is about 20 seconds, so I'm a little worried a little worried, but we'll do our best  Jeff by the way is the new Dvorak the first about three years of  Twitter Dvorak was always the one coming in on some sort of bad line  There was one entire tweet where we couldn't hear him so he would type in the messenger you could try this Jeff  And then I would read his responses on Google Messenger  Also with us from search engine land calm Danny Sullivan always a pleasure. Thanks for joining us from  Balboa Peninsula, which sounds exotic  Indeed indeed  But it's not it's not it's San Diego basically yeah, well no Orange County Orange County

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Orange County  Between San Diego Los Angeles the forgotten city midway

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yes ladies and gentlemen Mike Elgin is on the road  But I'm so pleased to welcome him back to our microphones as they used to say in the radio days  He where are you these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Yucatan Peninsula we're all in a peninsula today. You're in the Petaluma Peninsula

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not yeah, I'm in the valley the Petaluma Valley, but hey the Yucatan  I'm in Cancun Cancun Mexico, so you're on the East Coast of Mexico. That's right after a jaunt through Cuba

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Spent a month in Cuba so jealous that was really something I tell you you you'd no stranger to Cuba

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'd stayed there before it had wonderful stories to tell was is first of all had it changed much

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's changed massively actually the  The internet is a major factor that is completely changing Cuba now even though only a minority of people can get on it  There these public Wi-Fi hotspots, you know the Communist Party supplied Wi-Fi hotspots have existed for a year now when I went in 2008  There were probably three or four Wi-Fi hotspots in the entire country, and they were all  Tourist hotels in Havana and that's what I used back then to get online and do my work and so on nowadays  There's something like 60 Wi-Fi hotspots in the country  They're slow super expensive and sometimes hard to find in some of the some of the other cities around the country  There's literally one Wi-Fi hotspot in the entire city

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so that's hard to imagine a modern country without  Ubiquitous internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They use it as a as a means of control for now. The government is really concerned about rapid  Reorientation of the country to the global stage. So they've slowly liberalized they've let people travel abroad  But this whole internet thing is something that's very scary now the way that they do it now  Part of it is a source of revenue for the government cause about two dollars and 19 cents per hour  To use the Wi-Fi we spent about three hundred dollars on Wi-Fi in in the month that we're there  But more importantly to the government when you buy these Wi-Fi cards that give you either one or five hours online  You have to show your ID they they log exactly who you are  Associated with exactly what card so when you use this Wi-Fi  Everything that I do they know that it's Mike Elgin. Holy using this connection  So it's it's a source of intimidation and control  That they don't want to give up so they don't let restaurants they don't let  nightclubs or coffee shops or  Private homes have internet connectivity for the most part some high-level government people can have dial-up broadband  But other than that they want to know they want to know that every single person exactly what they're doing online

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's you know, it's almost hard to believe that it's that's worse than China

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's far worse than China. And of course it is censored internet people think, you know  Cuba has always been a tourist destination. It's a beautiful island with amazing beaches and beautiful people  Amazing music. It's a wonderful place to visit on vacation and this gives Cuba kind of halo effect that makes  people not realize what a  Totalitarian communist dictatorship it is. In fact, we try to stay outside of the tourist bubble. We lived in regular apartments  we shopped in regular stores and  And  It's a brutal place to live for Cubans. This is why so many of them are still trying to leave even with the liberalization  It's a very very tough place. Nothing works. The infrastructure is crumbling. We  we talked to  some Canadian friends there who did an all-you-can  You know an all-inclusive resort package in one of these high-end resorts in Veradera  They charge exactly as much as you charge at any other country  And yet they didn't have water for four days off  They didn't we were in an apartment where the the water went out in the apartment and the only way we  Restored water is the Airbnb host that was renting to us  Paid somebody to bring a truck and fill the cisterns for the whole building and that was the only way he'd get us water  The rest of the people in the building were very grateful for that  But but Cuba is is a mess because of the restrictive government. They have two currencies  People are incredibly poor and  They have food rationing and so on. It's a very very very tough place to live and they definitely need  Google they need the internet and  I'm afraid that it may be a while before they really actually get online in any sort of meaningful way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's such an eye-opener, you know, we we you know people say first we're world problems and stuff  But you really don't really appreciate that what that means  Until you hear stories like this, you know when we're all worried about all Google's watching what I do  Internet and that's nothing compared to what people in Cuba are putting up with how much of  Their poverty and suffering though is because of sanctions from the US

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's it's difficult to say I've talked to a lot of well-educated Cubans while I was there because I never quite understood it  I mean Google excuse me Cuba trades with China. They trade with Italy they trade with  Most US allies really they trade with most of the world freely theoretically  most of their problems are about the US control the international banking system and  So they can't raise money very easily  But my sense is that the vast majority of their economic problems are the result of the fact that most businesses are owned by the government  There's no choice. There's no competition government bureaucracies are notoriously inefficient  You go to the store and it's not like oh should I buy this kind of  Cooking oil or should I buy Western oil or should I buy Crisco?  Should I this that the other thing?  No, you go there and it's this is the one brand that you have and it's a brand that's owned by the government  almost everything is owned by the government and so any any country that has tried to  Run the entire economy has ended up being extremely poor now  Cuba is very lucky in two ways in terms of their economic situation  They have three point five million tourists now coming to the island dropping like we spent four thousand dollars in four weeks  And which is a good deal  But for Cuba that must be a ton of money, right? It's a ton of money. I mean and and they also Cuba also  Essentially takes money that is earned by the the public for example, we know one person who worked for another government  I won't specify the government because I don't want to get anywhere near  identifying that this person was but he worked for a  Western government in an office inside of Anna and he was paid and I don't know some regular salary probably  $2500 a month  The Cuban government takes all that and then pays him $30 a month  That's how it works. Oh, thank you. They just take money for everything  They the the the Cuban government nickels and dimes every single thing they can get for example, if you take a bus  Across the country in Cuba as all the tourists do it's one of the best ways to get around  They have bathrooms in the bus  They're Korean buses and they lock the buses and then they stop at these rest stops and they charge you up to a dollar  something to use the bathroom  Little things like that. They're always and that's you know, of course that's going directly to the Castro administration

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and so is Castro and his family getting rich who I mean what  What happens to all this money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's it's a it's it's sort of backwards from the way things normally work. I don't think  The Castros claim that they live like ordinary Cubans. I think for the most part that's mostly true. They're not living in  Saddam Hussein stout palaces for sure. They don't seem to be living high high on the hog  but the way things normally work is you have people have private businesses they make lots of money and then they're taxed and  Governments get their money through taxation primarily in Cuba. There's no real taxation  They basically just take the money directly. And so in order to fund the whole government on a very  Small GDP, I mean they don't produce much except sugar and rum and a few other things  and they have tourism and they have a lot of  Remittances from Cubans in the US just sending money to relatives. That's another source a multi-billion dollar source of revenue for the country  They just have to take money where everything get it. It's a terrible system. It doesn't work. They're unable to keep up with  The crumbling infrastructure there they can barely keep people fed  People are always on the brink of like, you know hunger almost everybody it's a fairly equitable fairly equitable system  It's especially compared to this says that everybody's suffering equally  Everybody's suffering. I mean, you know people are not actually starving  But you go to the store and you know  There'd be big shortages and outages of things here there and the other thing and it's kind of like the old Soviet Union if there's  A line for me you get in it and you find out what they're selling later  If there's a line it must be good  But you have that you had this big surge in tourism was really interesting to see with Obama there and  Lots of people from all over the world including the US but also Europe and Canada all the usual suspects came rushing  Into into Cuba and they just don't have the market mechanisms to respond to demand  So there are all these stories about how Cuba was running out of beer  And they're running out of water and they're running out of these simple things purely through distribution and manufacturing  Which you know in a capitalist economy?  There are all kinds of mechanisms to satisfy that demand  I mean, you know Walmart has a super computer predict when there would be rushes on water and they make sure they stock it early  And all this no that stuff exists. They just run out of stuff. And so they even ran out of Wi-Fi cards  It was a couple of days  Right after Obama's visit where you couldn't you couldn't use the internet because you couldn't buy the cards  It's not because they had a lack of capacity with the Wi-Fi  They physically didn't get the cards to the places that sold the cards weird stuff like that. You just would never think of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is it's kind of shocking and it just shows you a cent even in a small island relatively small island a centralized  Planned economy doesn't work  It's just  Fascinating do you think the removal of trade barriers is going to change things? It sounds like  It's there's still a long way to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah, I mean it I don't think people quite understand the the  The how far behind Cuba really is I mean one of the things that Cuban the Cuba is  really excited about about the removal trade barriers is  It's a very aggric agricultural based economy and  There you still using tractors from the 40s and the 30s

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw all the pictures that you posted of Cuban transportation a continuing series

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, one of the yeah, one of the first things that  Was sort of liberalized was there is a company in the United States that can actually provide parts for these ancient tractors  And the Cubans are super excited about that  They're not they're not they can't even think about modern tractors and if you think about tractors tractors amazingly high-tech now  They're almost self-driving. They they're incredibly computer. They just want to fix the ones they've got  They just want to fix the one from 1935 Wow, it's broken and they need you know  So it's they've got a long long way to go and this is one of the barriers in which  Cuban government is well aware of is they have two currencies  There's a currency for locals and then there's a currency for tourists. I did not know that  Yeah  My wife calls the the the one for locals the people's peso. It's not what it's called  But it's fun to call them peepees and sometimes we have those and we use those to buy things  and then if you're if you're a tourist you use kooks CU sees and  Those are tied to the dollar and so on but the the the average Cuban wage is between 15 and 30 dollars a month a  Month Leo, they're so the economic disparity with the rest of the world is so out of whack that well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that puts a $2 Wi-Fi card into perspective. I mean you're not gonna buy that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. Yep  And so there's a dual economy now of people who have friends and relatives in the US who can send them iPhones and  Then there's people who couldn't imagine ever having an iPhone  Yeah, and so it's it's got a long way to go  The government is aware that it's an unworkable problem and they're also aware that  Sort of they're kept in power by this cult of personality around the Castros. How old Castro is in his 80s?  Fidel Castro is in his 90s. That's not gonna last too long. So they're struggling first for solutions  they don't want to give up power who does and  You know  Meanwhile the Cuban people are championing at the bit to move forward and join the world as a liberalized economy  I think that theoretically, you know two of the achievements they talk about with the revolution or the education system and the health care system  I can't speak  directly about  Whether or not they have successfully done those things, but they seem to have a they have high literacy  They have 99% literacy, which is really great. That's amazing. A lot of people who speak English  So they have lots of engineers. So  Theoretically, you know in a capitalist world the the sort of the jobs rush to the low end or the market where you have high  Education and low wages so Cuba could become like this new Singapore or what China was a few years ago something  Potentially if the government would just allow it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you when you hear about this poverty and this desperate such circumstances and then you read stories about the lung cancer  Vaccine for instance that Cuba's had for years you wonder how such a thing could happen  And you really feel for the people and I  Do hope that something can can happen for them make their lives better. What a tragedy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I do recommend that everybody visit Cuba if you can  It's gonna change but maybe  But it's it's  It's a it's an interest. It was a really fascinating place to go because again, we really tried to live like Cubans  We lived in regular apartments. We shopped in regular stores  We made a lot of friends we had a lot of candid conversations one thing that's very different now when we're 2008  Everybody's scared to death to say anything to us and now people are just openly  Out loud and so there's a lot of boldness. There's a sense that things are changing and I think they are good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I don't know if they were much better under Batista. I mean he was pretty corrupt  himself and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and there were multiple  Revolutions in right in the in the 20th century and the US invaded several times was not a great  Situation there's just got to be a way for Cuba to have its independence to have a certain amount of equality  but also I mean one of the shocking things I  Mentioned before the show that I went to the Rolling Stones the Rolling Stones came  To Havana for the first time and I didn't realize this aspect of it  But everybody was talking about this because only a few years ago it was illegal to even listen to the Rolling Stones  You know popular music was literally illegal. You could literally go to jail for having an album or a CD with music on it and  That that's a degree of repression. That is just pretty outrageous  So this whole Rolling Stones event was just like wow, it's a new world, you know  There were actual  Cubans saying from now on will will measure everything that as being before or after the Rolling Stones isn't that interesting Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mike Elgin who's just off a month in Cuba. He's now in Mexico and Cancun if you want to follow Mike's travels  He's back to the parapetetic Mike Elgin  We we know and love if you want to follow his travels, of course on Google Plus  You're still posting there and I noticed a lot of them are is everything making it to Facebook as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook and Twitter. Yeah, and you have a blog now and I have a blog called becoming nomad calm  it's sort of a site about the digital nomad lifestyle and  It's a combination of observations tips things. I've learned  things have gone through so it's more of a  specific narrow focus on the  Digital, you know living abroad as a digital nomad. Yeah for anybody who's interested in that sort of thing must read and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Continue to follow Mike and I'm hoping that you will continue to be places with some internet so we can  Get you on our shows. We missed having you although I I hope so too. I really there's hot dogs a staple apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In our first Airbnb came with breakfast and they were feeding us hot dogs every morning for breakfast  It was kind of like why are we having hot dogs every day? It's considered a legitimate  Meat or meat by products a gourmet treat. Are you kidding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is you can put anything in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at the cars though, and of course  While we think oh, this is wonderful. They're keeping these beautiful cars these vintage cars alive. This is what they have  This is it. Yeah  We're gonna take it we're gonna take a break Danny  I thank you for being patient while we caught up with Mike's travels around the world. Isn't it fascinating though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just I don't I'd like to go there  It's always weird for me because you know my wife's tradition we lived in Britain for 12 years and you would walk down the streets and  Especially in Britain going on holiday or vacation such a big industry that like on the main street  There's always these tourism shops  There's all these places you could go and there'd always be things like trips to Cuba and I'd always be like what I mean  You know because you couldn't go there if you're in the US and and you would realize wow  Everybody else is going over there. It's weird that we couldn't go to this island  Like you know 90 miles next to us so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really didn't realize the depth of poverty and repression  That was going on there. I mean it sounds almost as bad as North Korea. It sounds really  horrific and so I appreciate the the update Mike and we will cut we will get back to  Matters of the Internet. It's just it feels so  Shallow to talk about the kinds of things we normally talk about  You know whining about various minor minor inconveniences on the Internet  When you hear about  My Wi-Fi didn't work yesterday. Yeah gosh darn it cannot get a good Wi-Fi signal in the gym  The jacuzzi

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know what is it always impresses me is the spirit of humanity to even through such a horrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean the 50 years 60 years  The human spirit survives and a beautiful people  Who have managed to survive in you know, just very challenging circumstances  It kind of is and one last thing leo on on Cuba if I may along those lines the the desire to have the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is so strong in Cuba that one of the ways they get it is on a thumb drive  There's a there's this type of business called the weekly packet you subscribe to it  It costs a couple bucks a week and you everyone has to pay to get it  A couple bucks a week and you every week you get a new thumb drive to give me the old thumb drive  They give you the new one and on that thumb drive or Netflix movies YouTube videos  There's a kind of Cuban Craigslist with listings on it  There's a just a mishmash of the kinds of things people would get on the Internet  It's like a slow offline Internet and it's very very popular  It's the main way that people get Internet content and even if they don't have the isn't that fascinating a sneaker net

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, people want the Internet and I you know, I don't blame them I don't blame them. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most of cards is very popular in Cuba. You're kidding. No  You get it on the little thumb drive every week this new episode

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow  What is it the weekly packet the weekly packet? Yeah, but who can afford it if it's that much

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People are willing to pay it  Yeah, it's it's it's it's a valuable link link to the outside bucks a month is like a 30-year income. That's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Danny it's what is it in the state 60 70 percent for?  Search market Google search market share. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and you know, it's estimated to be around 60 to 70 percent

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if you why is it 90 percent in in Europe because

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Microsoft's not even trying. Yeah, I mean, you know  They're literally not even trying there if you go over there and you try to use a version of Bing  they usually don't have the latest features that have been added to it or the country specific stuff is not even there and you know,  the  French search engines that were supposed to get funding and challenge Google didn't and so, you know, it's just become  Become de facto because there's just no one really doing that with the exception of Russia, which is in the EU, of course  But you know, that's that that's really been it  They just wiped out the competition and it was much harder for anybody to challenge Yahoo  You know which in the US was a counter to Google for a very long period of time had been weaker in in Europe as well  You know and and each individual market smaller too, right?  You know, so it's like, you know who you're gonna fight it out in in France or Germany or the UK and so on so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is this is how this is how Microsoft is fighting it this whole  It's kind of because of Microsoft's prompting research  Yeah, your search is the complainer in this case and fair search is a Microsoft lobbying organization  That exists to take down Google in every way and possibly and oracles involved in others. Well, it was backed by Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was never entirely Microsoft and actually Microsoft has pulled out a fair shirt search now  Yeah, yeah, they're not they they apparently are not and I think well their job is done  Exactly, I mean there's no doubt that Microsoft helped make this happen in some ways  It's sort of like turnabout is fair play because in 2009 Google was really hammering away and before that about  Microsoft and Internet Explorer and you're so dominant on the mobile app  You're so dominant on the desktop that you shouldn't be able to let people choose what their browser is or their search  You know, and that's the reason why and I think it's still run to this day that in in the EU  You know Windows computer will ask you to pick your search to find provider  when you turn it on and it starts up and so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, not you. Well, not only your search provider your browser because that was the sorry your brow  Yeah, there's the brow we call it the browser ballot and where they say which browser would you like to be your default?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that was that's over now that just ended but and right but Google really pushed for that, you know  Google was like yeah  We need to have this because there's two dominant and so now Google is gonna be taken up in part by  The same kind of actions it took against Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and also, I mean if you want to mention Microsoft  This is very similar to the Department of Justice's suits against Microsoft in the late 90s  Claiming the same thing dominant market share used to promote their a new market in the in the browser  And that's exactly what the EU is saying is because Google has market share of 90%  They are using their their position in search to force people to use Google in the Android operating system force  Google is the default search in the Android operating system  The Play Store accounts for 90% of apps downloaded on Android devices  So manufacturers have to you know for commercial reasons pre-install the Play Store  And for that reason Android users are less likely to use other stores  So the the Commission

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although that's confusing right because it's part of what it's called success if you ask me  But 90% of Android devices, but are they talking about Android?  Devices are they talking about Android open source project devices and when they say Android in that instance to say 90%

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're saying probably licensed Android devices. Oh really? Oh interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They probably mean both because you're not going to be a licensed Android device without having Google play on it  It's part of the licensing process the Commission seeks to ensure they say that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Manufacturers are free to choose which apps they pre-install on their devices  Although just as with Microsoft consumer choice has always existed  But it's the tyranny of the default because Google search is the default Google browser is the default

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  although although interestingly here, it's like it I  Could just go on a rant about this whole thing go ahead do it Danny do it so  First of all we have to start off like there's no question Google is dominant in search  Alright and so Google is vulnerable and has already had actions against it in search because it has such a dominance and you can do the  Arguments like well other people do different things or whatever  But you know it's widely accepted that when you have dominance in a particular market if you have a monopoly  It's not necessarily illegal to have the monopoly  But it's that you may have special circumstances that you have to follow to ensure that there's competition  So Google at 90% in search is already vulnerable in Europe that it needs to do special things  And certainly the EU ruled that when it came to regular search, but then they start trying to go into well  and how can we try to  Somehow curtail them in search when it comes to Android and so they do this bizarre thing of saying well  They have like 90% of the licensed  Mobile operating system market. It's like  What like 90 but they don't you don't pay Google unless I've missed it somewhere  You don't pay Google a licensing fee Google doesn't make money directly off of you becoming an Android provider and  Anybody could be a licensed thing, but they provided Android said here's this platform you want to use it  You can use it you want to actually call it Android as a trademark  Then it's going to be licensed Android and you have to install this Google stuff  But still you know you don't have to do it you can go out and buy your own thing  But so so this product that no one actually has to buy suddenly they say well  You have a monopoly of this free product people use so now we want to restrict it more because  Manufacturers should be able to do what they want right but  Apple doesn't have any of these restrictions, right?  There's no there's no argument in here that says well Apple shouldn't be able to shove  Watch on its device or shove a podcast down your throat or shove pages down your throat or shove any of the other  Apple crap it wants to on iOS that you cannot install  Because apparently if you're the manufacturer of a device you can do whatever the hell you want, but if you are this bizarre  Majority licensee of this third-party thing that we don't even make money off of and nobody has to use it  But they decide to use it anyway because they're too lazy to build their  Cynogen or whatever the hell you want to call it type of operating system and do it well  Then we're gonna say well  No  that's bad because  Bundling is bad because manufacturers should be able to do what they want because manufacturers may want to shove their own crap down somebody's throat  Rather than yours crap down the throat even though they didn't build things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we're gonna wait a minute and I agree with you, but I'm gonna  but wait a minute because one of the things the Commissioner is saying is that when you and  Consumers want it pre-install Google's proprietary apps on your version of Android as part of the license agreement  Google says you have to sign an anti-fragmentation agreement and  Commit not to sell devices  Running on Android forks you can't sell AOSP if you're gonna sell a licensed version  so Samsung can't do right both a  Google you know  Play store version and then one without like by the way Amazon does  because  They don't they call it there any fragmentation agreement the EU says well  That's proof that Google's forcing manufacturers into using its market share and demand from consumers into its proprietary corner, right?  Which you know it's your but you but I agree with you because  Google did the right thing which is they made it an open source operating system that anybody could use they offered  Play Google services as as you know come on. Maybe they should drop this anti-fragmentation agreement

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that is kind of there's a lot of things that they could do  I mean yeah, I agree with you on the ante when they started doing that because a  Lot of this is coming back to haunt Google for its own  Two-faced talking on Android first Android's open source and anybody can use it then it turns out  Androids is not open source anybody can use it Android if you want to call it Android means you have to do all this  Licensing stuff to get the Android trademark otherwise you can't call it Android  Which is why Apple stuff does not call it was why the Amazon?  Devices don't call themselves Android because they're not Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know now Kendall is not is Kendall is not Android under the surface  We know that but it's not Android Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Branded Android so they started doing this stuff where it was like well everybody should get together because open is always good because that's Google's  Go-to thing whenever they're behind on something well, we'll declare it open  Let me defend a better thing, but then once they get the dominance in an area open is no longer open anymore  And now we're in this bizarre world where well Android is open, but it's not open because we do this licensing  But you don't have to do it you can do this stuff over here so on the one hand  They've confused it on the other hand you is coming back being just as confusing with the whole thing and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the time this is all resolved it'll be probably moot as it was with Microsoft  Yeah, and you have this and then you have this stupid browser ballot for ten more years  It it just confuses the hell out of people and serves no real purpose

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's exciting too because let's just let's just jump ahead and talk about all right  Let's say you come up with your solution and the solution the main thing that they're pushing here  They don't like search being shoved down. They don't like Google search being shoved through Android, right?  That's been the main thing that they put in here, so let's do a ballot box of search providers. You have to have in the EU  Okay, that but but let's what is the choice being your choice will be yahoo  being

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And being friends they want I want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  France has their own don't they Mike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, their France wants a mandate in addition to alternatives to Google that you have a French search engine in other news  There's a French search engine

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  France did have a French search engine, and it was called name that I can't remember  But it was a homegrown search engine. They ended up letting it sold to AOL  I'll see if I can find the name with it from there, so  But even if you do that search engine  There's an excellent chance that some of these other search engines will end up being powered by Google. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, duck duck. Go. It's still Google right?  Yeah, is duck duck. Go Google or is it a is it a hodgepodge of other stuff?  Think is being actually I was being but it's but a sanitize whatever it is. It's a sanitized version, so there's no  Information about your search is fed back to the origin

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't have their own crawler yet that they say they're working on one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the thing when you start changing around search engine by the way the French search engine the French private search engine is quant  And I think they actually do that's right  I think they actually do run their own crawling because I remember talking with one of the principles on it last year when I was out  In France, so but here's the real problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody wants anything but Google because Google's the bet is better than all these alternatives

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the customers especially in Europe yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, European public loves Google more than any other public. That's why they have 90% market share. That's right. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mean it'll give some of these other providers a better chance and give them maybe the ability to  To actually make a serious go of it if they really wanted to because right now  Why would you I mean seriously?  Why would you think I'm going to try to compete with Google?  Because to build up that kind of an infrastructure that you need to crawl the web as the core part of competing with them is  difficult and  Then to try to capture the market share like you need some degree of market share to go with it, right?  So this kind of thing could benefit some of those companies and it might not be bad  I mean, it's nice to have competition in search  It's nice to have Google feel like there's things that they need to be stepped up  And so, you know going back to you know, the idea that there's a 90% thing  They probably could have just said enough that you have a 90% share and you don't we're gonna impose this on Android anyway  Right, but when they come in with all this other bizarre stuff like and of course, you know  You're the dominant third party licensing provider and you're like what you don't even need to do that and then your argument. It's just weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's quant by the way, you can use quant qw a NT  Com you can use in the United States they show you hot trends Donald Trump Elizabeth the second I hop and Chrissy Teigen's bus line  I'm not let me let's search for something. Let's search for what should we search for Mike Elgin?  Do you let's see if they know about you?  Yeah, look at is that you Mike in the sailor suit picture. That's a picture of my dad  But at least you know, I did a good I did a good job it found a lot of Mike Elgin  Your food and technology podcast articles by Mike Elgin on computer world Facebook LinkedIn  Pretty good job, huh?  I'm switching you're well known in in France  Here's videos  Look at that. Oh, there's one mostly twitch stuff. It's all twitch stuff. Well, you don't do videos, right?  Let's see Danny Sullivan. I  mean, I  Guess you could you I mean, I just don't see a lot of people wanting to use squat even in France probably right  There you are, oh of course I found the race car driver  But you're mixed in with a race car driver. Just had his anniversary

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did he really well they had some f1. I know this because people were congratulating me on Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're kind of inextricably entwined now  I just look at what the EU did with cookies and I feel like that's a really good example of how  All of this is really gonna end up with something that makes no one happy solves. No problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's there's nothing as enjoyable than every time I go to a website having to shut that damn window telling me  There's this cookie. Yeah, and what did they really did a great job there good good for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  I mean if you if people are listening and don't understand what we're talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Meanwhile when I'm watching Sky TV and I change the channels sky doesn't tell me every time you go to a channel and by the way  We're monitoring everything you watch and we'll use that for however we want

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's insane  If when you go to sites most met and now it is every site because if you want to do business in Europe you have  To do this. There's a big banner the first time you visit that says hey, we use cookies. Is that okay? Yeah, that's okay  Click that it's just annoying doesn't solve any problem  costs money to implement

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sometimes it feels like the EU is just  Hyper conservative about anything any sort of new business model any sort of new thing  They just like wait a minute. Wait a minute. We can't have a new thing  I mean to a very large extent if you take a 10,000 foot view of Google's  Business model around Android. It's just a different business model  Yes, we gain dominant market share by giving away this great operating system on all these phones and the business model is we get the manufacturers  To bundle these apps people launch the apps and we move money from advertising. That's just the business model  They don't like that business model because it doesn't match or map  Against anything that is understood or well-known  But it's it seems like a pretty straightforward business model the OEMs are in a position where they can choose alternatives  my Samsung phone has

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Prioritized the Samsung browser not Chrome  They do use Google as a search but I but if they didn't I would immediately change it anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the companies that do try to do innovative things with signage and modern all these other things with you know  with the exception of the Amazon  Alternative user interfaces and so on they're routinely rejected by the public who say we want we want Virgin  Vanilla Android that's what we want

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, but I mean the biggest selling Android device you have right now is from Samsung unless I'm off the mark outside  It's the outside of China right and there's no way that that's a pure device it's full of crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Number one in terms of the second biggest one, but in terms of a market share. It's a tiny percentage, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually it's less but here but Danny it's less full of crap than ever  in other words, they're feeling market pressure to tone down touch was to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Verizon phone my friends Verizon. That's the  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Agree with you on that Verizon loads it up with crap  iPhone does not have that crap on it. No, well Apple had some you remarkable market cloud that probably has dwindled somewhat

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but but I you know, I do think that I  Do think it's very easy to be in the US and just go. Oh those Europeans are crazy  They just hate all innovation blah blah blah blah. I do think that there are you know some serious concerns  They have that Google's market share in search is much higher than in the US, right?  There really is no alternative out there that people are using and and that that raises obvious concerns to begin with you  You have those concerns about anything that happens regardless when something's that especially when it comes to how people seek information

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are that's true. I mean, you know Facebook it was had to say oh we  We  Despite what Mark Zuckerberg said at f8 against Donald Trump  We're not going to try to throw the election and and the fact the even fact that they had to say that shows that people  Are aware of the cloud that Facebook and Google the the dominant players have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, how long before Facebook does decide they  Wants Google right and the fact that Google's far less dominant in other regions other countries proved that if they wanted  Alternatives they would choose those alternatives

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A lot of the European countries and people do want Google  But I think that you actually have significant a number of people in Europe  I'm not saying the majority but I think a significant number of people who have serious concerns about  The only search tool that I have is this thing that I have concerns about what's going on with my privacy and my tracking  And it's tied into my phone and maybe I don't want to use Google  But how do I get to a good alternative to that because I think the privacy concerns in the EU are much higher  You know in public concerns and then I think you have to add on top of the fact that there's a political aspect to this  Both among people and among the politicians that are reacting to it or leading it which is you know  Google's an American company and you've got this American company with this big huge dominance. It's out there and do we like that?  That is that good and I think if you flipped it around and if you were told that the  Largest search engine in in America was owned by China and a Chinese company  You might have some people who would have concerns about it or being worried about it might be thinking well  Maybe there's other things we need to maybe we need to address this and maybe we need to address it on the  Anti-trust ground type of things and then there's no doubt that there's gonna be politicians that see this as a way for them to score  They don't know, you know, sorry  but you know  European politicians are any different than American politicians where sometimes they're doing stuff because they think it's the right thing to do and sometimes  Just doing stuff because it's the right thing for them to to score a big victory in what they're doing  Yeah, so, you know, it's kind of messy  But you know it I don't think you can entirely dismiss what the EU is doing as it's just just all ridiculous  I think they've got some serious concerns, especially with some of these licensing agreements that Google ties into Android  But I do think some of the other stuff and how they try to position it seemed to be very laughable and and I guess  That's what concerns me the most is that  Do you really think it's an issue that  Manufacturers should be able to put whatever they want on their phones  Or is it really that your concern is that when manufacturers can't put what they want that doesn't help users which in turn sells  Competition and then if that's the concern then really what you ought to be doing is addressing default installations on any device  Like I'd be cheering from the roof if the EU said right now, you know what?  Nobody who makes a cell phone can force you to have applications stay on that phone  Oh, yeah  There you go  The consumer has a right to uninstall and pick and choose and put whatever they want on it and moreover  You need to make it really clear when you tell somebody that you're gonna set something as a default while you're doing it  So if Apple wants to make sure that spotlight is by default going over to Bing  You know you understand that and and in addition to that you understand that they're doing it because they're getting paid a  Crap load of money to make it happen  That's one of the things I actually wrote to the FTC here in the US about three years ago  You know I sent a formal letter saying we have these deals in the US  They happen and the consumers have no idea why they're happening and who's paying whom for what going on  And maybe you ought to be looking at how that kind of disclosure house, but they don't care so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  dimension to this that I think bears  Pointing out is that  It feels oftentimes like  The EU is always complaining about American tech companies  But the reality is that it's mostly American tech companies complaining to the EU  Who then respond to those American companies by going after the other American companies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's mostly the that's not a that I think these stores. They're just a pawn in your game  Well you know there's some merit to what the EU says and and I think Google's  Smartest thing Google could do at this point would be to respond to attempt to settle  They have a few weeks to do so I think four months three or four months to do that  And of course what their response has been  That the UC Davis strategy is Danny Sullivan called it to release a bunch of news today  So so that would be buried in the Google search results  Google search result

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean they they might just decide to drag it out as long as they can because as you say long you drag it  Out the more that by the time you get to a requirement in the settlement  The more it may not make any deal difference, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly exactly. Hey, what happened by the way? We we've lost Jeff Jarvis. He he had to bow out because the quality was  Connection in Germany was so bad that he couldn't he couldn't weigh in  He he'd have to respond 30 seconds later, and that wasn't wasn't gonna work, but I'm really glad we still have a mic  in Mexico and Cancun and Danny Sullivan from  Orange County  What's the story with the Google transparency report because yesterday?  When I went to the safe browsing site status and search for google.com. It said somewhat dangerous now. It's not dangerous talk about  Transparency did they just change their settings or was it mistake when they said they were somewhat dangerous

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know my guess it was some kind of a glitch. I mean you remember once Google blocked  Got it. I think in Google search results. They blocked all Google or something  There's that period of time when suddenly everybody had to use Yahoo, and they had this big spike off of it. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, which is half these things happen. It must have been a little embarrassing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't I don't think they went through and deliberately said oh, we're bad. Just go change it  So we're not bad. I suspect that if there was something that was wrong  They figured out what it was and then tried to fix it. Well, and it does say some pages on this website

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's the the actual site safety details don't don't appear to have changed some pages on this website install malware and visitors computers  That's because it's a search engine  So you may search to sites that do that some pages on this website redirect visitors to dangerous websites  including Google groups  Dangerous websites have been sending visitors to this website. So people link to google.com and that's considered a  Black mark. So none of that has changed just the overall  Status which is now not dangerous from somewhat dangerous  So I I think there's a little status. Oh, they're not dangerous. Yeah. Yeah not  Most mostly harmless would be nice. It was it was 2009

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've got the tech cringe article we had one as well, but it was like Google flags whole internet as malware  So whenever you searched on Google every site on Google, I remember that this may harm your computer  And if you listen really helped Yahoo that that day they got they got a significant rise

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah stuff happens again not far wrong. I think the internet is really much as a malware haven  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think we can we can move on to less  controversial  Topics new things well unless you want to say if you want to talk about the article  Why I won't live in Google Alphabet's tech utopia

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't exist yeah, and even if it did exist you don't even know what would be in it  That was this is based on that weird article that Google the alphabet wants to build a city  Wants to build a city you felt like you should write a clickbait article anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is clickbait based on also why will not live in heaven

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Next

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although to be honest if if if Google Alphabet did build a city I would move into it in a heartbeat

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Well, who wouldn't want to you know what? I've bet that they like giving you a free house and everything  Yeah, I should think oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would have high-speed internet it would have  Autonomous vehicles it would have green roofs. This comes from the ads everywhere. It would have well any kitchens  There's a price to be paid. You know kitchens cuz you're gonna eat out every night  This is this comes from the recode you say Danny that this recode article in the first place was clickbait

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no that one's not okay, that's that's a report like here's and that's actually a report off of the alphabet article, right?  Right. So that's like here. They're planning to do this thing. We don't really know much about it  So then but to me is like why I won't live in this thing. We barely know anything about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so it all it all goes back to the  exclusive piece and the information by Jessica lesson  alphabet sidewalk labs is  Is considering not a city but a futuristic  district  project sidewalk  They've been working with a hundred advisors on a plan for a standalone digital district  Which would mark one of the most high-profile attempts at a dedicated technology testbed. Please Google if you're listening I  Volunteer you got to have some old people  Can't all be Millennials living there  Somebody's got to slow traffic down by crossing the street at a snail's pace I volunteer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of the original intention of Epcot Center  Which if you look at the old videos of Walt Disney rolling out the vision  What they ended up with was very different from what they intended to and partly because Walt Disney died

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But last time I was at Epcot. I took a picture of the tele the telephone booth of the future  This is an alternative future that I think is not going to happen  that's how it's why it's so hard to predict the future because  I think nobody would have predicted maybe somebody would have the  Ascendance of the pocket computer and its ubiquity and its total addictive nature  I don't think anybody really knew that that was coming ten years ago, let alone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Google should buy an existing town like Detroit. Why not?  Yeah, put hyperloop transportation. Yeah, you know flying

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Elon needs to buy it with Google. They did have that contest where some town renamed themselves Google or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but that was to get Google a fiber. Yeah, it didn't work. By the way, they didn't get it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think they named themselves back? I'm sure they can come up with a  I'm sure they can come up with a city to buy here there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Made in New York and our chat room is suggesting that Google's prototype community of tomorrow should be called goop cut

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're leaning toward Europe France in the UK as boring and delicious as that sounds but yeah, we're we're not sure right now  Cancun is actually a great place because it's a hub to the Caribbean to South America  We have a couple of trips planned coming back to the United States as well. So  Who knows could be could be just about anywhere. We'll be here for at least a couple of months. So damn jealous

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just really I'm and I'm happy for you because at least somebody gets to do that  Oh  So much more to talk about let's take a break and come back with more than we can talk about Facebook's  frustrating and useless chatbots I  Haven't talked to you about f8 and chatbots yet Mike's I'm curious what you take is on all of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I can't wait to tell you wait to find out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our show they brought to you by  Automatic love my automatic got one right here  See turns out every car not in Cuba you can't use this in Cuba, but every car built since 1996  Has a OBD or on board diagnostic port right under the steering wheel. It's open. It's available  It's not illegal to plug into it  I think most of us just look at and go that's for the technician when he's gonna, you know fix my car  But you know it can be used for a lot more when you attach the automatic suddenly you've got the quantified  Car this just plugs right into it and it integrates with so many things you get real-time performance data  So your first thing you do is install the automatic app on your phone  Android or iOS it pairs via Bluetooth and  Now you're gonna get all sorts of performance data  You can actually look at the temperature of your engine as you're driving  You can get audio alerts signaling that you've stepped on the gas too hard or you're braking too hard  Or you're going too fast that helps you become a better driver a more efficient driver to their commute  analyzer determines when you should leave for your destination and  How you could save money by making your commute more efficient seeing how much a drive to the store cost and gasoline is really great  And it's real time. It's based on where you got gas last and the amount of gas your engines using  It's really accurate the dashboard web app provides granular information  Let's you export trips and then you could tie it into other things so I have it automatically for instance via if this than that  Porting out my every trip to an Evernote notebook keeping track of where I go and it has the map  It has the distance has information about how I drove a score associated with it also works with the Amazon Echo  Yeah, it's so cool. You can ask the automatic how much gas is in my tank  Nest so it can turn the thermostat up when you're on your way home your mechanics  So you could figure out what those lights mean on the dashboard  It'll work with fresh books and  Expensify and concur so you can keep track of business mileage  automatically  It's and if you have a teenager  This is the best thing you can get you had they have apps that will integrate  To help your teenager be a better driver and help you keep track of what your teenagers doing in your car  They've even got 24 7 crash response  So you can feel secure knowing automatic is keeping you and your loved ones safe at all times on the road  Apple watch a pebble integration as well and none of this requires a monthly fee  You just have to buy the automatic normally that's 99.95, but we have a special offer code twit  TWIT they'll save you 20 percent automatic comm slash twit and  Use the offer code to it to save 20% off the regular purchase price I  Got two I got one for Lisa and one for me. I love the automatic  automatic dot com slash twit and if you follow my chief twit bot on  Twitter or on telegram  That's how I give you the notifications when I pull up out front  You'll get a notification Leo is pulled up that's using if this than that and an automatic  It knows when I've turned off my ignition within a certain area on the map and tweets for me and posts to the telegram bot  I love that kind of thing is all the sky's the limit  automatic comm  slash twit  Mike Elgin is here. He's visiting us again from his jaunts around the world Danny Sullivan from search engine land as well  Let's talk about f8. Were you able to see any of the f8 conference Mike or read about it? No way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, not not from Cuba, but I read all about it when I got back  Yeah, you know I was a huge cheerleader for bots when they first came out  I was as you know  I think it was on this show maybe a month and a half ago that I recommended x.ai  Which is got the Amy bot that interacts via email and so on  But what what's bothering me about the whole bot hype thing is the degree to which it's being viewed as an alternative to?  apps  Companies are frustrated because their app is hard to discover and even if people install it they forget about it  it's hard to get  Make an app that's both discovered and sticky and they're saying that bots are the solution because you don't have to install anything  It's just there you just chat and so on  The problem is that I think bots are going to be in aggregate far worse than apps  Individually if you just look at the 1-800 flowers  Bot you think oh I could order you know I just want a dozen roses sent to my mother a Mother's Day  Okay, that sounds like a good  Application for a bot but what happens when all the florists are on and and there are dozens of thousands of  Bots how do you find them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you remember to use and everyone you use is now kind of be kind of sending you spam messages, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, and the the the flawed logic behind the hype around bots is that hey everybody's doing messaging  So that's where the eyeballs are we'll just go to where the eyeballs are and then we'll succeed because that's where everybody is  That's odd logic because people go to messaging because it's free of spam because it's free of visuals and complexity and hype and  marketing and once  That starts being asserted in on the chat platforms and the messaging apps  It's it if users can't do anything about it. They'll just wander away to some other medium. It'll ruin  Messaging as a as a friendly medium. I just don't see how  Bots are gonna. It's essentially going back to a command line interface  You have to know the command to launch the well there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Spots have buttons so that you you know that I mean the buttons are gonna be critical  But I have to say I had to CNN bought on for a while and I turn it off. It just was annoying  There's a great article Katie Natopoulos writing in BuzzFeed six things that definitely sucked about Facebook's new shopping  But she just wanted some shoes and it kept trying to upsell her she said it was kind of like that annoying  Salesperson who's saying oh you look great in this  She said I want sneakers under a hundred bucks it offered her five hundred dollars sneakers  And it just I mean it goes  These are a bit more expensive at 120 bucks, but I think they're really great for summer  It even said things like you know  I think this is really really a great-looking shoe, and she's saying who I who a bot  How do you know do you have feet the whole thing is really annoying no customer reviews?  And if she says I asked the bot to tell me the customer rating for a pair of sunglasses they replied  They don't have review yet reviews yet, but quote we hear good things from whom I might ask from whom your bot friends  And  Furthermore you have to enter your credit card it doesn't for I guess for reasonable reasons  It doesn't save your Facebook even though Facebook knows all sorts of things including  If you've signed up for things like the Facebook pay feature and messaging your credit card that won't use it though  So you have to this is a good interface manually enter your credit card number into the messaging  That's gonna. That's gonna go well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'm more positive although first I have to say Leo that was such a good pitch. I just ordered one of those  Did you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Will they never will they never stop working  Thank you, thank you very much stay tuned  I'll have other things for you to buy later on the bot thing I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like was mr.  dubious about this whole thing and I totally agree with Mike and I do I do feel that there's so much hype and  this idea that  that  That the bots are gonna replace apps is work going to work just as well as the way that the apps replace the web  Which of course they didn't and in reality I think that these are all layered  You know  Sometimes using the mobile web is going to make sense for you and and you're gonna continue to do it and it's great and  Sometimes using an app is gonna make sense and it's you know  You're dealing with one person enough that you're like yeah like for my gym  I you know if I could book a training session or whatever they've got a great app. It's really easy  I I've used that rather than try to call them or go online or whatever because the app is great  So I'm gonna use their app  but I think that the bots have a place and you know that there are there are things that they can do and  I did my own article and it was like how I sent flowers to Mark Zuckerberg using a bot Wow that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was supposed to ask you about that you did that during the speech

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I wasn't doing so I wish it was that good. No, I asked you afterwards  I was at f8 now whereas I wandered around looked at different things and I sat down I thought alright  I've heard a lot about bots over the past four months or so  But I've never really kind of interacted with one because I don't use messaging much and there hasn't been that many of them  So let me go try one of these things out  So I you know for whatever reason I started off with the flower bot  this is 1-800 flowers one and I  Came away with the believer like that bot is so good that when Mother's Day comes around  I will use it to buy the flowers because it was actually a better experience than going to the website  Which I have done before it was very easy. And one of the nicest things about it was like, you know  You can complain about putting in your  Putting in, you know your credit card number whatever  But like I needed to send the flowers and I couldn't remember the whole address and as I was going through  I thought well, let me pretend to send flowers to mark  Why not? Because let's see how this whole thing works. And so it was like, well, what's the address?  I'm like, well, I know it's one hacker way, but I don't know the rest  I put that in and it's like do you mean one half away?  No part California nine to whatever whatever whatever Mike  Yeah  And then it gave me a selection of flowers and as you'll see if you've read my article like they weren't exactly what I was looking  For like I didn't want to send them love and romance flowers  But you know, I found something that was you know, like that works and it's a good price range and there was enough selections  For what I needed to do and it wasn't gonna be any  Anything that great if I gone to the website as well and it was like it was like a five-minute process  And because I wasn't on the web and even if it was on a mobile web or an app you're still sometimes like, okay  I put it in here and you know, you know to entering my credit card number. It saved it  It went through pretty forward straight forward  I was a believer in fact after I sent the flowers to mark and then I wrote the article about  When I posted the article two minutes later, my wife was like, yeah, you know, I like flowers  If you're sending them to mark, so I went back and I sent her flowers actually  strawberries more than flowers but  But I did it again and I did it all from the chat bot and it worked great  And so like I said mother's day were all around so I think that  For certain instances you might find that these things are useful now I totally with a lot of these things  I went back and played with that same shopping app and it was like yeah, it was a miserable experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean and it may guess we have to acknowledge just as with any other technology  It's early days and so it's a mixed bag

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Some things will work the the poncho I think what I thought show is so annoying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and I think Facebook kind of sells a disservice because they really wanted to make this a big announcement and when you go in and  You know if you go into your phone and you you're in messenger now you you start to do a search for stuff  It's offering these five these five chat bots only one of which I found worked

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're seeing and was terrible poncho high poncho. The weather bot is  Singularly annoying. I mean it's almost as if you pick so in fact, there's a great article  This is in gizmodo by Darren Orff in which he does some screenshots  If you don't want to turn on poncho and how annoying poncho could be do I need a jacket? Yep  It's chilly sunglasses. Sorry. I was trying to charge my phone. What are you trying to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When you turn on when you turn on your phone and it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the way you can see the weather instead of getting this really annoying hipster  Your future is so bright gotta wear shades. What about an umbrella? Excuse me  Do I need an umbrella and then what's the weather like this weekend?  Are you on a boat because I was not able to find any results for that location  What's the weather like in Brooklyn this weekend he finally gave up said I'll tell you where I am  Weather in Brooklyn, New York is 46 degrees and clear this weekend. Excuse a more  weekend  Sorry dosed off for a second. What were you saying? Like you don't want that in your phone. I got family members like that  I don't need a I don't need to sign up for a bot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is that this is the this points to the three things that are gonna make bots  Amazing and unfortunately these three things are five years away  So the first thing is real artificial intelligence  We have to get to the point where computers can't understand right random things like this is umbrella  Artificial stupidity. Oh, he's asking me if I need to recommend an umbrella  So so you need real AI to to manage not in each in every individual bot  But a referee sort of a platform that that referees all that manages all this stuff  It could be the chat app app  Okay  The second thing is you need the app itself needs to have all the data needs to know who my mother is it needs to  Know what everybody's addressed like Amazon the kind of information Amazon has but doesn't Facebook already know that well  They should the third thing is that I think the real killer app of this is voice interaction  so I typing messaging I think is  Okay, but we really just want to talk and and if you can imagine the integration of Siri Cortana  Alexa and so on as the as the manager of all these third-party apps  Bots, excuse me and can intelligently choose those. Let me give you a real  The flowers example that Danny's talking about is one of the best current examples for how bots work  But here's how it should really works  You talk to the bot you talk to Siri or Cortana and you say or Google now and you say I want to send flowers  to Mark Zuckerberg  And the bot should come back and say, you know, I've noticed through your past purchase that you like organic foods and organic things  There is a small  Shop in Mark Zuckerberg's town that sells organic flowers  It's only a couple of dollars more than the cheapest flowers around would you like me?  Would you like to consider flowers from that? Yes, I would. Okay. So here it is. Blah blah blah  You know that kind of intelligence will make this  amazing life-changing  But but for now we're gonna be struggling against this  The stupidity of AI the inability of it to know anything the data for all this  These products have not been keyed in and optimized for bots  So the world is not ready for bots yet  The AI is not ready for bots yet and I don't think the public is going to be thrilled with all this frustration  So I think that for the next year there's gonna be a lot of I think bots will kind of unfortunately be a little bit  Laughing stock because people will have so many frustrating  Experiences like the ones that you talked to yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's early days yet. I think there's potential there. I think we don't even really fully understand what bots are best for  How they could be best used and I think you're exactly right AI is nowhere near as good as it is and I you know  I I finally got the Amazon dot which is the my  I'm a fan of the echo big fan own four of them. Yeah  But the echo speaker is kind of  Mediocre and I would like to have the echo be able to do things like play me music and it read me books in a  Way that sounds a little bit better. So the dot is a speakerless or almost it has a small, you know function utility speaker  But it's basically a speakerless version is the top of the echo cutoff and I paired it to a Bluetooth speaker  Which seemed to be the best way better than plugging in and hardwired  Because it didn't seem to wake it up all the time things like that  But but Bluetooth did put the echo near near where I am the speaker is playing loud. It's great  It's always there always available and when you when the echo suddenly has full  Stereo sound rich stereo sound it's just remarkable and I really think that that that is a platform that is  And it's it. It's it. Let's face it. That's a chat pod essentially

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is and it's doing what I'm talking about they have what they call skills  Third party developers and Amazon was very aggressive with this  Built these skills, but it also has the problem that I was talking about which is in order to use a specific skill  You have to have skill yourself. You have to know what's the command specifically that will enable that skill  It's a it's a for one or two skills. It's fine  If you want to use a dozen or two dozen or three dozen of those skills that are available animals and echo  It's like, you know, it's like there's a lot of homework to do to figure out remember how to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It really needs to be smart enough because I I mean I was going through to add some skills and they're like ten pages  The different things we need to be smart enough to know that when I tell it  Something that it goes right and just finds the skill and runs the skill rather than do you want to install it?  I think so I say if I say Alexa fart I need it to just immediately fart

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You like yeah install the fart skills  And then tell you that the syntax is so from now on  You need to say it this way

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That that'll happen  I don't want to do that  That's gonna be a relief for it too because I don't want to actually have to remember the syntax it should figure that out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's another failing of natural language right now. It's not very good  Good article in Bloomberg, although unaccountably loaded with dancing GIFs  I wish this is the this I mean just okay like can we just talk about the layout on this?  I don't know what they're trying to accomplish, but this is this I mean it's everything but punch the monkey, but it is in the  Did somebody I don't know does somebody get a GIF animating program at Bloomberg and decide  You know what this article needs is more dancing echoes  It's the strangest thing the real story of how Amazon built the echo of course  in Amazon's lab one two six where the  Fire phone was built was originally created to build the Kindle and it was one of I think it was  Project D or e they they do them in the alphabet the one before it was augmented reality apparently  the team  somehow was doing  something along the lines of a voice response system  Jeff Bezos didn't really think much of it  But they went ahead some have reported that that's one of the issues at Amazon is that you spend a lot of energy way too much  energy thinking about whether Jeff will like it  and  Doing more things probably than you would  Project C was an augmented reality  program of some kind which died project D ended up being the echo despite Bezos is  Suspicion of the whole thing it's good. It's a good article well researched if you can ignore  I think this is a good one for a pocket just put put it in pocket or readability

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you won't see the enemy one little bit of trivia that I didn't know and I thought I knew everything about Amazon and lab  126 was that  126 is a reference to the alphabet one representing the letter a and 26 letters in the letter Z  And I thought I always wondered what that 126 was all about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They they also talked about the name and the and the wake up  Because apparently Bezos wanted it to be Amazon and their engine his engineers are saying you can't  Because it'll wake up all the time people say Amazon a lot on TV everywhere sometimes not even referring to us  And so they wanted to be a le XA  Which is much less commonly referred to Jeff resisted, but eventually I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They should just let you make it whatever you want though  I want the hot word to be the hot word I wanted to be yeah the only time it's ever I've ever seen that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the Moto X where you could yeah, you're right  And I guess it's because it uses too much processor power to have our yeah, that makes sense, right?  You want to have just a few patterns built in and still come I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we got a long way to go right save the processing locally overwrite the RAM do something wrong  Do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There better and then there's people in Cuba who don't have water for four days. I just want to remind you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although I have the feeling that Cubans rather have good internet connectivity than water isn't that interesting that just shows you how much I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think you I think you're right. I think once people really get experience of the internet  It's what the world changes. It's a different world we live in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google set up this one. I know we talked a lot about Cuba earlier, but one last thing I have to mention  Yeah, Google partnered with an artist whose name is Kacho K. Ch. Oh and  set up a room at Kacho's sort of an art compound and  this artist does lots and lots of things to get young people involved in art and culture and and so on and  this partnership with Cuba has  20 Chromebooks set up and  These Chromebooks are on a super fast Wi-Fi that supposedly 70 times faster than the government Wi-Fi  It's literally the fastest internet in Cuba. I don't know how Google does this stuff  How they provide?  Super fast connectivity in a place that just doesn't have it anywhere else  But they also had Google Cardboard there and they also had free Wi-Fi  Which is the only place in Cuba where you can actually use Wi-Fi for free and what's fascinating about it is people were lining  Up to use those fast Chromebooks  Nobody was paying attention to cardboard because cardboard I'm sure they all tried it. Oh, this is really neat  They really just want to get online and man  You get one hour with this fast Wi-Fi and people were just locked into these screens for that hour  It was really something to see they are so hungry for good internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, we really take it for granted don't we yeah, you know, it's just the fact that you can stream Game of Thrones  or  You know house of cards  it's really remarkable really remarkable and  a  Couple of change law. I will do the change log which is just gonna be a bunch of new features Google launched a bunch of features  Today, I think it's I think as Danny Solomon said it was to distract people from the EU decision  Google play music now, of course has podcast support. It's on Android. It's on the web. We are on it  We are a big part of it. It's kind of rolling out slowly to Android  I don't yet have it on Android but on the web if you if you're a Google Play music user  There will be now a new  menu that says podcasts and you can search for podcasts over here under the hemberg air you  could search for podcasts so you could search for twit or you can  Actually search for twist the way to see what all the shows we do or you could search for individual  Shows as well and I imagine most podcasts will be on here  I think the podcaster has to submit just as they do with iTunes. So that may be a while  short while before your favorite podcast is  on there, they've added new features to inbox which I just learned about because  Right before the show I checked tech meme  And so I'm not really up on this maybe you are more Danny I  Like Google inbox, but we finally got Jeff Jarvis to use it. He fought it for a long time now  It will keep track of  Events in your inbox and I think collate them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah puts all the all the email that you have  Associated around a specific event together. So sometimes if you have a trip coming up you have the individual emails  Coming out over a period of weeks. It'll just group them all together nicely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's great. That's awesome  Email newsletters will have a preview  Kind of rolling up all the issues into a single preview. You could store links that you want to remember with save to inbox  so  I'm not sure you have to get the I will get this the inbox by gmail chrome extension and  Then now I guess in Chrome I can save it to my email

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't understand. Yeah becomes an option in the share function on both Android and iOS when you say just hit the share  you can plug it in there so that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like saving a link or because chrome has been missing this email link forever, right you every other browser  There's there's it. You just email a link  It doesn't seem like you can do that on chrome unless I'm missing something. So now you add the inbox extension  So what it's just gonna save it to my inbox

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll create an item in the inbox  I love that because I use inbox for everything to any sort of information  I want to retain I just throw in an inbox and deal with it later

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that works great for me. So it's it also has another entry share via email  So hallelujah, they finally added that you think that would be a fundamental browser capability, but they finally added that  Google fiber wants to beam wireless internet to your home according to  Recode I  Guess this means I mean it makes sense because fiber laying fiber is very costly  It was estimated that Verizon spent five thousand dollars per subscriber to give them files  So now it's looking at wireless high-speed internet solving that expensive last mile problem  I'll take it just point it my way point the beam at me  Let's see  Google claims you to add YouTube ads are more effective than TV  Okay  The TV people disagree. I think some might disagree. Okay  Oh  Kevin Mark said this happened to him the  Marshmallow six point. Oh one update is is bricking some people's Nexus sixes. So if you have an older Nexus six  Be careful about the April security patch that's an over-the-air update they don't build them security patches, but that's what they are  That's gonna break my Nexus six be careful. It did it does some and it bricked Kevin Marks is Nexus six

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do I be careful? Do I just don't take it don't take it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do give you a chance. It is not an automatic install  There is a way to recover according to somebody named techno bill I trust him implicitly  Which means put it you have to put the Android and beta  on your Nexus six  Check developer options. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't know. It's complicated. I should just wait until that goes away and they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unpushed I bet it's gone by now  But I wouldn't wait. I would still wait. I  Only updated like every three months or so whenever you know what I see an Android update. I do it  I'm good. I jump up and down. I think oh, maybe I'm getting nut roll. I don't know. I just get excited  I just can't wait  YouTube has rolled out support for 360 degree live streams  Plus and I think this is very important  Spatial audio so they've always had 360 degree videos, but this will be live now  now, I don't know if you have hardware to do that the  Cameras that do live 360 degree video are few and far between so yeah, this is like 8k video

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like they can support it  But but who's gonna is it and how do you watch it and yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the other thing that'll be challenging too  Is that you know you have to be so careful with the 360 video like if you're like the first one I shot  I'm holding my phone my thing up like this right and they realize oh great this whole  Backpart is just your head. Yeah. Yeah, you know like what they were showing you their thing. Yeah, that's cool  But you know, I suppose you you know, I don't know  360 is awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  360 audio though, I think is gonna be a critical feature and again this requires hardware that has microphones in every direction  But that's kind of what you want. If you're looking over there the sound should move right? Yeah  So that's gonna be a big deal  again, I don't know what kind of hardware you're gonna have to have to do it, but I  Suppose it's coming along the Oso which is Nokia's camera. We were playing with that earlier  We made a couple of Oso videos and new screensavers and back break weekly with Alex Lindsay who had one on loan  He actually I think he has three Oso's at the NAB show  He's recording three 360 degree cameras one of them on a moving jib. I don't but  There's $60,000 each the problem is they're not live streaming. This is the video  This took us took him a week to generate this 10-minute video because it's four hours per minute of video to stitch it  Four hours of processing for every minute of video you shoot and you see it doesn't even look all that good

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's that just changes everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're being sarcastic. Okay, especially when you get it sent to you by your chatbot. Yeah look

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we I think we've got it. We've got it all covered anything else you guys want to there was an interesting article about magic leap  In wired  But as Neelai Patel writes in the verge in a critique of it  they didn't really ask the important questions in the wired it was a  Interesting profile, but here's the five burning questions Neelai Patel would like to know what the hell is it?  It was mostly like a press release

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was like it just works it was a nice it was a nice article about what's going on with Kevin Kelly  Who wrote it is great and I love him. Yeah, no, but it didn't I did not get inside magically  Like I don't think we somebody said we don't even see what the headset is. We still don't in fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is the picture they showed as a guy staring into a  obviously prototype device with lots of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  glowing wires coming out of it as a nice article about  Hey  VR is growing and maybe this will finally be the time that it makes it unlike this article that could have come straight out of the  1990s that talked about I mean it literally could have been a  1990s article on how VR was someday  But now like, you know, the difference is people really are getting these headsets  If you have the gear be like, you know, we were joking earlier. I've got three gear VR sitting around  You really can do it and people really are kind of blown away by it  I was showing my my business partner it the gear VR where you have the dinosaur and he was just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Magically bizarre, of course in the end and they they've described it  But they haven't really described how it works as glasses that are lightweight and thin and then that somehow magically  It just a stuff appears in your field of view and your eye naturally focuses they offer this video  But as Neely says well, but they explain nothing. What was it shot with? How is the camera focusing? Where is it focusing?  Where does this stuff appear and there's a call coming in from Google Hangouts  Is there an interface for Google Hangouts or is this just completely a mock-up? How does it know any of this information?  You know  It's it's and Kevin Kelly never answers any of  These questions. So while we're all kind of intrigued by magic leap, there's still absolutely  No idea of how it works

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but you know, it's kind of funny that that's one of the  Impressive things about magic leap is their ability to prevent anybody from knowing anything. Yeah reminds me of  Yeah, they've raised a billion dollars. They've gotten Google backing  They according to this article the one thing that they hinted at that was somewhat intriguing was that the main  Core competency of magic leap is is unique technology that makes the 3d aspect of it  incredibly  believable and so  Again, we don't know what that is how it works or anything  but the fact that they have been able to raise that much money and  At the same time they have the discipline to prevent us from knowing anything about it  is in a way a  Suggestion that this company is  somewhat formidable  And it's very or keep those kind of secrets or their Theranos

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know given the history of the of the world  The latter is more likely than the former to be honest with you. I'm not casting aspersions, but  At some point you're gonna have to have show this technology to somebody and it's gonna have to be real  The everything we've seen I think is fake

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean to say same goes for to a certain extent for Microsoft HoloLens

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But no no no because the people have tried it on and it works and you can see what you see it's disappointing  I mean at least to Microsoft's credit  They're they're letting people buy them and try them on and use them and so that exists much as oculus rift exists  I'm not convinced that magic leap exists

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe can't read an article that was inside magic league. So what questions could you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know my my son told me about a  Bottle that some Austrian inventors have created that pulls water out of the air and fills itself up. It's a magically  refilling water bottle in an hour  Even in the desert it will fill itself up with water and I said well, you know you read this stuff  You see these kickstart it was it's like a crowdfunding campaign. You say you got to really think is that possible?  Do they have one does it work?  I'm just I'm still a little skeptical. I mean we I would love magic leap to be real  I will be the first to buy one. Yeah  Mmm, birth Einstein we all talked about it plus see monkeys dance to music  And they do they're real they're alive  You know, maybe that's it I bought too many things from the back of comic books to believe any of this stuff anymore  I bought x-ray glasses. I bought  submarine submarine

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Didn't really work. I never get the plans for my hovercraft

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay  Do you want to talk about the UC Davis article in the and New York Times you're quoted Danny Sullivan UC Davis  As everyone knows and remembers well  That was the New York Times complain about my arm blocker  As many of you remember well UC Davis very famously in 2011  campus cops pepper sprayed  students  nonviolent sit-down protesters  And actually if you watch the video, it's just horrific  and  unfortunately  When you do a search unfortunately for UC Davis for the Chancellor's name or UC Davis you get this video  You see Davis didn't like that. They spent  175 look at this guy. They're just spraying him  like  Anyway  Trying to bury this video. They hired a company Nevins and Associates. This is like reputation management, right Danny

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean there's nothing unusual about this other than it was by public university with public money  Yeah, and not actually  Doing it. Well, so, you know so  For like we didn't write an article on it because this was like so commonplace  But you know, it definitely got attention out there  It's it's reputation management. It's it's SEO with very specialized SEO that the problem in this case is first of all  They didn't like if you read the contract I was I think I was described as thinking I found it laughable  The contract didn't describe what it was  They were trying to fix like improve things improve what?  It didn't say that when you search for UC Davis  You were actually getting this stuff or when you're searching for the Chancellor's name  And in fact the day the article ran about their attempts all those years later  Those results were very clean, you know years had passed it really literally years the path at this point  It wasn't coming up that way  But the contract talked about trying to somehow  Get rid of all the results which you were never gonna be able to do  It is totally a case that a lot of reputation management companies will try to  Bring in new content that kind of pushes down the older content  But some of the older content and maybe it's negative content may disappear on its own anyway  But overall it was a lot of money that they spent without any  specifics of specific mesh  Specific measureables about what they were good there was nothing like and and here's how we're gonna prove that this actually worked  And if it didn't work you're gonna get your money back or or even kind of like we can try this stuff  But it's not necessarily gonna help so after that learning experience  They decided to spend even more money with the second firm  After working with the first firm for a year not getting the results and spend more money with the second firm  Which may or may not have done anything different either and then of course the whole thing comes out  And so now they get even more negative publicity off of what they were trying to bury in the first place the whole  Streisand effect that you know as it's known or whatever they'd have been better off really  Just trying to I don't know I mean  One of the things they actually could have done is just dealt with the problem right  Owned it said this is what happened at our campus  We're working to make sure it doesn't happen again, and you know go on with it from there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that's the way to deal with all this is they would deal with the right to be forgotten and all of that  You can't you can't delete history  Unless you win if you win the war then you can do whatever you  But so these are just to make this clear because I think a lot of people know hear about this than there  We I don't do ads for but there are a lot of radio ads for companies that do reputation management  What they do they mention a low price thing that does absolutely nothing then for a significant amount of money like  $10,000 a month they will generate a ton of content  kind of just  stupid meaningless content  With your name attached so that when people do a search that content supposedly will rise to the top of search results  But you're saying Danny that kind of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It really depends on the situation so you have some people who are  private individuals who maybe have fairly unique names and  When you search for them if let's say they had gotten arrested and it ran in a local paper  That might show up because there's just not a lot of stuff  So if they go through and they create a Facebook account a Twitter account and a LinkedIn account and all this other stuff  You know Google tends to favor  Returning if you will brand pages your personal pages and it may be enough to knock that stuff down and then they could go through  And create lots of other content and yeah for that for that private person it might be effective  You know for a bigger company  It might help it might help move it further down like I haven't looked at the results for BP recently right  But you know I'm pretty sure that BP's search results are not dominated by the oil spill and take a look at them now. There's global  BP not well. I've got news results. You never get rid of the news results, but the rest of the stuff that's showing up there  You know there you know is not dominated  And so you're always going to have like for a brand if there's something back in the news  The the new stuff is fresh you can't get rid of that  But yeah, it it can be effective if it's done right and you're realistic about it may not always work the way that you want  And I think you're gonna be even more effective if you understand that you go into the approach with  Not something that's so blatant like we were trying to bury this other stuff, right, right, right  You know if Davis had embraced this as you know this terrible thing has happened  This terrible thing happened on our campus. We're embarrassed about it. Here's the story of how we're improving it  It would have been so much more positive because first of all they would have been taking positive action  Instead it just looks like you did this horrible thing and now you're just trying to hope to get rid of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like nobody remembers it so one things that probably had a lot more to do with the chancellor trying to protect his name than anything else

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But and just not understanding how the internet works  I mean there's not any possible way that you can get this news story off of a search for UC Davis because  This is literally the biggest news that this university is producing last decade, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was off the results. I mean it was just naturally off the result. I mean you're you're right  You're never gonna get rid of UC Davis pepper spray if you searched for it  But when you were searching for just UC Davis, this was not dominating the results

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we're not dominating but they're they're on the front page  one of the ways that Google  Search results work is that Google actually somehow tries to figure out I'm not telling you this Danny  You know this better than I do  But it tries to understand whether something's positive or negative and if there's lots of positive it says it throws in some negative  It tries to D filter bubble the search engine results to make sure that there's some semblance of balance

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, it doesn't do anything like that at all unless you're reading something different than I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you if you look at Eli Peres's filter bubble book, it actually addresses this  this mechanism  It was one of Google's defenses against the filter bubble thing  The other one is which that Google's claims that they don't filter search results. They only rank them  But if you if for example, I mean I think this goes for all of us let's say, you know  Danny Sullivan is a beloved figure in in in  Technology journalism vast majority of things that people say about Danny Sullivan are very very positive  And if a tiny minority of people say something negative, those are gonna get an unusually high ranking in Google searches because they're negative  And because so much of else of it is positive  Well, I mean it goes for Leo Laporte and Mike Elgin as well if  It tries to almost artificially balance positive against negative so that  Results can't be padded like is it really doing that?  I don't think it's doing that and it's been a while since I've read Eli's book

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I don't think it's trying to do that and there's all sorts of bad things because if it was trying to do sentiment analysis  Of the different search results  If it was trying to do sentiment analysis of the different search results, and then I said hey  But let's just throw in some bad stuff. Anybody could just make up bad stuff, you know, it's really  My understanding of the balance that it trying to do it tends to be more like to show a variety of results

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right of sources as opposed to variety of sentiments

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But but if you could just go back and look at this like you can do the search for UC Davis now and  Before the story broke  There it wasn't there I remember looking the day the story came out and I looked and there was there was nothing there  It was like the Wikipedia page the Facebook page their day the other athletic site  They were one of you know, their best college ranking thing their YouTube page  There was no and that's very standard for brands if you do a search for say target right now, right?  Or do search for McDonald's right now  Google over the past few years has actually really shifted things so that if you're a brand  It just kind of rewards your your standard stuff. There's a lot of people who hate McDonald's right here  I'm searching for McDonald's and there's no don't shopping McDonald's stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's coming it kind of brings up the standard McDonald's stuff the the official McDonald's right exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And a few years ago you would have gotten that or if I search for like Diet Coke

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure that that's the brands have put pressure on Google to do that right or they haven't directly done it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's been a combination of Google like  Not wanting to deal with the hassles that if they're shifting more towards favoring stuff  That's officially from a brand and someone's just searching for a brand  It's less controversial. You have less people getting angry at you  But people who are looking for something bad that they've heard about it still find it, right?  So, you know if you if you that's why if you go UC Davis or even if you search for the Chancellor UC Davis is Linda  Katehi, I may not be pronouncing it right, but if you search for her on on Google  Her stuff was not that bad  You can you can see that the only real negative thing that was happening like was coming up in March  It wasn't getting to the pepper spray thing. So  They they made it worse for themselves by getting into the new new stuff that was going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you we were looking at the results you could I mean, it's just really messed it up because

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right because they've generated all this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Necessarily there anyway, so backfire. Well, there you go. Don't mess around just accept  What our Google overlords say about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well  mostly, right no, I mean I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's you know, it's just hard this is really hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like saying that if you were having negative stuff written about you in a newspaper  That you should just take it. No, you would probably wage a PR campaign  But there's a difference between waging a good PR campaign that has  underlying it real change and  PR that's the way to do it is just a bad PR campaign and in fact that UC Davis did a lot they they did

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Investigation they put the officer on leave. I don't know if they ultimately fired him, but they did stuff  That's what you want to promote not try to bury the story entirely that's a mistake

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and so, you know, it was just I would have been fascinated on how they actually did the research to find these companies  It was so that's that's the most annoying thing all this it was a lot of money wasted  Because no one really seemed to understand what they were doing more than wasted. Yeah. Hey good news for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  free speech and  For Google the Supreme Court on Monday declined to  Consider the challenge to Google's book scanning project a district court had said  somewhat reluctantly but said that that was a fair use to scan those books within the boundaries of fair use and  While the Publishers Association appealed it  They have now been rejected by the Supreme Court which means I think finally the Google book case is over  That's the end of that unless there's a higher court that I don't know if I guess they go to the EU. Yeah  We're gonna take a break and come back with our final  Picks or tips or whatever. It's so great to have you Mike Elgin from Mexico off his  Jots through Cuba to be here  Yeah  Really appreciate it and I love it that even though Mike is traveling about as light as you can was just a couple of backpacks  He packed a PR 40 microphone with him which ways it's not an inconsiderable amount  I mean, it's it's heavier than your laptop. Probably. Did you bring a laptop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I did definitely brought a laptop only in the necessities only the only the very bare necessities  So the PR 40 but not I I put in storage all the stuff that goes around it the pop filter that stand all of  That's why I'm holding it, but you got to have the PR for it.

Thank you very much everybody  I kind of know Google's gonna give  $15,000 to three screenwriters one for a feature film and two for episodic pilots  At the Tribeca Film Festival, it's the computer science education and media program  And these these pilots I gather will will have to be about computer science  Especially to inspire young people, especially girls and minorities  To do something in computer science. So good on them  $15,000 for three different screenwriters from Google and they're announcing that today at the Tribeca Film Festival  Danny do you have a tip or a number or anything? You'd like to share with us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was trying to think what's the number and I was going through search engine land and I realized  I have the number 10  Which are 10 big changes in search that I wrote in an article for my 20 years in covering search, which Wow

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  20 years last Sunday 20 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was yes, so I've been congratulations. Thank you very much. So I kind of did it wasn't really retrospective  I just tried to go back and look through and I was looking for some number to go with 20  So that will do 10 because I can't come up with 20 big changes  So, you know I wrote this article and it goes through  You know kind of the revolution that search has been that I think people don't really take into account this revolution of Google itself  And you know as you know remember Leo we used to use open text or info seek or web crawler  Oh my god, it's today have no idea they're kids  Google world  So that was one of the other revolutions. I talked about the idea of Google becoming a destination  Which is a significant change from when it was just a search engine and there's some issues that go along with that and  The idea that our phones are like search phones more than smartphones and what a big change that's been in terms of how  We have this always on searching and we can look for stuff wherever we want huge  Huge did a big thing where I talked about the death of ten blue links that some people  All hearing about and I've got this giant side-by-side where I'm showing you like Google from 2002 versus what you get today  Look at the change  Text and now it's like here's some apps  I talked about some of the bots and where that may be going  this is all new stuff that's coming in there as well as the idea of machine learning and then  You know the idea and this is the part that always fascinates me is how searches interactive with society where we Google each other  My opening to this section was like, you know  Who would have thought that when we've had these tools that emerge to let you find anything that 20 years later we would get  Laws about how you should be forcing them to forget what they know  Well, I mean that's one of the huge impacts that we've had that's come off of search with it from there  so talk about search society stuff the big change with search marketers and then just at the end kind of a  I don't know if it's so much of a trend. It's just so much of saying gosh, you know this stuff search is this magical gadget  If you will, it's it is this kind of rocket science that happens. We should take it for granted  Just like we do the internet we we you know, they Tesla, you know make breeze out their new phone. Sorry  It's all mixed up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is all mixed up though. That's the truth of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but you know the  SpaceX launches their rocket and brings it back down to earth and we're all gripped by that  virally Apple launches a new phone and we line up and and you know go out there by that like ooh now it's got  3d touch right we never really kind of do that about the latest search features because  They continue to be this evolution yet. They're these amazing gadgets  So, you know that was sort of like wow, you know, the big trend is you've taken this magical thing and it's just everyday  But there's a lot of work and a lot of stuff that goes on behind the scenes for the people who make all that happen  To make it so routine and yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, you know that was a great article ten big changes with search engines over my 20 years of covering them from Danny  Sullivan and boy, there's nobody better to write that article and I'm glad you do remind us of what an amazing world  We live in I mean that Mike started out by talking about how how  Deprived people in Cuba are if for no other reason because they don't have access to the internet  We take it for granted, but it really has changed our lives. I didn't realize you've been doing this for 20 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it was I I tweeted the thing. This was on Sunday night  I think it was  You'd have to go back my tweets to find it  But I showed a little screenshot of the first thing I wrote but I you know had been a newspaper journalist in  Gosh after college through about the beginning of 95 and then went to work with a friend of mine to do web development  and  As part of what we were doing we were putting people online and questions were coming about how the search engines were working  And so I spent some time researching and trying to understand what exactly were they doing because no one really knew  They assume that everything got crawled instantly and they everything didn't get crawled instantly  people knew a little bit about meta tags and assumed that they made a difference and mostly they didn't and  So I published all this in April 1996  the results of what I had studied over a few months of making changes to web pages as  Well as an accompanying guide that I called a web mattress guide to search engines  Which was designed to say look, you know, you're publishing stuff on the web  This is the stuff you need to understand on how the search engines are interacting with your stuff because they're kind of like another  Browser and at the time you'll remember people will be like I got to make sure it works for  You know  Mosaic and I got to make sure it works  Firefox which is new and I got to make sure it works well for this  I guess Internet Explorer is coming out and you know  I would kind of was arguing to people you also need to make sure things work for search engines because they  see some things they don't see other things and  That kind of launched me on a new career that I hadn't anticipated

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that exciting and you know what what a great?  Beat really and and you've made yourself the expert in it, which is I think really really fortunate  Follow Danny on Twitter if you're not at Danny Sullivan lots of great tweets all the time, but  Sunday's tweet
