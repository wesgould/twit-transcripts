The show that covers  Google, the cloud, Facebook, Twitter and all that jazz with Gina Trapani, founding editor at Lifehacker,  currently a principal at ThinkUp, the fabulous Twitter and Facebook analytics company at ThinkUp.com  and a blogger at Life, I mean, what is it? SmarterWear.org and she's probably forgot the  address as well. Oh, so sad. You're busy. Whatever happened to blogs. Yeah. She's got a baby. She's  got a new program. There he is, Jeff Jarvis. He's in Seattle today to meet with some big wigs.  At the Gates Foundation. Oh, that's beautiful. Oh, yeah. That's pretty. And what are you doing?  Jeff's a professor of journalism at the City University of New York. He also blogs at BuzzMachine.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you doing at the Gates Foundation? They have a meeting of all their media fundees. So I'm  going to stand up and say I'm not a fundee yet. So my favorite moment, Gina moment this week,  I'm just going to throw this in, is that somebody speculated that there are new regulations about,  and Russia, I guess it was, about not using nasty words and how I couldn't live in Russia.  Gina looked up her data on ThinkUp and said that I didn't use the F word as much as she thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we have a new insight in ThinkUp that tells you how often you drop the F bomb on Twitter or  Facebook. And, you know, it doesn't show up for everybody. It only shows up for folks who do that  at all. And of course, Jeff had that insight and it wasn't so bad. It was only like eight times in a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, now I've embarrassed you. Now I've got to oomph up my F and act here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to have to use F once so I could just see.  Yeah, F, yeah.  I've never used the, I don't think I've ever used the F word in any of my tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I, you know, I haven't either, honestly, because it's just personal policy, but that's not the  case for everybody. And we just thought, hey, why not celebrate it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If somebody uses a lot, do you like give a red, a red insight, you know, bright red?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're not judgmental. We merely count. Oh, and we'll let you know how many more this month as  compared to last month. Once we have the data to show you that. I love think up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff insight. That's my, Hey, look at that. It's Matt cuts from the Google. He's one of the early  employees at Google currently fights spam and Google search results. He does those wonderful  webmaster videos to Matt's. Nice to see you from the Googleplex. Good to have you back.  Thanks very much for having me. I got a question for Matt, actually we get, I mean, and I mentioned  this before, but I, but I never had the guy here. I've been getting a lot of email. You guys must  be on a campaign to get rid of bad backlinks because I've getting, getting email all of a sudden  from people who spammed our forums many moons ago saying, you know, I don't know who did that.  Could you delete those, all those spammy links or spammy accounts? And then a few of them are  mean and say, I would hate, I would hate to have to report you to Google for not doing so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. That's a nice forum you got there. So, uh, am I, should I worry, uh, man?  No, no, you don't need to worry. This is basically a one-time correction where for a long time,  spammers were like, get links, all the links, as many links as you can get links, everything.  And now that's not the case. And in case, and in fact, it makes sense to not have some of those  low quality links. So this is basically a lot of people trying to go back and clean up the mess  they've made. The nice news is going forward, people will be, or at least anyone who pays  attention will be smart enough not to just say, yes, get as many links as possible. That's what  I want to do. But no, you, you don't need to worry about it. You're in fine shape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It gives me great pleasure to often to respond to them saying,  with a little bit of schadenfreude, Oh, you spammed my forum and now you wish you hadn't.  But somebody pointed out to me, I think this is possibly the case that some of these might be  legitimate firms that hired less than legitimate SEO firms and they did it on their behalf.  Yeah, that does happen. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or at least that's what people always say. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're actually going to shut down those forums because there's, they're not much used.  And, um, and I just think it's probably better. The forums are kind of old hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, there, there is discourse. That's actually a new one from Jeff Atwood and company.  And that actually does a very good job of being crawlable and it includes some user trust so that  you don't, you can't just drop a link the day that you register. So you might want to check out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am now suddenly interested discourse.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is there, it's a, it's a, it's an open source, right? You download and install yourself, right?  Is there like a very popular discourse installation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question. All I know is, you know, since we're interested in spams,  spammed forums, we did a little bit of an audit to make sure that, you know, that it was crawlable  and had pretty good SEO and it was actually looking really good. It's one of the very few  times I was like, there's not a lot more to suggest. So if you just want to drop in forum,  that is sort of like the next generation of forum, uh, I'd sort of start looking there rather than  with some of the older ones that, uh, I am going to talk to our team because I like the idea of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  forum and you know, there are forums like, uh, the, uh, developers, uh, forum for, you know,  XDA developers forum for Android that are very active and very widely used AVS forum.  There are some kind of, they've become kind of platforms. Um, I think a forum is a nice  way for our audience to, uh, to get interactive. So maybe I should take a look at this discourse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should know this, Leo. Oh, there, there is, there is a subreddit for twin on Reddit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Right. Many subreddits. I think each of our shows has a subreddit and you know,  we just launched a Reddit show called Reddit up. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cause I love reading new stuff coming out. I can talk about later, but I talked to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they will do a hosted version. They haven't done it yet, but they're working on a hosted  version, but we haven't, we have a few servers lying around. Yeah. And the, the sandbox looks

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  great. Just, uh, you know, front page, uh, just, you know, try it out, which very good discourse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, one thing they do, which I really liked, they don't have to, you don't have to go page,  next page, next page, next to read a discussion. You can just look at it, which is great.  We use something briefly. It was very popular called vanilla. Remember vanilla forums. They  were really clean and simple. Loved those, but we ended up using some, you know, PHP BB tile  thing. And that really is just, it makes me nervous that even there are servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. There are entire server packages. You can lease out of Russia for 500 bucks a month,  where they will register accounts, solve the capture, you know, just, you know,  professional software packages to spam every type of forum. So it's pretty crazy.  You, you're into Russia, Matt.  My wife would like to go and I'm kind of like, I'm not sure I want to go to Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? You think, no, you'd be safe there. Wouldn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure. But, uh, he's lowering the GDP of Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a, uh, here's a picture of Vladimir Putin considering the  arrival of Matt cuts in the Soviet former.  I am not amused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and there's these new blogger laws that  who signed where bloggers have to register. Yeah. That's, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  pretty bad. And, um, he'll use think up to find out who's using the F word and banish them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Putin on Monday, uh, actually a few weeks ago said that the internet was a special CIA project.  That guy.  You know, um, so this is a lot of governments, China very famously does this. You have to  register if you want to publish on the internet. Um, that's really sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, it really is sad. It's, it's the ruination. The time story goes through  kind of the state of things of how all the countries that are trying to mess up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Turkey, China. Um, of course, during the, um, the, uh, Arab spring of a couple of years ago,  Egypt, Syria, uh, Venezuela, uh, during protests against the government in February  was blocking online images from users. Pakistan has banned 20 to 40,000 websites, including  YouTube saying they're offensive to Muslims. Facebook blocked for a while. Um, yeah, the,  that to me, that is a measure of how, uh, powerful and good the internet is as a,  as a force for democracy, for, um, you know, freedom.  Yeah. When the, when the tyrants don't like something, that's a good sign.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, that is a good sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You might hope Think Up gets banned there as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's my goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It counts F's. What a terrible thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It used to be, if you're an author, what you really wanted is the Catholic church to ban your book  that would sell copies, baby.  It boosts sales.  Let's see. Should we talk about, uh, classroom a little bit?  Yeah, that looks neat.  Launched yesterday. They announced it at an event some time ago. It's the apps for education tool  to help teachers create and collect assignments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My fellow faculty members immediately were sending an email around saying we want this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it, is it a blackboard replacement? A, a Moodle replacement? What exactly  I don't know.  Does it do? Um, you can create and collect assignments, classroom weaves together,  Google Docs. See, they already, you've already got docs, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've got a lot of people use blackboard is universally despised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody who use it, not only expensive, but everybody uses it hates it.  We use Moodle at our, at the local high school that I'm a part of.  That's an open source project, but that is ugly, a little hard to use.  So, but, and we also use Google Docs. So I think anything that works with Google Docs  would be very powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is an evil conspiracy to get young people on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is the CIA, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, and it sounds like it'll, uh, if you have a lot of assignments,  it'll create folders in Google Drive for like, here's the class period and here's  individual students. So it, you know, what are we doing with paper in 2014?  You know, just even bringing that all in one place is a large amount of progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of funny. Lisa's son, Michael's 11, he's in fifth grade.  He has to do his first research project.  And one of the first things is get the insight. He's doing it on cactuses,  get the encyclopedia interest in the country for cactus. And, uh, that's like,  fortunately back when my kids were that young, uh, I bought a world book encyclopedia in 1995  and I still have it because it's beautiful. It's a,  I just moved it to my office this week so that Michael could get the cactus, the C volume.  And then for a while we subscribed to the yearbook because, you know, of course it's  immediately out of date. So now you have to subscribe to a yearly update of what happened  in 1996, 96, 97, 98, 99. And it just stops at 1999. It's the last one I got. And there's,  so I'm considering an artifact from the previous century.  It's the Y2K problem of knowledge.  It's just nothing. Nothing happened after 1999.  The end of history.  It's beautiful. I got the deluxe edition. It's leather bound. It's gold pages. It's got a little  ribbon. I don't know what I was thinking. I was nuts. It was very expensive, but it's, but you  know what? I'm glad I have it now because it's, it is, it's kind of a little bit of, um, you know  what it was is because when I was a kid in 1965, I read the encyclopedia. I loved it. I would just  take a volume at random. I liked the S volume because it was the biggest and I would just read

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it. And I thought myself the sign language of the alphabet and sign language using like encyclopedia  Britannica, like the blue. Yeah. And I was like nine. I'm just imagining that my daughter is  going to be like, mama, like what was an encyclopedia? I'm waiting for that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I had it here at the office and I had everybody, I said, can you help me guys?  And the, and Russell said, what did you print out? Wikipedia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Times has changed. So this classroom is, you know, the Germans did print out Wikipedia.  What? What for? Uh, one of the publishers there did, uh, did an edited, uh, mended version of  Wikipedia called the Wikipedia lexicon on this very thick book. Wow. Here's the encyclopedia

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Britannica entry for cactus. Look at that. Just get it. They charge you to get to it. They do.  They do. This is just a, a locked sample to continue learning the pay here. Well,  and look, it's got an ad next to it for Vonage. Trip it. Activate your free trial. Members get more  Merrill Lynch. This is sad. This is not the encyclopedia and all in Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right at the top there. Don't be using this. Be using Google and add for Google ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Yeah. It's I kind of, I love books, but I think books are a specialty product now, aren't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they? Yes. Nothing wrong with it. It was a wonderful column by will self in the guardian about the,  this week or at the end of the, of the literary novel. And it's just magnificently overwritten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I hope that literary novel is not dead. Oh, he argues it is because he argues that basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you have to get buried in a narrative and, and readers will not give up the link and the link  will break the narrative. Oh, that's so sad. And he didn't say it really mournfully. He just said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this is the reality. This is going to come as a great shock to Jonathan Franzen. Oh, well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah. Let me take it. So I had his book, the corrections, I guess the one before last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. That was a great book. Well, I talk about getting him, you talk about a lot of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was trying to get through it. I was reading it and then it was in my briefcase on line 11.  Wow. And the book got completely infused with all the dust. Absolutely. Every page was that was the  corrections and the corrections. Right. So I threw it out and then I bought it again and I couldn't  read it anymore. It just seemed self-indulgent to me. And fiction has since. Wow. So it's not the  link. It's 9 11 that killed the book for you. For me, for me. And I also think that he's a little  bit self-indulgent too. I loved his book, the 27th city. I'm still in the blurb on the cover

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  from people magazine. Well, interesting. Cause when I do a search for Jonathan Franzen, I get the  Google books page for the corrections. Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was talking to, I was talking to a friend of mine about like iPad magazines or tablet magazines  and the difference between reading web pages. Like I use Instapaper to save stuff to read later.  And if I'm on the subway and I'm offline and I start looking at my Instapaper queue, I have this  hyperlink anxiety because there are often links that I want to follow and I can't cause I'm offline.  And so what I like about books and magazines that they are, they are contained, right? And like,  it's up to the author to provide all the context in the words in front of me versus just, you know,  kind of linking off and letting me decide. I mean, of course I read like that all day,  but what's nice about the book and the magazine and sort of the contained story is that I don't  have hyperlink anxiety and I can't go off into a million directions. I'm just giving myself over  to the author to take me from point A to point B and give me all the information that I need  in that straight line. And I think that there's value in both ways of reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think sci-fi is going away. I feel like, at least among the most technically  literate folks, people who watch our shows and so forth, we all love sci-fi. We love getting  buried in a sci-fi novel. So I don't, you know, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And fiction is not going away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you said the novel is going away. The literary novel is going away.  Literary novel.  Sci-fi is not literary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was that I was with the other day, whoever bought Harlequin. Oh, it was News Corp. Bought  Harlequin. I was with an executive from News Corp. And the number of romance novels, if you want to  call it fiction of any sort, is just incredible. Hundreds, hundreds of them a year.  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So people like to read fiction.  Just not literary fiction.  Smart.  Highfalutin fiction. So I would say that that isn't link anxiety because why don't you have  link anxiety if you read a Harlequin? I mean, link anxiety is link anxiety. It's just that  people don't have time for highfalutin literature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, part of the argument is, are people willing to do something hard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, definitely not.  Definitely not. Too much work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's funny because I mean, I save stuff to read offline when it's, you know, TLDR,  because it's during my workday, right? Like I can't, it's not a piece of content I can  ingest quickly, you know, while I'm at my computer doing other things.  So it's true that a novel is a much larger, it's a novel to me. It's an escape. It's a vacation,  you know, versus sort of news, news gathering or reading, you know, reading quick essays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He has one of the best leads I've ever read. Let me see if I can do this. And I'll send you to your,  if you happen to be a writer, one of the great Benesongs, look it up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that your personal culture mind is equipped with its own canaries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Holy cow. Wait a minute. I got to parse that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You happen to be a writer. One of the great Benesongs of having children is that your personal  culture mind is equipped with its own canaries.  Yes. Because you've read so many books.  If you tunnel on relentlessly into the future, these little harbingers either  choke on the noxious gases released by the extraction of decadence,  or they thrive in the clean air of what we might call progress. Isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's beautifully written.  Yeah. It's a great piece.  But you know what? Nobody's, this is, this is nothing new. Nobody reads literature.  It's been lamented.  It's always been one, the 1% that have ever read literature. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just as Twitter is declared dead every once a year.  So Twitter's actually dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Didn't you get the memo, Jeff?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It actually, no. Well, the stock market, yeah, the stock market things is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's how you measure its life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah, what is, so what's going on? The stock market apparently doesn't believe that Twitter  is going to, they believe because of its falling growth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Growth was down A, but B, then a whole bunch of insider shares were released,  I think yesterday or day before.  Yeah, they were unlocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're unlocked. So that caused a lot of big sell off.  But the shares were dropping long before, you know, a week before that.  So it's just, I think it's, I think it's an adjustment.  I think Twitter was perhaps overhyped because gosh, you couldn't go five minutes without a TV  show or a magazine or anything or billboard saying hashtag something or other.  And so everybody thought, oh, this is mainstream.  I don't know if it's mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, here's Jimmy.  It's still pretty darn big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's Jimmy Fallon. He does this.  By the way, Jimmy Fallon, the new Tonight Show, does use his Twitter, I think, to great effect.  He plays a game called the hashtag game.  Let's play that.  So he just sent this out.  Let's play the hashtag game.  Tweet out a funny, weird or embarrassing thing your mom has said and tag this with mom quotes  and send them.  What happens is now tomorrow night, the next night, he'll read mom quotes.  They had a funny one.  The last one I saw was a rap.  It was a Kentucky Derby.  It was because it was in the Kentucky Derby day, May 2nd, Kentucky Derby rap.  It was hysterical.  And then they had the roots.  It's his wonderful house band, Rap It.  I don't know what they're going to do with the mom quotes.  Maybe get Jimmy's mom to read them.  They're good.  They do a good job with these, I think.  I think that there's lots of ways Twitter can continue on and monetize,  but maybe it's not.  Maybe it was overhyped.  Or maybe the stock market doesn't know.  Let me ask a question here, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  The story about Loon, Google Loon.  All right.  Not doing its own thing, but now instead...  They're doing the lease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leasing their balloons to the telcos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was depressed by that because I was hoping that Google could provide  Uber Earth competition to those said phone companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of this comes from Astro Teller.  What a great name.  Do you know Astro Matt?  A little bit.  Yeah, he's a great name.  He is the head of Google X, the Google moonshots.  Loon is one of the moonshots.  I guess he was speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt about Google X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's a lot of interesting parts in here.  Now, bear in mind that I don't have any idea what the Loon folks are actually  pursuing on a day-to-day basis, but it might make sense.  If you can cooperate with some telcos, then you can test out the system,  see how it works, work on the navigation of  the balloons, see how long you can hover over a given place or a country  or something like that.  And if you've got seven problems to solve and working with someone takes  one of those problems off so that you can move a little faster,  I think that sounds great.  And then if down the road someone magically, all the FCCs of the world agree  on one communication spectrum that's open that everybody could use,  then you could still explore that down the road.  But just to my uneducated eyes, not knowing anything inside details,  it seems like it's a good way to jumpstart and move a little bit faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's not like they want to give Loon to the telcos.  It's just that for Loon to work, Loon is stratospheric balloons.  They're almost in space.  They're above even the weather that you bounce internet access off of to provide  internet access to places you can't get wires to.  You got to have the internet access coming from somewhere.  It's going to, I mean, unless Google wants to build base stations all over the globe,  but it makes sense to use telcos and others who have the access to provide the connection.  Certainly for testing.  I don't think that means anything.  Don't be depressed, Jeff.  It's okay.  I'm happy now.  It's part of the process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have the Matt Cutts balm on my anxiety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and it doesn't make it reversed at any time, right?  They could decide to solve that problem themselves.  And here's the good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He also said that they are not going to do jet packs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was disappointing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they considered it, but they were loud.  It was louder than having a Harley motorcycle on your back.  And that seemed like a good experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google people, Google jet packs are going to fly over your backyard.  They're going to see everything you see.  It's a privacy violation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's that you're going to crash into the Amazon drones and it's going to be a nightmare.  Falling, burning death falling from the sky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Jeff, just back to Loon for one second.  I'll give you one more piece of balm that make you feel better.  If they're actually working and talking to telcos  and talking about cooperating with them, to me that says,  hey, Loon is still a very high priority.  People are exploring it.  They're seeing how far they can go.  It's much more of a concrete thing than let's see if we can get 100 balloons to stay afloat for so long.  So I take that as a good sign in that direction as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's also a really good quote in here.  Apparently, this is a quote from Mastro.  We thought working with existing telcos and use their spectrum,  buying harmonized spectrum was going to be absolutely critical to the project.  We wanted to get it done before we launched.  They had worked for half a year to get the spectrum deal done.  It worked with a number of large companies to make it work.  Larry Page told the team, I love this quote,  you're going to hit a double.  That's not really interesting.  You're going to be really frustrated.  You're going to be really angry for a week,  but then you'll get creative and you'll come up with a home run.  That's kind of an inspirational thing to say.  I love that.  And Teller does say, indeed, for a week afterwards,  the team was angry and came up with something way better  than just buying a small piece of harmonized spectrum.  Now they use a spectrum that already exists in a given country.  So that's why you have to work with a telco.  But it's interesting because you only get the balloon while it passes over.  They don't stay still.  So as the balloon's passing over, you got it for however long it's in the,  right above you in your airspace, and then it moves on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I thought there was a mesh of them so that you would...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Oh.  Yeah, the idea is you have enough balloons afloat at any given time  with some spacing between them such that you can do the handoff,  just like if you were in a car doing the handoff between cell phone towers or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they get more bandwidth that way too,  because these guys have more bandwidth than Google could have gotten.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But right now...  What's the latency like on these things, have they said?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the latency...  The main thing to know is the latency going 12 miles is so much better  than going up to an actual satellite like DirecTV or something like that.  So it remains to be seen how much you can squeeze out engineering-wise,  but the nice thing is you're only going like 60,000 feet or something like that,  and not thousands and thousands of miles up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We shouldn't do this to you, Matt.  Because I know you come on here as a private citizen.  You do not represent and speak for Google, but I got to ask you.  Google Plus, is it going to stick around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought there was a really good article about how Google Plus,  in a lot of ways, was about trying to get identity situated.  And for a long time, you could come to Google, you could search,  and we didn't know who you were, anything like that.  Only really with Gmail did we start to realize,  you know what, it might be handy to understand who users are,  so that they can log in and stuff.  And so we were always sort of behind.  We never had...  Think about YouTube, bought in 2006, and had a completely different identity system.  So I think what a lot of people overlook is one of the biggest strengths  of Google Plus in my mind is it's caused Google to bring identity  all under the same umbrella so that things are somewhat logical,  rather than just, okay, here's a silo out here in the wilderness  that doesn't have any connection to Google whatsoever.  And I think it's been a huge success in that realm,  and I think Google needed to work on that.  And now I think we can sort of take a look around and figure out,  okay, what's the next big thing that we need from Google Plus?  Do we look at the web?  Do we push within Google to make identity more strengthened?  And I have no idea.  I don't really know what the plan is from that point of view.  But I love Google Plus.  I use it a lot, especially internally.  There's a really thriving discussion on our Google internet,  and intranet.  And so I hope that they keep it around,  and it's healthy for years and years to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  – Good. No, we feel the same way.  And I don't look for Google Plus to become the mass culture hit  that Twitter is.  That's one of the things that makes Twitter unpleasant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  – But it's already bigger than Twitter in people on the street.  – Isn't that funny, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  – Well, and I think, I mean, here we are using Hangouts  to do our radio show, right?  And, you know, I think about photos.  So just getting identity right for those kinds of things  is already much further than Google was before Google Plus.  – Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  – Yes.  – That's a really good point, Matt.  If you did kind of an audit of what Google Plus has added  and this notion of identity across services is added.  And it really, we had a conversation last week  about Facebook breaking up the app.  And Leo, you said that the brilliance of Google  is that it's N number of different services and applications.  But what ties the platform it's really built on is,  uh-oh, our data.  But that's still a good service better.  – Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  – Yeah, and even little things just like the authorship  and on web pages and search results is such a big thing.  And even Google Now, as much as sometimes it does creep me out  how telepathic it is, the fact that I'm signed in across my devices  and Google Now knows that I want to catch the new episode of,  you know, The Good Wife, you know, and now I know that.  I mean, I just, the services are so smart now  and that's because I'm signing in, because I've created contacts,  because I've, you know, my content is travels across products.  – Yeah.  – And Google Plus is really the glue.  – Google Plus is the thing coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  – But we're the true believers.  Doesn't that scare the hell out of everybody else?  Isn't that exactly what people are worried about?  – Yeah.  – I love it when I go, and in fact, we had this discussion on Sunday on Twitter.  So this is good, isn't it?  What is the nightmare scenario you're worried about,  that the ads will be targeted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  – That's ridiculous.  – Right.  You have to do the punch the monkey ads, go back to 1999.  – Yeah, you want to go back to those days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.  Belly fat ads, I don't need any belly fat ads.  I'm perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  – Did you see the article about the woman who conceived she was pregnant  and she decided that she didn't want to be tracked after she read that,  you know, the New York Times article about how Target knew that this woman,  this girl was pregnant before she had told, you know, her family.  And I think it was Janet Vartese,  it was the woman who decided that she was going to be under the radar  about her pregnancy the entire time she used her…

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  – But the irony is she quit Google as a, quote,  conscientious objector, but uses Facebook.  – Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  – Yeah, I have to admit, I read that article and it sounded like she had quit.  She said, I got off Google two years ago when they changed their privacy policies.  So this is what really kind of surprises me.  I'll say surprises because, you know, Google had 60 plus different privacy policies  and that it doesn't make sense to have a whole bunch of silos  and putting it towards one's unified privacy policy is exactly what  Apple and Facebook and a huge number of all these other companies do.  Like it's really correcting a historical artifact.  And, you know, to object to that and say, OK, Google by doing that…  – Oh my God, they unified their…  – Yeah.  So for me, like Google Now and all these things are hugely helpful.  And I understand if people don't want to use them or if they want to disable them,  and we should provide that functionality.  But for me, if the trigger is Google unified its privacy policies,  well, I would rather have one to pay attention to than to have 60 different ones,  you know, one for this product and one for Google Flight Search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  – There's an unstated presumption in this article  that they don't even have to examine this notion that  whatever it is they're collecting this data for, it's bad.  So they don't even have to examine that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  – Which means that knowledge now becomes bad.  It means that having a personal relationship with us becomes bad.  And I yell at media companies for saying we don't know relationships,  we don't know who we serve, we treat everybody as a mass  that's inherently insulting.  We have to start to know people as individuals.  But if this privacy nuttiness goes too far, then that'll be seen as a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  – This is from an article in ThinkProgress.  They said, you said you quit Google products two years ago.  What was the breaking point?  She said, when Google knew I was engaged before anybody else, that did it for me.  What?  How did that happen?  Google reads your emails, reads your chats.  It knows what you're searching for.  It sees we when you're sleeping and knows when you're awake.  And the server is economically incentivized to remember.  So what happened?  She sent an email to somebody using the word engaged  and she saw an engagement ring add.  – That's my guess.  That's my guess.  Yeah.  – And so there's this anthropomorphization that's going on.  – Exactly.  Well said.  Yes.  – Yeah.  I just, but now I admit that even among our sophisticated audience,  and I would say everybody who watches this show and listens to Twitter,  these are among the most sophisticated users,  there is very much this feeling that, well, they're reading my email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  – Well, and I think that makes people who have something that they want to hide  uncomfortable and there's like legitimate times when there is something that you want to hide.  If you don't want people to know that you're pregnant,  I live with a big secret before I came out of my, I came out of the closet.  That was really scary and I lived in constant fear of other people knowing.  So if Google now was selling me two bride cake toppers before I came out of the closet,  that would have freaked me out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  – Yeah, except it wouldn't have been meaningful because no human knew it.  It's just that there was a correlation between a keyword and an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  – But Google's products, I mean, good products, good digital products,  and it kind of anthropomorphized themselves, right?  There's a friendly voice.  – That's a good point.  – I mean, you know, so I'm just, I'm empathetic to both sides here.  Like I really, really see both sides here and I'm split on this a lot.  And I'm trying to sort of just offer the other side of the coin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  – No, it's a good point.  – Let me ask you all a question.  Let me ask you a question.  I'm coming out, I think I mentioned last week,  to speak to the Google Privacy Group, about 300 people in two weeks.  And what I want to say at first is that I think Google has to have the absolute best practices there are.  And then I want to say in the second half, we've got to open up,  we've got to change this discussion from having vaults  to having marketplaces to open our stuff up.  Let's start with the first half.  What would you define as best practices?  What should Google do to bring trust and faith  and recognize the value of doing these things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that opens up a big conversation.  – Let me make it more specific.  Would it be enough for you if Google said,  look, we're never going to out you to a real person or an organization or in any meaningful way.  All that will happen is we will match a keyword in your email to advertising.  But that in no way outs you.  And we promise never to give that information to anybody who can use it.  – Except the NSA and the FBI when they come with a word.  – Well, there's going to be a fudge words, except for governmental.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  – Well, and so I'll throw out a couple quick ones, which are,  I think there ought to be encryption and it ought to be ubiquitous between you and  whoever you're talking to so that someone can't spy in the middle.  We ought to offer options like incognito mode all over the place so that people who want to opt out  or if you're doing a sensitive search.  – But wouldn't that undermine your business model?  – Well, no, that's the thing.  I think if you have an option where you know, hey, you're doing something private,  you can go incognito, then anyone who is savvy enough to care  can go and find that out and use that.  But if people, the vast majority of people,  there have been studies that say they'll tell you their password for a chocolate bar.  If most people don't care, then there's definite value that can be  given to the average person like Google Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  – Well, there was a rumor that Gmail might count as an encryption.  I mean, that you could really could implement that beautifully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  – Right, right. I think that would be fantastic.  And in fact, Gmail tries by default to encrypt mail between Gmail and other providers.  So think like that or make it easier to do PGP and encryption.  And then a dashboard that shows you what you know and gives you the options to delete it.  I think all those things are really good things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  – And you think Google might consider even doing that,  given that it costs money in effect?  It says we're going to give up that opportunity to monetize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  – But trust can be a real competitive advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  – Right, absolutely.  And what I would argue is we actually do relatively good on things.  Like we were some of the first to do encryption.  We offered incognito mode, I think, before maybe even IE released private browsing.  You know, there is a dashboard where you can look at your search history  and all sorts of different stuff about you.  But no matter what, it's interesting that Google gets raked over the coals for things like,  people say, oh, you're in bed with the NSA.  Like, you know, this Al Jazeera article just came out that said, oh,  Google is doing some special thing with the NSA.  And then you read the article and Google CEO got invited to a security summit and he said no.  And that is literally all that was in that particular article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  – Exclusive. Emails reveal close Google relationships with…  – With NSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  – Hi, nice to talk to you. Thanks. But no, I can't do that.  – Well, right.  – There's a push off email from Eric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  – Exactly. And to be clear, like if the NSA, you know, the NSA's job is both to,  you know, spy for the US government, but also in theory to protect  US corporations from being spied on.  And if in part of that mission they were going to tell companies,  you know, hey, here's this potential zero day or here's this potential hole.  Could you close it?  Like that is a good communication.  That is something you want every company to listen and hear, oh, you know, there might be,  you know, hackers from a different country trying to exploit your service.  That is the sort of thing that most people would be happy their tax dollars are going for.  – It's so funny, the article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Schmidt was unable to attend the security meeting, but here's what he wrote.  General Keith, so great to see you.  I'm unlikely to be in California that week, so I'm sorry I can't attend.  Would love to see you another time. Thank you.  – Yeah.  – Smoking gun!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  – It's probably a, that guy, Eric gets so many invitations on so many things.  – I would hope that he has enough social grace to say no politely like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  – It's probably a memory key on his keyboard, F9.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  – Yeah, gee, I'm really sorry, but I'm not going to be anywhere near you anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I write that all the time.  No, I can't, I'm not going to say, no, I can't be in your stinking podcast.  See, I'm very busy.  – I don't want to have you on me.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't want to have you on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  – I'm very busy, but I look forward to seeing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  – I don't want to have you on me. I don't want to get near you.  – Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  – Well, and let me just say, if the, if a government agency was offering ways to secure  Google services, you know, I think it's great if Google were to participate in that sort of forum,  as long as the communications were going one way towards the companies to help them out.  – Absolutely.  – And even if you talk, you'd need to take it with a grain of salt, right?  We now know that the NSA subverted NIST official documents for how to do encryption by  proposing bad standards that they had a backdoor or they could crack more quickly.  So no matter what, with any source, you're going to take it with a grain of salt.  But in general, if someone is, you know, willing to provide you with potential feedback that it  can prove your services, you want to listen to that.  – So, Gina, given…

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  – Isn't the other part of that, Matt, isn't it also true that if Google knew there was a  threat out there, it has a moral obligation to tell other tech companies and the government?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  – Well, and that happened with the Heartbleed bug that somebody, you know, somebody noticed that,  and they were going through all the proper channels.  And I think the news leaked earlier than it was expected to, so you didn't have time to alert  everybody. And when you've got something that big, you can't alert everyone without the news  leaking at some point. But I believe Google was going through all the right responsible disclosure

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  procedures.  – So does that, Gina, would that be enough to say,  we'll give you encryption if you want it, we'll give you private browsing if you want it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  – And we'll give you the dashboard, let you take out anything that we think we know about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  – That's one criticism people have of the current Google dashboard. It doesn't let you  delete everything. I don't know if that's the case or not. Would that be enough, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  – Yeah, I think that's a good start. I think it's a good start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  – Let's say you were living in a country where you could be arrested for being gay. Oh, wait a  minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  – I wouldn't use the internet. I mean, really, I would try my best. Yes, if there was a place  where I could be harmed or killed or arrested or whatever, and there are those places. Yeah,  I mean, I use Tor a whole lot and I just wouldn't use the web. I mean, I would come up with  code words and that's what people do, right? They come up with words and phrases that mean  other things or whatever. I mean, I'd be really, really, really, really paranoid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  – Well, just using Tor alone is a signal, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  – Well, right. I mean, and that was one of the points that Janet made in her piece was like,  I was using cash to buy baby things and missing out on discounts that you get with those cards  at Target or whatever. And just the fact that I was using those things made me look weird. I mean,  it made me a target alone, just the fact that I was using privacy tools. I thought another  interesting point that she made is that she asked her friends and family when she called them or  talked to them in person and said, hey, I'm pregnant. She asked them not to post it on  Facebook. And so they wouldn't post to her wall, but they would Facebook message her  about being pregnant. And she said, hey, I said not to put this on Facebook. And they're like,  oh, no, but that's why I didn't put it on your wall. So regular users' conception of putting it  on Facebook was the wall, but that private Facebook messages seemed like a private channel to them.  Or I think that this is just a perception, a misconception that people have, the idea that  Gmail is private or that Facebook or Google doesn't have access to your Gmail is absolutely  not true. So there's an education aspect around it as well. I love it that by the way that I read

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this article on ThinkProgress and get a pop-up that says, like ThinkProgress on Facebook.  Share this on Google+. I do, I get all of that. Put this on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And to be fair, I don't think it's fair to beat up Gina on this because I think she's absolutely  right in that she is channeling a large percentage of people who feel that way. And to be fair,  there's a large chunk of people who have been surprised by the revelations about the NSA in  the last year and are concerned with validity. And if you haven't been someone who's been paying  deep detailed attention to like, oh, when did Google roll out its encryption and all that  sort of stuff, then it's a relatively understandable strategy to be like, okay, I'm concerned about  Google and I'm just going to put that in a box and I'll act accordingly. And if people want to dig  all the way in, then they can find out we've fought against Department of Justice subpoenas  that were very broad and stuff like that. But it's natural that given some of the news over  the last year, people would be worried. And how we address that and tackle that and educate it  and how we respond to it and what we do better, you know, is a very fair question and something

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we need to think about. We're going to take a break when we come back. The change log will  put Gina to work with all the new changes quite a bit going on this week. Yeah, with the Google.  Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter. If you work in a company, if you're in HR, if you  need to hire, you know that the that's kind of the word.

Jason, do you know where the trumpets

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  are kept? Oh, I got this. I've been waiting the full episode to do that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A bunch of new cards and improvements to Google Now coming out this week. First,  Google Now now works offline. So if you don't have an internet connection, you'll still see your  Google Now cards, your appointments and all the other reminders. And at the top, it'll show you  when was last time this was updated. That's great. Indoor maps and mall directories are now in Google  Now for Android. So if you go to the mall, you'll be able to find where that store is located,  what floor and which way you got to go. And related to that, if you search for a product on Google,  you know, you're looking for a pair of boots or crib or a stroller. Talk about telepathy. Google  will now let you know if the product you search for, if you're near a store, if it's in the store,  the product you search by is nearby. And where the deals are. That's valuable to me. That's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Schmidt was talking about when he said you'd be walking down the street and say, oh, you need  pants? They're right there. That is pretty amazing. I think that's useful. And I don't think it comes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  at the cost of any real personal information. You know, those programmatic ads that come after you,  if you looked at a canoe on Amazon that followed you around for three weeks, my fear is if I just  happen to look up one thing, it's going to be constantly telling me you're near a Radio Shack.  They have phones. They got phones. More phones here. Phones there. From experience, we know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google now is very easy to say, I don't want to know this anymore. Like for instance, I searched  for Jeopardy once, the TV show. And for a while I was saying Jeopardy's on. And finally I said,  okay, really? You know what? I don't really care. But you go in and you change it. And you says,  literally it says, I don't care about Jeopardy. And it goes, okay, fine. Yeah, you get the, is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  this useful? Is this card useful right now? And you can just say yes or no, or you can just swipe  and I'll say, okay, done for now. Good. Good to go. It's, it's, it doesn't feel. I love now. I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want, let me make clear here. I want more now cards. I want more now. Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, see it says, interested in Jeopardy episodes? No, no. Interested in community. This  was the weird one for a while. I don't know why it was telling me random people's commute updates.  And I don't know what it says. Are you interested in community? Commute updates for Dennis Appleton  Nielsen? It was tied into ways. I'll bet. I don't know why. I don't know who this guy is. He must

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  be in my circles. Maybe, yeah, maybe they've turned on commute sharing with you. And this is like your  way of accepting it. I have no idea. So yeah, there's commute sharing. Yeah. It's one of the  stupidest features of ways is that I really don't care when Joe Schmo starts driving to work. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know what? You might care what your wife's commute is. Like your wife's coming home from  work and you want to know when to put the Brussels sprouts on. And that's exactly how I use it for  Brussels sprouts. Yeah. Because God, you cannot cook those things long enough. I'll go on my way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  then and pick up my own dinner on the way home because Brussels sprouts are a nuclear accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hopefully. They need a Google Now card that says time to put Brussels sprouts. If you're cooking  Brussels sprouts tonight, you should put them on now. It should go off at 7 a.m. Yeah. Start cooking

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  now. Well, you know you got Brussels sprouts delivered by Google delivery yesterday. And they go bad in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  three days. Ergo, you need to put them now. That's the trick on this. There's a lot of things that  would be useful. They need to, you know, I think they're going to need to come up with a better way  of managing the signals you send Google now as they get more and more signals in here.  I mean, already I've got 16 different items in my everything else category. Well, including Leo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sometimes I want to send them more signals. I want to choose. This is something that I'm actually  looking for. I'm looking for this kind of shoe. And then not only do I want Google Now to tell me,  but I do want the merchants to compete for my business and say, here's the best deals.  Right. And Google could be, this is the opposite end of the privacy discussion.  I think that Google could be a conduit for signal sharing in a wider market. It's all about control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just give me good. Yes. Well, that's what I mean. Similar to what they do with TV shows. Now,  if you search for a TV show, it'll say, remind me of new episodes. And you can say yes or not. And  it seems like products could be kind of implemented a similar way. The thing about Google Now, we were  just talking about this last night, which Jason and I were talking about it last night on all  about Android is how it's kind of like consumer, you know, subsumer superseding all these like little  apps, you know, the remembering where you're parked and, you know, what TV shows you'd be  interested in. I mean, it's wonderful because it's all in one place and it's this like key,  you know, piece of UI that's part of my phone. I mean, literally I look at Google Now first thing  in the morning and, you know, before I go to bed at night, you know, I look at the weather and  whatever. But it is kind of, you know, you're not going to these other apps to do these things,  right? Which is kind of nice because it opens up any developers to work on other things, but also  not so great if you made a parking app, right? But it's interesting to see Google Now sort of  gobble up that functionality and just present it all in this one interface that you know we're  going to see on our watches and on our, you know, eyeglasses and whatever else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would honestly be happy if I could just, you know, sometimes Google Now is like,  do you want to use your corp account or your personal account? And I'm like,  Oh, yes, yes, I am me. I have all these accounts. Listen, you're the all powerful wizard, Matt cuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And to IO, okay, you have proven your power on earth. You once and for all solve this problem.  I want Google smart. Damn it. I have two accounts. I'm the same person. Google. Can I just tell you  that I'm the same person? I'd start to be nuts. Yeah, I agree. And every time I've heard you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  complain about Google Now, I'm off on a run and I'm like, there's something wrong with Google apps  for domain names and it's on the wrong account. And I think personally, it shows that Google  historically has been like, you tell us what you want, we'll give you the answer. And we haven't  really had that great of account functionality. And Google Plus and all that stuff has gotten us  a lot further. But it's still like, yep, you can have you. We have both kinds of country,  both kinds of music, country and Western. But I like country Western, you know, show me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a hard problem. I understand. I know. It's amazing how well you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't let them off the hook. Don't be a nice guy. Don't let them off the hook. They can figure this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  out. Yeah, I agree. And you know, you ought to have capabilities if you work at Google and that's  your corp account. And then when you leave Google, you ought to lose those capabilities, but it  shouldn't be the end of the world. Yeah, you shouldn't lose your search history or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I wish I had those capabilities. I just searched for a TV show and in the knowledge graph or  whatever you guys call I can't remember the card that comes up on the right. Remind me about new  episodes. I can click that and that'll just show up in Google now. That's a really nice and it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  not turned on unless I turn it on. And it's great for upcoming movies. I go, yeah, I really want to  see the new Hunger Games movie when it comes out. Just tell me, you know, because I don't have a  baby. I don't get to pay attention to that anymore. Yeah, that's really great. By the way, do you watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Orphan Black, Leo? I do. I love it. It's really good. I don't have time to watch all the good TV  now. All of a sudden TV got really good. Yeah. Yeah. Sunday nights are jam packed. I will be able

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to download those shows onto my Chromebook Pixel on my beautiful clear screen. And then Leo can

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  watch Big Bang Theory. All right, before we get into the Big Bang Theory conversation again,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  let me carry on with the change. You have been listening. See, I told you Google knows too much

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about you. Yeah, it's not because he's watching the show, Leo. That is big data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google Maps got a big update rolling out now on Android lane guidance. Tells you which  lane you should be in before you make that turn. Why didn't other things do that? I just, it's so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  obvious. Getting the left lane now, you're going to be turning left. The lane I should be on for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the Bay Bridge is the one that gets me off before the bridge because I'm scared of it. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, for all of us, because there is that particular on-ramp, if you get on that,  you can't get off. You're going to Oakland. You can do better. You can now save maps to use

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  offline. So are you going camping? You know, in some places not a lot of connectivity. You can  save maps for offline use. You got better filters for finding businesses when you need them. So,  you know, what is that bar open or shut now open or closed right now? And this is really interesting.  Uber app integration will compare transit and walking directions with Uber access in cities  where Uber supported and only if you have the Uber app installed. Oh, you have to have the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uber app installed. Yeah. Fascinating that Uber has an official position here. Yeah. Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why not Lyft? Why not? I don't. Why Uber? And Google did invest in Uber. So they're going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  get some crap. Oh, okay. Well, there you go. Yeah. Google ventures more than 150 million, I think,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  into Uber. Really, really interesting. A little weird, I thought, the Uber integration there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But everybody loves Uber. So, it's convenient. Well, not the taxi commission in New York, LA,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  San Francisco. Finally, Google shopping express came to Manhattan and West Los Angeles this week.  And in fact, I was at the think up office on Monday, and I decided to try it out. And it was  great. I loved it. I ordered up some snacks for the for the office. And it got super overloaded  the first day in Manhattan. So I didn't get a delivery time on Monday, but it came the next day.  But the whole idea is that you can order stuff and get same day delivery from major retailers,  Target, Fairway, etc. First orders get 10 bucks off. That was a nice discount. And there and  Google's offer also offering, I think it's a six month free subscription for unlimited free  deliveries. So really nice. It's not in Brooklyn yet, but it's coming to Brooklyn and Queens soon.  So I'm excited to impress my wife with with that when that happens. Diapers, diapers at the door.  Well, you know, we do, we do Amazon mom, we have like a, you know, it's basically Amazon Prime,  but like a subscribe and save, which is like, send us three boxes of diapers every couple months.  Yeah, which is fantastic. I love the size automatically. No, they don't up the size.  They don't up the size. And in fact, I got a bunch of boxes that were too small because my daughter  is growing like a weed. But yeah, I mean, especially ever since we had the baby, I realized how much we  just have this parade of delivery people coming to our door because we just don't have the time to go  shopping as much. So I think this is good, really good business for Google. And it'll be interesting  to see how they stack up, you know, against Amazon. You saw the, what was the dry goods play that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that Amazon's doing? It's you get for six bucks, you get a 45 pound box.  Did you see that? I didn't. It's like a partner to, it's called Prime Box. I can't remember. I'll have  to search for it. It's kind of a Amazon Prime Pantry. Thank you. Very good. Jason Howell for the win.  Six bucks, 45 pound box. And it's basically groceries. It's grocery shopping.  Wow. Wow. There you go. Yeah. Amazon. It's good. Let them battle. That's good.  Let the battles begin. Yeah. Yeah. Safe. We get in there and everybody else. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's going to be a crash of retail real estate in this country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd hate to be, I'd hate to be in, you know, in a brick and mortar store at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a little scary. But shopping express actually, I mean, it is local retail. I mean,  from what I can tell, it's like a guy in a cap with a truck that goes to the target for you and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  brings it to you. Right. And they bought all those old Cosmo bicycles that were lying around  with the big baskets, I hope. Grocery stores used to do that. There used to be a milkman.  You're too young to remember this, but the milkman comes to your door. The East Coast Leo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a chip delivery guy, Charlie's chips. All he did was deliver pretzels and chips.  The chip man's here. Yeah. Imagine that. I have the, I have Union County booked up. I've got every

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  chip. I remember that you had to remember the night before, I think it was Tuesday night,  you had to put the milk delivery out in the, and the empties in the box. And then the milkman had  come and he put the milk and then they, you knew they were in trouble when they started selling  milk shampoo. That was like, Oh,  oh, that doesn't seem like a good thing. Sorry. That was, that's all I got. That was ladies and  gentlemen. Now, Jason, you know where the Timps are? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Bring it in.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what, Gina, you might as well throw in the Google camera update that hit today.  Is there an update? There's an update that allows you to  take pictures while you're shooting video. So they added, Oh, that's like a Zoe a little bit.  Well, no, no, no. So, so you're shooting a video and you can actually also take pictures at the  same time. Wow. But that was unintentional. Sorry about that. Thank you, Jason.  Leo, I have to go in five minutes, but I want to make sure I got in. I told you to 15.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You told me, when did you tell me that? That's okay. You can go anytime you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just want to make sure before I leave that, that there's a whole mess of new Chromebooks coming out.  Yeah. Intel's doing some. Intel's doing lots of them. They did an announcement.  That's why I complained about Acer not having enough new Chromebooks because I was wrong,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because they have two more new ones now. Yeah. So I feel bad now because I'm starting  to come around on the Chromebook thing. I wouldn't buy one. Come on in, the water's fine.  I wouldn't buy one, but I think I understand why a school would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's phenomenal for schools. I shock even Googlers. I've been in the room with Googlers  and I pointed out that Pixel's my only machine. Even they look at me funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pixel is my primary for almost a year now. So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. See, I wouldn't go that far. I think that's crazy talk, but more and more and more we get  calls. Like on the radio show from people, I had a call. Oh, I felt so bad for. Very nice person.  Just couldn't, you know, Windows 8 was not updating and she couldn't, she didn't, it was clear. She had  no idea what a computer did or anything, but she had to have one, right? You have to have one.  I said, what do you do? She said, well, I do some email and I, you know, we surf and my,  my husband balances the checkbook. And I more and more I'm saying to normal people,  you don't need the complexity of a computer. Right. You need a Chromebook. I mean, there are  other people like me who need the complexity of a computer and can handle it. But a lot of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  can't. There's also things like my parents and, and viruses. All that's gone. She couldn't figure

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  out how to turn this thing off. Seriously. And you know what? It's not easy in Windows 8. And she said,  the guy told me to press the moon button. That's it. That's all she knew. So Chromebook would be,  but it's hard, but this is the problem. And I think Microsoft's responding to this by making  Chromebook like, I think they're gonna make Chromebook like Windows machines. But the,  the problem is that people say, oh, well, no, a computer equals Windows. That that's, those are  the same. It's a personal computer. It runs Windows. And so it's hard to convince them that a tablet  will work. And in many cases, maybe they do need a keyboard or if not a tablet and a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A new Chrome desktop machine. Yeah. Having Intel inside helps.  I think it does. Yeah. And there's up to 11 hours on some machines. The thing is the pixel to me is  the perfect combination. Good screen, touchscreen, and LTE. But it's way too expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But it's to demonstrate the idea. And if you were to get a Haswell chip in there,  so the battery lasts a little longer. Oh, oh, my heart would. Matt, Matt. All right. So, so going

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  back to the power of Matt, you got Gina into IO, you're going to fix this identity thing. You're  going to make sure that you come out with the next generation Chromebook. Okay. Pixel. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I promise. I've been asking for Haswell Chromebooks, like as soon as they came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got the sense that that's not a product. The pixel is not really a product. It's just,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it was a proof of concept. I love this thing. And I would buy that in a second. Me too. A reference

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  device. I like that Matt has a honeydew list now. Now next time, Matt, you're up there with Larry

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and Sergey. Would you do me a favor? I'll just put it on the twiggy-doo list. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got to go guys. All right. Thank you, Jeff. Give my best to Warren and Bill in the game.

Matt Cutts is here. He is the man who fights spam for Google on the web search results.  Great to have. Can you see his video? I got to... So the best thing that he does is the Webmaster  Tools. It's Google.com. Not the best thing, but the thing, the public facing thing you do that we  love. You probably do very important things that we don't know about. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In my mind, Matt is like Rocky. Like because you're always running while you're listening to  Twig, it's always... I think of the Rocky song. I love it. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He posted... Let me see if I can find this. You got a lot of attention for this, even though,  frankly, I think most SEO types should know by now that the body is the most important part of  your content, not those meta tags. People don't still do that in the meta tags and the header  and all that stuff. Yeah, you'd think. It's kind of amazing. But you know what? I think  your most recent video really gets that point across. I just wanted you to remember that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's important to pay attention to the head of a document, but you should also pay attention to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the body. Shouldn't your head be missing and only your body be there? Meta tags, all that sort of  stuff. So what are you wearing? He said he's wearing a green suit. Yeah, I do have a green  green suit that I use on such occasions, you know, for Halloween and that kind of stuff. That is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  awesome. Do you have a head piece too, if you want to be completely invisible? Yeah, it was actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  flipped over on the back. So I could go visit Microsoft. And by the way, I think that's a  pixel. Yeah, everyone's hand will show up. I can't stop talking with my hands. You'll see  invisibility go in front of my face every so often. And he's got a pixel in front of him,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  by the way. I think we noticed that. Google.com slash webmasters. I can't believe that there'd  be anybody who wouldn't know this. Yeah, there probably are. Well, there are people who literally

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  believe in a meta tag called the Google Prey meta tag. What? And the idea is, it's a joke. You know,  somebody made it up. But if it gets repeated enough online, people are like, oh, did you add  your Google Prey meta tag? And it's like, Google Prey make me number one or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like, pray like prayer? Yeah. So not pray like, like, like hunted. No, no, no, not like hunted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. So there's a lot of misconceptions to debunk. Some people still think we use meta keywords for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  web ranking and we just don't. We really don't. Here it is. Here's an article on the Google Prey  meta tag. Google Prey. Google, please rate me high by keyword you max search.  Is that the weirdest thing that you've ever seen? No, not even close. I mean, there's a whole church

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of Google. I mean, it's crazy. So is the church of Google populated by SEOs? No, no, it was,  it was a few years ago. I think it's died off. We worship you. Oh, church. Yeah. The church of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google.org. It's the, it's the home of Google ism. Yeah. Wow. Of course it says, join us on Reddit.  So there may be a little confused. We at the church of Google believe the search engine,  Google is the closest humankind has ever come to directly experiencing an actual God. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can tell that's from a few years ago. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So give me an example of something else crazy people have done to get number one on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, people try all kinds of tricks. You know, they're convinced if you buy ads,  you'll rank number one. And then there's other competing theories that say if you buy ads,  we'll demote you. And you just want to get all those conspiracy theorists in a room and let them  fight it out. And like, okay, you guys decide. And then whoever comes out will debunk that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  misconception. Because there's so many. There really is. Here's the prayer, by the way,  you should put this. I have heard if you put this in your meta tag, all your hopes and prayers will  be realized. Yeah. Our Google who art in cyberspace hallowed be thy domain. Thy search to come,  thy results be done on 127.0.0.1 as it is in the Googleplex. Give us this day our daily searches  and forgive us our spam as we forgive those who spam against us and lead us not into temptation,  but deliver us from Microsoft for thine is the search engine and the power and the glory  forever and ever. Amen. And there it is in binary. In binary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The weird thing is there are people who are literally creating new misconceptions. So I  don't know if you saw last week, there was somebody who claimed to be a former Google employee in  AdSense. And you read through it and you're like, there's no way this person worked for Google.  Every single thing about it is wrong. The terminology is wrong. None of the terms make sense.  You double check with the ads team and they're like, we don't have any color coding scheme the  way they imply. If you're a real employee, it's not hard to prove that you used to be an employee.  You could say, hey, Charlie's Cafe, that electric door on the left, it sticks a little bit.  That would do it. That was enough to prove it, right? And yet this paste bin anonymous thing is like  Google is trying to cut off publishers to save the money for itself. Well, we actually refund that  money to publishers. So you've got like some weird people who are just like, okay, I'm disgruntled.  I'm unhappy with one part of Google. So I'm going to lie and say I used to work there.  And here's all these things that people who don't know better might believe. It's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A couple of three actually Google acquisitions, little ones.  Adometry, an online attribution firm. I don't know what Adometry does. I don't even know how to say it,  but Google has acquired them to give advertisers a better sense of how their online ad campaigns  are working. It's an ad metrics play. Stackdriver and a cloud analysis tool. But my favorite is  Appitas or Appitas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If Google can bring better restaurant websites to the world, that's good work right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Beautiful website restaurant. So it's a provider that does  website restaurants websites, integrating Grubhub, OpenTable, Appitas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No more flash.  Appitas.  No more images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Images instead of text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's like a Squarespace for restaurants. Yeah, that's nice.  Yeah, a lot of, you know what, somebody's got to do this for radio stations. I think somebody did  in the end, but whoever it is has no taste. I've never seen more ugly websites than radio station  websites. They're the worst.  Yeah. It's like black background. It's really bad.  Oh, and like, and well, I guess because radio stations have so many ads,  they're all, they're all, they're all jingly and I shouldn't pick on this station. I just  entered in some magic call sign and I found this. This is a very typical radio station website.  Did you find the content? Good luck.  Yeah.  I mean, they're all horrible. I hope this is not one of my affiliates.  But I, but these guys could do a better job. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To go back to the head and body thing though, briefly, I, we just enabled Twitter cards and  like the OG, the meta tags and the OG, the open graph tags for sharing content on like on different  social networks on Google plus on Facebook and Twitter cards in particular. And it was really  the first time, the first time I've looked at the head of think ups pages in a really long time,  because it's, you know, it seems obvious that it's the content that that really matters. But I  think some of that, that, that those sharing hooks, that little, you know, snippet that you  see with the image and whatever other metadata you see like in a, in a shared social post that  has to help a little bit. I mean, I like to think that, you know, Google's, you know, crawlers are  getting decent data from those head tags just because, you know, people are hooking up sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Throw it out, right? I mean, yeah, yeah. So in, and in fact, if you do a search for Google  webmaster meta tags, there's a, there's an official document that says meta tags that Google  understands. And we go through that in more detail. The main one is everybody thinks that if I throw  some keywords in the meta keywords tag, that's going to help. And that doesn't help. So if we  could just shift that focus to like, you know, using schema.org or some of these, you know,  other ways of describing what you can or can't share or what's on the page, that, that stuff  could potentially be useful. It's just, we don't use the keywords tag because it's been so span.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. But things like real, really, real, real equals author. Those are, that's a really useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thing. Yeah. I mean, I use that. Yeah. Real what? Real canonical. So you can say this URL is here,  but it should be over here. And that gives Google a great hint to say, show this URL instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And again, this is all described. All of these are described at the webmasters tools page. So  here's the canonical URL explanation. This is, this is, you would think everybody would know this.  Yeah. And actually here's the, here's the page meta tags. Google understands with Mac cuts, many  moons ago, that is a, that is a very young and somewhat larger Mac cuts. I didn't have gray hair  back then. You know, you're lucky though, when your videos, you look fatter in your old videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good. That's what you want. The directional trend is the right direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The right direction. I look so much thinner in my old videos. It's very depressing.  I don't care about hair color. You always want to look fatter in the old videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I only do head and shoulders here. Yeah. You're smart. There is no record

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of any of this. So I don't know whether to believe this or not. This was quite a scandalous  article in all things on the digits blog and that W I almost said all things D and the digits blog  in the wall street journal, the Google glass parts estimated to cost what less than 80 bucks  for a $1,500 product. This is from tech insights, teardown.com. Google has said that's absolutely  nuts, but they didn't say how much it does cost. And I know you don't know because you didn't build  glass mat cut. So I'm not asking you. But boy, if that's the case, now some have said, well,  we want to Google glass to cost, somebody said we want to Google glass to cost a painful amount so  that people will be serious about buying it if you want to be an explorer. We know the explorer

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  editions price was pumped up a bit. But that's more than a bit. I hope it's not $1,420 bit.  There's no way. There's no way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and I'm sure that they say, oh, this is, you know, 20 cents worth of plastic,  but if you're doing a small limited run doing the injection molding or whatever,  the plastic, that's actually a pretty large cost to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say the most expensive component is the processor. The TIO map 4430 applications  processor. That's an arm chip. $13.96. 16 gigs of NAND memory from Toshiba, $8.  But you're right. You don't that doesn't take into account R&D that doesn't take into account  custom stuff, molds and so forth. Actually, this could be good news. If you were hoping for a  consumer release of glass, it means if this is, you know, maybe when they did do maybe it does  cost 80 bucks if you made a million of them. That could be good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, in which case glass might be affordable. I mean, you know, that would be a good thing.  Right. When it comes out publicly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, do we care about Foursquare separating its app? You know, it's a funny thing on the Yelp.  When the Yelp pushed the update, it said we're working really hard to keep all of our stuff in  one app. Obviously a little bit of a little. I mean, I think the trend is worth commenting on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we actually talked about it in last week's episode. It's interesting to see this sort of  unbundling. So we have Foursquare splitting its app into a check in app and then to a  recommendations app. We see Dropbox making Carousel. And what was the other one that Dropbox did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought there was another Dropbox app. Evernote's done this for a long time. Evernote

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  has Food and Hello. Evernote Food and Hello. And even Google did it with Drive. So  Yeah, I don't really understand that one. That's kind of weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it is a little weird. They took an editing capability out of Drive and put it into Docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's a Sheets app and a Docs app for editing and then Drive for browsing your files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My naive take on that is that when you say Google Drive, people think of some places to store stuff.  Right. And so there might have been some mismatch where people are like, oh, Google Docs. I can  understand that. That's where I edit my docs. And so maybe they were trying to bring that more  closely in line with users' expectations of what they thought the app would do. You know, if you're  just looking at an icon and a name, you're like, oh, okay, this is where I'll go to edit my Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Docs. JC Calhoun has created a new verb for this kind of thing. It's called quick stirring yourself.  Because remember Netflix was going to divide itself up into streaming and disk business.  And one of them was called Quickster, which didn't last. That's not a positive association.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You've been Quickstered. No. You've been Quickstered. Quickster doesn't exist anymore.  And of course, I did mention Facebook separating out message from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, Facebook's doing it. Right. They're being Quickstered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm very curious to get your take on a story. There was this article on ZDNet about Google  experimenting with hiding URLs in Chrome. I saw that. You know, it's funny because I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  remember talking to Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented URLs and incidentally the World Wide  Web. You might have heard of it. And he said, I never thought humans would look at URLs at all.  The URL scheme was really designed to be machine readable. And he just never thought people would  say anything like www.google.com. He thought that's not going to happen. So how is Chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  doing this? Well, so this I think is in a canary. And essentially what it does is there's a chip.  I think it's called the Origin chip. And it shows you just the domain name of the URL.  And then I assume you can click and get more information if you want to.  And there's pros and cons. It's very rare you see people from Google sort of disagree outside of  Google. But I think Paul Irish has said, oh, I hope this doesn't happen. And meanwhile,  Jake Archibald, who's also at Google, has said, oh, this can help with phishing.  So that sort of shows that people have different points of view on this. And I was kind of curious,  what would you guys think if Google started to show this Origin chip instead of the URL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That makes sense. The idea being because a URL is so complex, people often misread it.  So they think they're going to www.google.com when instead they're going to www.google.hacker.com.  And so by making it more clear as being the real URL. But I'm looking at these examples  from the Jake's blog. I can't tell the difference. I don't understand which is which.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, one is Halifax.co.uk and the other one is Halifax.co.uk.creditcards.whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You keep going until you get to the com part. Yeah, to the slash.  Well, I've seen that. I mean, this happens all the time with phishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, I really, I'm kind of split on this. I mean, on one hand,  I really like the idea that a user doesn't have to deal with the URL. And I really like the changes  that Chrome has made to URLs thus far, like hiding the HTTP and, you know, graying out the path.  Whereas the domain is black. I really like that. So that's happened kind of slowly over time. It's  like, oh yeah, why do you not need to see HTTP or HTTPS and the lock, you know, indicate HTTPS.  And so this seems like a natural progression. This feels like the same kind of debate that  people have about whether or not the file system path should be exposed to the user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently iOS, I didn't notice, but Safari and iOS 7 does that. So here's the example on that,  where it just shows the top domain. It doesn't even show the extended domain. You'd have to tap  it to see more. That's a good way to do it. At the same time, you know, when you're dealing,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, particularly someone like me who's coming from being, you know, being a blogger where like  the idea of a permalink or, you know, the full URL was sort of very, very important. The idea  of sharing URLs or sharing pieces of content or a piece of content is assigned to a particular URL  that if it's, you know, structured well, it actually does read well and mean something.  But that's part of the problem is that a lot of URLs are not well structured.  Well, right. A lot of URLs aren't. So if this change were to happen, I wouldn't be  totally against it, but there would have to be a piece of UI that made it really easy to share

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a permanent link to a piece of content. Yeah. What happens if you copy it in order to share it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would copy the full URL. Yeah, I'm sure it would. Yeah. But I'm with you, Gina. I'm really  torn because as a power user, I really want to know what the full URL is. But I can see, you know,  for an average person who doesn't need all those details and might get fished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's other ways to fish. You know, I was fished on Twitter a couple of years ago. I didn't fall  for it, but it had a link to TVV ITTER, which looks like Twitter, if you type it out. And it  was by chance, I think that I noticed that that wasn't Twitter. It was a login page and everything.  So there's other ways besides having a obfuscated URL. People start using bit.ly and other stuff,  you know, they'll just mess with it. I don't think it's a bad idea to syntax highlight. We  could agree that would be okay, right? Yeah. Yeah. Top level domain. Interesting. Anything  else? Thank you, Matt, for asking about that. I'm glad. Yeah, we were gonna. I was curious.  I wanted to talk about that. Tim, you know, it was never the plan to see these things.  He thought only the machine would see it. I don't know what he thought the humans would see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's crazy. And now I say things in conversation like nope.com, which my daughter  is picking up. Really? Oh, that's cute. You know, when we're, we don't want to say no anymore. So  you say no.com slash never gonna happen. It's really works its way into the culture. Yeah,  it works its way into the culture. Exactly. Yeah. There was one interesting story about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the observations of an internet middleman. Yeah, this one, I actually tweeted this out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because I thought this was really great. Mark Taylor writing at level three. You know, the  debate is on about open internet about what the FCC is doing or not doing to protect the internet  about the idea of charging access fees for edge providers, things like that. But this really puts  some facts into the argument because one of the things we had a big argument, I had an argument  with Brian Brushwood, who has a libertarian streak on Twitter this Sunday, he said, you don't want  regulation of any kind. But when you have companies acting so anti competitively, maybe you have to.  So level three, who that they're an intermediate internet provider, they provide big connections  to big networks. And they have a lot of peering relationships, 51 peering relationships, that's  how they get access to the rest of the internet. So if, if you're Google uses level three, if you're  google.com, you get onto the internet via level three, they need to still get you to other places  that aren't customers. They do that by having relationships with other big backbone providers  who have relationships with their customers. So it turns out that by having 51 peers in 45 cities,  they're able to reach the world, the entire internet, 13.8 gigabits per second and bandwidth  going through all of these points. They say the this is actually it sounds technical. This is very  readable. Mark does a great job of explaining this. Read the article, you don't have to be a geek to  understand it. He says the average number of interconnection cities per peer is five, but  ranges from one to 20. But there's a little bit of an interesting thing happening with six  companies, five in the US one in Europe, they're all six of them broadband providers.  I think if you've got five in the US, you could probably name them Comcast, Time Warner, Verizon,  AT&T. He doesn't. He doesn't. In fact, he obfuscates the information. But what he does show is a graph.  He says normally in peering relationships, it's not unusual in a peering relationship  for these switches to get saturated as traffic, you know, traffic moves around on the internet,  they get saturated. And what everybody does, everybody in the business does is they put more  equipment on. What you're seeing here is a graph of saturation happening, a 100 gigabit connection.  Let's see, this is I'm sorry, this is 100 gigabit interconnect in Dallas for the week of April 3.  You see those flat tops on the left hand graph, that is a congested port. The flat tops are packets  not getting through. They're just it's getting clipped at the top. And if you look at the on the  right, you'll see the graph that's dropped packets. That's a lot. So many dropped packets that if  you're on the other end of that connection, your video is not going to play, you're going to get  buffering, you're going to have all sorts of congestion, traffic won't get through or get  through delayed. It's a mess. Now go down to the graphs below Jason, if you would,  100 gigabit interconnect in DC with a different peer, no congestion. So you see peaks,  but those peaks are never clipped. And if you go to the right dropped packets, none.  So it is normal, this is normal to get congestion. But what's also normal is without sending a bill,  you fix it. That's how the internet works. He points out though that these five broadband  providers in the US haven't been. He says they're all large broadband consumer networks with  dominant or exclusive market share in their local market. He says in countries where consumers have  multiple broadband choices like the UK, you won't see these congested peers. These congested peers  have been in place for well over a year where our peer refuses to augment capacity. In other words,  they know there's congestion, they know there's packet dropping, and they don't do anything  intentionally. They violate the unwritten compact and they don't fix it. He says they're deliberately  harming the service they deliver to their paying customers. They're not allowing us to fulfill the  requests their customers make for content. That gives the customers a bad experience. In fact,  if you look at customer satisfaction, it's very low for all of these broadband service providers.  But he says there's one purpose and one purpose only, to blackmail us into giving them money.  To blackmail us into paying them to upgrade. And this is what we heard from Netflix,  what we're hearing more and more. This is not a case of, this is a case of blackmailing,  mailing peers, but this is also going to happen on edge networks. His final line,  shouldn't a broadband consumer network with near monopoly control over their customers be expected,  if not obligated, to deliver a better experience than this? What they're doing is going to level  three and say, if you would like to reach our customers, perhaps you would like to give us  some money so we could, you know, they're crying. They say, oh, it's costing us so much money,  you've got to give us money to upgrade our switches. That's not what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very well explained. Thank you. That's why Leo should be president of the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just, it's very frustrating. And you know, a lot, you know, Brian and others,  and I agree, you know, government intervention is, is a blunt weapon and can have all sorts of  negative consequences. But when companies act in monopolistic ways, there is no other, there's no  free market force that can save you. There is no competition. And he points out, I think very well  in countries where there is competition, this doesn't happen. If you had a choice and you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  getting crappy service, you'd go somewhere else. Yeah, my, my home internet connection, my new home  internet connection here in Brooklyn is now is definitely the upper graph and not the bottom

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  graph. Isn't that frustrating? Yes. Yes. It's frustrating. And yeah, I don't know if the  solution is to get the FCC. I mean, my, my, my feeling is the solution to get the FCC to do the  right thing and declare these common carriers, telecom companies regulated as the telecom companies  are. But maybe that's not the solution. I don't know. I mean, we've got it. It's clearly a problem.  I'm glad level three step forward. They didn't name names because these are customers, etc, etc.  But they step forward. And I think that these are very telling graphs. Yeah, it's a great piece.  Yeah. It's frustrating. I don't know what we do about it.  Save the internet.com. That's what you do. Save the internet.com. They have a page. What can I do?  You know, you can fund Alexis Alexis Ohanian's billboard across the street from the FCC.  You can pick up the phone and call the FCC. You can email open internet FCC.gov. There's lots of  things you can do. You can write a letter to the editor. You can write to your congress critter.  Lots of information at save the internet.com. How is the billboard coming along? Oh, let's check.  He did this on crowd tilt, which is Alexis's startup crowdfunding.  Let me just search for save net neutrality billboard and FCC's backyard. I gave him a  thousand bucks. I just wanted to jumpstart it. He's so close. Eight days left. He needs 20,000.  He's raised 15,000. That'll be another thing you could do. Give him a buck. You don't have to give  him a lot. It's five bucks. Yeah, I'm going to do this right now. Yeah. You know what? I think  one of the reasons it's hard to raise the money is because it's like, well, this isn't going to  change anything. You put a billboard out in front of Tom Wheeler. He's already getting millions from  the lobbyists. Why would a billboard change anything? Make it more passive every day, you know?  Actually, there is one crowdfunding thing that I really am interested in. It's Larry Lessig's  plan to create a super PAC. Yeah. May1.us. Isn't that interesting? Yeah, it's really cool.  So you're an offerant, huh? Yeah, yeah. I've donated and-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should give money to this too. There's a couple groups, and this is one of the larger ones,  that's starting to use this idea of PACs. Let people spend, you know, a PAC can take lots of  donor money and then spend that in some very flexible ways. So if you can use that same  machinery against some of these super PACs, that could be very cool. And so I think they're trying  to raise a million dollars in 30 days, and they're actually pretty far along. Are they?  Yeah. Like in four days, they'd raise like half a million or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the idea is let's get Congress people elected. It's the May Day PAC. Let's get Congress people  elected that will vote to get money out of elections. And it actually is kind of  perversely sensible. You're never going to get people who are dependent on big money to get  elected to vote against big money in Congress. So here's what you do. Create a super PAC,  go out and lobby it, raise funds, get this one last election we'll pay for.  Get these people in, reform the whole thing. And Larry, of course, everybody knows the guy who  started Creative Commons law professor at Stanford and Harvard. We've had him on. We love Larry. He's  just fabulous. This is awesome. Yeah, good for him. This is great. And his idea, you know, he for a long time was talking a  lot of, you know, Creative Commons was all about getting the music industry off our backs. He finally  realized this is never going to happen until we get the influence of money out of politics.  So he said, let's go after the root cause of all of this, which is Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the FCC,  every member of Congress, the president of the United States, they're all basically doing the  bidding of people who have deep pockets, because that's how you get elected. So let's change that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's reform the influence of money in politics. And I think, I mean, if you look at it, they're  almost up to $600,000. And it's the seventh of May. So they're doing like $100,000 a day. So they're  trying to get a million. They're 59% funded. Yeah, I say go way over the top, because if they've got more,  you know, ammunition or dry powder, or whatever you want to call it to tackle money in politics,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they can have a lot more of an impact. And if you feel bad, you can say I only want to fund Democrats,  or I only want to fund Republicans. So you can, you can choose. I really like this idea. Now,  because it's a super PAC, you're going to have to say who your employer is, there are government,  there are oddly enough, rules about contributions that you're that they have to adhere to. But you  know what, they're pretty, they're pretty easy to get around. That's the problem. The website is  mayone.us. I like this idea. I'd hate to see what Brian Brushwood thinks of it, but I like this idea.  I love Brian. But he lives in Texas, and he's living he lives in a just as we in San Francisco  live in a bubble, he lives in a bubble. That's all. I love it. On a much lighter crowdfunding

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  note, my friend Andy, Andy Bayo actually sold his company upcoming.org to Yahoo, like back in 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw he had an announcement today at 10am. What was that? Yeah. So, so a few months ago,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yahoo calls him they shut they shuttered they sunsetted upcoming, right. And they you know,  Andy had a team of people kind of try to archive it. And then if you want to go Yahoo sends him  an email and says, Hey, do you want to buy back the domain upcoming.org? He buys back the domain  and he launched a Kickstarter to rebuild upcoming. Yeah, from the bottom up using modern tools,  which is really kind of kind of amazing. So yeah, that is hysterical. And and he I think he launched  the Kickstarter today and he blew through his goal. Already. It was a small it was a small goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was like 30k. I gotta find the page. Well, I'll just search for Andy Bayo and Andy Bayo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and Kickstarter. Well, Andy's associated with Kickstarter a little bit, which helps as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, he helped build Kickstarter. So he's associated and he did xoxo on Kickstarter. And  yeah, wow, look, 47,000 already. So what was upcoming? Was it like it was?  Events. It was events calendar. Yeah, social events calendar. I remember using it. I thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it was really great. Yeah. And there's still not a great event solution for the web yet. So I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's land your is it like Evie kind of or what is it? I think it's more like a local band is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  playing next Friday. I'm going to submit this event, which one of my friends are going. I  less like Evie. I thought more of kind of like a community based events calendar. I don't know,  Matt, would you would you characterize it that way or think about like Craigslist events except

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  with, you know, a modern UI and, you know, trying to keep all the spam out and that sort of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. And D, that's all. That's the first time I can think of that happening where you  yeah, you got bought out. Yeah, who as usual just kind of screwed it screwed it to death into the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ground and a big company shut you down. A few years pass. They must have had that the deal that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know, he could he could compete by now or something like that. Right. Because usually they  have non competes and all of that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and this was a while ago. Yeah. Ten years

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ago. That's awesome. I remember there was some spam on upcoming where someone was posting spam  events that were like watch free online Super Bowl, whatever. So I dropped him a note and he was like,  can you get rid of this spam? He's like, no, I can't. I don't own it anymore. Oh,  so if he can pull that back and make it his again, that would be so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yay. Google Andy even Google wants you to bring back up coming dot org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've been playing around with Google camera, the Google camera app for Android, the lens blur  feature, which we talked about a couple of episodes ago. And a photographer at guidingtech.com  actually did a pretty good post about all the different ways he's kind of experimenting with  lens blur and a couple of good tips for getting lens blur to work most effectively. Something  kind of obvious, have a subject real close and the background farther back so you really get that  depth of field. Centering your subject apparently helps a lot to get the effect that you want.  And just tips on kind of raising because you're moving your device in order to get the  effect. So the subject centering I didn't know about. I often try to off center because that's  sometimes or a lot of times better composition, but it looks like lens blur looks a little bit  better if you center. So a couple of good tips there. How to use the lens blur. I have to say,  I like Google cameras implementation a little bit better than the HTC One. You don't use the HTC

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One's. I will do Jeff's number of the week. He says 2.5 million Chromebooks shipped last year.  A 68% increase expected this year. And he also mentioned that Flux. Look at that. He's such a  Chromebook shill. He is. He loves those Chromebooks. He also mentions that Flux is a Google X project  that just emerged from Google X and has received $8 million in funding to build eco-friendly  buildings. Matt, you got something wonderful you'd like to pass along? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  since you already mentioned Webmaster videos, you can search for Webmaster videos and find all my  stuff. We've got 500 videos, but here's a little trick that I hadn't heard about. And if I hadn't  heard about it, most people hadn't. There's on the AdWords side, there's a similar group of people  who film videos. And what they do is they take requests for questions on social media. So if you  leave the hashtag ask AdWords on your tweet or your Google Plus post, I don't know if they can  search Facebook or not, but basically just leave ask AdWords as a hashtag. And they film about once  a week. They've been filming for about six months and they typically answer one to three questions  per video. So I haven't actually told them that I was going to mention this. So let's just flood  them with good questions about AdWords and they'll be like, what happened? This is crazy.  So I think that would be kind of fun. You should do this, Matt. Why don't you do this?  Hashtag ask Matt. We have done a couple sessions like that. It is a lot of fun to do. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should do it. It can be a lot of work too. I mean, I say you should do it. Am I doing it? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say, I think that Matt probably has enough incoming queries on a regular basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do mention this site and this was really useful for us because we did get the warning  from Chrome. This website contains malware. Our site was hacked almost a year ago. And you have  a great website from the webmasters page, google.com slash webmaster slash hacked. What to do if you're  a site owner and you see those very depressing, scary words. We built this specifically as a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  multi-stage thing to take you through. Here's what to do. Don't be scared. We can help you  recover. And then at some point if you need to ask for IT help, great. But this leads you through  the basic procedures of recovering from being yourself. Yeah. I mean, we did all of that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  including get our experts to go in there, find the exploit, find out how it got in to patch that  hole and then of course to get rid of it. And it's hard. I mean, once that happens,  just like with a home computer, there's an unlimited number of bad things that could have  been done to you. So you really have to scrub. Yeah. Sometimes it's better to nuke it from orbit  just to be safe. Yeah. Well, that's what I tell people to do with their home installs.  You're not going to nuke my, I'm not going to start my website from scratch.  Let's just start all over again. Download Drupal. Step one. Step two, pay $400,000.  Step three, you have a site. God, that's expensive. We did not pay that much. Thank goodness.  That is Matt Cuts, my friends. We love the Matt. Mattcuts.com slash blog, two T's, two T's,  an M and an S. You provide the vowels.

Transcript:  get to bed a little bit earlier and if I don't have to get up, I'll set the alarm a little bit  later and that sort of stuff. I went for a run this morning and I actually went faster than I've  gone ever before after a good night's sleep. Ladies and gentlemen, Rocky, part eight, featuring  Matt Cuts as Rocky. So can I tell you, Leo, I actually ran the Boston Marathon two or three  weeks ago. You did? I didn't know that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, rock on. Did you finish? I did. Yeah.  Oh my God. It turns out I can't qualify for speed. I'm very, very slow. But if you raise money for  charity, then you are allowed to run in the Boston Marathon. They put you at the very back of the pack  and I have to tell you, every time I run a marathon, I start out the first hour and a half  listening to Twig because I'm like, I don't want to start out too fast. We can get you all the way  home. We'll make them longer. If you make it, I'll listen to it. Four hours? What was your time?  It could get you the whole marathon. So great. And again, I'm very slow, but I just wanted to  say thanks because I saved that episode so that I could listen to it on the marathon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina, don't you feel good? I do. First of all, that's amazing. All hail. Yeah.  Coming from the person who can't walk half a mile. Yeah. Good job. But also, that's so exciting.  It's so cool that you're listening to us on the run. That's amazing. I put the treadmill on a 10%

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  grade and I promptly fell off. It wasn't even going. So I'm not ready for the marathon. What  is that? 26 miles? What is it? 26.2. And you did it in how long did it take you? Oh man, like five

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  hours and 12 minutes. It takes me a long time. Make a note of that, Jason. Our next Twig will be

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  five hours and 12 minutes. Just the fact that you were in motion. I'd be double fisting, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  inhalers. I can't even. That is so awesome. Did you see Denz go running by from Dennis

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Crowley from Foursquare? I didn't. He did pass me at some point, but I didn't see him go by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. Well, then he had to walk for the last few miles. So it's okay. Did you run it? I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  jog it the whole way? So that's what I didn't realize is the Boston Marathon, there's crowds  the whole way cheering for you. You can't exactly arrest. No. I had a shirt that said, go, Matt,  go. And so the whole crowd was, they'd shout, go, Matt, go, which turned out to be a blessing  and a curse because, you know, the last two miles you're like, I just want to run. And there's like  a bunch of frat boys that are like, oh, Matt, go. I just want to rest. But it was really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a phenomenal experience. How did you train? Obviously you had to train for that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'll do one quick plug. There's a website called usafit.com. And what they do is they have  chapters around the country. So I'm with San Jose Fit and over six months, they take you from one  mile a week to 26 miles a week. And it's like a hundred bucks a week. You get discounts on  marathons. It's all normal people. Anybody can run a marathon. All it takes is, you know,  six to nine months of training. And so the season's actually starting now. Anybody who  wants to run a marathon, I'd highly recommend that organization. Really? You think I could do that?  Yeah. I had never run more than eight miles. I'd done beta breakers and nothing longer than that.  And then I joined USA Fit and over the course of a season ran the San Francisco Marathon.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's incredible. Well, I mean, what it takes is a commitment and a lot of time and stamina. And  yeah, that's incredible. It's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's fine to go slow. You know, if you finish a marathon in six hours and 29 minutes,  you still finish, right? And anybody who hears that you run a marathon, they don't ask usually  what your time is. They just say, oh, wow, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I only asked if you finished and you finished.  Yeah, exactly. So if you finish, you beat everyone who didn't.  Yeah. All the people on the couch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the people who didn't run.  I was in the bottom 10%. So I was very slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would not. If I ran a marathon, I don't care. I could be the literally 12 hours,  the last guy crossing, I'd be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. You made donuts I could eat in 12 hours.  I could eat a lot of donuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Matt's really mean. I just went to USA Fit. You're really tempting me here.  You should try it.  It's what was the charity that you raised money for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The charity was the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, which is a fantastic group of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really good guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They had 700 runners at Boston and they raised over $6 million.  Isn't that great?  It was very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The vibe that the race was good. There were spectators the whole way.  Boston Strong, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was incredible. I was ready to cry two or three times because the signs and the cheering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What a good one to run.  Yeah, exactly.  Wow. Well, once again, Matt Cutts makes us all feel bad.
