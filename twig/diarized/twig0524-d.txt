Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We were discussing semicolons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my god, a whole book.  This is like Mark Kerensky's book on salt,  a whole book on salt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Carson was trying to prevent us from doing any punctuation  talk at the beginning of the show.  That's why we're doing it.  We did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We did it for half an hour before we began the show.  Stacey got a whole column in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it was the most productive I've ever been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's Stacey Reganbotham.  She's always filing at Stacey on IoT, her IoT newsletter,  and of course, the IoT podcast with Kevin Toffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that your new 3A?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I've been doing is I've been setting up my new  phone while they've been talking about it forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Jeff Jarvis is also here, professor of journalism  at CUNY, the graduate school of journalism.  And he's also a blogger at buzzmachine.com.  He is also using a 3A.  Do you 3A people?  Do you get Android 10?  Not yet, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have Android 10 on my Pixel 3 XL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no way to have it check for updates anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, there is.  It's hidden.  Yes.  Tell me where.  It's hidden.  I had to do this yesterday, and it worked.  You go into Settings.  It's way down at the bottom where you at least  expect it.  System.  Settings, System.  Advanced.  Advanced.  System updates right at the bottom.  System updates.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  System update.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now.  I bet you you're going to get it.  You will get dual SIM support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Yeah, which is cool.  What carrier are you on?  I'm on AT&T.  Because carriers can block it, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, not just dual SIM support, but simultaneous dual SIM  support.  Yeah.  Isn't that how?  I thought dual SIM, you had to switch SIMs.  No.  You had to tell them which one you wanted to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  So at least in the dual SIM phones  I've used like the OnePlus, you can  designate which SIM to use for different apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you can say.  Can you take phone calls from either?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so.  I don't know.  OK.  That's an interesting question.  I don't know about that.  But you could say I want my text messages on one SIM  and my phone calls on another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I get the expert panel's advice?  This goes for you guys and the chat room.  Because I am giving my Pixel 2 to my daughter,  is it worth signing up for Google Fi  and not giving her a SIM card at all?  She's 13.  Pros and cons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She will never be able to call you from, or wait.  Without Wi-Fi.  Without Wi-Fi.  No, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Are you saying just get her a Google Fi data only SIM?  No, you want to give her a phone system, right?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you use the virtual SIM instead  of the physical SIM?  That's what she's asking.  Oh, the eSIM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's, it offered me the chance to set up my phone  without using a SIM, just using Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fi supports eSIMs.  All carriers will support eSIMs in the coming year.  But right now, Fi does.  Yes.  I think Fi is great.  So here's the pros and cons.  Fi is $20 flat for text and phone calls in the US.  Period.  That's done.  That's every month.  And then $10 per gigabyte or less per fraction of gigabyte  as used.  So if she doesn't use a lot of data,  and she probably won't, because I  bet you she uses the phone data mostly at home with Wi-Fi,  maybe at school, then you will have a very inexpensive phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  Well, I'm going to do it and see.  But she should still be able to, like, if she's down  by the docks at night, and she's like, ah, how do I get here?  I'm scared.  Mom, help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it uses, at least for now, I don't  know what's going to happen if T-Mobile Sprint merger goes  through, but right now it uses T-Mobile and Sprint,  and US Cellular, and Wi-Fi.  And it'll choose whatever's best.  So I've not had any connectivity problems at all with it,  including here, where we don't get T-Mobile very well at all.  I guess it goes to Sprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you, guys.  Because yes, the other option was to add her to Verizon,  which is like, I'm giving you a free phone.  I'm giving you money and setting it on fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the problem with that is, I don't  know if this is still the case, but it was shared data.  And our 16-year-old, who was then about 13,  would go through all the data every month in the first week.  And then mom, Lisa, goes, Michael,  you used up all the data again.  So finally, we went to T-Mobile, where he could use as much as he wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could try Visible.  Yeah, I'm that person in our family.  Visible is the new Verizon thing.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And VNO.  Sort of, because it's not really, because it's their own thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's $40 flat a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's supposedly unlimited data, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's unlimited data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She really doesn't use that much data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Fi is actually a good choice for somebody  who doesn't use a lot of data.  Of course, there's our sponsor, which is Mint Mobile.  But that's really more for if you know you're  going to use a certain amount of data every month,  then it's more economical than Fi.  But if you don't use that data, you don't get money back.  Fi, you get money back if you don't use the data.  So I think it's probably a better.  You know what's interesting is how competitive  and how much variety there is.  And according to many states attorneys general,  that's about to go away with the Sprint T-Mobile merger.  I don't know if I believe that.  I agree with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have conflicting opinions.  Although I do find, I consider myself pretty smart  about carriers and pricing plans.  And even I am trying to research what to do for her, what's best.  I am like, oh, shoot me in the head.  It's so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, you don't want Android 10 because it's dark mode.  I just said that to see what would happen.  You don't have to use dark mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but I won't be able to see how to switch it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like dark mode, but not everybody does, obviously.  YouTube page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It happened to me the other day,  I was driving with my Google Maps.  I normally use Waze.  And I would come back from the US Open  and Waze wasn't working for whatever reason.  So I have a Google Maps and we go into the Lincoln Tunnel  and it goes to dark mode and I start browsing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't like that.  But that's not the same as operating system wide dark mode.  That's just a weird thing that Maps does.  It's to protect your eyes at night.  You don't want a big bright phone glaring at you  while you're trying to drive at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I also don't want a dark phone.  I can't read and can't figure out where the road is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love dark mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You would.  We're dark.  Just to spite me.  I know.  Just to spite you.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's the angel of Azirio, Aziriel.  And we are David Tennant, whoever he is.  YouTube will pay what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was gonna say, I sent my daughter out to like,  I told her to go talk to my tomato plants.  This is only a David Tennant reference.  And I go outside just to see what she's doing  because she had been gone for a while.  And I hear her yelling at my plants, grow better.  Which is just like Crowley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is, okay.  Your daughter is officially cool in my book.  That is awesome.  Talk to the tomato plant says hippie dippy mom.  Daughter goes out and starts screaming, grow better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  YouTube, I'm gonna try one more time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, let's do the actual show stuff.  I'm just gonna throw this story out.  We'll pay $170 million to settle claims  that violated child privacy laws.  This just crossed the wires today.  FTC says it violated the Children's Online  Privacy Protection Act.  The settlement was voted through the FTC in a 3-2 vote.  The Democrats said it wasn't mean enough.  Republicans said enough already.  The New York Attorney General also will get some money.  34 million for the state of New York,  136 million to the FTC.  It's the largest amount the FTC's ever obtained  in a COPPA case since the old law was enacted in 1998.  This is what FTC Chairman Joe Simon said.  When it came to complying with COPPA,  YouTube refused to acknowledge the portions of its platform  were clearly directed to kids.  Child-directed sites, in other words,  that portion of YouTube, including, I would guess,  the thing labeled YouTube kids,  must disclose data practices and get parental consent  before collecting information on kids age 13 and under.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me understand this.  Was this stuff that was apparently for kids  or was labeled by YouTube for kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube and Google, according to the New York Attorney General,  knowingly and illegally monitored, tracked,  and served targeted ads to young children.  Just to keep advertising dollars rolling in,  these companies put children at risk and abuse their power.  It's not clear.  I don't, maybe it doesn't encompass YouTube kids.  Yeah, because there is an issue there.  No, no, no, no, it's just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you keep reading,  it talks about YouTube aggressively marketed itself  to children's toy companies  by saying they could reach children, which means-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They told the advertisers they could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's basically,  COPPA says you're not allowed to advertise to kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not allowed to tell advertisers  that it's not encouraging to kids.  Think about it, when a network puts on cartoon programming  and sells it to Hasbro,  isn't that exactly what they're doing?  Is that why-  Yes, but there is a law against that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is a law actually-  COPPA is a law against that.  Yeah, the FCC mandates time for advertising to children  like via cartoons.  That's why we have-  Saturday morning.  They actually have laws related to that,  but it's not COPPA.  It's a different set of laws associated with the FCC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it was, of course,  the networks don't really gather information  about who's watching.  They just provide, just like we do.  It's like we don't gather information  about people watching Twig,  but we know something about them  because of the nature of the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the TV does the same thing.  They have Nielsen boxes that say who's watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't gather information about any specific kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but they know how many kids.  Basically, they're allowed to give-  It's not a privacy violation.  It's not a privacy violation.  They are allowed to give their Nielsen information  to advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the Democrats who wanted more, a stricter fine,  Rohit Chopra, in a dissent, said,  "'This latest violation is extremely serious.  "'The company baited children using nursery rhymes,  "'cartoons, and other kid-directed content  "'on curated YouTube channels'-  I would gather that's YouTube kids-  "'to feed its massively profitable,  "'behaviorally based advertising business.'"  He wanted something more serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I kind of agree.  I mean, given Google's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because first of all, $170 million is nothing, right?  For Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they've made that much money on Elsigate videos  since we started talking about that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, the YouTube blog post about this says  they're also going to invest $100 million  in children's programming.  So I wonder if that's them trying to kind of create  a controlled space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's what you'd have to do, right?  And you would have to make sure  that you got parental permission  before a kid could log into that.  Maybe you don't, and maybe they don't log in at all.  Maybe you don't collect any information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then how would you monetize them?  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the same way the networks monetize  Saturday morning cartoons, which don't exist anymore,  but if they did-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they sell, I mean-  They have kids shows.  I will tell you.  They have kids shows and they have advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the advertising is not for Budweiser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but it's for like-  Hasbro.  Honey Smacks or crazy.  I mean, my daughter, who grew up in this weird  blip of time where we only had Netflix and no cable,  she hadn't actually seen,  she'd never seen these ads.  So she didn't want any of this stuff.  And it was weird to me.  Yeah.  Like, and now she just doesn't even know  what to do with advertising.  Now I-  She's so confused by it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This ties into it.  And I am a little concerned about this,  but it's just come out.  This is from the Financial Times  that Google has been doing some sort of weird thing.  And I don't really understand it yet.  This made no sense to me.  Yeah. And unfortunately it's behind a paywall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Behind a paywall.  But I saw another story somewhere that just,  that said that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so apparently the Financial Times  security guy, let me see if I could find-  It's a little hard to talk about it if we can't read it.  Yeah. I saw through the paywall briefly,  but now I can't anymore.  Gosh darn paywalls.  I suppose I could,  I could spend money to get the Financial Times,  but I remember what the guy said is he was doing  an analysis of what Chrome was gathering on him.  And it turned out that Chrome created an invisible page  that had no content on it,  but had his unique identifier, his Google identifier on it.  A page that advertisers could pull up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me see if I can-  So I gotta see that story.  I gotta see that story here.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Prepare your autoplay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And then that's another, yeah.  It's a choice between autoplay and paywalls.  I don't know.  I pay for a lot of them.  Financial Times is kind of expensive.  I can't really afford it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In response, Google said it doesn't serve personalized ads  or send bid requests to bidders without user consent.  Yeah, but that doesn't-  The process laid out by Ryan could potentially be  cookie matching or cookie syncing.  It's an ad industry practice of matching ads  across multiple sites based on a user's browsing history.  It's a non-denial denial from Google.  A Google developer page on cookie matching  explains the process and the privacy principles  the search engine follows,  such as not allowing the info to be harvested by...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't wanna jump on this only because-  Yeah, let me be careful.  I came out this morning,  I didn't have really time to dig into it,  but the point was Johnny Ryan, who works at Brave,  he's their chief policy officer.  Brave is a Chrome-based privacy browser,  which I like a lot.  He submitted this as evidence to Ireland,  which is investigating Google,  to the Ireland Data Protection Commission.  So I think we have not heard the end of this.  Ryan said he discovered that Google used a tracker  containing web browsing information, location,  and other data, and sent it to ad companies  via web pages that, quote, showed no content.  This could allow companies buying ads to match a user's  Google profile and web activity  to profiles from other companies.  And in fact, that is against Google's own ad buying rules,  according to the Financial Times.  Google's denial is not really a denial, so I don't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're saying that these...  Everybody does indeed get this unique web page identifier.  What it seems to be saying is they're not serving  personalized ads or sending bids without user consent,  which is just basically saying,  at some point in time, you must have agreed to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you search for cookie matching,  you get some descriptions of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So maybe people did opt into this with Google,  and then that would make it GDPR compliant.  But maybe they opted in without realizing  they were opting in because  serums and conditions are painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Maciej Zawadzinski from ClearCode,  what is cookie syncing and how does it work?  If you work in online advertising,  you've probably heard of cookie syncing.  There's a video there you can play.  Why do ad tech and data companies use it?  So this is, by the way, why I've started using Firefox.  And the latest version of Firefox  is even more aggressive in blocking this kind of tracking.  It's got new anti-tracking protection.  It allows you to turn off fingerprinting.  It also allows you to block third-party cookies.  But the issue is, of course,  fingerprinting is starting to replace third-party cookies.  And that's what we're talking about.  A unique ID on the user's computer,  which allows advertisers to track you  moving from page to page.  It's a form of fingerprinting.  So cookie syncing,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  and bringing that into your execution,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you may have to use it to try and change your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh boy.  Most...  This is more arcane than going through punctuation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, boy.  Yeah, let's just keep...  But it is more relevant  to what we were supposed to be talking about.  So it's like a super cookie.  It's a super cookie for advertisers because...  I guess I should start at the beginning  with first-party cookies,  can remember what your order was,  can remember what your password is.  And obviously they don't store that  or they don't want to store that on their site.  They store it on your computer as a cookie.  It's just a persistent bit of information.  That's a first-party cookie.  Only Starbucks can read that cookie.  The problem is of late, when you go to Starbucks,  there is also a Facebook like button,  a Twitter like button, a share on Twitter button,  a Google plus button, stuff like that.  All of those buttons are actually served  by Facebook, Twitter, and Google.  Any cookie they set is technically a first-party cookie  because you loaded content from Facebook.  The problem is you're not on Facebook, you're on Starbucks.  So that's what we call a third-party cookie.  And the danger of it is Facebook can now track you  on every site that has a Facebook like button on it  and see everywhere you go.  If you go to then Pete's Coffee,  they know you've been to Starbucks.  Starbucks doesn't know,  Pete's doesn't know, but Facebook knows.  So as mentioned previously, cookies are domain specific.  Those created by one third-party tracker like lottome.com  cannot be read by another third-party tracker like AppNexus.  Similarly, Twitter can't read Facebook's cookies  and vice versa.  For advertisers, this restricts the potential amount  of information they can collect about a user.  Therefore, in order to accurately target an audience,  advertisers need to incorporate user data  from various domains and sources, which happens as part of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not so much just Facebook or Twitter.  No, there's lots of them.  Or Google.  It's AppNexus or-  There's a ton of them.  It's the programmatic ad networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  So that's when you get these data buying agreements  and partnerships where I'll give you mine  if you give me yours.  Advertisers are able to achieve this by,  and this is the key here,  mapping user IDs from one system to another.  So this is your AppNexus ID.  This is your Google ID.  This is your Facebook ID.  It's all the same person.  So now I know a lot more of you.  That's cookie syncing.  Did that make sense, my description of that?  In other words, I'm saying Leo has cookie A from Google,  cookie B from Facebook, cookie C from Twitter.  That's all those three things.  A, B, and C represent Leo.  By syncing those, I now have a bigger dossier  of all of Leo's surfing from those various companies.  A, B, and C becomes Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you say I have it, who are you playing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the advertiser would be one.  Google would be another.  Anybody who's selling ads, right?  The cookie syncing process is used  by most ad tech platforms, including ad networks.  That's Google.  Demand side platforms, don't know who that is.  Is that Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Data management platforms.  DSPs are part of the programmatic ad network.  So a demand side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So complicated.  This is part of the problem with ad tech in general,  is it is a very convoluted, elaborate process  with one goal in mind, track everything you do on the net  so that the advertiser can target you.  The results of the cookie syncing process  benefit those mentioned above, ad tech DSPs,  DMPs, data management platforms, ad exchanges,  supply side platforms.  So you have DSP and SSP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The DSP allows the buyers of digital advertising inventory  to manage multiple ad exchange and data exchanges.  And the SSP allows the seller,  the media company to do that.  And the two talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They two talk.  So you could see this is the cookie syncing  from DSP to DMP happening right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's happening here, and this enables retargeting.  So you go to Amazon, you see a pair of boots.  Those boots follow you around for three weeks.  Because the data about you being boot interested  is more valuable now than any proximity  to editorial content in, you know, boot world.  And so wherever you are, if you're going to weather.com  or you're going to goodyogurt.com,  there is a cookie set on you, a user ID on you  that you are boot interested.  And that enables bestyogurt.com to make some money  because there's nobody wants to advertise yogurt,  but the boot ad is there and that's what enables that.  And in media, this has proven to be two things,  both valuable and commodifying.  It's valuable because now media companies,  news companies for example, can present their ad inventory,  their unsold inventory, which they have plenty of,  to a wide range of advertisers they would never reach  because they would never go and get RFPs from them.  The bad part is that it commodifies media  because now you don't go buy a boot ad  in outdoor world magazine.  You can put it anywhere because what's valuable now  is the user.  So the whole program, I was at a,  I had an event at the school where a major executive  in programmatic kind of yelled at the media people  and said, why are you doing this?  This is somebody who made his living in programmatic.  So why are you using programmatic?  It commodifies you.  And then the chief revenue officer  from a major media site in the room said,  sorry man, I got to because that's where  the ad dollars are going.  The ad dollars aren't flowing through  requests for proposals and PowerPoints and all that anymore.  They're flowing through these platforms  because there's an instant auction  that gets the best possible prices and better targeting  and that's the way the media world operates these days.  So it's not just that Facebook and Google  are doing evil things,  it's that this is the way the entire ad infrastructure  is working these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's true and it gets harder and harder for us  because we don't do that to survive in this ecosystem  because advertisers expect it.  And value comes down probably.  Yeah.  So this is a cookie sync script from Pubmatic.  What happens by the way when you click this link  is you're gonna get a blank page  like the one the brave guy explained that Google's doing.  So essentially it says Google is offering cookie syncing.  Now when I click this.  When do you ever get that page?  Well you never see, that's the point.  The user doesn't see it.  This is part of, see the user doesn't need to see anything.  That's what makes no sense.  Well what happens is it synchronizes the cookies.  So that's my-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But how do you ever end up with that page  to do the syncing?  They ask for it.  That's your ID.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I the user never click on that link  to get a blank page. You never see it.  No, no, no.  Well then the tree fell in the forest and it didn't sync.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you didn't see it but the ad guy did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you mean?  Your ad page clicked, your little boot ad clicked on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't have to do anything.  It's all done for you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your, when you saw the ad that you got  because you're a boot-seeky person.  A boot-seeker.  A boot-seeker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That hidden page got shared.  So I run Ublock Origin which blocks all this stuff.  When I clicked on this link to get to my secret page,  Ublock Origin said, no, no, no, no, this is an ad tracker.  I'm gonna temporarily stop blocking it.  Oops.  And then I'm gonna get another one.  But there is finally the usink blank page.  There's no content on the page  because that's not the point of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All you need is the ID.  I still don't understand.  I never get that tab with the blank page.  You shouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but.  You won't see it, no.  It's not for you because you're a human.  It's not for you.  Yes, you're a human.  It's for a machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The ad is getting that page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's using it to sync.  So that's the allegation from Financial Times  and from Johnny Ryan of Brave,  which is honestly probably not surprising  because other ad tech companies do this as well.  So it's not surprising that Google's doing it.  However, the problem is that Google says,  well, we don't do that.  So that's gonna be the question.  Is Google saying they don't do that?  So this was just a very confusing 10 minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of NetCast time. I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I wish I had had the time  because it just came out today,  but I thought we should talk about it.  I wish I'd had the time to kind of  parse it a little bit better,  but you got to engage with us as we were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As we were parsing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Parsing it.  And you offered a really helpful,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's a really helpful overview  of the ad industry,  which is really hard and convoluted to understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of amazing.  And amazing.  And this is why ad blockers and tracking protection.  And this is the problem,  is you're getting this escalation now  and this war between ad tech and users  who I think not unreasonably say,  well, but wait a minute.  I don't want you doing that.  What really needs to happen, I think though,  is some sort of transparency so users can opt in.  Because honestly, a lot of,  that's not how we make our money,  but we're in old, very old school.  The way we make our money is so old school  compared to this.  And I fear that in years to come,  advertisers are going to just say,  well, if you can't give us that data,  we're going somewhere else.  And there are podcasters who will start doing this.  There will be this kind of ad tech in podcasting.  It's coming.  That's one of the things that we're talking about  at the Podcast Expo, the podcast movement.  It's coming.  I don't want to do it.  And there are technical difficulties because  it's one thing on a webpage,  because you're using a browser,  and all the browsers until recently supported this.  Now they're starting to block it,  and it's a big war coming.  But right now, when you listen to a podcast,  there's so many ways you can listen to a podcast  that there's no system for doing this at all  in podcasting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're working on it.  Oh, they're working on it.  Hidden tones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our friends at the Interactive Advertising Bureau,  IAB, would love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it could increase the value immensely.  There's value to the content creator here.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and so this is why it needs to be a conversation  and why it needs to be more transparent.  It could put Twitter out of business if I refuse to do it.  It could be the end of Twitter.  And a lot of podcasts.  If the owners of the podcast network say,  we don't want to do that,  advertisers could turn away and say,  well, we're only going to buy ads  where we know this kind of information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Conversely, if they find a really good way to do it  and we agree to it,  it could make us all incredibly wealthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's another problem,  which is the kind of ads we do  do not lend themselves to programmatic advertising.  I read an ad, it's baked in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, because that's also why you get those kinds of ads.  You get direct response advertising.  Well, I think they work better, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But in order for this to work,  you'd have to have what's called DI or dynamic insertion.  Because just as you see different banner ads  as you go around the web based on your boot preference,  people buy ads and podcasts would like you  to have different ads served to you,  depending on your geographic location, your demographics,  what they know about you.  And so it's increasingly popular  in large podcasts to have dynamic insertion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's a company called, for example,  A Million Ads that does this.  There are companies that start to do this.  They're doing dynamic serving in podcasts.  So it's coming.  It's here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of them.  There's A13.  There's one we've tried.  We've tried it,  or is it A16?  I think it's A16.  We tried it with back catalog.  So our stuff is so baked in,  we'd have to completely redo how we do ads.  But we have a long tail, right?  We only get paid for ads in the first six weeks of the show  or something like that.  After that, the ad doesn't go away  because we don't edit it out, but we don't get paid for it.  So whatever hits an ad gets in months three, four, five, six,  that's just free to the advertiser.  We get no revenue from it.  So what we've tried doing and we've looked at  and maybe end up doing is not on the first run,  but after those six weeks starting to replace  existing baked in ads with dynamically inserted ads,  because we don't get the same kind of money  for dynamically inserted ads.  Although, honestly, as you're listening to it,  it would probably still be me reading it.  It might not be so different.  It wouldn't be quite as tightly integrated into the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like when you go out of town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, you're rolling in a pre-record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the bad news, you've got to record 100 ads tomorrow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would like to keep doing what we do.  Who knows what'll happen though.  Maybe, maybe.  There's also, by the way, and this is a complete different,  the IAB is also insisting on a new ad,  a new people counting technology  that in my opinion dramatically under counts mobile users.  It really hurts podcasts with a high tech audience.  People like you who listen on your phone  and on your Google and Amazon Echo.  Don't most people?  No, no, normal people don't.  Normal people don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Normal people listen to podcasts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They get counted more.  Yeah, now they do and they get counted better.  So what is gonna also happen,  I think very subtly, is these new ad,  these new audience measurement technologies  will hurt certain podcasts.  And so it's gonna homogenize podcasts.  Podcasts like ours will go away  because we have a high technically literate audience  that uses mobile.  There's a bunch of reasons I don't wanna get going on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because no one listening to our podcast is normal,  that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're abnormal to begin with.  So podcasts like mainstream podcasts like serial and stuff  which hit a more normal audience  are gonna get counted more effectively.  Their numbers are gonna go up,  our numbers are gonna go down,  and eventually you're gonna have a homogenization  of the podcast arena, which I regret as well.  And that's gonna be very subtle.  In my opinion, that kind of audience count difference  is not gonna be apparent, but it is going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know, maybe it will just be, this is my hope,  maybe it will just be less efficient to sell ads  on those more niche podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but eventually it gets harder and harder to do  because you don't, you know.  We spend a lot, look what we do here.  We spend a lot of money.  That's all, that would all have to change, right?  Yes.  So you're gonna get, yes,  what will happen is the great middle will go away.  You're gonna get the very high revenue intense podcasts  that are from big brands,  because they can do all this stuff.  You're gonna get the hobbyist podcasts  that don't monetize at all.  And the stuff like us,  the independent networks in the middle,  I think are just gonna disappear.  But by the way, this is exactly what happened with blogs.  When Ad Tech first came into blogs,  the Voxes and the Verges and the big blogs  of the world survived.  Blogs like yours kind of survived  because it was hobbyist blog.  But this middle, the John Grubers of the world,  you know, during fireballs kind of struggle  because they're not willing to do the Ad Tech stuff,  but they do need to monetize.  So it gets, I think that's kind of what happens.  But I don't know, you know, I could be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, the bigger question is,  in the long run, in an abundant based market,  what happens to volume based advertising?  The prices will keep going down and down and down and down.  Right.  And at some point it's not gonna be worth it  and you have to have new, there's no scarcity.  So at some point, entirely new models,  and I believe they're gonna be service based models  in journalism, are gonna emerge.  And yes, there's gonna be paywalls behind that.  There's gonna be other kinds of.  That's probably exactly what will happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with podcasting too, I bet you're right.  Yeah, I think that's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we should offer some more actionable grammar tips  if we want people to pay for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actionable grammar tips.  Actionable grammar tips, yes.  Tips.  Tips.  Punctuation tips.  I did get an upside down in Tarot Bank and Twitter,  and I'm wowing the math.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  An upside down in Tarot Bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I screwed up, I just cut and pasted, I got in there, yeah.  Upside down in Tarot Bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, aren't you fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We need the Hibonichi Techo people to sponsor us.  We can do product placement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's sitting here right on the desk.  Exactly.  Gee, I wonder what that is.  I sure would like to buy one of these.  They just went on sale this week.  Just went on sale this week.  Google is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we've discussed this before.  Did you try to be wire cutter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean with affiliate links?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We did a little bit with our, and we do now,  with our product show, we do affiliate links for Amazon.  You can't do it in a podcast for obvious reasons.  No, but on our site, if you go to Hands On Tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you click a link, that'll have an affiliate link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you click the link to the product, then.  It's maybe a few hundred bucks a month.  Yeah, no way that's not gonna pay anybody's salary.  If I still think.  It doesn't even have a car engine.  We're doing two products a week.  That's not gonna pay anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we've tried at TwitPix,  we've tried a lot of different things,  but honestly, really, 99% of the revenue comes from the ads  that you hear on these shows.  That's fine, I mean, we've done very well.  It might be, I'm getting to retirement age.  It's not.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, Dan, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm gonna write it down.  We'll just see what happens.  I wanna be doing this for years.  I don't wanna be chicken little,  but I do, I think that I love being in a medium,  a new medium where it's like this, it's democratic.  It's not mass media, it's not mainstream, and I love that.  And I think it's great to be able to do that.  Having come from the mass medium,  and still having a foot in mass media,  I really love what we can do with podcasts.  Not just mine, all podcasts, it's really exciting.  It's a new world.  It's really, really cool.  You can't retire until my kids are out.  I wonder what we'd each be complaining about  out of college, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Karsten, you could go get a different job.  I'm just saying.  No, no, we can't.  That is what people do.  No, I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am not really employable at anything but this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically, anybody who's still working here is stuck here.  That's really the story.  Including me, I might add.  Can you see me on the street,  pounding the pavement, looking for work?  This is another story that broke today.  Don't know what's gonna happen,  but according to the Washington Post,  more than half of the state attorneys general  are preparing to announce an investigation  into Google next week,  a big antitrust probe from the states.  They are expected to unveil the investigation on Monday  at a news conference in Washington.  This is according to the Post  and three people familiar with the matter  who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  It's not clear, according to the Post,  whether some or all of the attorneys general  also plan to open or announce additional probes  into other tech giants, including Amazon and Facebook.  This is kind of interesting.  This is what's been sort of happening.  It happened with a Sprint merger,  Sprint-team mobile merger as well.  The feds approved it, but the states have jurisdiction too.  And the state's attorneys general seem to be  more and more willing to wade into these antitrust matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think part of it is probably-  Well, it's also a very popular thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, hold on, go ahead, Stacey.  Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Part of it is a reflection of our current political climate  and the huge chasm.  As one might say, in states, you'll look and see,  and those are probably more populous,  and they will speak out where they feel  the federal government is letting them down.  And I expect to see this not just in tech mergers,  but across a lot of other things,  like some of the rollbacks of various federal regulations  that we're already seeing states come up and say,  nope, we're going to implement our own laws then.  So I think that's a function of the times we live in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it's also, but it's hard for somebody like Google,  because now you have kind of death by a thousand cuts,  piecemeal attacks.  For instance, not all of the state's attorneys general  have the same agenda.  According to the Post, Texas officials are worried,  in Louisiana, Mississippi, about politics,  political bias at Google,  and the censorship of conservative viewpoints.  That's Texas, but Louisiana, Mississippi,  sharply criticized Google for its handling  of users' personal information.  They're also concerned about the surfacing  of search results and a political bias.  So there's a mix of concerns here, and that means-  And agendas.  And agendas, and Google's got to fight  on a lot of different fronts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is what happens when we don't have a working mechanism  to hash out our differences.  That used to be Congress.  Now increasingly it's the courts,  and it's through these systems.  So it makes sense that we, I mean, this is,  if you look at this the same way you would look  at all the parties weighing in the different entities  affected by laws into the writing of legislation,  that's kind of what's happening.  It's just happening through the courts.  And again, it's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Six years ago the Obama administration declined,  the FTC declined to prosecute Google  over their search or ad business.  They decided not to give it any penalties.  Currently the Justice Department, the FTC,  and Senate lawmakers are all investigating,  and now these states are also going to get into the matter.  I should point out, and the Post does,  this happened with the Microsoft case way back in the 90s  when Microsoft was being prosecuted  by the Justice Department.  Their own state's attorneys general  also got involved in that.  But what usually ends up happening  is the federal government coordinates with states.  And that system maybe is breaking down  because you can see right here  with the Sprint T-Mobile merger  that that's gone through with the federal government,  but it's hung up now by I think 28 states,  some large number of states.  I guess that's just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But not large enough to write an amendment  to the Constitution.  No, can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when I talk about our little piddly problems  at podcasting, I'm glad I'm not Google,  that's all I can say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think even with that eggs it'd be worth it to be Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, just hire more attorneys.  You don't have to worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think about the quality of snacks  you would have in the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have pretty good snacks, don't you think?  We have awesome snacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I once had Chipotle queso,  that is not high quality snacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those new chickpea Cheetos are awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was for you.  There is a box marked Leo only,  which has macadamia nuts and shelled pistachio nuts,  which apparently are horrendously expensive.  We have to shell our own pistachio.  You have to shell your own, sorry.  Only Leo gets pre-shelled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've told everybody.  I'm on 8th Street in the Greenwich Village today  and I overhear, dude, you know I can't eat sushi, keto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Keto, just eat the fish off the top, it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's pretty funny.  You're gonna hear the keto cry more often, I think.  It's spreading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I'm gonna host Thanksgiving  for my parents who are keto and by gosh,  I don't know, I mean turkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Thanksgiving's easy for keto.  You just don't eat the mashed potatoes or stuffing.  You could have the turkey, you could have the green beans.  There's plenty of stuff to have.  Oh, they can't eat green beans?  Yeah, they can have vegetables.  Not my parents.  They don't even eat veggies, they just eat meat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can they have the sweet potatoes?  No.  No sweet potatoes?  No sweet potatoes, what are you crazy?  How about sweet potatoes with the marshmallows on top?  What are you nuts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Canberry sauce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  No, that's so sugary.  That's like just sour sugar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Green beans are a little carby, I have to say,  so maybe make them some broccoli.  Wee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, it's their call, man.  Bacon wrapped Brussels sprouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ooh.  Is that a thing they could eat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They could totally eat bacon wrapped Brussels sprouts.  They relish it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Drizzled with butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just think, no carbs, that's all, it's easy.  That's the thing about keto, it's very easy to do.  We had pizza for the staff today.  I just took the top off, left the crust behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you had cheese wrapped in meat.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gosh, it's good to be keto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you use cauliflower flour?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't use cauliflower flour,  because when you mill stuff, it gets a little dicey,  but I use cauliflower all the time, I love cauliflower.  That's fine.  Cauliflower rice is very, very good,  especially if you make it with parmesan cheese and garlic.  Mm, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, guys, I only had a salad for lunch,  you gotta stop.  It's gonna kill me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had greasy cheese wrapped in meat, myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, greasy meat wrapped in cheese.  Greasy meat wrapped in cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so excited, across the street from me  is opening a Taco Bell at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you ready for, what do they call it, fifth meal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fourth meal.  Fourth meal.  Why not have five?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's make it six.  That is the quintessential ad campaign in,  I don't know how to, fourth meal.  Yeah, three meals a day, it's not quite enough.  Let's go to Taco Bell.  It's just not enough for the American.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Supersize me.  So, Stacey, have you had the Popeyes fried chicken sandwich?  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but I really wanted to.  We all do.  I did, I did.  I'm not gonna fight for that.  Have you had a Chick-fil-A sandwich?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is the battle, which is better.  I won't eat a Chick-fil-A because of their politics, so.  I'm going to Popeyes.  But everybody's saying that the new chicken sandwich  at Popeyes, how do we get on these tangents?  Is like the next coming.  It's there's lines around the block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, no, they ran out.  They had to get rid of it.  I went to a store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Social media battles, massive crowds,  and overworked employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy, that does look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were crazed.  The staff was completely crazed.  And it's been like that.  They had to stop selling at 330.  Now they've stopped selling it entirely  because they're basically one out of chicken suppliers.  What?  Yeah, it's sold out.  We're out of chicken.  Sold out.  There were lines at every Popeyes.  The staff was working overtime driving crazy.  Huge issue for workers' rights here.  How does this even happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is how the restaurant wars begin.  We're gonna have only taco.  I think it was in Mad Max.  Every restaurant will be taco bell.  No, it was Demolition Man.  Only taco, only, all restaurants will be taco bell  within the next five years.  God, I hope not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Popeyes, I've never been to Popeyes,  but I've been told this is good.  This is the gender of the street.  Popeyes is delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, I know.  Popeyes fried chicken sandwiches, great.  That little mayo and some pickles.  The pickles are a nice touch.  I think the pickles are a nice touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The pickles make the Chick-fil-A sandwich.  I don't know about the mayo.  I'm anti-mayo.  But the Popeyes chicken is delicious and their biscuits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So apparently Buffalo Wild Wings and Cracker Barrel  are now testing new chicken sandwiches.  McDonald's franchisees are calling on the corporate office  to start developing a top tier chicken sandwich  as its top priority.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Buffalo Wild Wings is trash.  The launch of a legend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We missed this.  I didn't realize it's all gone.  It's done, it's over.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did wanna go get one, but I'm not gonna fight a crowd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've wiped out the entire chicken supply  of the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it was, I'm trying to find the story.  It was one tweet from Popeyes against, no.  No, it was Chick-fil-A responding to the Popeyes.  Against Popeyes and then Popeyes' response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Business Insider calls it the tweet heard round the world.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, so back to the-  I got the New York Times story.  It's a good story.  I've written the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Most early social media support of Popeyes' chicken sandwich  appears to have been a grassroots movement,  a rarity in the sea of influencers.  Did Stacey make a funny and I missed it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She tried.  No, I asked us to get back on target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Back on target.  Oh, I missed that.  This is Twitter.  This is social media.  This is Target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is legit.  All right, I'll get the internet.  Sure.  So-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That morning one of Popeyes' fast food rivals,  Chick-fil-A had tweeted what appeared to be  a thinly veiled critique of the new fried chicken sandwich.  A subtweet.  It appeared on the official Popeyes' account.  So then all the Popeyes responded.  They had a big meeting-  Popeyes responded.  High-speed brainstorming.  Y'all good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Y'all good was the response.  Y'all good?  Oh, that's cold.  So this is,  so there is a language of social media now.  I mean, I only just learned the phrase  from a subtweet a couple of weeks ago.  So this is all new to me.  Brett Stevens?  Yeah, no.  But it is handy now because of Brett Stevens.  And y'all good is like,  how we, what is the phrase?  It's not,  it's kind of like a subtweet too,  but it's like,  God, I don't-  It's in for-  It's like a backhanded burn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, backhanded burn.  But it's only, yeah, it's only by inference.  By inference.  You can't tell that they're talking to-  It's shade.  It's shade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  After that subtweet, Chick-fil-A went quiet,  but hashtag chicken sandwich wars  rose to the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's darn good.  What a world.  My cardiologist was not pleased, but it's darn good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What a world we live in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I will say that my daughter  and her friends are amazed that I speak,  quote unquote, their language,  but I don't.  I only speak what I learned on Twitter, right?  So the time I spend on social media  is mostly what allows me to quote unquote,  speak the language of the youngs,  but, and there's lots of research,  a lot of the language on Twitter goes back to  black Twitter and African-Americans,  and we just kind of all co-opted.  And it's a really interesting-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I tell you, that's from the beginning of the world.  Well, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jazz, rock and roll.  Coolio, daddy-o.  I mean, yeah, all the jazz speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Groovy.  You know what?  The most creative sector of America.  You know, I'm gonna extend it.  I was gonna say as African-Americans, it's immigrants.  It's the subcultures that rise up under repression  to create, and it's us white men that reap the benefit  when we capitalize on it with ad tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And teens are the most creative.  Teens are great.  Teens are great.  And they use whatever outlet they can use to be subversive  and God bless them for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the point is they're trying to create something  that the olds don't know, don't understand, can't get.  Like Snap.  Y'all good?  I like y'all good.  I'll be using that.  That is a good phrase.  The passive aggressive chicken sandwich debate,  as one news article put it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And meanwhile, there was the rush on the fake chicken  at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't use chicken?  Oh man, I didn't have a segue ready.  I was like scrolling up to try to get us  to a true story.  All right, all right, all right, all right.  And it didn't work.  I was like, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me do an ad so we can regroup.  Although I'm kind of curious about what, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just like the Burger King fake meat.  Fake meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fake chicken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shake Shack said, we have a chicken sandwich  without the beef.  Good, huh?  That's good.  That's good marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can't look like marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How to drive Stacey up the wall.  I thought this was a home for geeks and nerds.  It is very nerdy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  We're gonna come back.  We're gonna do more.  And we're gonna give Stacey a chance to regroup  and find us that Google story.  Meanwhile, Jeff and I will talk about weird punctuation.  No, actually we're gonna talk about monday.com, our sponsor.  monday.com helps teams manage work and meet deadlines.  But I love what's going on at monday.com.  We started using it.  I love it.  It builds a culture of transparency.  No mystery.  Everybody knows what's going on.  We all work better together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, I found a good story for ya.  Okay, Stace.  It's got everything.  It's got infrastructure financing.  It's got Google.  It's got internet of things.  And it's got private equity.  So.  The Wall Street Journal did a story about Google Alphabet  subsidiary Sidewalk Labs getting together  with the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan  to launch an infrastructure holding company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now Sidewalks Labs is controversial  because it's building this so-called smart city  in part of Toronto down by the waterfront  that some people say is just a big invasion of privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a big invasion of privacy  and the citizens who live there  won't have much decision to talk about it.  What is really or should be pretty controversial about this  is this new infrastructure investment company.  It's not a fund.  It's going to be its own company  that is going to lend money for civic infrastructure.  So things like roadways or suet,  advanced water treatment plants.  What's crazy to me,  and I used to be a government bond reporter, you guys.  What?  Wow.  What?  This is, they're going to invest in these projects  for cities, but they're going to choose the technology used  and they're going to take a stake in that technology.  So if the government were doing this,  we would call that corruption  because the government would be like,  hey yo, we're going to pick this vendor  if they didn't do an RFP process, I should say that.  And if they also had an investment in the company  they chose through that RFP process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You mean like if you owned the golf course  where the vice president stayed in Ireland?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it actually looks a lot like something like that.  Except think investments in technology  to improve your roads  or to improve your water infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there is a long history of pension plans,  teachers' pension plans, CalPERS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, and they investing in this sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a good investment and it's good for the state  and it's a good investment for the teachers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes and no.  So there are plenty of long,  so pension funds actually are really stuck in a bind  because they're trying to diversify out of just VC funds  because those are getting later and later stage  into other places.  And it's becoming more competitive  to get into high performing funds  because there's so many other funds trying to get into them.  It's analogous to something like,  I don't know how to say it, Macary.  Do you guys know that fund?  It's a giant infrastructure financing group,  M-A-C-Q-U-A-R-I-E.  And they fund things like toll roads.  But when they fund something,  they don't take a stake in the company  whose technology is going to be part of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so you're saying there's a conflict of interest here.  Because now the Ontario Teachers Union is a part owner  of the company that's doing the infrastructure.  Right.  Although that's how they profit, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, but, yes.  But as they finance these things,  I mean, these are projects that are designed to be,  and this also will depend on how you feel  about things like governments doing private jobs.  Would you feel differently

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if it weren't the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan,  if it were just me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, the problem I have is with the infrastructure  company that's financing these projects is,  Sidewalk.  Sidewalk, and the company they've created,  is taking a technology stake in the company,  is taking a financial stake in a company  that they're choosing to implement the technology  that's part of the project.  Instead of having an open bidding process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, isn't that a better vetting process?  If I'm going to take a stake, I'm going to do due diligence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It feels kind of like insider kind of dealing.  I mean, I would be, I am very suspicious.  I feel like, as a reporter, I would want to see  all the records of something like this.  Especially when it, but it is something  that is clearly happening.  So, enough people are like,  I don't know if this is a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would think that if I'm putting my pension fund  in a technology company, that I'm going to do,  I'm going to even be more careful to make sure  that they're up and up and going to make money for us.  Infrastructure's hot right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, are you funding infrastructure  or are you funding new tech?  And if you're funding infrastructure,  well, but if you're funding infrastructure,  your goal is to have it be awesome for the longterm.  Right. Right.  If you're funding tech that is built  into this infrastructure, I don't feel like these are,  these should not be part of the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what the real problem is,  I think is the short term thinking,  it's the mismatch between tech,  which is going to be on quarterly returns,  versus infrastructure where you're talking,  I want 20 years, 30 years, this infrastructure's got to,  this bridge has to stand for a hundred years.  And so the mismatch, it's another case  of a duration mismatch where the tech company  is only looking at, well, how much money can I make  in the next three months?  Is that the problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I guess nobody sees this as a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're the only one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to, yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She was just trying to do anything to distract from chicken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think this is a really big deal  and I'm not explaining it well  and that's because I'm a writer, not a talker.  So I'll work on it.  No, I'm trying to figure out the circle there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Carson Bondi.  I really want to be Stacy'splained over whether  or not USB 4 is going to fix the USB-C problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is how bad it's gotten.  Now, Carson's trying to distract us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you all up on USB 4?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  God, I just want something to stay the same.  I'm all up on USB-C dongles.  You're getting old, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a sign of getting old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's not.  It's a sign of like, I'm fine with technological advancement.  I am not fine with things killed,  like ports being killed by backwards incompatibility.  How about this?  Especially when it's happening every year  on devices I have to keep for three or four years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they're uniting Thunderbolt 3 and USB under USB 4,  will we eventually be able to buy a USB-C cable  at Taco Bell?  Without checking whether it can deliver power,  whether it's Thunderbolt capable,  whether it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, why are you nuts?  What are you nuts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just want the USB 4 standard to be a standard  and not a quote, quote, standard.  Right.  The problem...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it does that, I'm all on board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It won't, and I'll tell you why,  because it's downward compatible.  So you'll never be able to look at a port  and know what its capabilities are  because it's got to support everything.  So you'll still be able to look at a port  that might just be USB 3.1 and Type-C,  or maybe this one delivered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, they are changing.  They are keeping the connector.  Yes, that's the problem.  So your USB-C works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the problem.  You can't inspect the connector  and say, I know what this does.  And that's the whole problem.  It's never going to get better.  So good luck, Carsten.  And we were talking about this on Windows Weekly  because Microsoft has, for reasons no one fully understands,  on its surface, puts Type-C connectors  but doesn't support Thunderbolt with them.  In fact, only recently supports charging with them.  In fact, they only recently put them on at all.  So, and then the rumor is with Microsoft  is going to have an announcement October 2nd  on new Surface devices.  And I think our experts, Mary Jo Foley  and Paul Therotte on Windows Weekly,  both agree don't hold your breath  for Thunderbolt support on the new Surface devices,  which just keeps us in this silly downward spiral.  And there you go.  There's an XKCD for everything.  By the way, I felt kind of bad.  We had a great interview with Randall Munroe on Friday  on triangulation, the creator of XKCD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I just put that screen up,  so you can plug it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you should tune it in.  But I just wanted to tell you,  we did the interview shortly before it was revealed  that his forums had been hacked  and all the information leaked.  I got, I hope they weren't related events.  So Randall's scrambling a little bit today all week  because they've had to shut down their forums  on the xkcd.com site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whatever happened with the Joey Ido interview?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Canceled because the Media Lab has decided  to defer publisher of his book  until he is less of a hot property.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But everybody should still go to twit.tv slash try  and watch the Randall Munroe XKCD.  Oh yeah, I could do with my daughter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He loves that man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't he great?  And you know, she will like him even more  when she realizes what a sweetheart he is.  He's not, he's kind of what you would hope.  It's kind of neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Any bearing with my daughter.  No, I mean, he's just like.  She is a dark individual right now.  I know.  Grow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was surprisingly, I don't wanna say naive,  but innocent, sweet, really a great guy.  I really enjoyed talking to him.  It was such a thrill.  Danny Sullivan kind of caught in the middle  in an unusual position.  He is the founder of course of Search Engine Land  and Marketing Engine Land.  Went to Google.  Went to Google.  He's in a little Twitter battle with DuckDuckGo.  DuckDuckGo tweets, most people know companies  like Google and Facebook collect and sell your data,  yet some people think, so what?  I have nothing to hide.  Here's five compelling reasons to tell them  why your privacy is worth more than you think.  Kind of all of this conversation we just had.  Hyper-targeted ads, propaganda and discrimination,  the filter bubble, user data is saved  and shared with third parties,  user data is sold to advertisers.  Danny Sullivan responded, well,  regarding the filter bubble claim,  we don't at Google manipulate your search results  based on what we think you'll click on,  nor are search results different from someone  doing the exact same search at the exact same time  as the video claims.  And he said, another tweet this week,  DuckDuckGo claimed Google had a filter bubble.  I feel bad for Danny,  because do you think Danny wants to be in this situation?  We used to have him on, of course, all the time.  I love Danny.  Once he started to go, went to work for Google,  we kind of backed off a little.  I keep asking him to be on again.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He keeps saying, he keeps saying,  I really want to be on, but I'm far too busy.  Ask again in three months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google may not let him.  I've watched in events like Newsgeist,  where, no, Danny tastes glee.  Some will say too much, but I would disagree.  I love watching him, because he tastes glee  in telling people where they're wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and he's right about the filter bubble issue, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, here's another book to recommend, just received.  Are Filter Bubbles Real by Axel Bruns?  Guess what the conclusion is?  No. No. No.  I've read his papers, and I just got this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sullivan points to a new tool  that automatically deletes location,  history, and activity data.  He says, I work for Google Search  to help provide information about how we operate.  So I'm only speaking to the part that's in my area,  the filter bubble part.  But somewhat related, we do have new tools  that let people automatically delete data.  And so I'm gonna click on that link,  auto delete controls for your location,  history, and activity data.  This came out in May, so we did report it at that time  in the changelog, but you can turn off.  You can say, once an activity's older than three months old,  you can delete it.  And that's all built into my activity.  So keep for three months, 18 months,  until I delete manually.  That's better than nothing.  Three months is maybe, some would say, too long.  I have a Firefox browser that I use on iPhone and Android  called Focus that deletes the data as soon as you log out.  In fact, I even get a notification on my phone  that says, click this to delete  all your erased browsing history.  And so it just pops up after I use it.  So there are ways to be a little more proactive, I guess,  but not in Google land.  No, not in Google land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's hard, it's hard work when you have to,  when you move from the Google world,  everything is very convenient,  and then you have to piece this sort of functionality  together using a couple different sites,  and you're never gonna get quite there.  So, and you have to remind yourself constantly,  like, oh, I'm supposed to do this.  It's tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not an Instagram user.  Did Instagram follow up on deleting the like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't notice.  I do use Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So apparently Facebook says, yes, it may do the same.  Start hiding like accounts.  I think there's a lot to be said for the fact  that like accounts do drive a certain amount of...  Weird behavior?  Weird behavior, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think, but I don't, in most cases, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, normal people look at likes and go,  oh, look, I got 12 likes.  But it can become addictive, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what also I like to do sometimes is on some things,  I'll see someone surprising like something,  and I wanna see who all liked it,  only because I think, oh, I didn't know they cared  about that, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there is information there.  So this, I guess Instagram is testing it in seven countries,  not necessarily yours.  And Facebook says now, we're not gonna do the same.  We're gonna try it, test it.  Not live for all users, test it.  And Facebook declined to share results  from its like hiding tests, its exact motives,  or any schedule for starting testing.  But I think that's an interesting idea.  It's like hiding follower accounts on Twitter.  It would very much change the platform, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know, when I started blogging,  I looked at my traffic every day, I cared about it deeply.  Then after a time, I just didn't give a darn anymore.  And the same for all the metrics that exist out there.  I just don't, I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you're not trying to sell anything.  I mean, I can say as someone who I personally do not care,  but as someone who's trying, who's accountable  to advertisers or who has been accountable  to advertisers and editors, those things matter.  And if you're an influencer trying to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So would you be opposed to getting rid of them, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you be opposed to getting rid of those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think people could then,  I think it's nice to hide that kind of stuff.  I think it does drive people to behave,  to do it for the likes kind of thing.  And I think it also would make it harder  to be one of those influencers,  because you wouldn't have a way  of necessarily tracking that.  I think there's a lot of repercussions there,  but I'd be for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just generally think that playing whack-a-mole  with information is not always a good strategy,  and I tend to like more transparency.  I think we can present it-  Yeah, but the likes are so silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, there's bots, there's no transparency.  I mean, yeah, it's transparent, but it's stupid transparency.  It's like showing someone, I think, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like drawing on a map of the hurricane's path  with your Sharpie to expand it into Alabama.  It's like that, is that what you're saying?  This is the, this is not, that has nothing to do with anything.  This is the original chart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but not related to this at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The important thing is that with his mind alone,  he changed the path of the hurricane.  As Marianne Williamson, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've got to give full credit,  as Marianne Williamson suggested  that the power of the mind can deter,  she's running for president too.  So-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So she deleted a tweet that said-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Millions of us seeing Dorian turn away from land  is not a wacky idea.  It's a creative use of the power of the mind.  Two minutes of prayer visualization and meditation  for those in the way of the storm.  But as you know, no tweets are ever deleted on the Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can delete your tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but they've been saved.  Somebody's found a-  Somebody's been-  Somebody's been-  Oh, okay, I was like, well-  Yeah, oh yeah, you could delete them, but they live on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So then Yashar Ali from, I think from Huffington Post,  tweeted that she had erased it,  and then she went on an attack against him.  All he said was she'd erased it.  And so then she defends herself from not being crazy.  But if you have to defend yourself from not being crazy,  well, I don't know.  You've already lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've already lost.  I am not crazy.  I am not.  Let me quickly talk about my beautiful white teeth.  This is not crazy.  This is, thanks to this, the Crest 3D whitening kit.  At the health club,  I was just at the health club this morning  doing my workout, and they're, for $199,  they will whiten your teeth.  I thought, well, I don't need that.  I've got my Crest white kit.  This is amazing.  It's 100% guaranteed.  It removes over 10 years of tough,  set in stains, coffee, wine, smoking,  to give you noticeably whiter teeth.  It's really easy to use.  I've been using it.  I love it.  In fact, it's really, I time it with my show.  So right now it's succession.  Here's what they look like.  I'll just show you.  I'll give you an example.  Safe on your enamel.  This is exactly the same ingredients  the dentist uses for much, much higher price.  It's hydrogen peroxide.  That's all it is.  And it comes in these nice adhesive strips.  There's no messy gels or trays.  It's very simple.  I'm gonna do it right now.  I'm just gonna show you.  So before my show begins,  I put the strip on the top and the bottom of my teeth,  and I just sit and I watch the show for about one hour.  You could talk, you could drink water.  It's just happening in the background.  Completely safe on your enamel.  And then when it's done,  this really is the pièce de résistance.  You got the LED blue light to help target stains  so the ingredients work faster and better  than the white strips alone.  This is also what dentists use.  You put the LED light right there,  and turn it on, you see it's glowing.  And that's timed as well.  And when it turns off, you're done.  You're done.  $20 off your first Crest 3D whitening strip kit  by going to crestwhitesmile.com.  Use the promo code TWIG at checkout for $20 off,  and that includes free shipping.  This really works.  And I know you're probably tempted when you see the ads  at your health club or your dentist says,  come on, come in.  But wait till you see the price the dentist wants  and wait till you see how little it costs to get it done.  In your own home and the comforts and convenience  of your own home completely safely  with the Crest 3D white strips.  I've been using these and I don't know if you've noticed,  but I look 10 years younger.  It's true.  Well, I can't promise you that.  You might only look five years younger.  Crestwhitesmile.com promo code TWIG.  These are great.  And you get 20 bucks off right now.  It's a good deal.  I'll put my white strips away for another day.  Next episode of Succession.  As long as there's a good TV show on,  I will always have white teeth.  That's my promise to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I wish Kevin were on the show  because there's a story about these Chromebooks  dying early.  Yeah, what's the story there?  I don't know.  I was gonna ask you guys,  cause I saw this and I was like, what?  That sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are cheaper computers.  So I'm not surprised.  Android police blames Google.  I don't know how you can blame Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just, you get what you pay for.  It's a netbook that you nailed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're paying $200 for a laptop,  it's not gonna last as long.  My pixels last as long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By dying early, do they mean that the hardware is bad?  Then how do you blame Google for that?  By dying early, do they mean it doesn't get updated?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there is, okay.  So the hardware platform is developed by Google,  the motherboard.  So as Android police says,  the CTL Chromebook tab TX1 and the ASUS CT100  both use the Scarlett baseboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is-  Well, and I think part of their issue  is some of these devices are shipping,  but they're gonna ship with less support  than what was promised  because they were actually built in support,  the clock on support for their internals and Chrome,  their internals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When they promised six years of update,  it's six years from when that-  Implementation.  Platform was not released.  Yeah.  The support cycle begins when Google  completes the hardware platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which kinda sucks, but I also kinda get it  because you can buy a machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, who keeps a computer for,  that's a really interesting question  is how long do you keep your laptop?  How long do you expect?  Is it every three years, every five years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they point out if you go to Amazon,  you search for best Chromebooks,  you'll see the ASUS Flip C302, which is a great machine,  but it is two years old.  It's well into that life cycle  and only has three years of update left.  Now, I have to point out  there are people on Microsoft Windows  who are gonna be out of life a year and a half  because they can't update from Windows 10 1803,  which is the spring update last year  for various hardware reasons,  and 1803 goes out of service.  You're not gonna get updates  if you don't upgrade in a few months,  and that's less than two years.  That's pretty darn quick.  That sucks. Yeah.  So this is not, in the business, this is not unusual.  Apple will only update to Catalina,  that's new operating system coming out next month probably,  systems that came out after 2012.  I mean, that's seven years ago,  but it's just what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not unusual.  To answer your question, Stacey,  I hold onto a laptop only until Google gives us the next one.  So you're on Pixelbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You guys are a little abnormal.  But our Pixelbook's in great shape right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These were $1,000 laptops and they're all working well.  Who is it comes in?  I think it's Ian Thompson,  comes in with like the first Pixelbook,  and he said, yeah, it's really on its last legs,  but that thing is how many years old?  That's pretty old.  You mean the Pixelbook?  The slate gray Pixelbook. My last MacBook was five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  The brand was different.  What was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't remember,  but the one that's kind of gray metal, dark gray metal,  not the newer lighter ones.  They did two generations of that one,  and they came out with the new Pixelbooks.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know if I agree.  This article says something has to change.  I think this is pretty hard for the course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would like, and I think this is really important  given security threats,  that every connected device, be it your phone,  which actually already has it,  comes with a sticker that explains when support  for that OS or whatever it's running on runs out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It should have not six years from date.  It should have a June 20, you know, 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess that's why I'm more sanguine about the Chromebooks  because these Android phones,  something like 40% of all Android phones  are still on lollipop.  Lollipop.  Lollipop.  So we're, I mean, that's where there's a real problem.  These devices are not secure anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're not getting updated.  But it is tough.  I mean, it's not like the average person  doesn't necessarily know  to look for security update supports.  Like I look it up.  And like the other day,  the reason why we updated my daughter's phone  is actually because Apple announced  that they weren't gonna do patches for iPhone 6s anymore,  and that's what she's on.  And so that precipitated a change,  but otherwise she'd probably still be on that phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a certain kind of,  in my day, we kept a TV for 12 years.  We kept a car for 15.  My refrigerator. This isn't that though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not that anymore.  This is just me saying consumers need to have.  They should know.  Yeah. Yeah.  If you're gonna build tech into a device,  you should know how long that tech is going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we have to kind of understand  that it's not gonna last as long as your car and TV used to.  It's just not.  So I'm sitting there on Friday interviewing  Randall Monroe, XKCD,  and all of a sudden people come running in and say,  Jack Dorsey's Twitter account has been hacked.  Again.  This is, I don't, I mean, who cares?  But it was the chuckling, it was the chuckling,  the chuckling club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Same people today hacked HitGirls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, shocking. Now I'm upset.  What is HitGirls?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, HitGirl.  I call her HitGirl because I can't-  Khloe Kardashian?  Khloe Grace Moretz.  Is that how you say her name? I don't know.  Is this on Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay. I know who you're talking about.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  HitGirl from that other superhero movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. That other superhero.  What other people are talking about.  So she was hacked on Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Her Twitter account was hacked, yes, by the same people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we think that Jack's account was hacked  by what we call simjacking,  which is absolutely a problem in the world.  People pretending to be Jack Dorsey  called his phone company and got,  and basically hijacked his cell phone number.  And Jack had been using a service Twitter acquired  nine years ago called Cloud Hopper,  which lets you tweet from your phone via text message.  It does not authenticate you though.  It looks at your phone number and says,  oh, that's Jack Dorsey.  Go ahead and post the tweet.  And since they had his phone number,  they were able to tweet as Jack Dorsey  for about 15 minutes before they got shut down.  So is that a weakness of the phone system or Twitter?  It's a very big weakness of the phone system.  Sim swap is a real problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The flip side to that is,  the flip side though,  if you make it too much more difficult,  people complain to the phone system  because they can't recover their accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is hard.  Twitter has decided to disable SMS tweeting as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which was the whole beginning of the company.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was what it was for originally was SMS messages.  So it's entirely disabled now.  Yeah.  I mean, that seems like a draconian response  to having your CEOs.  Do you know anyone who ever actually used SMS tweeting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can also, in the early days,  you can have incoming tweets via SMS,  which really could be a lot of tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I did all my Twitter via SMS in the beginning.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't do all of it,  but I definitely did a bunch of it.  40404, that was the short code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of Jack Dorsey,  I've got another question for you.  Yeah.  I put a link up in the chat,  in the, not the chat, but in the rundown.  Yes, I see it.  It's a fashion question.  Jack Dorsey's.  The far right picture.  I don't care about the shoes.  The far right picture, Jack's long hoodie.  You think I can pull that off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to see a fashion question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This, you want to wear this?  Where is that?  Because it's all black.  The far right one.  You like all black.  You think I can pull that off?  You think I can pull that off, the long hoodie?  Absolutely.  Which, this one?  Yeah, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that a hoodie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this one.  The hoodie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, you probably could.  Yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Definitely.  Anybody can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  His head looks oddly large in that outfit.  Doesn't his head look too big for his body in that outfit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's either the camera angle  or he's trying to be a supermodel.  Who knows?  I think it's the camera angle.  And his beard.  And his hair.  His beard adds length and his hair adds length.  Oh, that's it.  And the shadow behind his head also does help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's it.  You're right.  It's a trick, a trompe l'oeil, a trick of the eye.  Why is he holding a hammer with Justin Bieber?  That's what I want to know.  What's that all about?  Habitat?  If I had a hammer.  So yes, this was an article on Mashable  about Jack Dorsey's footwear evolution and investigation.  So if you ever complain about the kinds of things  we cover on Twig.  I know, Mashable.  It could be worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, you know, that is a legit topic.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I love fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've talked about my Austrian shoes on the show.  The Gieswein.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Gieswein.  Oh yeah, I was like, didn't we talk about  like Allbirds or something?  But yes, the Gieswein.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, we did.  It's a weird, you know, the problem is folks,  before the show I looked and I said,  weird week on the rundown.  Like back from the holiday,  there was nothing that kind of just screamed,  talk about me here.  It is, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The fine was good.  The Google's cookie sinking or super cookies is good.  We could do the Google change log.  It's time for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you got him, Stacey.  Good work.  Good work.  Sorry, Carson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I was actually in the studio.  I saw that poor Carson has to like hit five buttons,  hold his elbow and dance to get that to happen.  I'm gonna point out, he doesn't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He might, but he's not required to.  It's not part of the overall, is it?  Maybe it is, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All he has to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to turn up the,  I have to turn up the TriCaster audio.  I have to push the button.  I have to make sure it's selected up here.  It's a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm exhausted just thinking about it.  It's a thing.  I wanna go home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there not a macro we could build for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are TDs here who are better at doing that  part of the job.  This is not what we heard.  I heard Carson.  It's something that my hands don't do well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's again, an artifact of my vanity and hubris  that I thought we should do streaming video of these shows  when it's completely unnecessary.  Like I had all kinds of costs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true, because Kevin and I get requests for it.  Like six people have asked Kevin and I, only six.  Like I am capable of writing down every single topic

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we talk about as we talk about them.  He's doing that right now.  And time code.  No other TD can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  You're exceptional at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I can't bring up videos.  For some reason, I am incapable of bringing up videos.  Like that's just something I can't do as a TD.  Can we make a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And all the other TDs don't have a problem with that.  Let's take one of those,  that was easy staples buttons  and make it a change log button.  If we could do that, that would be awesome.  Google planning big changes to the way Chrome tabs work.  Adrian Kingsley Hughes of ZDNet writes,  but you might not notice.  Google's planning to carry out a major decluttering  of tab options that users are presented  when they right click on a tab in the Chrome browser.  The options used to be,  new tab, close other tabs, reopen closed window,  bookmark all tabs, play the Google change log theme.  Those are now gone, at least in Canary.  But I bet no one notices.  So, I mean, it's a change.  And so, hence, it's in the Google change log.  Any questions?  Google camera is, they made a smart trade off  on the Pixel 3.  And you may notice this on your brand new Pixel 3.  When you look for...  It's on the 3A too.  It's on what?  The 3A.  It is on the 3A.  I have the 3A.  When you look for SmartBurst, it's gone.  You'll find instead Top Shot.  It's not exactly the same, but it's close enough  that I don't think anybody's gonna really care  about this one either.  Top Shot is awesome.  You can only get a few, you know,  you don't wanna have too many choices in there, right?  So, Google has decided to focus on the development  of Top Shot, which, what?  It takes a number of pictures and then suggests the one  that nobody's blinking in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does the same thing SmartBurst did.  It takes like 15 pictures at once.  And then it just, it automatically picks the thing  it thinks is the best, but then you can go back to it  and scroll through those 15 pictures and say,  no, I think this is the best.  So what did SmartBurst do?  Kind of the same thing, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they had two things that did the same thing  and they've decided to get rid of one of them.  What, Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  Why wouldn't they do that with messaging?  There was a messaging story and we didn't talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Man.  Yeah, hold on, we're not done yet.  It could happen.  I'm not saying it will, it just could.  So, you can't, SmartBurst did not let you manually  set burst size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, SmartBurst was only, like it only decided for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and you could create animated GIFs with it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically, it automatically created GIFs  and automatically picked things for you.  But apparently, I imagine they have.  A little bit better control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I imagine they have telemetry,  so apparently nobody wanted it.  That's, if you have an older Pixel phone,  you could continue to have SmartBurst  because top shots can't be done on an older phone.  But Pixel 3, 3 XL, and I presume 3A  that you just got for your daughter will have now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, the 3A is for me, the 2 is for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well she will still have SmartBurst.  So if you need SmartBurst,  you should run on over and borrow her phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe we'll take some pictures using both  and see what the difference is.  There you go, would you do that for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's something for Stacey.  The TensorFlow machine learning framework  for graphical data.  There was a bunch of words in there.  I knew each, the meaning of each individual one,  but not the total sentence it makes.  So today, Google introduced neural structured learning  and open source framework that uses  the neural graph learning method  for training neural networks  with graphs and structured data.  It works with the TensorFlow machine learning platform.  It is made to work for both experienced  and inexperienced machine learning practitioners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can throw a bunch of charts and visual data,  I believe, and sorry, charts and structured data  at a tense something that the TensorFlow framework  or whatever it is.  And it will tell you what you need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chew it up and spit out intelligence.  Something like that.  New logos, rebranding for Android Auto,  Android One, and Android TV.  Again, another change,  you're just not gonna really care about or notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even the change log is anemic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a weird post holiday week.  It's a weirdly anemic test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, there's actually some cool stuff.  Okay.  Or Stacey keeps trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you guys, this is actually cool.  So your Pixel phone now actually can work  with certain select hearing aids.  Oh, this is Android 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an Android 10, yeah.  So that's a cool story.  This is a nice feature.  I actually use my ReSound hearing aids on an iPhone  because those are MFI hearing aids.  And so it's great because you could be walking around  with your hearing aids and listening to an audio book  and no one knows any better or a baseball game or music.  What are you listening to now, Leo?  Wouldn't you like to know?  So no, yeah, that's a feature that iPhones had  for some time.  They have a lot of nice hearing aid technology.  Android has been kind of hit or miss,  but this is a nice feature of Android 10.  Yeah, we could, you know what, you're right.  We did not put Android 10 into the change log.  We probably should because frankly,  the next change log is equally dumb,  which is Google Play Store.  Well, no, I've got another good change log.  Wait a minute, starts auto playing videos later this month.  Woo hoo.  Woobity doo.  Okay, give us a better one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gmail on G Suite, so only G Suite, I think,  can tell you if you set it out in office  and someone tries to email you.  And I think, is it only your coworkers?  I'm a little unclear on that.  It would be better if it's anyone.  And when you start to email them,  Google will be like, yo, that person's on vacation.  And then you'll be like, oh, I shouldn't send them a message.  I thought that was pretty cool.  I don't know how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mean, get the damn vacation OOOs.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're on, wait a minute, let me get this straight.  Because what I really need is if I'm on vacation,  I can't send any email  because I already set my vacation reminder.  That's not what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's going to let you set, no,  if I were going to email you and you had set your email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It will know and it'll say, no, no, no,  don't even bother, he's out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  Yeah, nice.  For some people,  that means they will actually get fewer emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Finally, something in the change law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I care about is I get fewer OOOs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you, Jeff, will get fewer OOOs.  I can't stand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did see another change today.  I updated Chrome and then it said,  I did two things.  One, it said there was a new sign in  for the admin of all of my accounts from one page.  I had to update them.  And then two, I went to calendar and it said,  oh, we can show everybody who you shared your calendar with  your normal working days.  I said, no, no, don't do that.  So it can know when they can bug you.  No, no, don't do that.  I said Google, no.  But it was new, it's change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would out me in a lot of ways.  Yeah, same here.  Like my working hours are not necessarily  the working hours you might expect me to have.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google calendar, speaking of working hours,  makes working hours more prominent.  Wait a minute, is this what you were just talking about?  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm double dipping on the Google change log.  Just trying to fill it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that in the change log?  No, it's not.  We were a little bit.  But somebody didn't put it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't put anything in the change log this week.  I was so lazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I didn't.  I was so lazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should have caught that one too.  That's a good one.  Working hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  All right, well we may have achieved all of our goals  with this show so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have finished the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is done.  Thank goodness.  It is done, it is done.  Are there any other stories before we go to the bottom  and get our picks of the week?  Any other stories that we have missed that you fellas,  and I mean by fellas, you guys.  You shouldn't say fella or guys anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you say?  Y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Y'all.  Can we use dudes?  I like dudes.  No, I hate dudes.  I hate dudes.  Dudes is not gendered.  Y'all.  It is gendered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Y'all.  Actually, Carson.  You know why?  We don't have in English a collective you.  Are you a.  We have y'all.  It used to be the and thou.  But now we got you and y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You and y'all.  Yes, y'all.  Used to be the and thou.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's now ye and y'all.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is you a collective you?  It is.  You and you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's undistinguished.  You see what I'm saying?  It's just you and you.  In French.  Forever time.  In French, it's to and voo.  But in English, it's you and you,  unless you use y'all.  And y'all, I am ready to wrap this out.  Y'all good?  Y'all good?  Ah, y'all good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I got a question for you.  I got a question for you.  Should AOC,  if Trump legally cannot block people  because he's the president of the United States on Twitter.  Isn't a member of Congress just the same thing?  But she's getting horribly harassed  by some really awful characters.  Well, don't you think President Trump

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is getting horribly harassed?  He doesn't read the Twitter.  Well, so that's not neither here nor there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She actually responds.  Should it be the law that she can't block someone?  Should that be the case?  Is that a legitimate view?  Didn't the court rule that President Trump could not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you should be able to block people  who are sending you incredibly offensive content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should, and I should,  and Professor Jarvis should.  But a member of Congress has a right,  has a obligation to listen to response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If there's, maybe when you're a member of Congress.  I get that.  But what I'm saying is,  what if you had, before you could block someone,  you had to prove that they were horrifying  and you would go to, maybe it's a federal judge.  They're not doing anything else, right?  Okay, let's add a little thing in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because according to Roland in our chat room,  she does not block anybody from her district,  abusive or not.  She only blocks people who are not her constituents.  That changes it a little bit, doesn't it?  That might be legal.  I think she has the right to block  people who are not her constituency.  The thing about the president is we're all his constituency,  but she is elected representative from the Bronx,  so she should not be able to block constituency.  They should have the right to speak to her,  but nobody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that works.  There you go, an answer.  Thank you for the one.  Thank you, Roland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem is then she has to track  who's treating at her.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that means-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, she's only blocked like seven people.  So she has to track who's an a-hole.  That's a little bit easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But maybe they're in her constituency, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there's seven people she's gotta figure out.  They're Russians, anyway.  Are they Russians, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  You think?  Oh yeah.  Well, she should be able to block anybody  from outside the US.  And any sock puppets or bots,  she should be able to block them.  They should have to be real people.  Oh well, I don't have to worry about that.  Let's take a break and you, oh, there goes Stacey.  I knew she wasn't gonna make it through the whole show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We grab her out.  We're gonna be back in just a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's do an ad and I'll get her back.  That's the saddest sound in the world, isn't it?  Chicken sandwich and grab her.  Hang up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's much for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We will come back with your picks of the week  and maybe if we can get Stacey back her thing of the week,  but first a word from Epson.  This is my pick of the week.  You can kiss expensive ink cartridges goodbye.  Epson's EcoTank wireless color printers,  they're all in ones, have super tanks  with up to two years of ink in the tank.  It comes with a printer.  Enough to print thousands of pages.  And then when you go to the store to get more ink,  and these bottles are great because they're keyed.  You can't misuse them.  They only can fit, and it's easy to use.  You get another two years of ink.  So when you go to the store in 2021 to get more ink,  you could say, I'll see you in 2023.  I love this.  We have two at home.  I like them so much.  With the supersized easy to fill ink tanks,  EcoTank printers mean fewer trips to the store,  less frustration for you.  Epson wants your printing experience  to be stress-free and easy.  And you know, I like Epson.  I've always had a thing for Epson  because my first printer was an Epson,  remember the dot matrix printers?  And they've just gotten better and better.  And these EcoTank printers are so sweet.  I probably do as much scanning with my EcoTank  as I do printing.  It's so awesome.  Get the compact EcoTank printer for your home or office  with that big tank so you could just fill and chill.  Check out epson.com slash EcoTank Leo  to transform the way your home or office prints.  And do away without of ink frustration.  Just like Shaq says, fill and chill.  For the best combination of ease and value,  turn to the Epson EcoTank printers.  Now through September 30th,  just in time to get back to school,  you'll get free overnight shipping  when you use the promo code EcoTankLeo at checkout.  For any EcoTank printer offer valid  within the 48 contiguous states,  exclusions apply subject to availability.  E-P-S-O-N-Epson.com slash EcoTankLeo.  Epson and I go way, way back.  I bet you two, I mean I bet you,  most of you, the early days your printers were Epson's.  They're still the best.  Epson EcoTank printers, just fill and chill.  Epson, exceed your vision.  Thank you Epson for supporting this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of Epson printers,  I was standing there in the airport as I do a lot.  And I'm looking at the folks behind the counter  at the gate.  And of course they have a dot matrix printer there,  spewing out the passenger list and stuff, right?  Where the heck do you buy a dot matrix printer anymore?  Can you?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Industrial stuff, maybe.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe.  I wonder if they do that  because it's a special form or something  that they're printing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's not a form, it's just,  it doesn't feed multiple sheets.  It's one sheet.  It's a manifest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Do you think they just price it with a nice...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a Canon copier  that is 16 years old.  You can still buy one. No, 20 years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google shopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that a tractor?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah?  Epson dot matrix.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're so noisy.  Why would you want them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you buy the paper too?  Sure, I guess.  It's hard to find.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, my parents.  Yeah, I remember the dot matrix,  the sound of the dot matrix.  My parents had one.  Thanks a lot, Stacey.  Yes.  Sting's parents had one.  I was a kid.  No, I was.  Thanks a lot, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeez.  Sorry.  It's okay, I'm used to it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you ever see that video of like,  it was 24 if it had been shot in like 1998 or 99,  or maybe it was like 1991?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The cell phones and the dot matrix printers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so he's like,  okay, send me the information.  Okay, we're waiting to print it out.  You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the fax is on its way.  You know, for people from our generation, Stacey,  that's not amusing.  We remember those days.  Yes, we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember them too.  See, I just was younger.  It was normal.  I just wasn't trying to function in the workplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, now Stacey, you're starting this back in  on the history of word processing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, God.  I gotta get that book.  I do want that book.  Stacey, what's your thing this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I have a great one.  You guys are gonna love it.  I was gonna do Room Me,  which is a new sensor out,  but I'm gonna do that next week after I get one.  So stay tuned for that.  But,  oh, I've forgotten it.  Yourthings.info.  My thing is your things.  That's right.  My thing is yourthings.com,  or .org, sorry.  Let me pull that up.  .info.  .info, gosh.  Slash scorecards.  I'm doing this all good.  Yourthings.info.  This is a project from UNC, Chapel Hill,  and Georgia Tech.  So two very legit organizations  have done a review of about 75 or 74 smart home devices.  They've only posted the scorecards  for about 40 something of them,  but they're your popular ones.  You've got Belkin, WeMo,  you've got Arlo stuff,  you've got Bose, Sonos,  Amazon Echo, Google Gears,  Roku's, SmartThings.  And what they've done is they've done a device grade.  So, and that's related to characteristics of security  on the device.  They've done it for the mobile networks  and for the cloud capabilities.  I don't really know the cloud endpoints.  So like where are they sending data?  What are the TLS configurations?  They've also graded it on its network communication.  So is it encrypted?  What kind of protocols are they using?  Are they susceptible to man in the middle attacks?  So you can go and look up your devices.  You can look up how they scored.  I was kind of surprised by some of them.  And I just thought this was a really,  and I would encourage you to do so.  And even before you buy a new device,  I would encourage you to go and be like,  hello, are you a good device to have in my house?  Why or why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you were gonna pick one of the four grades,  device, mobile, cloud or network,  which do you think is the most important?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is really tough because like,  it kind of depends on what you want the device to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's interesting is that you can get things  that are really high in one category  and terrible in another category.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And like, I was like, Sonos got an F for,  I think it was network connectivity.  And some of these are design decisions.  I think this is why security for these things is so tough  because some of these decisions make sense  within the context of what is likely to happen,  like what you're likely using it for.  And so it's very hard to be like, oh, this is terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is not one device in this list so far  that it has an A in every category.  Canary is the closest, which does not surprise me.  Yeah, what is it?  Tell me about what's Canary again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Canary is a all-in-one home security device.  So it's one of those.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you mean the thing, is it the Thinkst Canary?  No.  The what?  No.  Canary, it's a-  It's not the Canary we advertise for Thinkst.  It's a different product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what that product is.  So I'm going to guess no.  If you Google Canary.com-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an enterprise security device, so I don't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, no.  This is a siren and motion sensor and-  Oh, I remember the Canary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a little tower thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  It gets a high score.  That's nice.  I've searched for it and I found the Canary Islands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also, lovely.  I don't know how secure those are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is not, in fact.  It's not an SSL site at all.  The connection is not secure to the Canary Islands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But for example, your Google Home,  its cloud is super secure, right?  As you might expect because it's Google,  so it's behaving well.  The device score is only 78.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the mobile app score is only a 69.  And the network score is horrifying  because probably it's not encryption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They got a device just called Chinese webcam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I did like that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't know anything about it.  It's just a Chinese webcam,  but it did not do well as you might imagine.  This is good.  This is very useful stuff.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so I thought you guys would appreciate your audience,  all of you guys.  Y'all.  Y'all.  I thought y'all would appreciate it.  Y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're gonna start saying y'all.  We're gonna make y'all be the new lingua franca.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Y'all is great.  Y'all good?  Y'all good.  Jeff Jarvis, y'all good?  What was your number of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was hard to find a number this week too,  but I finally found one.  One of the more interesting,  but actually kind of useless technologies  Google's talked about is Project Jacquard.  Oh yeah.  Which is controls built into fabric.  They had a Levi's jacket.  They have it available in something else now, in a backpack.  And you think that would make people  all kinds of happy geeks, they can get it,  but it says Yves Saint Laurent backpack.  Uh oh.  That costs $880.  Yikes.  What can I do with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a backpack that costs $880 Jeff.  It's a backpack strap that costs $880.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to put the backpack on included.  Worse.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's, you could, you can put that  on your other backpacks, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Any backpack you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right, so it's, it's interoperable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interoperable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Backpack strap.  Wow.  And it has a USB port.  There's a Jacquard dongle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  So you can stroke up, stroke down, tap or cover.  To do things on your-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like this.  We're gonna see this in more places  where it's the costs are gonna come down.  They're just playing with it.  I would hope so.  You can afford it.  I think about having more,  think about having another interaction paradigm.  I said that word.  That you can use when your hands are not full,  but like when you don't wanna pull out your smartphone.  Yeah, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I will tell you-  It is kind of a limited set-  Oh, it's totally limited.  Of functionality.  So what form-  I would not buy this today.  I could make this, I could make this-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Volume up, volume down, pause, play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I tell you what my bicycle helmet does?  So I have a Laval bicycle helmet, which I love, L-I-V-A-L-L.  And it has a little dongle,  a little thing you attach to your handlebars  that has multi-functionality.  You pair it to your phone.  It's a Bluetooth enabled helmet.  You pair it to your phone  and it has a left turn signal, a right turn signal.  Volume up, volume down, start, stop, take a picture,  launch the smart agent.  All in one tiny little button.  That's the kind of function, and it's not $800.  That's the kind of functionality you want.  I can answer the phone.  I can, I mean, this thing is amazing.  So there, I think this is overpriced,  this jackpot technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I even can send an SOS alert.  Get the helmet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or you can get the Facebook, whatchamacallit,  portal on sale on Amazon right now for 70 bucks off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought it was gonna be for 70 bucks.  Then I would have plots.  I spent so much money on those two portals.  I think 600 bucks total for two portals.  For you and your mother?  No, it ended up not getting used at all  and it's just sitting there and Burke's taking it apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's $130.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's now down to 130, but that's the 199 one.  That's the smaller one.  I got the big, tall ones.  So here, just so you know what this multifunction button  looks like, it's right there.  Oh, it's on the button, oh, I see.  See, it's on your handlebar.  Press left for left turn, right for right turn.  Press the red button to start and stop music.  Bottom button, Siri or Google Assistant,  top button, camera.  Up and down buttons, volume up and down.  I think that's pretty good and just a simple device  that is about, you know, it's only about that big.  By the way, I love my helmet.  And it lights up as I'm driving down the street  so people won't hit me.  People can see Leo coming.  You can see me coming.  I'm bling bling all the way.  They actually call it the bling helmet.  Ladies and gentlemen, that's the end of Twig for the week.  I think we'll have more to talk about next week.  I'm just hoping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will- Yes, the Apple event  and what else is happening next week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Apple event.  I won't be here because I'm going to the PodFronts  in San Francisco.  You know, Upfronts.  Jeff knows what Upfronts are.  It's where the networks bring their shows  and their stars and show advertisers  and say, please buy us for the next year.  Podcasting has a similar thing.  I went a couple of years ago to New York's,  the PodFronts, IAB does these.  And I'm going into San Francisco to the PodFronts.  So I won't be here.  So it'll be Jason Howell next week.  And I will return the week following.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey will also not be here sadly next week.  I'm going to take over.  Oh, I won't.  You should take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it will be-  I'm going to talk about chicken sandwiches  and moral panics.  Yes, and Gutenberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Jason Howell and Aunt Pruitt will both be on the show.  Oh, nice.
