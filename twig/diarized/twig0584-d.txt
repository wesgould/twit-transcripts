The show where we cover the latest news from the Google verse, the Facebook verse, the Twitter verse.  All the verses. Ant Pruitt is here. Hands on photography, hands on wellness, hands on the hard body.  No, that's what they call those contests where you get a bunch of people in a mall.  Yeah, it is. Isn't it?  Yeah. But no, we're not going to go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, they get people on the mall and they all have their hands on the truck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the first and the last man standing wins the truck or woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I have one more thing to look up on Netflix and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very much. It's such a great documentary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of like what they used to do in the Depression with the dance contest, the dance marathons.  It's like suffer for a truck. That's Stacy Higginbotham of Stacy on iot.com.  She's two cookies in so she may be a little intoxicated on the show today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was either cookies or alcohol and it's too early to drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go with the cookies, baby. That sounds good, man. I could use some right now myself.  I was going to make snickerdoodles last night. Instead, I just we just got like three large pizzas.  And that is Mr. Jeff Jarvis. He's exhausted. You didn't stay up, did you? Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I stayed up. I realized about 10 o'clock my time, 10.45 my time.  Nothing was going to happen. But then I woke up at one as your Lisa did and panicked.  I couldn't get back to sleep. But then probably did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I was sleeping soundly and she goes, we lost.  I said, literally, I think I said, I feel bad. Shut up. I'm sleeping here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I slept like a baby. I got like six hours last night. That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For Aunt, that's a lot of sleep. Wow. Good for you. Good for you.  And you actually you posted this in in our company Slack. And I thought it was quite the story.  It's all about Ring. Oh, the Ring video doorbells.  They're going to pilot a program in Jackson, Mississippi, with the local police to live stream Amazon's Ring cameras.  Basically, you know, obviously, as a ring owner, you'd have to opt in.  But it's really an interesting problem because suddenly you've put CCTV, live CCTV cameras throughout the neighborhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not all about the people that actually own Ring, though.  You know, yeah, the people across the street that doesn't have a ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's what the Electronic Frontier Foundation says.  This serves two police purposes.  First, it allows police departments to avoid the cost of buying surveillance equipment  and puts that burden on the consumers by convincing them they need cameras to keep their properties safe.  Second, it evades the natural reaction of fear and distrust.  Many people would have if they learned police were putting up dozens of cameras on their block, one for every house.  But of course, it captures footage from your front door of you coming and going from your house,  your neighbors taking out the trash, dog walkers, delivery people.  And that could be live streamed into monitors scrutinized around the clock by the authorities.  Or by your stalker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Access to something like that is really problematic, even though we have a history of case law that talks about  if your garbage is at your curb, it's kind of publicly available.  People can root through it and grab stuff out of it.  So it really, I mean, walking down the street is a public activity, but is sitting on your front porch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  The alleyway behind your house.  Less so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we, you know, there are cameras in downtown cities all over the country put up by the police.  But they're crap cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those things are absolute crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And so it's okay because the video is terrible.  Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know firsthand because I had an incident a couple of years ago back in North Carolina where someone ran into my car.  And we needed some sort of evidence to figure this thing out.  Well, no, someone caused another person to run into my car.  It was sort of a chain reaction.  And of course they just hauled ass out of the parking lot and went on about their day.  And you go and look at the camera.  You can see the camera right there.  40 feet away from you up in the air.  But the resolution was crap.  Tastic.  Couldn't see anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  That's an interesting defense.  I guess it's okay because they're crappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As a somewhat of a mental deterrent.  Just because you see the camera up there.  Things are so bad on resolution.  They would just carry on with their business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They don't have to be anymore.  Clearly, I mean, they can be high def.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the green cameras aren't awesome from far away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, no, because they're very wide angle because they're designed for your front right, right.  Your front stoop.  So they're super wide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it only the doorbells or will they also, because Ring also makes IP cameras for outside your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's Ring cameras.  It's everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so it's the cameras, not just the doorbell cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not just the doorbells, yeah.  So the cameras are much better quality and they're not quite so wide.  This is really a great, philosophically a great subject because,  Yeah, you're right.  I mean, the police cameras downtown are there as a deterrent.  Certainly the camera in a 7-Eleven is there as a deterrent as much as anything.  Well, we're capturing what you do.  They're not on suburban streets or, you know,  It helps police.  Oh, wait, wait, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're looking at the ZDNet story, is that what we're being?  No, this is EFF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Electronic Frontier Foundation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The story says, the ZDNet story about this program that we're talking about  actually adds a clarification that Amazon's Ring product was cited as an example option.  And Ring says, this is not a Ring program and Ring is not working with any of the companies or the city in connection with this program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's interesting because Jackson, Mississippi actually banned face recognition.  So it's not, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that doesn't mean they can't pull.  I mean, you may not digitally scan all the faces in these things, but you can just have someone look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  The original time Jackson is still facing, what was it, like a hundred deaths this year,  homicides or something like that in that particular area.  And they're trying to figure out a way to crack down.  So I get the premise, but I don't know.  Still a little half and half on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. So what's your final view, Ant, about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get trying to lock down and help keep the citizens safe and have some way of catching the wrong doers  because you have an eye out there that can witness them and find them.  I get that.  But at the same time, the neighbors across the street that's just wanting to sit on the porch and have a whiskey and just hang out,  they're being watched too and didn't really ask to be watched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, but isn't this isn't this properly?  I'm going to play with Stacey right now.  This is we should have a discussion with our neighbors, right?  Basically, if you're if you're Gladys Kravitz, is that a reference you get at all?  Yes, I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm the only one on this panel besides you who remembers Gladys Kravitz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that Lenny Kravitz's mom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In Bewitched, remember the nosy neighbor in Bewitched?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You've never seen Bewitched?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've seen Bewitched but didn't remember the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you remember.  OK, so if you've seen Bewitched, it was certainly a part of a lot of episodes was this nosy neighbor because she was always snooping around.  And Samantha was always worried she'd she'd caught to the fact that she was a witch.  That was that was I'm sorry.  Yeah, that was the stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So anyway, now everybody's Gladys Kravitz, right?  Everybody has this.  But if you do it and your neighbors say, you know, I really wish you wouldn't do that.  Or thanks for doing that.  I'm glad you caught the criminal coming to take away my lawn sign.  You know, I don't know.  But that's at some point it's a negotiation.  You're free to shoot from your house, whatever you can see.  There's actually there are actually efforts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm trying to remember where you actually have to with cameras on your property, you have to make sure they only look at your property lines.  And there actually have been some cases on this.  Yeah, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact, I would expect that would that be true of the street or your next door neighbor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is for your next door neighbor.  So like, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, right. Right.  You can't shoot your neighbor's window.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, or their backyard is right.  This case was around, I think, backyard.  And forgive me for not remembering the actual case.  I can try to look it up.  Dare you not remember?  But I mean, first of all, I think, you know, and I've talked about this, this kind of plays to that idea of consent.  One, you know, when I put doorbell cameras or any cameras outside, I make sure I've got a sticker saying, hey, there's a camera here.  Be aware.  Two, I do try to make sure it doesn't catch my neighbors.  But I do that just because I'm trying to be nice.  And I do catch my neighbors or I did not now.  But my old house, you know, there's a walking path that went right by my backyard, which is where we had our camera facing.  And, you know, I could see parents and their kids walk by, dogs pooping in the lawn.  I mean, just all kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does it make it better if, and it is the case here, the police only access the video after a crime has been committed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would. You know what would make it better is if it died, if it went away after 24 hours.  If it were constant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or there's some limit to the amount of time that they could access it.  I mean, you know, 24 hours is pretty quick.  I wouldn't say 24 hours.  What if I get murdered in my house and you don't discover the body for a few days or a week?  You would still like to see who came and went, right?  Yeah.  All right. You can have it for.  Although if I get murdered in my house, I just want you to know it'll almost certainly be my wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're telling her to shut up on the most important day.  And we may not blame her. That's the other part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And she's got a very credible excuse.  I had it coming.  But he was an a-hole. Oh, yeah. Never mind. Forget it. Sorry. You're free to go.  He just wouldn't stop talking.  So that is an important qualification. I'm actually looking at the original story from the Jackson Free Press.  It is not a program from Ring, but Ring doorbells will be used.  Part of the original Ring program, right, which is to give police access to this.  The city council signed off on entering the pilot program at its Tuesday meeting.  The equipment needed to allow the center access to the cameras is being provided by two corporations,  Pilium and Fuses. Terrible names.  And they, in fact, can use Ring cameras.  The Jackson Free Press story had a actually picture of a Ring video doorbell right in the right in the front of the story.  But it is a ring loves these things. Yeah. Yeah.  Poor Ring. But so but it but Ring is really is somewhat coupleable because that's part of the Ring thing is that you can  submit you can have your video submitted to the police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So anybody is going to say whenever anyone asks for my advice on their doorbell cameras, I actually tell them I'm like, hey, here are the issues I have with Ring.  And that will make you complicit with certain things. Some people think that's a feature.  Some people don't care. And other people are like, oh, God, no.  So I think the key is to understand what it could be used for if you're purchasing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it fair to say that really comes down to your whether you trust law enforcement in your area, right?  If we trust them, if they're trusted helpers to protect our safety, trusted public safety officers, we want them to have this tool because we trust that they won't misuse it.  And so some of this complaint comes from the fact that trust in local law enforcement is diminished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like facial recognition, like data, like all like like like street cams, like all kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And how you approach this really is going to depend on how whether you feel that they're trustworthy or not.  Right. If I you know, I think our Petaluma police are great. I don't think I think it'd be great to give them this tool.  And I trust them not to misuse it. On the other hand, I'm fat and rich and white.  So maybe I'm the wrong person to ask. You know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I think, yeah, whoever has trust in. I mean, if you're if you're on top, you're likely to trust people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Because yeah, because they're there to protect me. God damn it. That's their job.  I am the power structure they were created to protect. Please don't forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The other problem here is that Ring is making in the U.S.  I don't think in other markets, but in the U.S., of course, is making a market out of paranoia and paranoia can have racial undertones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, I have mixed feelings about this because I did not want to have I thought I'm not going to have cameras around the house.  All that does. I watched my brother-in-law. We went to on a trip with him and he was like his phone was out all the time.  Seeing others, somebody in the backyard others, there's motion. He was like, it makes you paranoid.  And so I said, I'll never have that. Then I got a Ring doorbell more because I wanted to look at that and review it than it was because I felt any need.  And suddenly I got kind of like kind of dug the notion that I can see when it back.  And then by the time I'm done, I've got cameras all around the house.  The ring of the house.  And, you know, my neighbor, I have a neighbor up the hill who has a bad tendency to come on our property and kill our trees.  I pointed a camera at him. I mean, suddenly it does.  It makes you that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He kills to your.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a long and tawdry story. I'm not sure I want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. I mean, like that's like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we live. There's a hill behind us, pretty high hill.  And he came over the other day said, no, I bought 10 feet into your property. I bought that land.  No, you didn't. Do we have to survey it and build a wall?  So he is he routinely, I think maybe he routinely comes down because the trees on our property, apparently he doesn't blocks his view or some, I don't know, blocks his view of our hot tub mostly.  So who would want that?  Yeah, I don't know why he would want to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you should explain that to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But last year we had a tree guy come out and, you know, trim, you know, our burst come out and do something.  He said, you know, these trees have all been murdered.  We said, what? Yeah, they stripped the bark on on these trees and killed them.  Oh, wow. And we knew exactly who it was because he had previously come down and say, let me cut those.  So we know he's, you know, sneaking onto our property and killing our trees.  There you go. There's the story.  So I have a camera pointed at him, I think, with some justice.  If I could get a shotgun pointed at him, I might even do that.  No, no, I wouldn't do that.  No, but he's kind of a jerk.  You know, I mean, he keeps he comes down and yells it.  He yelled at Lisa saying, no, I own that property.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, but again, that was a legitimate use cases that people want to have these cameras for their own personal personal use cases.  Personal personal property security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you get packages stolen off your porch, having a ring is not a you know, you understand why somebody would want that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then you're able to present that information to law enforcement for investigation.  Yeah, it makes total sense. But live streaming all day long.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's you know, we haven't come to the answer to this.  It does come down to do I trust law enforcement to do the right thing with this information?  Because if you do, then you want them to have information to solve crimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And then what's the additional cost if this were to be put into place from a taxation standpoint?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I realize I've I've been you must think I have horrible neighbors because I told the story about the other neighbor who stole our cat.  And now, yes, yeah, it is well done.  What do you watch the shows? I do have some of the neighbors are great.  Wow.  Life in suburbia is just marvelous these days.  I live in suburbia.  No, you live in exurbia. You're on an island.  That's not suburbia. It feels very you're in the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They would like you to think that, but it's not true.  All right.  So ring cameras. We decided it depends on if you trust.  Sorry. Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah.  Consumer IOT devices to live stream.  Bad idea.  To the police.  Bad idea.  I'm going with it's uncomfortable. I don't like it.  Uh huh. Yep.  Actually, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what else is uncomfortable?  This is now the most viewed video on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is? Oh, no, not that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got to turn on my.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to turn on my sound.  The one time we forget to check the sound.  So I'm in Dubai.  And we are standing outside the world's tallest building, the Burj Dubai.  And they have a fountain show, a water fountain show.  And we were standing there waiting for the water, like in Vegas.  Like Bellagio. Yeah, like the Bellagio.  And we're standing outside there waiting for it.  You know, and in Bellagio, they play like Sinatra or Elvis.  You know, they play rock and roll.  This is what they played in Dubai.  The most now the most viewed video on YouTube.  What's that? What's that?  Why is my phone ringing?  What the hell is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Someone's calling you.  I don't know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know what? That was a nice break to keep us from hearing that little earwrap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Seven billion.  Jesus. Seven billion views.  And you thought.  What was that Korean K-pop song?  Oh, Gangnam Style. Gangnam Style.  Gangnam Style. You thought.  Yeah, I'm talking about Baby Shark.  Yeah, it's probably better that we don't play it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somebody called me during Baby Shark.  The most. You know why it's most played?  Because three year olds don't know any better.  Children's. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. And they play it like 200 times.  They're like, play Baby Shark. Baby Shark. Baby Shark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Baby Shark. More Baby Shark.  And more Baby Shark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two years ago, we went with that with Hamilton.  But, you know, that was just one of us.  And it's less annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Let's talk about Google.  Their quarterly results are out.  Actually, this was a wild week last week.  Everybody's came out all at once.  We spent a lot of twit analyzing that.  It was a pandemic quarter.  It didn't seem to hurt any of the tech companies that we cover.  Total revenues of $46.2 billion for Google, led by an increase in advertiser spend in both search and YouTube.  If you look at Google Cloud, of that $46 billion in revenue was $3.4 billion.  It's not other bets, basically losses.  They always do.  Other bets are generally...  It just reinforces. Google makes its money in search and ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How much are they charging me for my G Suite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What does that service income add up to? Nothing, right?  Did they break that up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, is that cloud?  I don't know what it is.  Is it other?  Could be other. I doubt it's other.  I bet you it's down there in cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What cracks me up is other bets, their revenue.  Eighty-eighty, $178 million.  The losses on that? $1.1 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Billion, billion with a B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like oof.  Ruth Porat has not quite...  Wait, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is cash burning a hole in your pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh.  Well, they do so well in search.  I heard hot pockets.  They do so well in your hot pocket.  I don't eat hot pockets.

Transcript:  Yeah, more spending on ads.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's just you and me, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, I would like to point out that Google Cloud did really well year over year.  It's nothing compared to Amazon's cloud revenue, but the increase, I mean, it's a sizable increase.  So somewhere, someone is buying Google Cloud.  They're a distant third.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're a distant third, though, right?  So distant.  Yeah, so distant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So distant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what is it?  Was it Amazon and Azure and then Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And actually, I let's see.  I can pull up the.  That's the order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But boy, when you look at the sizes, it's Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Amazon is Azure.  That different, huh?  That's the audio version of that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Amazon's hefty, hefty, hefty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Google's not going to say.  Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy.  Thank you.  You want to get the data?  AWS revenue.  Let's see.  Eleven point six billion is their cloud revenue from this last quarter.  Google.  Oh, Google's.  Whoa, was three point four billion.  And Microsoft's was 13 billion.  Oh, it was actually.  Azure's catching up.  Microsoft.  No, Azure's beat AWS revenue.  It's having a good quarter.  Microsoft cloud revenue has.  It has other.  It was actually down three percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have.  I wonder if they have Office, you know, Microsoft 365.  I think 365 is in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Azure revenue grew 48 percent year over year, but they didn't give you an Azure total.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  None of these guys break it out well enough that we can really compare apples to apples.  I love this chart.  It does. It's not quite related.  It's from inside.  It's on market cap.  So two Googles equals one Apple.  OK, four Walmarts equals one Amazon.  Amazon's market cap is one point six trillion.  Apples is two trillion.  It takes eight lifts to equal one Uber.  Ten Zooms to equal one Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, that surprises me.  I would have thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Zoom's doing well because their market cap's gone up a lot.  It's one hundred forty seven billion.  Microsoft's is almost one point six trillion.  It's up there with Amazon.  It's really Apple, Amazon, Microsoft.  Totally dominant.  My favorite, though, is Facebook's market cap was seven hundred ninety billion dollars compared to Twitter's of 38 billion.  That means there's 20 Twitters to one Facebook.  That really puts it in perspective.  It does.  Yeah.  What about if you broke out YouTube?  YouTube would probably be we don't they don't break it out, but there'd probably be a pretty big chunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, well, there was one of the stories.  They said YouTube was a problem, basically.  Oh, yeah.  It's a high expense revenue.  That is high.  I forget where I saw that.  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure the expense is you have to if it's if it's big enough, you have to break it out.  If it becomes material, you need to.  So I don't understand how they would get away with it.  Otherwise, the SEC would call the CPAs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is the first time actually I think was last quarter was the first time YouTube ad revenue was disclosed.  This is a story from Ad Age in February.  It topped 15 billion dollars in all of 2019.  But but the expenses are huge.  So it's not a it's not super profitable because the cost of revenue like content acquisition costs 21 billion dollars.  So that was up from 18.  And then don't forget, they've got to run all those servers.  Wait a second.  Twenty one billion.  They have to pay the music companies and stuff.  It just said cost of revenue.  So they made the revenue was 15, but it cost them 21 billion to make it.  It gives you some idea.  You know, it's pretty amazing.  It's pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why those those YouTube ad sense checks are so small.  Yeah.  Can't afford it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and think about what YouTube does.  And we upload our videos to YouTube instantly.  And you know this, because you put stuff on YouTube, too.  They are compiling it for a dozen different formats, different sources.  Different stream speeds.  They do huge amounts of transcoding, which is a huge compute load.  And then they have to cost.  Oh, yeah.  And then they have to store all those versions.  It's kind of amazing what they do at scale.  Google must find some value in it.  I mean, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, maybe that is important because of the other aspects of it, like the TV side of it.  That's probably why they're still keeping it around because of the whole live TV thing.  Or is that about the flop, too?  I don't know why or the world screams, break up Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They say, fine, fine, fine.  Oh, yeah, there's that.  Yeah, thank you.  It's fine.  Take that off our books, please.  Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't know.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They generate, they spin off so much cash with their search and ads that they can afford it.  They probably think it's got an upside.  There's a future there.  I'm glad they, I mean, look, I'm grateful.  There's so much good stuff on YouTube.  There's a lot of bad stuff, but there is so much useful stuff.  You know, my son learned to cook on YouTube.  People learn to play.  I've said a gazillion times that I watch YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pretty much just as much as I would watch Netflix, if not more.  It's an edge and it's educational.  There's a lot of different documentaries out there that the algorithm just seems to know  what to suggest to me that I never knew even existed.  And it's all on YouTube.  It's not it's not anywhere else.  It's on YouTube.  OK, there is going to be one election story, but it's a little one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the Prop 22 pass.  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the Prop 22 pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, it did.  That's actually a big that's a big story for us, isn't it?  So that gives Uber and Lyft drivers Uber and Lyft to not hire their drivers to keep their drivers as independent contractors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that any other companies under that like journalism?  Any other any other industries under that was just specific to those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just app based workers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if I have an app for cleaning people, that would be the same thing.  That's correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK.  App based transportation and delivery drivers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, just transportation.  Oh, my. That's a special case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's yeah.  Well, I mean, it was written by Uber and Lyft sponsored by Uber and Lyft.  By the way, it looks like the California the new California privacy law also passed.  Yes.  Hey, about that opposition or proposition 24.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  But that actually was not the story I was going to tell you about.  Remember, calm.com are sponsored calm.com sponsored CNN's key race alerts.  And they noticed a huge spike.  A huge spike in traffic after that and they're airing the 32nd commercial,  which is just rain falling on leaves and saying, breathe deep now.  Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant.  Placement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well done.  Screwball Whiskey should have sponsored it because I think they would have really done good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But OK. Yep. Yep. Yep.  So we have a so the story of the California privacy proposition is kind of interesting because  it was originally going to be on the ballot last year and the legislature and Silicon Valley was so concerned about it.  They made a deal with McTaggart, Tavish McTaggart.  The the I don't know what he sounds like, but I imagine he sounds like the groundskeeper, groundskeeper Willie on the Simpsons.  I don't know why. Just his name, Alastair McTaggart.  He he made a deal with the legislature.  OK, you pass your bill.  But he was unhappy and he went back on the ballot and won.  So Proposition 24, it was controversial because Facebook did not fight it.  And so there's some concern that maybe this is one of those laws that will, you know, something.  Well, no, the Facebook can afford.  It's regulatory capture.  It's regulatory capture.  Facebook could afford to do this, but no little guy can.  So in a way, this is a law that protects Facebook's incumbency.  The new data privacy law will do some of the things that the legislature passed.  Bill did not.  It'll let businesses let you tell this much like GDP GDPR tell businesses to limit the use of sensitive data like exact location, health information, race and religion.  It limits how long businesses can hold on to the data.  It allows the government to fine companies up to seventy five hundred dollars for each violation of children's privacy rights, creates a new state agency.  This was partly the controversy to enforce the privacy law, invest violations, investigate violations and access penalties.  But you have to be big.  You have to be one hundred thousand households a year or larger to be affected by this law.  So Alastair McTaggart got his got his way.  It looks like. Yeah, I think we're giving them the projection is fifty six percent.  Yes, forty three, forty four percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. You know, I look at that and see that you have the pose inside of it and I still didn't quite understand why people would oppose or companies.  Welcome to California.  You know, I mean, because I try to look at all of these, you know, from just from the middle of the road and try to see both sides of it, even down to the Uber and Lyft.  Was it Prop 22?  Because I could see both sides.  That's right. At the end of the day, I figured out, you know what?  It's I'd rather take an Uber or Lyft versus a cab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I voted yes on it.  Yeah, you know, choice.  Yeah, but well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That wasn't all the reason I voted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can argue against it.  I understand that the point of it is to protect workers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, we're getting I mean, this is kind of like the Amazon question, right?  Amazon, it optimizes for cheap consumer goods that are rapidly accessed by us, which is what we want.  But it doesn't take into account the costs of ignoring all of the costs that it takes to provide us with those things.  So we might want this just like I want to eat sugar every day all this time.  But I also would like to keep my teeth.  And, you know, the problem is these things don't take into the externalities into effect.  And that we want what isn't always good for us long term as a society.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was tough.  Like I said, I looked at it and all of them.  I tried to look at it from the middle of the road so I could see both sides of it.  And it made me think about when I moved here last year and the controversy I had with the state of California being an independent contract.  You lost your gig with the tech republic.  Right. The whole gig workers thing.  And it struck a nerve with me.  So I was thinking about that.  But then I also considered that heck, the state just wants some extra revenues for Suda state unemployment if they can get it.  Because I'm pretty sure a lot of independent contractors out there, whether they're riding Lyft or driving for Lyft or Uber, probably fudging those tax records too.  You never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was swayed by the fact that I know a lot of people like you, Ant, you know, people in our business, tech journalists and so forth who are freelancers who couldn't work in California anymore.  Yeah, I lost a lot of money.  Yeah.  And so that swayed me.  I wasn't happy about that.  AB 5, this bill was, I think, fairly ill conceived and had a lot of bad unintended consequences.  But then I agree with you, Stacey.  You want to protect workers against predatory corporations like Twit that will hire contract employees like you guys and give you no benefits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the challenge is you'll pay for it elsewhere eventually.  Society does.  You're either going to pay for, like if they don't have health insurance, you're going to pay for more expensive hospital bills, for example.  So, I mean, we have, I mean, I think employer-based health insurance kind of really distorts the market a lot, but that is kind of what we have here.  But that's where you're going to see this.  So, yes, you will be able to take a cheap lift somewhere, but you're also going to pay for it with someone somewhere near the service.  Or you're just going to have a bunch of homeless people who can't access health care.  And that is currently happening, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What also happens, Stacey, is that maybe all of those people who are unemployed could be employed except for the law.  I run into it, too, even in my school.  If I want to hire somebody just to write one research piece, I have to hire them on staff.  Or else they have to prove that they have a consulting business.  They have to have business cards and letterheads as if anybody uses those things anymore.  And client lists and all this stuff.  And it means that I don't hire them.  And so people lose work as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Ant lost his game, right?  On the other hand, ACO...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tried to finagle it with my LLC because my LLC was still active in North Carolina.  Lawyers was like, nah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could do that, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, when you use the word finagle, it usually means probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a red flag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're probably scurrying through some things.  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My favorite Martian.  Dang it.  You finagled it.  You know my favorite Martian?  Yeah.  No, it's just you and me again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Old TV shows.  Remember, don't forget.  Jeff used to be a TV guide critic.  You knew that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  I recall seeing that somewhere.  At least once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, you know, we always have...  I think I've always attributed to the cowardice of the California State Legislature that they just didn't want to vote on these tough issues.  So they said, let the voters decide.  Let the people decide.  On the other hand, I'm a fan of democracy, so I can't really argue against it.  Kamala Harris was against Prop 22.  So was Elizabeth Warren.  So was Joe Biden.  So was the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees in the California Labor Federation and the ACLU of Southern California.  There were a lot of people against it, including gig workers rising.  But there were also a lot of people for it.  It was a very difficult one.  And I think it's just not clear.  And, you know, I think you should...  Everybody should do what you did, Ant, which is really weigh it, the pros and cons, and do the best you could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of people go into these elections with just totally irrational.  You know, it's super duper emotional.  It's a lot easier to vote that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just to say, I know how I'm going to vote.  But then a lot of people like Baby Shark.  And, you know, there's that.  We can't hold that against them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Someone please take my ears from me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ant, I don't even have a kid.  And that is like...  You have a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, love Ted Lasso.  A kid of that age.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when the singer or when the fancy soccer player started singing his name to Baby Shark, I was like...  Wasn't that funny?  It had been out of my head for like so long.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And poof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was culturally right on.  It was well targeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was that show only on Apple TV?  Yes, only on Apple TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think Baby Shark will be the new Rick Roll?  If you have anything to say about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by LastPass.  Here we are in the beautiful LastPass studio.  Thank you, LastPass.  This has been a tough year for us.  And I think every media outlet, every podcast, quarantine really hurt.  But thank you, LastPass, for sponsoring the studio, keeping us afloat.  Really, it made a big difference.  So thank you, LastPass.  And you know what?  It made me happy because I've been using LastPass for a dozen years since they first came out 12 years ago.  I talked Steve Gibson's ear off about it.  So finally, 10 years ago, he went and interviewed the creator, looked at all the code.  Joe Segrist gave him a complete tour.  He said, wow, this is really good.  They're doing it right.  Steve's been using it for a decade.  Our security guy.  That was about six or seven years ago.  I think we started using it at Twit because LastPass Enterprise is so valuable.  And you know, when we started sending people home to work from home during quarantine,  we were thrilled that we still could send them home and feel safe.  And that was thanks to LastPass.  You know, you don't want to trust your most valuable data with just anybody.  That's why LastPass has been our choice for identity and access management for years.  We're not the only one.  They've been named a leader in the G2 Fall Grid Reports, a leading peer-to-peer review site that provides unbiased user reviews on leading software solutions  of the 746 customers that left user reviews there.  93% rated LastPass four or five stars.  I'd give it five stars for sure.  Couldn't be happier.  IT and security leaders can take back control of password security in your enterprise from a central dashboard.  They see exactly who's using what, when, and where.  Businesses can customize admin privileges.  I love the granularity of that because you can give people access to just what they need and not anything more.  You get company-wide visibility.  And that even gives you information about how strong your employees' passwords are, how well they're sticking to policies.  So you know that, you know, your training or your informational stuff is working.  And LastPass is so easy.  It'll integrate right into whatever you're using for onboarding users, syncing groups, revoking access, everything you use.  Admins get actionable insight.  They can access security scores, see real-time readouts of your business's password hygiene, track improvements over time, review audit reports,  build compliance, maintain accountability with detailed reporting logs that tie actions to individuals.  For every employee, you can view their password scores, gain access to shared accounts, monitor group memberships, and more.  Look, we don't want to spy on our employees, but we do want to make sure that they're doing the right thing because they have access to our bank accounts,  our websites, our data, our customer records, everything.  So you got to protect that.  We enabled two-factor authentication, but LastPass goes a step farther with multi-factor authentication,  adding contextual information like IP address and geolocation.  It makes it easy to log in, makes it easy to generate good, strong passwords and keep track of them.  So your employees will have good password hygiene, good security without a lot of effort.  In fact, they love it because it makes it so easy to just log in.  I think you're going to love LastPass. I know you're going to love LastPass.  I think your employees are going to love LastPass.  They've won eight awards so far this year, PC Magazine's Editor's Choice, the Fortress Cyber Security Award, Business Insider's Best Overall Password Manager.  I can go on and on.  This is really the way to protect yourself and your business.  Let the award-winning LastPass help you take back control of password security.  LastPass.com slash twit. LastPass.com slash twit.  We thank them so much from the bottom of my heart for keeping this show afloat.  Thank you, LastPass.  Thank you.  I love what we do. I think we do great content. We have a great audience.  But we don't charge anybody for access. I don't want to.  I want to make it accessible anywhere you want to listen.  I want to do the best job we can.  It's thanks to our really loyal sponsors that we can do that.  So we appreciate it. I appreciate it.  Jack Dorsey's keeping his job despite the beard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yay. Is he keeping the beard because that could go.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apparently.  The jacket's nice.  The jacket's good and the nose ring.  And look at those blue eyes.  Although don't you think those pupils are a little tiny?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's in bright light.  Oh, that's right. He's in bright light. That's of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's on the aperture.  He's like F22 at least.  Yes.  Elliott Management, which was a very activist investor and was always a concern when they joined the board,  apparently was kind of saying we've got to get rid of this guy.  But Twitter said in a filing on Monday that a board committee formed this spring  recommended that the current management structure remain in place.  I don't know if that's the right thing.  I mean, Jack's a wonderful guy.  I'm not knocking Jack.  But we've heard complaints from Twitter staff that he's not really very present.  He delegates everything.  He's got another company he's running.  And, you know, but who are you going to put in there?  Nobody knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The last what?  Six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're doing OK.  Yeah, about 20 percent.  That one again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Getting rid of him makes sense for us, him being hands off and things like that.  But I still argue that some of the best leaders out there are the ones that surround themselves  with the hell of a team to where they can delegate and just oversee things and not  necessarily always be in there writing the code or flipping the switches.  They're just sort of the right.  Yeah, you got a point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you know, Twitter used to be known as a place where executives didn't last long.  They all left.  Yeah.  Dick Costello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now they're sticking around.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And like my daughter was actually she was making you know, because she's 14 and she's  in the throes of like incredible liberalism.  And she she is talking about Jeff Bezos and man, what does he even do all day?  You know, and I was like, well, actually, you know, as the CEO of a ginormous company,  his big picture, he's the big guy, you know.  And so I think the best CEOs have an understanding of what they want to do with the company,  how the company fits in the world and how to strategically position the company.  But that's they're not like and said, they're not writing the code or flipping switches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're thinking and founders, founders would be would do well to do that and let  professional managers do the day to day operation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's the complaint about Zuckerberg is he doesn't do that.  Yeah, he's too handsome.  You can't win. Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How did Twitter handle the election?  I don't know.  I haven't been looking.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm looking at the president's last few tweets.  Official sources may not have called the race when this was tweeted.  Some are all of the content shared in this street is disputed, might be misleading about  a lecture in our other civic process.  They're very much got some flags on weighing weighing in on the president's tweets.  One, two, three.  He tweeted.  He tweeted.  What or what is this all about?  In caps and they said some are all content.  What is this all about?  Some are all of the content shared in this tweet is disputed.  Huh?  OK.  And then some of the tweets I just can't even see.  So yeah, they're very they they've definitely doubled down despite scrutiny and complaints  by Republicans.  They've doubled down on this.  But they said they do it.  This is the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They said they were going to do something and they did it.  Yeah.  They said we're going to you know if there's any false claims of victory, we are going to  stomp down in these ways.  And then they went and did it.  That's what we expect of them.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How about Facebook?  Has Facebook been?  They did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I had a Business Insider story up where there were examples I think from Facebook as well.  Yeah, they did similar things.  Their wording was different, a little more ambiguous.  Yeah.  But but yes, they did.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they said they would.  They've also both said that they would not accept political ads now after the election.  Can you imagine?  Because I guess the fear is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is interesting because yeah, they're going to be like trying to sway people in  scary ways.  Like I mean, you see the stuff that they're not showing you from Donald Trump is talking  about like making up ballots and finding things that destroying things.  So imagine that being advertised throughout Facebook and being normalized as something  that actually is happening.  Right.  That would be terrible.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you all think they both Twitter and Facebook have done a good job?  I'm not on.  I wasn't on either.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I can't say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At the end, yeah.  I'm sorry.  I was like, no, it's my job to have an opinion.  But I was like, I just couldn't bear it.  Yeah.  Yes, I just looked up the Facebook.  Go ahead, Stacey.  It's hard because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I was just going to say it's hard because you have a leader who is, you know, very good  at using these platforms to spread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to...  It's misinformation.  And it is hard to say, hey, we're not going to...  I mean, it's hard to say that your president is a liar, which is essentially what you're  having to say if you're a leader.  It's hard to say that your president is a liar, which is essentially what you're having  to say if you block this content, right?  Yeah.  So I appreciate that we should be above this, but we're not.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's really interesting to me.  Now that the election...  You know, many, not all of the votes have been counted.  The election is almost over.  That the nation is not completely evenly divided, but fairly evenly divided.  And you could see how at least half the nation would be unhappy with what Twitter and Facebook  are doing.  Yeah.  Right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that shouldn't stop them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and I think half the nation would be unhappy because for the last four years and  longer, really, half the nation has been buying something that they've bought into lies.  I don't know how else to say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But half the nation doesn't think there are lies.  It's only...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lie is a lie.  I mean, some of these...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like, it's one thing to be like, I buy into a certain narrative, but it's another thing  to say, I believe something that is patently untrue.  And a lot of people do believe something that is patently untrue.  And I'm not saying that's what swayed their votes or anything, but...  I'm just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess my question is, the country did not repudiate President Trump.  There wasn't a mass like blue wave and like, oh, we repudiate this guy.  It basically showed a very much stronger, you know, a lot of support.  Not quite enough, perhaps, to win the election.  We don't know yet.  But a lot of support.  So, does that affect things?  I mean, as somebody who thinks he's a liar is only...  You know, it's not universally agreed.  But he is a liar.  Okay.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  You have to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, facts are facts.  You can't...  Despite Kellyanne Conway's assertion that there are alternate facts, you cannot...  Facts are facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but no, in an age of epistemological war, if I don't like you, I don't like your facts.  Right.  I wrote a post right before the election about...  Which I reread parts of Hannah Arendt's The Origins of Totalitarianism,  because I'm that kind of fun guy who reads this stuff in my spare time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is an amazing book, though.  That's the book everybody should read, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it was very illuminating.  I'm not trying to call Hitler and Stalin models for Trump.  I'm just trying to say that there's a totalitarian, authoritarian mood here.  And what made me realize, and I wrote this post, and I said that I don't believe the people who espouse,  pick it, QAnon or lies, believe it.  I believe they want us to believe they believe it.  That it's, at first level, it's performative.  I'm going to own you. I'm going to piss you off, you liberals, you media, you elites.  But at another level, it's not about facts.  It's not about beliefs either. It's about emotions.  And so it could be true is good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Someone controlling your emotions.  I mean, that's one of the biggest ways to disrespect people is just to own their emotions  and be able to manipulate them and pull their strings.  And you don't really have a care in the world for them.  You just want to pull their strings and poke the bear kind of thing and just just to watch them react.  There's there's some people to get off on that.  And if this is the case with the likes of QAnon, that's pretty strong.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, you're right, Ant. And it's not just QAnon.  It's also political leaders and it's certain parts of media.  And what our Ant talks about is that the roots of totalitarianism are loneliness.  The people are lonely, that they are not associated, that they're that they're alienated.  Now, one could go too far with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I feel like it's I feel like it's different.  It's not lonely. This is a tribalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She says it's the opposite.  That actually it's because you don't belong to groups that you don't have an identity.  Well, you don't have an individuality.  That does not apply.  And this thing comes along to fill in the void.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That does not apply to the current situation in the U.S.  then, because that's not there's that's patently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can believe that there's lots of people who feel maybe loneliness is their sense of purpose has been eroded.  Yes, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Perhaps I would say maybe more that they feel let down by the people in power by government.  But I think they don't feel alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've all been let down by the people in power.  Yeah, they feel alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, like, I feel they don't feel a part of the elites.  They don't like the elites.  But I think that they know that there's a large movement.  How do you feel alone when this is your own in the crowd?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What they argue is there's a lot of sociology about this.  You're alone in the crowd.  Yes, you seem to be in a crowd, but you're in fact incredibly lonely because you're not.  And how many people do we know who we're going to give up friends and relatives, but not Trump?  Right. So the associations that you would think matter in their lives, they were ready to throw away.  That's what she argues.  Stacey, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to cut you off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no.  I was listening to Jeff and I was like, yeah.  And I also think, yeah, you can be lonely for like when everybody around you seems to believe something that just makes sense to you.  So like as a Democrat in Texas, you know, I thought that's a lonely.  Yeah, now I feel less lonely.  But if you're the nation, if you read the papers and you look at the way like that, I mean, think about watching our show.  We have a clear perspective where we talk about like this is clearly wrong.  We clearly espouse this.  If you don't believe that, you're like, man, I've listened to Leo and Jeff like half my life.  And a lot of people are mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're not.  Yeah.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that makes you lonely.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or hate Leo and Jeff more like at least.  Yeah, but you also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But for a while, they probably felt a kinship with you.  And suddenly that's I mean, it's confusing when like, I mean, we've all had those moments when like a friend says something and you're like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How did I know you for this long?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is an upsetting time for everybody.  I would agree with that.  Whatever, whatever tribe you belong to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  True colors have come out in 2019, 2020.  I can say that for sure.  And my side too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's why I'm a fan of Baby Shark.  Seems like the one true thing in this world.  Leo, the way you quit YouTube now, please.  I had never heard the song when we saw it in Dubai.  I said this is a catchy, catchy little number.  And Lisa said, you'd never heard that before.  I said, no, she says on YouTube.  And I watched it a billion times.  Just like a three year old.  Hey, what do you think of DX?  Yeah.  And not particularly bright three year old.  Actually, what do you think of DXO, Mark?  And and and they gave the Pixel 5 camera a 120 point score out of 100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you and I may have discussed this in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It might be a leading question.  What is DXO, Mark?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At one point in time, I thought pretty highly of DXO, Mark.  But it seems like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacey wants to know what DXO, Mark is.  And what are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're part of an organization that does a lot of camera review  as far as looking at the specs and checks and balances of whatever camera that comes out,  whether it's on a phone or just an actual camera body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They also sell software, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then they have a processing software as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They probably make money testing for companies.  Usually companies like this, you know, they they have a testing facility  and they probably test for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Say that loosely, though, at least from the way things look.  I'm going to say it loosely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is not the highest rated camera out.  The Huawei Mate 40 Pro is 136 points.  Weirdly, though, the Samsung Galaxy Note Ultra is only 89 points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Samsung didn't write the check.  Do you think?  I'm going to say it. Samsung didn't write the check.  It just seems like a lot of times with DXO, things are coming off as if they've  are on the take. I'll just say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The top four of their smartphone cameras are all Chinese companies.  Huawei's Mate 40, Xiaomi Mi 10 Ultra, Huawei P40 Pro.  Either way, the Huawei cameras are really good.  I will say that.  I haven't used one since the P20, but Xiaomi's Mi 10 Pro and the Vivo X50 Pro Plus.  Those are the top five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So I just can't put a lot of stock into them.  Yeah.  I've seen some things in the past where they'll headline things as this is the best  camera ever kind of thing, the same way Apple does with this is our best iPhone ever.  Every new phone, yeah, we get it.  It's your latest phone, so it better be your best.  But it just never seemed like there was some true meat to their testing, if you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you played with the Pixel 5 yet or are you going to get one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, sir. Mr. Howe has it.  Maybe he'd like to.  I haven't been interested in it though because quite frankly, I think the 4A is still just fine.  Even with this camera, it's still using the old tech.  It's the same camera.  It's the same camera.  I think it's the same.  It's going to work.  I think it's the same sensor.  Yeah, wait a minute, the 5, it is the same.  Yeah.  So no, no need for me to go to the 5.  What are you carrying now, Ian?  I like this 4A.  You're carrying the 4A.  Even though it's a little bit smaller.  I like this thing, but there's no need to really go up from that.  Computational photography is crushing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is really amazing.  Do any of the camera makers, Nikon or Canon or Sony, any of them putting that kind of computational power into a camera, a DSLR?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've not seen such.  I wonder why not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're just, they're relying on optics instead of software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would say you have lenses out there that's going to really help make things even better right out the gate because you've got better glass.  And then they're looking at flange placement, flange size and how that affects the image quality as well.  So, I mean, they got a lot of other things in place to not necessarily worry about AI stepping in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You just reviewed the new Panasonic Lumix, right, on Hands-on Technology.  S5.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think of that?  I think it's slightly overpriced, but it's a pretty good camera.  I think it is going to be really nice for someone that's just wanting to do portraits from a videographer standpoint.  It could use a little bit of help, but it's still quite capable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder what would happen if a company like Panasonic or Sony, I think they'd be the two most likely candidates,  started to put processors and power and software in there to add the computational capability to their already superb optics.  Wouldn't that be good?  Or you don't think they just know there'd be no advantage?  I just wonder how that would affect the cost though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are the consumers going to pay for?  Right now they're paying for a $5,000 camera that has overheating problems and things like that.  That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you paid $5,000 for a body, if for $6,000 you'd get a body with all the computational abilities as well, I would think that'd be interesting.  For some.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, our photographer is extra, and I'm old, and I started, like I did a photojournalism minor.  I didn't know that.  On a film camera, because it was kind of in the middle of the transition basically.  But at the time, and even after that, there was still a lot of snobbery in the traditional photojournalism world.  So I wonder if the people with the money to buy these things who are older are kind of like pooping computational photography because it doesn't take talent and skill,  which was the big thing, you know, the big thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I've seen a lot of that years ago.  I don't see that as much now.  The snobbery of photography, I think, is actually going down just a little bit, a little bit.  There's still some out there, but I think nowadays people are starting to really open their eyes and saying, hey, why not just make this art available for everybody?  You know, let everybody get involved and try to expand on this art and have fun with it and stop poo-pooing them because they're shooting with a phone and the computational photography and that phone.  Just, hey, they just created some great art.  So yeah, personally, I'm seeing less of the snobbery in comparison to what I used to see years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of course, one of the things, and certainly when you studied photojournalism all those years ago, this was probably a big issue, was post-processing.  Yeah.  Right? So that was very snob, I think that snobbery still persists where people say, well, you ran it through Photoshop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's still there, but again, I think it's going down some because if you crop your image, that's processed, that's post-processed.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you could do things with chemicals in a dark room that are equally...  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  ...dodging and turning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Certainly photojournalists, that's one thing because you're, you know, there's a requirement of...  There are some standards with it.  ...various similitude.  You don't want to modify the captured image, but that doesn't mean...  There's a lot of photographers, you know, our friend Trey Ratcliffe, I mean, he uses a lot of software.  His whole career is based on post-processing basically.  Yep. It's beautiful.  And it's beautiful. I mean, you know, if it's not photojournalism, if you're not recording a factual event, I see no problem with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the difference.  Yeah.  And I think a lot of those, I'll say it this way, old school photographers finally accepted that, you know, these people are just, again, they're just creating art.  Yeah.  You know, so let them create art. Who am I to tell them that they should use a finer paint, finer tooth paintbrush versus that wide paintbrush?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it's art.  Nevertheless, I think going back to the original story, the Pixel 5 is, and your 4a too, produces damn fine results with somewhat antiquated, less than good hardware by doing really spectacular computational stuff.  And that's really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Queen Pruitt was playing with the 4a and she yelled because she didn't like the camera.  Now, those were her words.  I don't like the camera on this thing.  And I had to tell her, I said, look, I don't care what phone you pick up.  You're going to have some challenges if you try to take a photo of yourself doing a selfie here in our living room that's not brightly lit.  It's going to have some noise and it's going to have some grain.  You know, you just got to understand what you're working with from a physics standpoint and then let the computational side just hop in and do the rest of the heavy lifting.  Right.  And I said, here, let me take a picture.  Boom. It looks way better.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I bet she loves when you do that.  Let me take a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't know what you're doing, lady.  Give me the camera.  I'll show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You like living dangerously, don't you?  Yeah, I have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to challenge myself every now and then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Walk on the wild side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just so can I can I can I sorry, can I interrupt with a little bit of Jeff computer advice since we're on hardware for a second?  Absolutely.  So, you know, I've been complaining my Chromebook is going to die.  And so I went into the Best Buy and risk germs to look at the machines that are there.  I looked at the go and I looked at the little Kevin Toffle at the Asus 713 keyboard on that one.  Didn't like it.  Just didn't like it.  So I'm ready to say, OK, it's a go.  And then sit next to the go is the first one I touched one Samsung Galaxy Chromebook.  I think they make excellent Chromebooks.  Well, you know, the problem with it is what the battery.  Oh, that the word on it was its promises eight or nine hours and some reviewers got four.  Some got maybe got more.  But they're saying that the screen is bright.  The screen is is huge.  So this is that.  Do you think there's any hope that it'll then supposedly Google's going to help the next version of Chrome with something?  So it's been a while.  So how much longer do you think it's going to take?  So how much battery life do you need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's a really nice.  And what if you dim the screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that should help you quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's bright red.  Come on, man.  I know.  I love the color.  I have been someplace that let you return it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ask Kevin an email.  He's not watching today because he stayed up late watching the election.  But send him an email and be like, you know, would you buy this?  Or maybe he's already bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I don't think you're foolish at all.  I think these are really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although if I were you, if I were you, man, I'd wait till Tuesday when Apple announces its new MacBooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, if battery life is what you want, you're going to have sooner going to get the Raspberry Pi keyboard.  Is that not awesome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's sold out everywhere.  But yes, I was like, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is a seventy dollar keyboard that is selling it for a hundred.  Well, there's a hundred dollar kit you can get with all the cabling and stuff.  Oh, OK.  So if you have the cables, you don't need them.  And any geek will have the cables.  But this is yeah, this is so awesome.  So cool.  It is a Raspberry Pi and it's the high end Raspberry Pi for inside a keyboard.  Seventy bucks.  All you have to do is take the HDMI out, put it on your TV, power it, maybe if you want to add a mouse and you've got a computer, a really good computer.  Now, a little caveat for people who maybe are thinking I'll get this for the kids.  They could do their classes.  Zoom and a camera, you can get them working, but it's going to be a little challenge.  It's not just as simple as plugging in a USB camera on this.  So if you're a geek, you could figure it out.  But it would work.  Yeah.  Raspberry Pi has a camera module for it and you could plug it in.  I bet it would work.  I can't get to.  Pseudo app get install.  Yeah, it's Linux.  But Zoom works on Linux.  There's a web based version of Zoom.  I just I just reminded me of Sinclair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The old days.  It is.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't understand why audio is coming out of my computer.  I was like, what is playing music?  I completely lost control of so much.  Baby shark in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, it will never stop playing baby shark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's computers haunted coming out of my phone.  I don't know why I started playing Eminem criminal.  Did somebody say something about criminal and Eminem?  I don't know.  I thought it sounded like Eminem.  That was very strange.  So random, very random.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm watching YouTube last night.  Like I said, I want you to just as much as I watched regular television and Queen Peru.  Queen Peru was on the couch with me and I saw this this pie announcement pop up and turn it on.  And I'm like, wow, that is so cool.  And I said, that's the same Raspberry Pi that we have upstairs.  The floor.  The what?  I said the desk computer.  The what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, so are you are your boys using Raspberry Pis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I just it's nobody touches it.  But me, it's in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got to keep a pie around the house in case you need to load some software and keep it as a web server.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just have a pie.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a pie sitting on my desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just a guest browser for us for the most part.  But it's there.  You know, I'm explaining that, hey, it's that computer that we have upstairs, but it's all in the keyboard.  And the face just went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  And why are you pointing this out to me?  Why would I care?  Why do I care?  This is my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I sit there and I get really excited about something and I'm like, oh, my God, the FCC is going to release this spectrum.  And my husband is like, no, and he's a geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the funny thing.  He's not like he is not a geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, he's not.  He's sort of a geek.  He's not that kind of geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does he do the same thing about new top level domains?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, God, no.  He's like, no one wants to hear about that state.  He knows better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  They just released the dot app.  Dot app TLD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm so excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  About 70 bucks.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know I got excited about this and I was trying to explain it to him and he's like, do we need one of these?  And I was like, oh, no, no, but they're cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, wow.  It's an impulse price point.  That's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you remember the one laptop per child?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have one in the other room.  Media lab.  That was one hundred dollars.  It was one hundred dollars.  It was kind of interesting, but you could do absolutely everything you would do with that.  And it's ten times more powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Although, did one laptop per child that had a screen, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, it came with everything.  It even came with wireless mesh networking.  It was a very interesting.  And it ran on a programming language called Scratch, which is basically small talk.  So it was a very interesting, very, very interesting idea that did not take off.  I have one because there was a buy one, buy two, give one to Africa or somewhere.  And nice.  It's a really interesting.  It's historic.  But this pie has absolutely changed the world in ways that that was what OLPC was going to do.  This pie is amazing.  And it's funny that you should say it reminds you of the Commodores and stuff, because really that was the inspiration of the BBC Micro.  This is like the Sinclair, these inexpensive computers that a whole generation in England grew up on.  And even Upton and the Raspberry Pi people wanted I interviewed him on triangulation.  It's an old triangulation if you want to watch the story.  But they wanted to create a computer that would empower the next generation of young people to learn computing.  It's really awesome.  I was running my Minecraft servers on that for a long time.  It's very, very powerful, very successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do wonder how many Raspberry Pis are running Minecraft still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, the distro that you can get with one of the distros, I think it's Raspbian, but one of the distros you can get with it, maybe it's a Windows distro, has a unique version of Minecraft that is Python scriptable.  So it's a really good tool for teaching young people into Minecraft how to program, because all you have to say is, okay, now you're playing Minecraft, but did you know you could write a script that would just build a house with one push of the mouse?  And then Kano did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that was the inside of the Kano computer for kids, because I got one of those for my to try to get her into programming via the sneaky Minecraft way.  Yeah, but it was an attempt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It didn't work on my hardheads either.  Not everybody should be programming, for sure.  But what you're doing is you're giving them the option that you're introducing it to them.  And if it doesn't fit their needs, it doesn't fit their needs.  That's fine.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The closest that I got to that is Hardhead, the senior Hardhead.  He's actually interested in mobile phones more and more over the last couple of years.  Like he really tends to look up to Mr. Howell, not just because he's six foot nine.  But he tends to look up to him because of his information about all of the Android devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the Raspbian version with Minecraft and it has a plug-in that comes with it that allows you to you can't actually do that.  You know, you can't do it on Windows.  The Minecraft Pi Edition.  It's really, really cool.  One of the things you should do, you can programmatically build a bridge with dynamite.  And then as you walk over it, it blows up behind you all the way.  It's fantastic. Kids love it.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's really cool.  I actually got that from a book.  Blow up.  That's all about learning Python using the Raspberry Pi.  It's really one of the best Python books out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So.  A little update if you want it.  Biden pulled within 270,000 votes of Trump in Pennsylvania with more than 800,000 votes yet to be counted.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah, this is, is this it?  No, this isn't it.  I have it somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Raspberry Pi.  Every time I say Raspberry Pi, people respond to me with Pi-hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that is the most common.  The most common use for Raspberry Pi is a Pi-hole, which is basically a router that blocks advertising and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think that's really the most common use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, among our audience.  A lot of my audience runs like a home bridge or open half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I think I think most I feel like there's a lot of Raspberry Pi based Minecraft servers out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, mine ran for a long time and then I thought I need more power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not like I need this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm always like, dang it, I don't want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have pies all over the place.  There's a pie set in front of me.  That's a music streamer.  The PDP 11 in my office is actually a Pi DP 11.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I have just one on my desk.  Just as you said, Stacey, just waiting around for something.  You know, if I ever need a project, it's going to need it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's so cool.  And why is Pi owned by a foundation started by a profit just open source period?  Anybody can make them inside is a Broadcom chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Broadcom developed the chip with even even even even.  Yeah.  I've interviewed him like five times and I still can't get his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's so cool.  He's just so nice.  There's a guy who's made a huge difference.  Just step after step.  Just, you know, I'm going to make this thing and it's just it's wonderful.  Yeah.  The Raspberry Pi Foundation at Raspberry Pi dot org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they have a lot of resources for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little bit different than Arduino because they had like a split.  Arduino was, you know, they have a different computing board, less less powerful, not a full computer, much more for embedded kind of stuff.  But Massimo developed that he ended up splitting with was it the foundation or the company that makes the Arduino boards?  And now there's like two versions of Arduino.  Interesting.  It's kind of sad.  That's a sad story.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Maybe that just is one more reason to love even in the Raspberry Pi Foundation because they've they've kept their original vision pure and and they just continue to put out great things.  Hey, how would you like to play some trumpets, John?  Because I think it'd be a good time to do the Google change.  No, play the baby shark.  Google.  That's our new theme.  Wouldn't that be a good theme?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm kind of joining you now, Leo.  I'm going to get on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google has announced if you have Google one, do you know what Google one is?  Yeah, you do.  Everybody listening this show should know what Google one is, right?  It is basically it's what the Google the old Google Drive used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because Google has to rename it.  It doesn't kill.  It has to be named.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I was like, I don't know what Google one is.  And I'm on the show.  Oh, no.  But then when you said it, I'm like, oh, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they renamed it.  They are now they are going to introduce as part of your bundle of features a VPN by Google one.  Which does raise some interesting questions because, of course, people often use VPNs to protect themselves against Google.  Yeah, but but Google says, no, we're going to protect we're going to protect your privacy.  We're going to protect your security.  And actually, I trust them.  I think that's probably probably the case that probably do a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So should we presume they won't be won't be logging anything on this?  They say no logging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They also say we are going to we are open sourcing the client.  Now we will open source the server down the road so you can verify that, in fact, it's private.  And I think it will be US only through the Google one app for Android.  More regions coming soon.  IOS, Windows and Mac also coming soon.  So it's not a complete solution yet.  Google one is two terabytes of storage for ten bucks a month or a hundred bucks a year.  I pay for it.  That's a good deal for storage.  Yeah, I do too.  You get family support.  There's you get premium support on Google stuff.  You get 10 percent on the Google Store and soon.  You do?  Yeah, apparently says so.  Oh, I know that either.  And it does say right here in the little fine print right at the bottom.  Some minimum logging is performed to ensure quality of service, but your network traffic is never logged and your IP is not associated to your traffic.  So I trust them.  No, I you know what?  Google is not going to lie in their privacy statement.  There's too much at risk for that.  And honestly, they don't need that information.  They know everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not where they're getting their privacy.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Privacy.  Good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Letting you lock the door after they put cameras all inside your house.  You can't come in, but you're already there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does the new California law have any impact on this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Proposition 24 stuff?  Yeah.  It will let you correct data that's incorrect about you, which I don't think the original CCPA did.  It also is a little bit more fine grained on the data it will collect.  So it lets you keep personal data safe.  It will be Google will be affected because it only affects companies that have data on 100,000 households or less or sorry or more.  So Google definitely will be impacted by it.  I think the most interesting thing it does is set up a bureau to handle privacy complaints.  And that's where I would expect for a lot of this stuff to be negotiated.  I know that doesn't exactly answer your question, Jeff.  So I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's OK, because now I'm growling anyway.  Guess what?  Guess what?  You're currently signed into your G Suite account.  Switch to your personal Google account to upgrade.  If you want more storage for your G Suite account, visit Google Drive and F you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and that is kind of complicated because there will be people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it Drive or Workplace?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's now Workplace.  It was G Suite.  It's Drive hasn't changed, but it was G Suite.  Well, Drive didn't change.  G Suite.  And that's not a workplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They have it updated everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there's actually an article now that you mentioned it on ZDNet.  What happens to your G Suite unlimited storage when Google moves you to workspace?  I want to go into all the nitty gritty details, but you can read this article if you are in that situation.  We use a G Suite business plan.  We have the $12 per user per month and we get two terabytes of storage per user.  That's not my phone.  Sorry, that was mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who is trying to reach y'all?  Who would be calling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who would be calling?  Spam.  It's all not as popular.  What was the most annoying election text messages?  Who was the who bugged you the most?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Harrison.  Jamie Harrison.  I don't even know why they had my information.  He lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's a good guy.  He's a good guy and I wanted him to win, but he lost.  I gave him money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I knew he was going to bug me.  He sent me 12 messages in a four hour period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So mine was Mark Kelly from Arizona running.  The astronaut.  I would have loved getting a message from him.  Yeah, but boy, you know, they acted like it's funny how some campaigns are just very aggressive in fundraising.  For a while, I had somebody else's SIM.  I got a SIM that hadn't been cured properly and hadn't been left to dry.  So I had and this guy was apparently had donated to the Trump campaign.  I have never seen more aggressive messages.  I thought, you know, hey, right now we need three dollars.  We'll double it.  Things like that.  Mark Kelly beat him.  Mark Kelly was worse.  It was he won, by the way.  Jamie did not.  Who was did you get?  Who was your worst?  Because I bet you because I bet you donate to a lot of causes, Jeff.  You got a lot of text messages.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got tons.  But also somebody somebody signed me up for Trump, too.  So I was getting I was always in that area.  All those.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, isn't that sweet?  I don't doubt.  Yes.  Thank you.  So there's there.  Give us and take us away.  And sorry, it was me, Jeff.

Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Did you see on the Pixel 5 that you could charge from your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Reverse charging reverse charging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought that was kind of neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Samsung invented that Apple's doing supposedly has that capability, but they haven't turned  it on.  And yeah, I like that.  Although, you know, I had it on my Samsung.  And when Samsung announced it, they said, look, you know, you're on a train with somebody.  They could say, hey, can I borrow some power?  My headphones have died.  I'm not giving you my phone.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so I know that you might feel that way.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But like as a journalist covering things like when like Kevin and I are sitting, sometimes  life happens and you know you're going to have the ability to charge later.  And you're like, we got to get this.  Oh, I'm so sorry.  And then you you share a power with the person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is it about this show that makes people want to talk like they do in regular life?  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are we all comfortable with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The scooter.  It's time now for the scooter exchange log because he always during change log, he comes  up with like 20 more things.  I'll just give you the headlines.  Google Assistant speakers and smart displays will not be able to make phone calls in the  UK soon.  Google Voice now supports contact cards and text messages.  Who knows how long Google Voice messaging is going to be around.  But OK, Android Auto tweaks its Google Assistant UI again.  Maybe you've seen the new UI, but they're changing that Google Messages begins testing  scheduled sending options.  OK, the key that you like this one, Jeff, the key that replaces caps lock on your Chromebook  is now called the everything button.  Well, it used to be the owner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's not the one that mean it just has the everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just a dot, right?  It's like a dot, but it doesn't do caps lock.  Well, you can make it do caps lock.  You could.  The new branding for the program.  It's a multipurpose button is what it is.  That's why they call it everything button.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, no, it has to do something.  What is it?  By default?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it was the no.  I think by default it was the search.  It was a search.  It was the search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The thing that really irritates me is that is the gosh darned there for you, John,  assistant button.  Yes, I never use the system.  No, give me give me an accident all the time.  I know.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't want an assistant button.  You're welcome to use this logo from now on.  Everything.  How many committee meetings?  Yeah, a lot.  Will occur for this name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's start the everything button.  How ridiculous.  You know what?  Hey, Google, Google.  I've been saying this many times.  You know what I want?  I want multiple save gets across the keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Multiple save gets.  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've talked about the show before where I'm on a site and I want to save three quotes  and a URL and then put them into the rundown rather than having to cut and paste.  OK, yeah, cut and paste.  We used to call it in the old the old newspaper CMS.  We call them save get keys.  And so I can say here's this paragraph is saved one.  This paragraph is saved to this URL.  Save three.  Say get one, two, three.  Yeah, it's wonderful.  Is that essentially a clipboard manager?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yes, it is.  We talked about this once before and I got somebody told me a program to use and I love it.  So thank you.  Hey, Nest thermostats can now anticipate problems with your HVAC system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you mean problems?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like if you're usually before your HVAC system breaks, it experiences a period of maybe straining extra hard to keep your house cool.  Or, you know, it experiences some sort of problem that can be determined.  Like your thermostat can actually say, hey, we've got the temperature set to 68 and your HVAC has been running for eight hours.  Normally it only runs for two hours.  And then it's like, I think there might be a problem.  Let's alert the owner of the house.  And it does.  And that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's good stuff.  Does it sound like this when it does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you been doing some more work?  A few sketches.  May I see them?  Sure.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's that, are you ID?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is Hal Knight.  That's a very nice rendering, Dave.  Thank you, Dave.  I think you've improved a great deal.  Uh oh.  Uh oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you hold it a bit closer?  Sure.  The HVAC system is about to go out.  Uh oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?  Mm hmm.  Yes.  By the way, do you mind if I ask you a personal question?  No, no, no.  Well, forgive me for being so inquisitive.  But why?  But during the past few weeks, I've wondered whether you might be having some second thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Never mind, never mind, never mind.  There was a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was like, where are we going with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because eventually he's going to say, oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.  The unit is about to fail.  And I thought it'd be nice if my Nest thermostat would sound like that.  But it's a very long clip.  I don't think that would be nice at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it would be kind of creepy if my Nest thermostat sounded like, nope, out of the wall.  Yeah, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hello, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I see the HVAC unit is about to fail.  Would you like to put on your space suit and fix it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I promise I'll let you back in.  Google Play Music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gone too soon.  It's dead now.  It's dead, Jim.  Born in 2011, shut down last week.  Wired says, shall live forever in our hearts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You want to know what I'm listening to in my new YouTube music?  What?  Joni Mitchell Black Set.  Oh, a new one?  Early Joni Mitchell.  It is ethereal and beautiful.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She had an amazing voice.  Didn't she tune her hammer dulcimer to an octave higher?  She had some odd tuning she used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For every song, she retunes.  Wow.  Amazing.  It's lovely.  I'm going to walk in with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it the songs we all know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it starts off very folky because this is her very young.  Her voice is really high and almost childlike at the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She had open tuning for every song.  It was a different tuning.  It seems problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess she didn't want anybody to cover her songs.  That's an artist.  You love Joni Mitchell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's still around.  She deserves some money.  You're going to give her a tenth of a cent every time you play a song?  Are you going to buy the box set?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The problem is I play it on what?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You buy it and then you can stream it freely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mike Schmidt, because I now do my Rape by Skype Room stuff.  Mike Schmidt, NYT.  He had two shells behind him with the neatest ridiculousness.  I tweeted it.  It was nothing but a long run of CDs or AOL discs.  Amazing.  You don't see those anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They probably don't work anymore.  CDs are not the most long lived option out there.  Poor Joni Mitchell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She opens her vaults and Jeff just streams it.  Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What would I play it with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was debating.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My dad just went nuts and bought a record player and a new receiver and other things.  He just went crazy.  You could pull a Don Higgins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you and your mom say why?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think my mom is totally just like, yes, when the man needs a hobby, he gets a hobby.  His current hobby is this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He might be interested in the 180 gram vinyl version of early Joni 1963 featuring the nine song CFQC AM performance in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in 1963.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to say my dad is not a Joni Mitchell fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My mom is and I remember him saying bad things about her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She thinks so high it hurts my ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, he's more of a CCR.  Eric clapped in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't care.  You still just appreciate Joni.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it has 119 cuts.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you're just streaming it on YouTube music.  Yeah, I don't want to.  I feel guilty.  I really do.  I don't.  I pay for Google Music.  I know what you do.  They paved paradise and started streaming my box set.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Y'all.  Y'all.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just got excited.  This has nothing to do with tech.  You just ignore me.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am too late now.  You can't do that and not tell us what you're all excited about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was updating the New York Times to check in on the election as one does.  And they had a food article up there.  I know I'm going back to the election.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was the election.  It was the food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the election is the same way it's been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you get Julia Child's tuna salad recipe?  Is that what you got?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is so brilliant.  I can't believe I didn't think about it.  It's so easy.  Rice Krispie treats with chocolate and pretzels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Lord.  That'll kill you.  Y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's brilliant.  You get the salt and the sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nailed it.  You need some peanut butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't even believe I've never thought of this.  It'd be so easy.  Nailed it.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you crush the pretzel with the rice krispies and mix it all in together?  Is that the idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so.  I didn't read the recipe because I got so excited.  And I'm supposed to be paying attention to y'all.  So I stopped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just got so sidetracked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm so sorry.  No, I don't blame you.  I never ever do that.  I always pay 100% attention to what is happening on this podcast.  So who's winning right now?  I don't tweet.  I don't look anything up.  So what's the current?  I just give my full attention to Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's up four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's still basically the same.  I don't write letters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't press two letters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I don't.  Last week they had a good article about Julia Child's favorite lunch, which was tuna fish.  Saw that, yes.  With a tomato, onion.  But they threw me.  They said, it's got to be Hellman's mayonnaise.  Well, we have that, but it's called best foods out here.  But we have that.  It's got to be Hellman's mayonnaise.  And it has to be Bay's English muffins.  And I said, Bay's?  What's Bay's?  What's Bay's English muffins?  I've been eating Thomas's English muffins my whole life.  Me too.  Well, so I went on Amazon and I ordered.  I got a case of Bay's English muffins.  A case?  I didn't know how many it was getting.  I got 300 English muffins in my freezer.  They're good though.  Are they better than Thomas's?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I used to have them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got to figure out a way to get into your ad feeds on Instagram and whatever, wherever  else you're watching ads, because they are hooking you.  This wasn't an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This was a New York Times article about Julia Child.  And it mentioned specifically that she would only accept Bay's English muffins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Would she make a sandwich of it?  Nope.  Open face.  Open face, okay.  But she'd have two because there's English muffins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It has two sides.  You open up.  And capers, lemon juice, Hellman's mayonnaise, red onion, and a slice of red onion on top.  Now I'm really getting hungry.  Yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was really hoping that Google didn't put those virtual backgrounds into the...  Oh, they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Aren't you glad that they did?  Google Meet will now let you use...  Thank you, Ant.  Good.  Good bringing us back, Ant.  Real good.  You are so good.  Google Meet will now let you use custom...  I still haven't had Popeyes though.  Sandwich.  Get the sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Get the sandwich.  I'm telling you, get the sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought I was going to leave the show last time, last week, and just go straight to Popeyes,  but then I thought better of it.  Google Meet will now let you use custom backgrounds on video cards.  It's not yet available on video calls.  It's not yet available for mobile users.  But yeah, I hate those custom backgrounds.  I hate the blur background.  I'm not a fan of them.  Because they don't do a good key, let's face it.  I mentioned I was watching former CDC director.  He had a key background.  Because I guess he didn't...  It looked like his office was a bookshelf.  He didn't want you to know he was in his kitchen.  But every time he moved his head, you could see his kitchen through the hole.  Every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like, stop it.  And don't get me wrong.  I give the developers credit for pulling that off on pretty much any type of device or whatever.  But it's not necessary, people.  Just go to a site.  I don't know.  Do what Ant does.  Move your room.  Yeah, move your room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do what Ant does.  Go down.  Go to Michael's Art Supplies.  Ten dollars.  Get a ten dollar background paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, if you have to take a call, you're like, oh crap, I forgot this meeting.  And you've got to take it.  Having a virtual background can be kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you have a beautiful office.  But I'm not sitting in it nonstop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  And sometimes, like sometimes I'll be out walking the dog and I'll suddenly be like, it's Zoom o'clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But are we to the point now, considering this is November 2020, where it's, I guess it's expected that people's meetings aren't going to always be in an ideal or perfect location because life has changed pretty dramatically.  I don't think.  For everybody.  So are we poo pooing on people because they not in a beautiful office or studio or something like that?  It's OK to be at your dinner table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what if your sink is full of dirty dishes?  Yeah.  And you don't want to admit that.  That's a lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or what if your bed's not made?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  We'll have an example.  My mom.  What if there are families behind them and the family doesn't really want to be on.  Right.  And they don't really want to show their family.  And I have one colleague whose husband walked by in underwear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I do that all the time to at least his calls.  That's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not going to get a sponsorship revenue.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  On your way to the hot tub.  Well, first the neighbor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Her desk is right in the middle of the living room.  It's like I'd actually have to like go outside and around to avoid being on the Zoom call.  What did you say?  Your mom.  Sacy.  Whose mom?  You said my mom.  Maybe that was just a parent thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was just like a Freudian slip.  My mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My mom.  My mom.  My mom.  My mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Voice typing is about to get a lot better if you use Google's Gboard keyboard, which everybody  on Pixels probably does.  Maybe people who are using Samsung and other devices download it and use it.  It's a pretty good keyboard.  Google owners are starting to see Gboards with new enhanced voice typing experience,  automatic punctuation.  Not everybody will have this.  You can access it by typing the microphone icon on the Gboard.  The transcription you'll notice is noticeably faster.  And the voice typing function now lets you say things like clear.  This is a big improvement.  To delete whatever you just typed.  Like clear.  Clear back to when?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How far back does it make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The whole thing.  Start over.  But remember when we had like Dragon NaturallySpeaking and the other dictation tools, they had all  sorts of editing commands.  I mean they needed them, but it was really a lot easier than, oh now I've got to do this.  Auto punctuation intelligently predicts where the period, comma, or question mark will go  while you're dictating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That will be amazing because I'm terrible at commas.  My editors hate me.  You don't have to say comma anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now here's a question.  You used too many or too few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The accusation has been leveled that I randomly sprinkle commas throughout my copy for fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's what my English teacher used to call comma blunder.  Yeah.  You're a comma blunderer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I blunder my way through the English language when I write.  But that's my thing.  And I try, even when I try, I do it wrong.  So I've stopped trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually really enjoy the precise use of punctuation when I write.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So do I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The choice of semicolons versus colons.  Yes.  I call it the wonderful thing.  Oh, I love a semicolon.  And you really, I'm sorry.  I overuse dashes.  I love the M dash, but Strunk and White said it's strong.  Use the M dash.  And but then I've been told since then, oh, you shouldn't follow Strunk and White.  That's no longer considered good usage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just don't use an exclamation point as a crutch.  Oh, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lots.  But only in texting and emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I knew someone who said she dated a guy from Yale.  Did I say this before?  Who said to her that his rule was in life you can use three exclamation marks.  In life?  They'd already used one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What a horribly unfun person.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've already used one exclamation mark and I'd like to save one for next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I get very excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, y'all are going to love this.  I can't wait till we get to our thing.  It's going to be so much fun.  Good.  That's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that a hint, Stacey?  Is that a hint?  That's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm just really excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Before you get to the thing, I've got one question for you.  Yes.  The story about Google and a standard for mobile driver's licenses.  Oh.  Did you see this one?  No.  It's one of those things where you guys are so good at thinking through all this security stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you'd have your driver's license on your phone instead of in your pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then it has a whole system for verification.  So it's not that long.  Just read down.  You'll see.  And I'm curious if you think this passes the smell test.  I'm sure it does, but I just I couldn't figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's an ISO standard.  Yes.  ISO 18 0 1 3 dash 5.  It's been written by a diverse group of people representing drivers license issuers like the state governments in the US relying partners.  Parties like federal state government, including law enforcement, academia, industry, including Google and many others.  It allows for the construction of an MDL mobile driving license application you can carry on your phone.  I'm all for it.  Instead of handing over your plastic card, you open the application on your phone, press a button to share your MDL.  The verifier has their own device with the O.C.  The officer has to carry a special device with an MDL reader and they scan the QR code or do an NFC tap.  The now it's the transfer is is well done.  There's a crypto ephemeral cryptographic public key.  It's kind of like an Apple Pay transfer and a hardware address the MDL reader can connect to.  Once it obtains the crypto key, it creates its own ephemeral key pair establishes an encrypted and authenticated Bluetooth le wifi aware or NFC channel to request the data such as portrait image or what kinds of vehicles you're allowed to drive.  Also can be used to ask more abstract questions such as is the holder older than 18.  So presumably as you go into a bar, they'd have a reader.  You just hold it out.  Oh, and 18.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no more fake IDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No more fake IDs.  Unless you carry your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, actually, you just carry your friend's phone.  But no one would let their phone out of their hands for that long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does make the phone.  This is the problem somewhat makes the phone more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it says like a bartender who wants to check your ID.  Yeah, they only need to get one piece of information.  So that means they wouldn't see where your address is, which is actually really useful for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bouncers hit on me all the time.  I always find them at my door.  No, that's probably true.  Not for me, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I was like, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bouncers love me.  That's really interesting.  I thought it was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that makes it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One advantage of plastic cards, they don't require power or network communication.  I would bet for a long time there'd be an interim where you'd have to carry both.  Yeah, I would imagine.  Yeah, of course.  But ultimately, don't you think that the phone will become your identifying because of.  It's your wallet now.  Yeah, because of biometrics that, you know, that's kind of a sci-fi future where you have this thing that is your identity card.  You know, it's you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You move from I think, therefore I am.  I have a phone, therefore I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I NFC, therefore I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's your wallet right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is, especially in during quarantine.  I never touch terminals anymore.  I just press my Apple watch over the terminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's interesting for like when you check into a hotel, for example, they want to see your credit card and license.  If you have all of that on your phone, you could actually do all of that just by scanning instead of having the stupid mobile app on your 18 different hotels.  And then you use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then use the phone to open the door.  Right.  There's some privacy concerns, but I think it could be thought out well.  And I do love it that in some ways is privacy protecting because you say just tell my age.  Nothing else. I like that.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just give them the information they need at this point in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It does make it the weakness is that presumes that you are your phone and your phone is you.  Yes.  Right.  If you stole somebody's phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  You'd have access to this, so it'd have to be easy to get rid of.  But if you steal someone's wallet, it's I mean, like we have a similar weakness with our wallets, although we don't tend to take our wallets out and leave them on the table at restaurants.  So you could check text messages.  So true.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Eventually, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It'll be your blob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Use your blob.  That's the blob we were talking about.  Yeah, I forgot about that.  That's the blob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How could you forget about the blob?  I forgot the blob.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  That was that was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Good story, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff is fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, you really take the show very seriously.  Yes, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I put lots of stuff, pardon me, in the rundown, mainly so I can steer you all the way from the stories I don't want to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like Walmart abandoning the plan to have robots, check store inventories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're keeping some of their robots, but they got rid of the Bossa Nova robots, which makes me sad because I like the envision.  I like to envision Bossa Nova robots that are actually doing the Bossa Nova.  Dancing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's funny because depending on your angle, like in Gadget says, oh, you know, humans are back, then like Mother Jones would say to enslave their workers.  It's like really, I have to admit, doing inventory in a store is one of the worst jobs.  It sucks.  Yeah.  So this bot just walks, you know, rolls down the aisle.  It makes perfect sense.  Faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The only thing that came to mind was the cost.  But it's not faster than humans.  Right.  What did it cost to have these robots in place and what did it cost to support and maintain them?  You know, is that something that they looked at to say, OK, we're going to spend X amount of dollars on this and it's probably cheaper.  Just pay the humans.  You think that was it?  Walmart found that you don't have to pay them health insurance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Walmart found that workers collecting online deliveries from shelves, you know, pickers could also gather inventory data.  Oh, yeah.  Now Walmart plans to use those folks to monitor levels and locations, which makes the robots redundant.  Also, the CEO of Walmart was concerned about how shoppers might react and interact with robots in stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I have a story about this coming out in a couple of weeks at IEEE.  It's all about how we as humans react to robots and how we need a registry for robots.  Because as people, when you encounter these things, you're like, well, who owns it?  What's it doing?  And we need a place to look that up.  It's going to be a good story.  It's going to be a good story.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's really interesting.  Yeah.  That is quite interesting.  Do we care about the we don't the Glenn Greenwald intercept?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  One great line.  We respect the journalist that Glenn Greenwald was.  Oh, wow.  Oh, it was sing.  Sing.  Sing them back.  That was all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I bet you you put this story in from Slate.  Americans are too worried about political misinformation.  Tell me what does that mean?  Why?  It just says that.  Is a survey.  Gallup poll says four and five Americans are concerned.  They're less concerned than they.  Yeah.  That misinformation will sway the outcome of the election.  80 percent either very or somewhat concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  So they're saying we should be less concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've seen a study that said that the influence of Twitter and Facebook was nothing compared  to the influence of Fox News.  Exactly.  That's what it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the that's the that's the that's the real our moral panic straight.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You want to see this data visualization of the spread of COVID?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought it was really good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is what we're learning now is that it's really it's aerosolized.  It comes through the air.  And so this is a very kind of graphical just from the Spanish.  It's a Spanish newspaper.  Al Pais.  Yeah.  Six people get together in a private home, one of whom is infected.  This is by the way this is very relaxed about it in the graph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's infected but he does not feel any pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's quite relaxed on the Thanksgiving.  Yes.  He has that attitude.  Yeah.  This would be the guy who's infected and affects you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  About 31 percent of coronavirus outbreaks in Spain are caused by this guy.  So after four.  OK, so they're all red.  It's noon.  Right.  But now at sixteen hundred four p.m.  four hours later, doesn't matter if safe distances.  If you spend four hours together talking loudly about wearing a face mask,  in a room with zero ventilation, five of them will become infected,  according to the scientific model.  If face masks are worn, four are at risk.  Masks alone will not prevent the infection in such a prolonged exposure.  I mean, four hours is a long time.  However, however, the risk of infection drops to below one when the group uses  face masks, shortens the length of the gathering to two hours and ventilates.  That's really the key.  I, I, I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It makes total sense, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I work out with my trainer.  He has an open barn.  And so it's sort of outside.  I said, all you have to do is put a fan in that window, just a slow fan,  either pulling or blowing to keep the air moving.  It doesn't have to be risk.  It's not to be a tornado, but to keep the air moving because then the aerosolized  virus particles get dispersed and your exposure is much, much lower.  And that's really what we're learning.  I think that's really important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it has other scenarios.  I wish you care.  But it was really, really good data viz.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And, you know, we're not making good progress with with COVID-19.  We're really not over.  I think it was 1300 people died yesterday.  It's just not it's just not progress is not good.  And we need to I think this information needs to get out.  Did I talk about the Google Doc that a bunch of smart epidemiologists and others  put out a public Google Doc explaining the aerosolized the issue and why?  Yeah, apparently, because the old miasma theory, you know, that you that bad air  made you sick was something that we defeated at the turn of the last century.  You know, finally went out the window.  Docs are very reluctant to ascribe and it turns out the CDC and WHO are very  reluctant to ascribe to aerosolized distribution of disease.  They only will admit to it.  Measles is one where it's highly contagious.  And let me see if I can find the doc because it's really good.  I think everybody should read it.  I've sent to a lot of friends and family so that they know this is the short  URL is tiny URL dot com slash F a Q capital F a Q dash aerosols.  And it's a very long piece.  It's being kept up to date.  And if you look at the people put it together, it's it's you know, I know you're  concerned, Jeff, about credibility.  These these are absolutely the people you would want to ask about this.  And they really say it's time to really kind of acknowledge that aerosol  transmission, just like that Al-Pais story said, is the issue.  And they talk very clearly about what you can do to protect yourself.  So you should still wash hands and socially distance and all that stuff.  But it's not so much from touching surfaces.  You know, you don't have to sterilize your groceries when you get home.  It really is from being in a in a closed space with with the spreader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I see a need for certification of ventilation in buildings.  Absolutely. I really don't want to go back to my school building.  Right. They talk they talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because you don't want to put too much fresh air, especially when it's  winter, because it's cold and you have to heat it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, my German friends say that kids are being told to bring coats and blankets  to school. Right. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have ventilation is very important in schools.  Yeah. So this was a I highly recommend this this Google Doc.  Put that in the rundown. I didn't.  But I will I will put a link in right now.  So you have it tiny URL dot com slash capital F a Q.  Dash aerosols.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Aerosols.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There we go. Thank you.  Yeah, the information's out there. That's the thing.  And I just this was this was kind of remember the CDC put this up and was taken  down within eight hours.  And the CDC said, yeah, I wasn't ready for primetime, but I think it was  political reasons.  And so this is important to get this information out.  And it's understandable that, you know, doctors are afraid of going back to the  old my asthma theory.  But that's but sometimes it is aerosol.  You know, let's take a break unless there's anything else.  There's so many stories we didn't get to everything.  But if you see something you want to talk about, you know, and that's the fun.  This is our potpourri show.  I've decided where it's just a little bit of this, a little bit of that, a little  bit of smell, light smell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is grandmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Twip this week in potpourri's.  Our show today brought to you by NetSuite.  This is such a good solution.  I look at Lisa when she's at home and she's like I said, she's in the living room.  She has a 49 inch screen curved monitor.  And she says, yeah, and if I could get another one on top, that would be really great.

Thank you NetSuite for your support of this week in Google.  All right, Stacey, you teased us.  You said it was going to be good.  What's your thing this week?  Oh, that's good.  You got that's the Amazon.  I'm spying on you.  Halo.  Halo.  Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm spying on you.  I like it.  OK, so I have been in it.  Y'all.  I was not here this week, but last week my thing would have been the whoop.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK.  On one wrist, pretty good.  On one wrist, she has the whoop.  On the other wrist, she's got the halo.  Is there anything?  Oh, look who else is wearing a whoop.  Mr. Ant Pruitt's whooping.  Oh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  So the whoop is definitely an ant ask.  What is the I never heard of the whoop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  So it's a fitness tracker, but it's it's really geared for.  It's hardcore athletes.  It gives you a lot of data for for athletes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You say, Leo, not you or me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In other words, is it whoop my life dot com?  No, no.  W.  Oh, whoop.  See, it's not whoop.  It's whoop.  Whoop.  Sorry.  Like I'm a cool whip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whoop.  Cool whip.  Cool whip.  Whoop.  Wait, what?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What?  What?  It's whoop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  So last week, whoop would have been my choice to show you all.  So whoop is a little in.  So this is going to give it.  I'll just let you all know.  This is a band that has a subscription.  You've got to buy a hundred and eighty dollar band.  It gets you three months subscription at thirty dollars a month.  So it's pricey and this is designed for hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  Is it better than like an Apple watch?  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, it depends.  So the whoop is very focused on like athletes.  Like it doesn't auto detect walking because walks are not workouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's the yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so I'm just saying this is a whoop.  I'm just saying this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thanks a lot.  Make me feel like a walk is a workout.  Trust me.  When you're our age.  Yeah.  A walk is a workout.  So this is for triathletes and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's just got a hundred million in funding from in part of the funders were like  Peyton Manning.  Is that a yeah.  Is that his name?  Eli Manning.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Eli Manning's brother.  Mahomes.  They got Mahomes in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're the official recovery and tracking device of the NFL Players Association.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have something called the strain coach.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's what it looks like.  Like here's my for a week or so.  This is Stacy's data.  This is showing that green is my recovery.  Blue is my strain.  As you can see, most days I sleep real well and I don't work that hard.  But what I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As you can see from this graph, Stacy's a large ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will say, I will say so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know how aunt feels about this, but the data is definitely like they, they love  their cardio way more than I love my cardio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's all about heart stuff.  It's all based on your heart.  To some degree.  I feel like that's because that's the thing they could measure.  Yeah.  So that may kind of color their, you know, their preference for heart rate variability  and resting heart rate and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're doing, they're doing real well and they do things like say, Hey, this is  how much sleep you need and they tell you what time you should go to bed.  It's, it's nice.  Anyway, so that's what I got these and I got this because everyone said the Amazon  halo copied the whoop.  Oh, it's a lot less exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a lot less expensive than the whoop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now the Amazon halo is available for 64 99 and that includes six months free at three  99 for the subscription.  So what's interesting about the halo is it is for lazy people.  I have already overshot my week's worth of, oh, you took a walk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can take a break the rest of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your data looks like this and not showing you my sleep data because I didn't wear it  last night to sleep because I'm, I took it off in the middle of the night because I'm  bad.  And this is also in here's, I'll be honest, if you listen to my podcast tomorrow, you're  going to hear Stacey almost break down in tears over this device.  It's very triggering.  But the fun thing slash scary thing for people is it measures your tone.  So here's my tone data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The halo made you cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll get to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think that's a good device at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a microphone on the band and you turn it on.  You can opt in to having it listen to your tone.  And so I opted in because I was very curious because people say I'm sound kind of like  a jerk.  Sometimes they're like Stacey or a little too crusty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You do not.  You are.  Oh, that's so not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's okay.  So what I have discovered and we'll do this live just to see.  Hold on.  I'm going to show y'all if my phone decides to work.  Here we go.  We're going to start the tone test.  Okay.  So just talk normally.  Yes.  Here's me talking normally.  I don't know if you can actually see the work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Once I say moral panic, then she's going to tone's going to change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  oh, look at that.  It doesn't.  It's shot over to the right.  That shot way over to the right on that.  Oh, that's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Never on that level.  Normally I'm right about here and I tend to go more towards negative.  So it's really interesting to see how it kind of judges you.  It's really judgy.  It's totally judgy.  So if you're worried about this, Amazon does A, it's opt in, but B, Amazon does say  it will.  What's the word I'm looking for?  It deletes your recordings every day at or every 24 hours.  It deletes them.  You can also go in and delete them manually.  So mostly it says I'm knowledgeable, interested and focused, which is probably how you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just got an invitation.  Should I buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's the other thing.  So tone is kind of fun and interesting.  The activity tracking is very lenient.  It gives you points.  So it tracks steps and things like that, but what it does is give you points for like any  time your heart rate's above a certain amount and you get two times the points if your heart  rate goes into an intense area.  So it's calculating for 150 points a week because that's what the US government says  is a fair amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What does it say about your use of commas?  Does it say anything there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't say anything.  It also subtracts points if you're sedentary.  So during the show, I'm going to lose three points because I'm going to have sat for three

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  hours.  I was hearing a lot of negatives about it, but actually it doesn't sound that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's get to the part where I started crying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why did you cry?  I think people misunderstood what it's actually used for.  Maybe.  A lot of people tend to think these bands are just pedometers.  There's more to these bands than just a pedometer.  It's a fancy pedometer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Chronicle did a great story about they talked to the doctor in charge and he talked  about it being wellness.  So things like understanding your tone might help you not alienate people you love.  If you're constantly negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Lisa wants me to have this guarantee you.  Seriously, she does not like my tone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah.  It gives you a very achievable activity goal, I feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, but it also does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In other words, easy.  Unlike whoop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whoop is, dang man, that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whoop would make me cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's tough.  It's intense.  So on the, it also has a section about your body.  This is where it offers to let you take scans and it will measure your body fat percentage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My body, myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does ask you when you take the pictures, when you start the process to take the pictures  to do the scan, it says, hey, do you want to keep these in the cloud or on the device?  I really recommend you keep them on the device unless you are gorgeous and you probably could  send it to the cloud and that would be fine because you are totally healthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Modeling career restarts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They also ask you before you take the scan, they tell you, please get into a bikini or  some tight shorts.  I don't have a bikini.  No, you would be in the tight fitting bikers.  That's a visual.  I don't want Leo.  Don't think about it.  And then you take pictures and you put the, you basically stick the phone on the table  and it's going to go beep and you're going to go like this.  Like you're at the airport thing and you're going to do it.  I didn't do it.  I didn't do it because I can't do it.  I just physically cannot take my clothes mostly off and put a bikini on.  I just can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's the part that made me cry because I was like, I can't do it.  Why don't you get a body double, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Get somebody else to do it for you.  I told Kevin you could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You look like a 48 year old man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's, that's my devices of this week and last week since I missed last week, but  I just wanted, you know, they're, they're totally different for different audiences  and people, I think.  And I'm very concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm definitely not a hooper.  Look at me.  Do I look like a hoop?  I might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I requested an invite for the, the, the Amazon band, but I've yet to see anything about it.  Is it able to be ordered now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's, well, I just went there and it says you're invited.  I mean, they're basically, they made a limited number and they're like sending it out to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I applied when they came out because I thought this sounds interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, give it to Ant for wellness.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll order it.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  I'll put it through his paces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, so, so that's, that's my devices that Stacey is reviewing this week.  Next week I've got a great one.  That smile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Dr. Mom, who was one of our regulars, said she had the halo band and because she was  social distancing and wearing masks on her walk, she would shout to people and it said,  you are so angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, so that seems kind of counterproductive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It definitely takes volume into perspective.  Okay.  And it does like, so I showed you a little graph thing, but if I look at like, it also  flags things like it has, it calls them notable moments and it says like, you had one phrase  that sounded satisfied, proud or appreciative.  Oh, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or do you feel like it's accurate?  Like it's, I feel like it's Voodoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like it's sort of accurate.  I know that I have a lower affect than many people and I think that comes across.  Like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it doesn't come across, I mean, from a nuanced point of view, it does not come across  as negative.  It comes across as very calm and soothing and nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unless it yells at you and tells you you're being an ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's what I mean.  I think the halo is not nuanced at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It may not.  I mean, not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like not yet.  You know, it has, the axes are positive and negative and low energy and high energy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd be very interested to see what it does.  I'm going to wear it.  Yeah.  How about as a sleep tracker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The people with their bikinis on look so happy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They're just very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They really do.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're crying inside, Jeff.  Trust me.  Take a picture of me.  It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Trust me.  They're crying inside.  Amazon, because they do show the people with their like little muffin tops and I'm like,  that doesn't realize it for me.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No one's going to see it or is somebody going to see it?  Like they sent it to a doctor who says, oh my God, you need surgery.  So I know he's going to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is this is I'm going to I had I struggled with an eating disorder when I was younger.  Imit body image issues.  Yeah. So just the idea of taking a photo and putting on a bathing suit is just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, actually, I know it's funny.  I know a lot of women like that, not guys so much, but a lot of gals like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I wouldn't.  Not anymore. I used to I used to be thin.  So but you wouldn't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It wouldn't make you cry, Jeff.  You just go, oh, fine, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I have a scale that measures my body fat.  So I am curious how well it works.  But I'm curious enough to I'm going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll do it. I'll do it.  I'll take the bullet for you.  Even if it makes me cry, I'm going to do it.  How about the sleep tracker?  Is it pretty good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This I really torn on this because the the one I will say I only wore the sleep tracker for two nights.  Last night, I took it off apparently because it's really uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Just the side of my body.  I don't know why the sides toughened up, but it was not accurate.  Well, it was vastly different from the loop.  And the loop was more in line with the Fitbit, which I have worn for years.  So it was like an hour and a half off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  I have a sleep tracker in my bed, so I'll compare it to the Serta sleep tracker, which I think is very accurate.  And I have the ORA ring.  I could wear that. I could have like sensors.  Just to get everything.  Compare them all.  Wear my Apple watch.  Everything. I'll compare them all and see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go. So I didn't I don't know if the sleep tracking is very good because I haven't tested it for long enough.  I'm trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chickenhead 21 is reminding me that I have a scale that tweets out my weight.  Oh, that's right.  I remember.  Right.  I keep forgetting that it's still there.  It still does it. I just keep forgetting.  Oh, my God. I just weighed myself.  And what did you think of the whoop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whoop. That thing is great again, because it's not necessarily something for just the no, it's for serious athletes, beginner or novice or whatever.  This is really designed for the real deal athlete is trying to get better or just really hit a certain mark in their fitness levels.  And it's going to make sure that they're out there doing the work.  If you're not doing the work, it's not tracking anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how do you feel about their measure of your work, though?  Because like like yesterday, I mean, well, just how do you you can measure walking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can you'd have to go in and dial it in.  You have to admit that I'm that I'm walking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'm not. I mean, I did like a full weight like I did a full functional fitness with weights and push ups.  And I was I was really like pushing myself hard.  And yeah. And I was at a 10, like just a 10 level strain on that workout.  And I was like, yeah.  And it was like a 19 level strain day.  And I was like, I I couldn't have done much more beyond that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How long how long was that?  Because that actually does sound about right.  How long did was that work?  Was that workout like 45 minutes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did mountain climbers for ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, if you were talking like 30 minutes, that 10 number does sound about right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's different for everybody.  But like if that's the thing, like if you have like a day that's like because it tells you,  it's like you can get you should go for like a 19 level strain.  All right. And then you're like, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then you're like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think I really want to do that.  But again, think about it, they're they're back by the NFL Players Association  and you know how those guys train.  And it's not but it's not easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So, yeah, I would say this is probably the whoop is not for not for me.  And I have a lot of friends like in the venture world or the tech bro world who use it.  And I'm just sure they love this stuff.  It's like data plus hardcore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm crossfit.  Oh, that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff, how about a number?  Oh, God, he's standing up.  What's the number?  I've been sitting to presume to seven hours.  Oh, go ahead. You can walk around.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I'm tethered.  Let me see my numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm one of those little bicycles for under your desk.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Like I'm like, I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we could use it to power your microphone so you can only scream about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's what you want.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My panic.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, I think of my friend.  You were the nice guy on the show.  Let's see here.  The Orange County Registrars  pre-planned is being bought by Amazon for $63 million.  Going to tear it down, put up a warehouse.  Boring.  Bezos sold $3 billion.  Maybe boring, but that's kind of a.  That's kind of says something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, here's the local newspaper.  Destroyed by crazy people.  Destroyed by Craigslist being torn down by Amazon.  Now, now, now.  And they're going to turn it into a warehouse.  A distribution center.  That's sad.  That is really the story of our times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is. Yeah.  Alexis O'Hanian, wonderfully nice guy, recalls selling Reddit  for $10 million to my old boss, Steve Newhouse.  Wow. I wish he'd had more advisors.  Now, as time went on, he didn't talk about this in the Twitter thread.  As I know it, this is about the time I left the company.  Steve had wanted.  I don't know if I should say it. Yeah, I'll say it.  Dig. He loved Dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, wow. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And and they kind of weren't, you know, I just know that.  But Reddit was his second.  Kevin would not sell him Dig.  I don't know that. I don't know whatever happened.  But I know that Steve loved Dig.  But then Reddit was kind of the second choice.  But look what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who's who's still around and who's not? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly. And I think that what happened was was was Steve Newhouse.  Is that my new house's son?  No, that's his nephew.  Nephew. My boss.  He's now the chairman of the company.  He's now the top new house.  And so as I understand it, they created equity.  They kind of spun it off so that there was equity,  so they could motivate all the executives.  And I would assume Alexis got a little more value then coming back as chairman.  But I thought that was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's married to Serena Williams.  He's what? He's married to Serena Williams.  And that is the that is the thing I know about him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's very nice. He's a great guy.  And, you know, I was friends with both him and Kevin Rose,  the Dig guy and the Reddit guy.  And now they're both they're both great.  And I wish Cy had paid him more, to be honest.  I mean, Steve had paid him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it was size money at the time. Yeah. Right. Yeah.  Xiaomi is going to build a factory to produce 10 million phones without any humans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, what could our phones without humans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know. And finally, Zoom has the happiest employees.  I bet their stock is doing wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder why. That's very odd.  What are they so happy about?  I don't know. Do you think if you work at Zoom, you're on Zoom even more than the rest of us?  Like, it sounds awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The whole company. How do you run it? Zoom.  Employee stock purchase.  Maybe that's why. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the second year in a row that Zoom is the happiest employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is based. Maybe they were confused and they thought Zappos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Shoes. Shoes will make you happy.  They ask things like, is your work environment positive or negative?  Do you believe you're paid fairly? Do you feel burned out at work?  Are you typically excited about going to work each day?  And do you look forward to interacting with your coworkers?  And actually, they're number four on compensation after Google, Facebook and Microsoft.  That's interesting. And they've one or two years in a row.  That's really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, hiring nice people and making it.  I mean, that's an important thing.  Like, that's why one of the big questions that.  Predicts if someone's going to leave or stay is, do you have a best friend at work or do you have a good friend at work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and they point out in this article  that the CEO of Zoom, Eric Yuan, was working at Cisco WebEx and left because he hated the company and founded Zoom.  So maybe it was in a reaction to, you know, a bad job that he decided to build a good company.  And your pick of the week, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I have two. The first one, I got a text message from my old neighbor back in South Caculac.  The sister of Chad Bozeman, and she says, we've started a fund for St. Jude Children's Research  because he's he's he did a lot with them and they have a fund in his name where you can donate to St. Jude's Children's Research  so people can get services for free there, because we all know those medical bills can be quite expensive.  I created a short redirect link at Pruitt dot com slash Chad.  I don't think it works.  Straight to that site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think it works.  I just clicked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hold on. Well, I can do that like right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me do it. Let me type it in.  Ant Pruitt dot com slash Chad, right?  Right.  You know what? It could have been the Google spreadsheet screwed it up.  No, it does work.  Yeah. OK. Good.  There it is. Ant Pruitt dot com slash Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice. So if you want to donate there, I appreciate it.  And you know, you're doing it in Chad's name, just continuing to boost his legacy out there.  That's really nice. Yeah.  And number two, I was just going to say go watch Hands on Tech.  I had a lot of fun reviewing the Lumix S5 and just yeah, I'm going to be watching slightly overpriced,  but it's a pretty nice camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it it's full frame, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Full frame mirrorless. Nice.  Not quite as big as the S1H that you and I played with at CES.  Yeah, I remember that.  But it's got a lot of capabilities.  And today they just released a firmware update to it to where you can externally record 5K off of this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, Mr. Ant Pruitt, hands on photography, hands on wellness and a whupper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hands on Tech, all that.  It's cool. Whop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mr. Jeff Jarvis, wait a minute.  I didn't give you all the credit you deserve.  At the beginning of the show, he is in fact a Leonard Tao professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Thank you very much for being here.  BuzzMachine.com is his blog at Jeff Jarvis on the Twitter.  Thank you, Jeff. Anything you want to else you want to plug?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, he's moving up in the world.  Moving on the people every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I do want to say that Mr. Craig Newmark has followed me on Twitter and it always fascinates me seeing him tweet me here and there, some random stuff.  And I'm like, really?  He's tweeting me and I forget that.  Oh, Mr. Jarvis, that's probably why there's a connection there.  And he's such a guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's loved the show for a long time. Hi, Craig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, Craig.  Such a kind man and always just boosts my ego whenever I hear from him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you do anything about pigeons, if you take pictures of pigeons, Craig will love that.  Craig loves pigeons, loves pigeons and hates the Orange County Register.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, he does not stop that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's kind of mean to say that Craig's put them out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What put them out of business?  The OC Register.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, a bad owner before the LA Times.  That'll do it.  It's not out of business.  It's just the LA Times.  They just didn't need a building, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, all news and most newspapers, I mean, my former hometown paper,  their building is they sold it and they're moving the news organization, which is sad.  Yeah.  I mean, I do feel like in your news organization in the middle of your city or the down, you know,  that's important, but now they're all moved out to the suburbs.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where the plant is, they moved out to be near their printing presses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Usually they just move where it's cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cheaper.  The gray, I think of the gray lady building, the Times building,  which is no longer where the Times is.  Right, Jeff? Did they move?  It's across the street from the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They were next to us.  They're across from the Port Authority.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Please do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
