Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but I'd explain what that means to me because I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's like a stripped down more specialized version of Android specifically made for IoT  Implementations, but what you'll notice when you're playing around with the UI on that is that it's it's very much in line with  Kind of Google's new direction of of user experience and and UI. It doesn't look like Android necessarily  It's kind of has its own thing going  But along there they're kind of style guidelines. It's really nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and it comes with additional support  and so it's not still crazy long support, but you'll have it for a little bit longer and  That's good because these devices shouldn't die. You know, some of them won't die after three years, for example

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thankfully it was just a five five five like fake number  At least you didn't say nine one one. That would have been awkward

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's giving me a few notes first telling me emergency numbers aren't available. Okay good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, so I'm waiting once I start to see something here I'll let you I'm getting it  I'm getting a notice on my pixel book  I'm not getting oh, yeah. No, I'm getting a private call number or for private incoming call. That's not duo  No, that took me to phone  That's you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hi  It's only audio. There's no video. Oh, it's a call call. How's it going? Yes, this is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm very confused. I need to find some calm. I think we all need to find some calm. I'm gonna hang up on you now

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Video it just works. Huh? I really I really want this to work. I want to see I want to see the video  I don't know how I can force it from my end  Like I yeah, it must there must be some sort of like account set up on your side to allow incoming calls to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can call Kevin Toffle on his  Do on his screen if he will he'll answer on the screen if he's there  but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm gonna try one more time Jeff. See if the see if the call comes through on your

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Huh? No, I came through on my phone. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, at least we saw a call complete at least we have this  Yes, it just works the way it's the way it was never intended it's vertical so I can't fit in dad hands

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you should flip your thing to the side is your thing landscape or portrait? No, I would tell this is on the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is not on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Phone is not as great of it  So if you go to Kevin's Twitter account, you can see he and I using duo if you want it the  When you put it in landscape mode, you look a little wider than you are. Oh, no, I don't need that now  But that's on the bigger one. I don't know if the other one does it you get a finer resolution on that one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so obviously the  If you're getting one of these for yourself and you plan on making video calls  You're probably not going to jump right on a podcast two seconds after you unbox it and and  So you're probably gonna have better luck than we had just then I'm guessing there must have been some sort of setup process that we missed

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just kind of assumed if you logged in with your account and duo is tied to your account that it would work  But but then at the same time your Lenovo smart display is not tied to your phone number  And if I remember correctly when duo launched that was its big thing was it's secure because it's tied to you  Like you don't use your Google account you use your phone number. Did that get changed at some point?  It must have in order to enable this  Talking through like a smart no. No cuz you actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Give it your phone number like so my Google assistant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Allow free calls, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz you don't if you don't want this because people can video call you you get the chance to not accept it, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so allow free calls is now activated is that right  I'm wondering if  Once it is  Just let me know what I should try again and I will Jeff I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just called you I'm styling you know, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, again, I'm getting it from a phone incoming Wi-Fi call

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello  Thank you for calling this week in Google, this is Jason

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Weren't you on the show? Were you hosting the time we called customer support at Google?  Yes, that was one of our greatest moments ever. That was fantastic if we do say so ourselves

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me try calling you then because for whatever reason that's not working  But now that you've set that up, maybe my incoming call will  It's coming on the phone  All right, I don't know I think I think I think we have to abort I don't know if it's gonna work which is weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why watch watch it doesn't work as it's my apps account. Oh  That might no no it should have any impact

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a joke. I wouldn't be surprised though. Seriously history seems to make that a  possibility  Alright, apparently that's not gonna happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I would like everyone to know that within a few moments of unboxing his Kevin and I did complete a perfectly acceptable  duo call  I have an apps account, but it's it's based on phone numbers and it it rang me on my duo  Like I got a it pops up. It's like you're will you accept a duo call from Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me try this let me try  We'll see now now we've got okay now I'm doing it I'm doing one more time just one more time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm gonna say make a video call. Oh, yes, please. Yeah, that would be that's that would be the way to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Crosses since you're dressed so well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, so yes, we'll see it we'll see how this goes he's a  He's firing off the command to the Lenovo  Smart display. I'm still looking at myself in my Google. Sorry something went wrong. Try again in a few seconds

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, don't you love that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I want everyone to know if you're listening to this later that we did actually sort of try this before we started the show  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think we thought we were better set up. We actually were I mean, you know  It should work. I would imagine if you log in here again  If you log into your account and you and you then fire up the video call, you know software  That's that's on the device. You'd think it would work. Apparently I I feel like it might work

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I mean now I'm I  Almost want to buy one just to take it back on the plane with me just to see if I can make it work because I feel  pretty confident that  There's some user error happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's interesting the UI oh hey Stacey  Variables here and maybe something variable named Jeff. I know I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now let's just blame Google for everything Google's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it should be easy for everyone even Jeff. It's interesting Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you click on the explore more things you can do right you click on any of those things and all it does is  Give you a sample thing to say right, right  There's nothing else to click on touch

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you always but if you fire off commands like to control your lights or something like that or you know  Turn up the heat on the connected thermostat or whatever  It'll give you an on-screen kind of interactive control that you can interact with then it's like your voice starts the process  But there's no way there's no way to go to the screen and just fire it off just like that, huh?  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would play live TV and all it does is give me six commands play sports center on YouTube TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In order to do that say this yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, no, wait, do you have a YouTube TV subscription Jeff? I have YouTube premium red thing  No premium red is just for you to so actually do this say show me videos on YouTube  What part me one is you're asking it to play TV, but you don't have the TV subscription so say  You have a Netflix. Oh, we haven't haven't played corgi videos on YouTube and then you should see it play something for you. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  play corgi videos on YouTube

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These pictures and then you should be able to press a video and start it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube premium is that what that says premium? Oh, there it is funny corgi compilation 2017 best funny corgi videos ever  2018 is already out. This is so old dated these corgis. So so 80s. I mean come on  They're pegging their

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Collars are you are you getting a corgi when you get home do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Am I gonna get one? No, I have a dog  Okay, so you can see that and if you had a YouTube TV subscription or if you tie it to your Netflix account then you can say  watch  You know whatever right mastermind on Netflix. Yeah, it's nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I try to start setting up the the problem is like like it wasn't to do HBO go. I don't have HBO go I have HBO  Which I can use on  My phone and my laptop, but it's not HBO go  HBO now now, I mean now yeah, whatever  Well, there's that for cock the CBS thing  I  Don't know. Yeah, I don't know how far like Netflix

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know is built in and if you get YouTube TV, then all you say is play NS MS NBC on YouTube TV and it will  So how much is YouTube TV cost? What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like 40 bucks a month or something. I think yeah, no way no way cuz I have  Every place is cable. Yeah, it's 40 bucks. Yeah. No, I'm like a cable  It's your files the cord cutting  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I drop into YouTube TV if something's happening like the Olympics that I want to watch then I'll buy it for a month and then I'll be  Done, you know, I'm afraid this could be like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At the right thing here. What was it the zombie?  Okay, no, this is way more functional than the chumby

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff just give it a few minutes and set it up properly. Not on the show  I feel like we're gonna come back to you when we do things on the show things happen  Like you lock yourself out of your account or you can't do video calls. So  We keep learning this lesson time and time again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a bad idea  I'm not sure if you're gonna be able to do it. I'm not sure if you're gonna be able to do it  It's a bad idea that's why it makes great TV  News sources custom. I think you'll like it. I think it's a it's a nice device  I like that they add the the hardware toggle for the camera  I'm afraid to use the word switch because Karsten was giving me  Give me static on that prior to the show  But it actually has a physical slider so that you can put a cover over the camera  If you don't want the camera to be oh that that paranoid thing. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and better than putting a piece of tape on the camera if that's what you want to do is cover the camera. So  And I think devices like this that's just gonna set some consumers minds at ease to have something like that baked in  So why not?  All right, well we started with the Lenovo smart display my initial thought was that we were gonna start with Google's big  News that from this morning from the intercept  But I'm worried about this we went in a different direction, but let's talk about this  After we thank the sponsor because we've got a few ads today  So I want to I want to first take some time real quick here and thank the first sponsor of this episode  And that is last pass and then we will talk all about  Google's China  Situation so this week in Google is brought to you by last pass  I'm a huge fan of last pass been using them for years now according to one survey  32% of employees share passwords with others  What is your company doing?  To to protect you to protect itself to ensure that those passwords are being shared appropriately  LastPass enterprise makes password sharing convenient for employees while keeping access to corporate data secure  It even allows for full customization of access  including the ability to set master password  Requirements enable password resets configure over 100 policies access security reports create shared folders  So many features organized database logins SSH keys software licenses and other important business information  So you can protect that information?  Securely and the last pass makes it easy to restrict access when it's needed when employees say leave the company or  No longer need access to that particular account to get their work done  You can further protect your business with multi-factor authentication  There's last pass authenticator, which is an app  It's a verification button inside the app that pops up on an employee's phone  to guarantee that they are the only ones with access to their accounts and  Even if credentials are happen to be compromised through something like a phishing attack or malware the app  Make sure that outsiders won't have access  LastPass password generator makes it super easy to come up with unique random passwords that your employees don't have to remember or write down  They don't have to come up with one on their own  It randomizes the whole process inserts the right kinds of characters in there to make it really easy to generate strong passwords  And now employees can log in to last pass with their Microsoft Active Directory credentials  So they truly only have one password to remember and that would be their AD password and data is encrypted and  Decrypted at the device level data stored in the vault is kept secret  Even from last pass so even last pass doesn't know from easy onboarding to password autofill  I love password autofill makes my life so much easier on Android  Last pass makes it easy for businesses to take control of passwords and reduce the threat of breach  Last pass also offers last pass premium  That's more for personal use last pass families for your entire family and last pass teams  for teams of 50 or fewer  like I said love love last pass been using it for years got my wife on board and  We rely on last pass. We've come to rely on it over the years. That's because it just works  It takes that it takes the kind of second-guessing and poor security practices out of your life and puts it in  To a secure package a last pass also by the way celebrated its 10th anniversary  This July so happy anniversary. Happy birthday  More than 13 million people trust last pass the number one most preferred password manager learn more at last pass comm slash twit  Today that's last pass comm slash twit and you can see which product is right for you  And we thank last pass for their support of this week in Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, so this is our dear friend and Pruitt just tweeted that he thinks what we did just now was funny no answer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was touching. I thought it was funny. He enjoys watching the world crumble around us. Yeah  Thanks a lot of and is definitely a good friend of the network and he is indeed. Yeah  So thank you for tweeting that out and I agree it was kind of funny, but I also agree. It was kind of sad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We should have been able to get there. I'm not sure why tragic our techno techno tragic comedy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll figure it out the second we stop recording this show will be like oh  That's what we should have done. So Jeff. Tell me why tell me why it's a bit  This gives you pause that Google might be censoring its service for China. I was very proud of Google as an outsider

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean like like something their parents  but I was proud of them for taking a principled stand and not doing this before and  Leaving China and it was a you know, whereas Facebook's been trying desperately to get in China. Google was there but when forced to  to censor on their own  Google said no and they and they  Fundamentally left and I thought that was a principled stand and right now we're expecting the platforms to make principle stands. We're pushing  YouTube and  Facebook to get rid of info wars we being lots of people  And so I think it's more important than ever for the platforms to act on principle now  I well understand the fiduciary view that China is a gigantic market and Google's dying to get in there Facebook is dying to get  In there, but they've got to know their line  They kind of know what line they won't cross and I think sensory and search has to be Google's line

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and Google had had already kind of gone through this to a certain degree, right? Yeah, they did this back in I think  2010 pulled out of China because for a few years prior to that they were doing similar things kind of a  stripped-down censored version of of their service operating in China and they got an intense amount of  Scrutiny, why is it different now? Why would they get less scrutiny now? I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, go on Stacy well so far they haven't done it so they may still get this group a coming  But I mean I imagine it's the economic I mean they can't not be in China. They've watched  what ten cent and we  Wibo we both eat their lunch and  How do you say no to being in a country with you know a billion people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I know I know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mean yeah, like you said Jeff from a fiduciary standpoint. Yes  That makes sense clear Sundar Pichai CEO has been very dedicated to the next billion users  And this is an obvious way to do that is to crack the Chinese market  But there but you know it it it seems to strengthen  those that pointed to Google removing the  Don't be evil tagline from there, you know from their company nomenclature  to kind of be like, okay, well now like when you're when you're  Stripping away features that enable, you know an entire country to be  misinformed and not you know not allowed to understand or know that certain things exist  for reasons that the government, you know stands to gain from because of the communist regime or whatever the case may be are you and then  Enabling that and does that set a precedent for other countries to say well now?  Willing to do this so we'll do that too

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would be interested to see if the employees freak out much like they did with the Pentagon for machine learning so it's possible

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember the arguments we had on this discussions we had on the show back then  You know the belief by some that that a hampered Google is better than no Google in China  And you know, that's a that's a decision Google made was no  And I agreed with her decision at the time one could argue that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mean I  Guess I understand and I do think it's a terrible line to cross but I am also kind of like  They've been acting a lot more public but more like a public company paying more attention to their shareholders lately, so  It kind of make it doesn't it doesn't surprise me. So Stacy. Here's another way to look at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because  What's the line? So Facebook right now is under under a lot more pressure than Google is which is why this is a convenient  Time for any Google to make a decision like this is paid  Squirrel look over there Facebook look what they did now, right? So  But what would the line be for Facebook?  right, what would what would  Because we're asking Facebook we society media government are asking Facebook to set a better line  As

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Culturally determined and so another really and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Authoritarian really are different things, right? They are now I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would say that in China  the there are some cultural norms that  Facebook could respect that we would find kind of abhorrent in  Like I mean  So it I  Don't love a theory author a thought I can't even say it authoritarianism and censorship  But a lot of people in China are very adept. They work to get around censorship  Yeah, but but I don't think it's ideal, but maybe Google's kind of like and maybe they're like screw it  The world is burning. Anyway, let's get our money while we still can

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I?  Want to like them better than that, Stacy? Yeah, I  Want to I want to be proud of them  Oh, why I'm sounding like such a dork?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cute Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know cuz it was Zilla or something  It's really hard these days. I mean I'm constantly position defending Silicon Valley depending the tech companies and it gets harder

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm tired as well Jeff. I mean I defend technology  But even I look at this and I'm like dang you can call it techno panic  But we're building a lot of tools without thinking about the ramifications and when we are thinking of the ramifications  We're saying shrug. Someone else will worry about that. Well, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been reading so books like crazy man. So watch out. I'm gonna do Gutenberg stuff  Right, so so  The press is invented and there's peasant wars and there's there's huge disruption and and and  One can't control the future  You know, you could try to do things right or wrong. I agree with that. But I think I think there's all there's a limit to your  ability and authority to  Determine the use of these tools now. I don't think Facebook's gone far enough  To say that I think that info wars is should whatever if info wars doesn't fail the test the test is wrong  At Facebook so so I think they should be doing more I think that Mark Zuckerberg  Doesn't thinks that he has the role of free speech in society as I said last week and he doesn't so he needs to set standards  For what's acceptable on Facebook and he has more authority there than he wishes to acknowledge so far having said that I  I think that that  It's a bit hubristic to think that we can say we can know what all the impact is and determine it and fix it all now I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't think we can but I  Last week I was in it was a community summit for it was like of analysts or some people who influenced  I think it was an influencer thing y'all. I was really appalled because of course your influence  I was like, no, I am NOT an influencer, but I was there and one of the people there who did  we had a discussion about AI and a  Person who was with eccentric ethics and AI group started really pressing them on  What does it mean to develop these tools and how do you view like?  Yes, it's a tool  How do you view like rules and how should we start thinking about this and what is the role of companies like Google and the Google?  Guys, he gave the very standard  Technology is like a rock it could be used for good or evil and I would argue that  It's not actually because AI is invisible and rocks are pretty obvious when you commit crimes with rocks  You're left with like a dead body or a broken window when you commit ethical violations with AI  They aren't noticed necessarily  So that's that's just me  But he he kept telling about that he kept saying it's the role of the government and the person kept pressing them on  Well, don't you think you as a company have a job to think about those ramifications?  Yes, it's a tool and they were like, no  That was not a thing that they wanted to bring up and I know that Google's gone very far and has their AI  standards, but  They they still aren't thinking about the future

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree. I agree. I just think that you know me  I get allergic to thinking that we can regulate this future  But but should the companies come to their own standards of deciding what appropriate behavior is? Yes. And as you said  One of you did the employees may well do that as they did with the drones  Though I just saw Wall Street Journal headline today in which the Wall Street Journal is saying more people will die because the employees did  That with drones and Google. Yeah, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the Wall Street Journal. Yes, it is  Like it's hard to count that but I do think it is your job if you're going to invent a technology or a platform to think  Hard about the worst ways that could be used and to reach out to people and say hey  what do you think could happen if we do this and  Listen to that feedback  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  interviewed Jonathan Zunger who's a brilliant engineer who was at Google is now doing a startup and  So I talked to him about this about about where's the line and how do you how do you set it and he his analogy  I like was to civil engineers in the early days  Right if you build a bridge and it fell apart  You didn't do your job, right? So your job was to figure out how to build a bridge that doesn't fall apart  Now that was okay because it was the bridge and you can look at the bridge and say it's up it's down  it's a different matter when you get into human behavior and impact on human behavior is very hard to predict and hard to measure and hard to  Control and maybe in some cases we shouldn't control it because lots of cases we shouldn't because people can discover new freedoms  What about an event? Sorry, go ahead. What about an analogy like drug trials?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because that's something where you have subtle  Sometimes subtle not always subtle long-term effects. So  Maybe mechanisms like that to be put in place for something like algorithmic bias or whatnot. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that they have a responsibility  To measure their own impact  And what they do with that and how transparent they are with that and how much you can rely on that different questions but to not  Try to measure your impact I think would be irresponsible  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't think they are measuring well, I think you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to imagine to a certain degree. They are though. This is google and  Yeah, I mean with the amount of people that are working on this sort of thing behind the scenes  Although the intercept said it's a very small  amount of people probably like 200 people according to the person who leaked the information about this kind of china, um,  Plan but I mean even sundar pachai, I guess I guess we don't really know sundar pachai on a personal level  But i've always kind of thought of him as a very thoughtful individual  I imagine that the I imagine in thinking about this i'd be really surprised that they don't weigh those consequences  It just seems that right now according to this leak they've decided that hey, you know  We've weighed the consequences and we stand to gain a lot. So why not try and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's a fair assessment for a business to make sure I mean  It's not a great assessment

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that an assessment that we're used to hearing a company like of google of google making specifically or well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was gonna say, you know companies make these assessments all the time. You look at someone like oh, I don't know  Exxon who says hey, you know what climate change is a real thing all the way back in the 70s and said  You know what? This isn't good for our business. Let's fight this for a while. Let's do this. I mean there's a  Look at dupont. I mean we we can find many examples and now the tech companies are going to become part of this  This wave of companies making decisions that benefit them and not society as a whole and that should not surprise any of us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because that's what companies do and especially these these companies are making ridiculous amounts of money

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By doing so, you know, and that's what government's for I mean that's  That's historically why we have it is because as individuals we can't assess this stuff  We can't enforce policies and I mean you see it with tobacco companies. We see it. I mean just  This is what they do. We're just doing a new venue to figure out government can't figure it out stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that's what I mean. So so in every case there they're basically abrogating to the company look like the right to be forgotten  Google you figure it out, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The hard thing here is because it's the internet is a worldwide phenomenon  Yes, smoking is a worldwide phenomenon  But you could sort of police it at the borders with taxation for example with the internet  We don't have a way  To police these things and the mores and values of one country versus another  You know, they  It doesn't matter  I don't know. Yeah

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Know that everyone's sad and depressed  I mean gdpr is a wonderful effort to try to make this like europeans privacy thing and it'll matter for europeans  But i'm not sure if it'll matter everywhere else

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it has unintended consequences like like um  Bifurcating the web for news consumers in europe

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right  and  That's because again the internet knows no borders and that's a that's a benefit and a challenge

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this goes back to my this is why i'm going gudinberg crazy again is is  Yeah  The notion of the nation changed after the book the notion of a culture changed after the book and after language was was standardized  Uh things can change again. The nation may not be forever  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah in a long  In a long-term view things probably will change nothing lasts forever  And who knows at what point in that inflection we are right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Except podcasting podcasting will be forever. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Never going away  Just staying the same you'll always get your podcast through the same podcatcher and the same you'll always download it. Yeah  Subscribe to an rss feed  That's it  Good point. Good point  Um, let's see here. All right. Well, you know, we're kind of touching on on facebook and jeff you are dressed to the nines  Uh, I would say maybe the eights

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't mean to show the video. I just put it in there to explain why I am dressed this way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so you were you were on ms mbc earlier today talking about uh, this kind of facebook  Uh this recent facebook news  About a coordinated political influence campaign. That's right. Yes, and I think that there's a growing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh one day consensus that the facebook is perhaps getting this act together  That facebook this time did right it announced  Uh, oh we found bad stuff we found efforts to have an impact on the political  They did not say what country it came from because I don't think they felt that they had enough evidence  But to everybody outside it looks an awful lot like the irs stuff from from russia. Yeah, everybody's assuming it's russia  People were assuming but I don't know that's just a good assumption because what happens what data in society the think tank  Joe donovan's from finds often  Is that there's a copycat structure here where where you see very similar techniques happening?  among russians and then trolls  um, so  I would bet on russia too, but who knows they also did not release the entirety of the of the material they found because some of it  I guess is just so horrendously offensive. They didn't want to be associated with that and I I think i'm okay with that  I think about it, but the point is  they did something and  So what I said on ms. MBC this morning was that what we've got to we've got to change now that they're getting their act together  We've got to change our attitude here facebook is the ally of democracy  And facebook properly done is is our best hope because our government christian nielsen did finally change her tone today  but  Her tone has been  Oh, there's no russian stuff going on whistling past the kremlin  and  So who is going to protect us from the russians donald trump apparently not  Facebook is our best defense and that's a weak defense. They would be the first to say  But but there are ally in this and they're also a victim  Of this manipulation and so I think we have to once they get their act together and get going  I think we have to you know change our mindset of oh my god facebook's ruling the democracy. You know facebook  Is trying to save it now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well done nice nicely timed there  I don't know. I'm the man i'm gonna have to internalize that a little bit. I I don't know how I feel about that  That's that's a hard hard turn for me to take

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My my gut response is god if that's that's what we've got. We're in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's where well, we are in deep doo doo. We are in deep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I i'd also I mean, I don't use facebook all that often. So I look at this and i'm like  Yeah, I guess I i'm still in love with newspapers and  conversation and civic outreach  and that is not happening on facebook and  I don't even know if young people are there anymore. So i'm like

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I i'm confused as to who

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who is influenced by facebook and i'm not saying that that's not happening because I I  See that it must be so i'm just I just don't know that's really important to see because what you what you're what you're also going

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To there which is what one of the other things I contend is  We can't take all of these actions and make all these presumptions without data now part of it is because you know  We can't get all the data we want from facebook, but but this presumption that  All of civic discourse is ruined  Uh, you know, you heard me say on the on the on the show before show me the nazis in your facebook feed  You know, they're not there when I was on msvc this morning. Stephanie rule who I think is great said  Well, this is like bear and if there's five  contaminated uh  Bottles on the shelves then bear took them all off the shelf. Shouldn't facebook do that?  I said really take off all the conversation. She said should they I said no  And bob torricelli former senator from new jersey, uh was on the panel as well and he made an eloquent  Defense of free speech and worried eloquently about the the slippery slope and the risk of free speech  Not that facebook is an agent of censorship. That's government  but that  Depends on what we expect of them to take down  Uh, where does freedom come?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are hard  And people are always going to believe stupid things. I mean good lord people I mean always have  so I  And I know this makes it easier to spread but  I don't know. I this is not a this is not a problem. I'm equipped to solve  It's not even when i'm equipped to talk about really because I am not a deep ponderer on this type of stuff. Let's talk about yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Talk about chips. Yeah, what kind lays cheetos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are cheetos really chips? I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, as I said that I was like, oh, well does that qualify like I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey if you're if you're in britain, of course you call french fries chips, which is my segue here to ask whether you've had taco bells  fry spicy fries and  queso  I I have not jeff. I'm so sorry. I'd like your i'd like your critical opinion stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of the fries and queso. I don't like french fries  I think it's important to know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think it's very odd to put them in queso, but I still want your critical opinion stacey. Oh, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cheese fries can be good. I mean, that's something i'm like, oh no. No, that's a great food. Okay. All right. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cheese makes everything better. Does cheese make chips you bet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does does uh cheese make uh, what is it edge tensor processing units?  delicious

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There I believe it makes them highly effective

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, what can you tell us about this google basically has uh, new tpus for iot devices. What are these going to be used for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Iot devices was right there. No, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, she's so feisty today. I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's earlier in the day for me. So i'm not you know  hungry and tired  Okay, so  I'm just going to run down the biggest thing and this is part of it is the biggest thing from google's cloud stuff  Last week was actually that it got  Not with the edge it met microsoft it met amazon's cloud services when it comes to edge computing  And this is a big deal because we're in the middle of kind of the pendulum swinging back from  Yeah, yeah, put everything in the cloud to people realizing  Oh if we're going to actually connect all this stuff in our factories and all these other places  We're totally going to need some local computing for security reasons. You know, you don't want your secret data going to the cloud  Latency reasons if you have an autonomous car or a giant slicing blade in a factory  You don't want data saying this is about to fail to go up to the cloud. You want it processed right there really fast  um and for  I had a whole bunch uh bandwidth costs power costs. So all of these things mean the edge is really important to companies  What google did with the tensorflow things is say hey  We can bring machine learning to the edge  machine learning takes place in two ways  One way happens in the cloud. That's when you train a model to like recognize  This is a person. This is a cat. This is a dog  All of that happens in the cloud that you show it lots of pictures of these things and figures out  and then there's the inference or  execution that happens  Where you take that model you put it on a computer like your phone you put it on an edge device  And it says when the dog walks by it says it uses that model and says dog

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let me understand that stacy. Can they interrupt for a second? Please because when I saw this story  I thought well, what's what's ai without a heck of a lot of data  So that's that's not what it's doing is that's happening somewhere else, but it's taking the lesson and the framework  and says  This is how you recognize a dog stupid and stupid little local chip says, okay. Thanks and sees a dog

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, so what this is doing is it's so in that that framework and everything is called a model  So you send your model to the edge. I said your model. Yes  And the model runs and you're like and so but it's still got to be a pretty decent chip  So that's why it's cool that they did a tensor flow for it because there's still some interesting  Requirements for you know, it sees a bunch of stuff and it's got to look at all those things to say dog  Not dog dog not dog, right? Hot dog hot dog hot dog. Exactly  So corgi not corgi  And yes, you can do that now depending on your edge processor  This is kind of a little wacky but you can train it to do  Like the fatter your processor the more models and the more sophisticated the model can be  So you could have like right now in your iphone. You have a vision you have a computer  chip that's running computer vision that's just like  Human face and then it wakes up an even smarter processor to do the face recognition for face id, right?  So all this is is this tiny very low power processor?  That's like human face wake up the big guy and the big guy wakes up and is like that is jeff jarvis  So  What google's doing here is?  The same thing that microsoft's doing at microsoft build they talked about something called brainwave  And that was a chip that is also trying to do inference at the edge intel bought a company called movidius a while back  Exactly for computer vision at the edge. So what you're seeing is google answer to all of the competitive  like demands  For needing this technology and this is really important technology that we're going to need  Because you can't have everything with vision that needs computer vision to be talking to the cloud all the time  And you can't have things like a stoplight that's like trying to direct traffic in real time  Having to talk to the cloud all the time. Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep, that makes a lot of sense, but this is different from  so obviously tensorflow in the cloud would be  You know learning of the model essentially  Uh, but tensorflow light how is this different from from tensorflow light to edge tpu just that edge tpu is more specific  narrowly defined versus tensorflow light being like  Still doing some of the functions of the cloud version on a mobile device

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tensorflow light is a language and the tpu is a chip. Okay. Got it. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right  I'm not sure I mean  No, I mean that's like but that enables a smartphone to  Replicate what's happening in the cloud  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think tensorflow light does the actual training that's happening in the cloud  Okay, but you can also do inference in the cloud, too  Okay  So the the like the running of the model basically that can also happen in the cloud if you wanted to it doesn't have to happen  at the edge

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting so stacy to jump to where europeans and some weeks you will  Go to the go to the techno panic scenario for this ai being small and local and on on my phone or my watch or my  glasses  What bad could happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, um  It's actually I look at it as actually being pretty good because there's privacy compliance you can actually  Do a lot of the image recognition  At the edge and you don't actually have to send it to the cloud, which means  You could use it and dump it. I don't think that's actually what google's going to do. But you know one could do it  I don't think that's actually what google's going to do. But you know one could do it  So you could have in your home for example a video camera that says  you know, these are the five faces that I recognize  and  Once I recognize those when I see them I take note of them. I use them locally and then I dump them  So there's no actual record of who came in. Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  so  um, but but in the recognition process  And you want to know who that stranger is then it has to go back up in the cloud and say here's who I see  Who is it because the all the data is not going to be there to recognize that stranger

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, and suddenly but what most people don't care who the stranger is like I get notifications on my phone from my doorbell  Right now from google and it's like hey, I saw a strange person at your door and i'm like, oh, yeah  Check it. It's the ups man or oh that is a strange person  You know and sometimes I look at it and i'm like, oh no, that's my husband wearing sunglasses

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so and i'm sure there I mean  There are all sorts of evil things when I i'm not a really evil villain I don't have that mindset so  um  Yeah, I don't know but you know some interesting like scary things would be like you could you could interfere with someone's model  and then you could like  Screw up their manufacturing process or something if you're running like yield using it to analyze yields you could  Anytime anything's at the edge that means it's accessible physically so you have to start thinking about that  And depending on how much faith you want to put in that stuff, but that's kind of out there  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Were there any other things?  um, you know in your time at google cloud next that because I know last week on the show  A bunch of the topics and a bunch of the announcements were were mentioned  But aside from these chips was there anything else that really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  105 announcements. Yes. I mean the list is huge, but it's it's ridiculous. I didn't see all of the announcements  I thought it was interesting that targets now working with google cloud  um makes sense  and  You know because the retailers don't want to be on aws  I think the kubernetes on premise is a big deal because that you know that expands  The orchestration environment for containers, which is like the hot thing in the cloud to people's on-premise database  Overall, it feels like google is finally maturing its cloud offering in a way that listens to customers and what they want  In a way, I associate more with microsoft as opposed to amazon because amazon's like we built it you can use it. Here's how  Microsoft's always been like we listen to our customers  We try to build what enterprises want and google's always been like we invented this crazy wacky cool technology. It's so awesome  And you'll like using it  But they never show you how they never help you get there and it feels like they're actually taking all the cool technology  They've developed and trying to help people get there and use it, which is a big step for google  So so that's the broad kind of  I don't know thing to think about and from a news bits. I'm just i'm thinking  Yeah  I don't know  Awesome that was last week. Yeah, I know that was ancient history. Oh, I lied to you  machine learning  Good lord. They are they are so they are doing some crazy stuff with machine learning with their customers  Especially with things like map and location data  Man, they are applying that to  just crazy stuff everything from like parking to like  I don't know florist delivery to like disease epidemics. I mean it was pretty cool some of the stuff they were showing off there

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So speaking of the cloud  I just carsten. I just sent you a photo and I came across in new york yesterday. Did you get it email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he's he's checking right now  I can hear you can hear his eyes looking at a browser

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can hear his eyes. Yeah. Yeah, so  What aws loft did you know about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they did one in san francisco for a while. This is where like you could just go and work there for a while

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is your aws customer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's if you can it's it's like for startups or anyone to come in and it's kind of it used to be a co-working space  in uh  San francisco, it's like a pop-up store they create. Oh interesting. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a pop-up co-working space

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if it was 100 co-working or if you just go in to find out, you know  It's been so long since they've done it. So i'm like, I don't remember what it was exactly  Here let me look it up so I can tell you accurately I could have done that oh  Uh boot camps for aws stuff. So they're pop-up lofts  They have them in new york and san francisco in london. They have pitch events  ta-da

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's hot at the loft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Container day you guys serverless days. Oh my gosh, you get a container you get a container

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, you didn't you didn't go in jeff. I didn't go in because I didn't feel worthy and plopped down

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man, you could have learned all about serverless and been very excited. I thought i'd be quizzed at the door

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why are you here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No  Are you looking for msnbc? It's around the corner

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Man in tie you're not allowed in here with a tie. What are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is true, sir. We have a dress code  You can't wear that tie in here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Woody or go

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's take a break. I could take the tie off now, couldn't I? Yeah. Yeah go casual

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Relax the first half of the episode  Jeff was all business now. Jeff is all party. The other thing is I don't know if you can see in the background

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a white shirt hanging on that doorknob. Yeah, that's my um  That's my twig shirt  So I finally figured out the reason I get pink all the time is because if I wear all black and everything's black  It doesn't know what to do with my face and hair the camera  So when I wear a white shirt, look at this. I'm I'm kind of like normal. Yeah, you look human

They are known for ron howard teaching directing  Each class is shot with cinematic production quality and offers on-demand lessons loaded with exclusive content  That you're only going to find this at masterclass. So you go on there  It's it's almost like I almost compare it to like, uh the criterion collection when if you ever watched a movie  A criterion collection movie and you turned on kind of the director's commentary and you got this really inside  Detailed background scoop or idea of what it was like to create the movie  It's that but that mixed with like a documentary because they film these these interviews and these courses. They're full-on courses  Step-by-step courses and they're just shot so well, they're beautiful  They sound great and it's almost like you're there with that person as they're teaching you what they are so known for  Um, just really great stuff.

They're adding new classes all the time  So they've got a whole roster of new classes, uh that they plan on adding in the future  Uh, and you know, this isn't just for someone who's looking for skills like for me music production  I'm going to find actual usable skills from the dead mouse and the armin van buuren  Walkthroughs that I can use on my own productions  But maybe you just enjoy watching professionals in their in their scenario in the in their perfect situation  Or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, a little bit. I think but I think that that tweet made me made me potentially happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, potentially happy. What do you want to tell about it? Hiroshi lockheimer  On twitter. He said uh, this is a couple of days ago  I was away on a business trip for a few days came back  To a desk with a stack of new devices to test out. Sorry. I didn't take any pics and don't ama don't ask me anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll humble brag there. I think so I went in and left a reply saying  I hope that one of those is a pixel book and then today I went back in and said now that i'm thinking about it  I hope you find time to just smash a little phi sim into that pixel book

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be nice  That is uh, that that would definitely be a nice addition. Hey, you're not happy. You're not far off ev leaks  A week ago said and noted noted leaker on twitter or leaks leak source  Uh evan blast on twitter said add to this fall hardware lineup a second generation pixel book  With smaller bezels scheduled to ship before the end of the year  Let's just hope that they have that uh that lte baked in there for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love I do too. So you you're elegant and I got into a macho off  He's thinking though. It's the exact opposite of macho as to who loves uh chromebooks more  I didn't I didn't do this. I didn't send it to him but somebody emailed me afterwards  Uh sent me things that mike had said snotty about and dismissive about chromebooks  Oh in the years ago, okay. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, but I mean for what he's doing the digital nomad stuff like the pixel book is like the perfect device

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just insisted that I love them more sooner. All right. Yeah, I was there before you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was the hipster the original hipster chromebook lover right there a pixel book lover

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well the thing is now I see all these stories about oh wow  You could just use a chromebook and they're wonderful and I you know, I've been there for three years  I've been there and the price by the way on even though obviously this means they're gonna replace it  But the price on the current pixel book now on amazon is down at a record low

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it dropped. Uh, I know I put that in here. I'm not seeing it. Um here  Oh, it's all the way up there. So yeah, so seven hundred fifty dollars for the i5 8 gig 128  Gig storage model. I actually think that's what I have. I got I got the lowest entry  Yeah, I did too, which is which is huge. It's fine  I have no problems at that at that level. But yeah seven hundred fifty dollars  which um  I feel like for the for the build quality and all that it's uh, yeah, that's a great price  I don't think it's ever been that low  And then oh by the way related to the the pixel book I had spent I just reviewed last weekend on the new screensavers  The acer chromebook tab 10, which is the first  chrome  Notebook form factor so no keyboard whatsoever  And oh and that's 330. So that's a different type of device entirely. It's I don't know that I  Yeah, it's and it's really geared for the education market. In fact, initially it wasn't even for sale  You can only get it k through 12  Uh with schools that were supporting chrome and that sort of stuff now they've opened it up so you can buy it for 330  Dollars. I mean, it's it's a tablet running chrome os

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Obviously it runs android where amazon stuff doesn't run but it has problems  What's that involving cr? Anything involving crm?  As an amazon app does not run. Well, netflix does not run well drm  Drm. Oh drm. Thank you. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I every time you guys talk about chromebooks. I'm like man a lot of people like these things  So then I feel bad that i'm not kevin guys kevin could be just like diving right in here and telling you everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We should we should we should do a um  Do a duo call with kevin on these things. Yeah, if only we could connect

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If only we could connect the single duo call  I don't I have not played around with that one yet  I will say that in my in my experience with this one chrome os on a tablet with no connected keyboard  Was for me kind of a nightmare  Um, yeah anytime you want to type anything on the screen  The full screen keyboard takes up two-thirds of the screen leaving with you leaving you with this little sliver  of anything to work inside and  Just when you're talking productivity it just man talk about slowing you down way slower than any anything else

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think the la la public schools made a big mistake to my mind when they went with  um apple tablets versus chromebooks  So the you know, they went with no keyboard in the schools. It was a disaster  And I think you get from the earliest age kids need keyboards as an entry. Yeah, that's what i'll be using. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're for content creation  As opposed to content consumption and kids  You really want them creating some content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I couldn't imagine like typing out a thesis, you know on a touch screen  I mean, obviously you're probably not going to do that  But when you introduce that as the form factor as the baseline minimum, it just sets you up for failure  I think in the worst possible way  Personally, but we don't have to talk about chromebooks. I know stacy. You're probably bored. Are you more?  Are you more excited about the the pixel 3 xl and the fact that it might have wireless charging

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you could put that charging tray on your night tape  It doesn't have to be far away. It could be on your nightstand. Yes  The idea is that you just have instead of having to like plug things in you could just set it on something

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That'll be included in the show that  Will be included in the show notes  As well  Let me think here. What else do we got?  Well, uh, we're probably also going to see not that it really matters to very many people anymore a updated daydream  Viewer at the event i'm guessing because apparently the headset is now 70 off  That began today. So they're blowing out the daydream view. It's 30 bucks now at verizon  The description lists  the item as eol  Skew so end of life  So I only imagine that a new daydream viewer is around the corner  Using a phone though as opposed i'm guessing. I mean they have the standalone one by  Is it lenovo?  I believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And of course, it's oculus instead. Yeah, the oculus go  So dr android, what are you thinking of this pixel watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, dr android, I like that  Uh  I I mean i'm having a hard time getting excited about watch anymore  I suppose that the wear os thing kind of passed me by at this point  But i'm really surprised that at the up until now google hasn't done their own  Pixel watch of sorts and we've been hearing about rumors that it might happen for quite a while a few months back evlix again tweeted  Uh that there would be an unveiling at this event also updated pixel 2  buds or pixel buds generation 2  But now we're hearing that there's going to be possibly three different versions of the of the watch the pixel watch  Some of those versions with heart rate sensor  All using a new version of the snapdragon wear  3100 system on a chip and this has kind of been in the works for a while by qualcomm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then of course always on do you think do you think the watch needs its own sim card his own phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um  I do  You do I I could never figure out if I really needed it or not because I always have my phone on me  Anyways, but why why do you need one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I would need it because I don't carry my phone all the time  So I like to go running or walking and doing things with how do you do that?  How do you know jeff? I I look again this this fomo thing. I'm like, eh  so  But I like to have my music for example, and I like to  You know this way I don't actually have to worry about missing out or I need directions  So those kind of things being in my phone are actually really useful  Kevin has called me from his apple watch which I don't really recommend but you know, it sounds fine  And I I don't know I think  For depending on the price obviously, but if it's a reasonable price, I love having data in my watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I mean no matter what it's a it's a monthly data fee that you have to kind of factor in  So I guess you just have to ask yourself like does this thing this you this this piece of technology that I wear on my wrist  Is it worth a monthly fee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just don't know if it is gonna fly if you can get I mean fly at 10 bucks a month is fly data only  Fly data only is you don't pay in the 30 bucks a month for that. Are you I don't think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And is that is that on cellular?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, the five you get a five data only sim right, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so something like that for 10 bucks a month. I don't know. Is it 10 bucks a month worthwhile?  probably  is it  I mean I spend hours without my phone plus I wander around my house without my phone  Well, I don't have pockets women's women's clothing doesn't have pockets  And phones are freaking huge  So even when I do have pockets then I have this heavy big old ucky phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I see somebody now I used to do this in the trio days used to have the old belt clip  Oh, yeah  I yeah, I see that now and I think how dorky can you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But like if you have it in your jacket pocket, I hate this my husband  It drives me nuts. It ruins the line of his suits and he's just like I don't care but i'm just like  Sure  And if you're wearing jeans and you shove it in your back pocket that is prime spot for your phone to go into the toilet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you pull down it's happened to me. It's happened to everyone. I mean, come on. That's why you need a waterproof phone

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even then

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm like and lysol wipes. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, just waterproof. That's that's all you need. No  um, I uh, I just looked up the  uh  What is the data only on project phi? I guess I didn't realize that's no additional monthly cost  You just get the sim and it ties into your normal it ties in for the same data  That's what i'm seeing here cost no monthly cost just pay for the data. I want this in my devices  Oh, yes, this high tech hdmi connection. We have here no monthly cost just pay for the data you use at the usual 10 gigabyte

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, well, but is that a separate 10 a month or is it included in your own?  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At the just pay for the data you use at the usual 10 gig rate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you have two devices, are you paying 10 a month?  10 a gig or does it combine in the same gigs?  It's a good question

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the gigs are different jeff all the gigs are I would think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, I love my nexus 7 dearly. I missed that which also fit in my back pocket by the way  But I knew it was there before I started sitting down  um  And and it had a sim in it. It was a beautiful thing  I loved it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I I don't know if i'd pay extra for a sim in my watch  But hey if I was on well, I am on project phi and if I had a watch and I could just  Do a data only sim and it would tie into my normal data usage. Sure. Yeah. Hell I'd add me up. Why not?  No extra fee, but i'll pay for the data that it uses. Why not?  Um, so yeah, i'll be curious to see uh on that regard  What else are we missing here? I know that there's a bunch of other stuff in here. Is there anything you guys are? Oh, um,  Google cleaning up the play store

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's happening. Okay. I saw that I was not like that apple did that a while ago. Yeah, it didn't seem  It seemed really reasonable. Yeah, absolutely. Nothing jumped out of me like oh my god, what are they doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually they're doing a number of things too like the cryptocurrency ban  The cryptocurrency mining apps from the play store are now banned  That seemed to get the majority of the news, which is what apple did very recently  They also kind of blocked this and google's done this in a number of different ways  With chrome extensions and its web store and all that kind of stuff  So they're basically saying if you're managing with an app cryptocurrency mining in the cloud, that's okay  But on device it's not okay  But they also are prohibiting a bunch of other  app  App behaviors, let's say in this post repetitive apps  so apps that have a very similar user experience or very or highly similar content to other apps so  If there are multiples that offer that are basically the same those are no longer allowed apps based on templates apps where the  Singular purpose is serving ads and I don't know if you've ever seen an app where it's like  An ad appears after every single flippin thing you do inside of it  And that app is probably not you know, not for anything other than generating revenue for you know  Based on the ads that are being served to you  Uh apps that appeal to children but contain adult themes apps that facilitate the sales of firearms and explosives or  Instruct on the creation of them and then finally apps that intentionally mislead users which wait a minute  That wasn't a rule before but okay  Good that it is now I suppose  So cleaning things up in the play store. I mean at this point the play store is just so filled  You got to clean it up a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't believe we've gone through so much stuff. Here's what here's the story of talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's up  New york city kicking spectrum formerly known as time Warner cable out. I think it's a big deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that is a big deal and  um, I what I think is super ironic because  Way back in the day when the okay, so they're gonna do there because my question was well, holy cow  How are they going to do that and they want to revoke its franchise?  Agreement and the irony here is when the cable guys wanted to launch  Um  Broadband and voice services they appealed they used to have to get their franchise  agreements at each municipality  And they were like god, that's such a pain for these new services. We want to launch so  Instead so we can compete better with the telcos. Let's just get it statewide  and so they managed to push that through in a lot of different locations including new york and texas and now  new york has this massive stick they can just pummel them with and be like  You did not meet your your standards. You did not  Treat rural people correctly. You did not deploy what you said you were going to deploy so  No more franchise for you  I have to assume that they're gonna fight this. Oh, they are but but let's say they did

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Get forced out. They sell the infrastructure to another comer. Is there a price? How does that work any idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they said this they said that they had 60 days  to  Find a another comer to come in because the other thing is  And they would have they did say that they would have to sell some of their infrastructure  now, this is where the lawsuits get really crazy because I mean  Can you really force a cable company to sell off their infrastructure?  Because I mean on one hand you're like new york has said it's illegal for you to sell services here. So  It's the opposite of imminent domain, I guess  Yeah, I don't I don't really know yeah, this is kind of unprecedented  But I was amazed because  The telcos and the cable companies have promised this stuff for years  They've done this for decades and no one they may get a fine or two  But for the most part we just let it lie. We're like, oh yeah screw those rural people. They didn't get what they wanted  That's why they have such crap broadband  so  Yay for new york for doing this

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Especially since our current  cudgel over over the  Other companies I gotta say this I have had huge problems on the show over the years with the verizon mobile  My verizon fios is god bless amazing. We had an outage recently for a few hours first time I can remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There it's great service fiber, but not everyone can get files and verizon said you know what I know we're going to stop deploying this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know it's it's tragic because it's some very good service

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well apparently  Not good enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I always dread that they're gonna sell it to somebody like  charter, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean in some ways  Broadband has become basic infrastructure like electricity and water and  There there are arguments that you know, maybe more of it should be municipally owned  I don't know if that's where we should go with that, but we should have  I don't know that we'd never mind too. I'm not gonna get into this  Too late  Stacey gets sad to see about our lack of competitive broadband. I am a communist. I I mean I'm not but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We want to talk about facial recognition  And how the aclu  used amazon's  recognition  recognition with a k recognition with a k  Recognition with a k and you know, we're trying to kind of make a point I imagine by running  uh  They what did they run here?  Just a number of you know, the members of congress, I think all members of congress  Through the system to see if it matched up if it paired up through the facial recognition  algorithm  Uh with people who you know may have been arrested for a crime at some point it  Erroneously identified 28 members of congress through the system at an 80 percent  of  Match rate if I remember correctly  So  There you have that the software was set at 80 80 confidence setting apparently that's the default  And amazon said after the fact well, we we recommend 95 percent because at 80 percent more matches happen than than should  um  but they don't necessarily like the default setting is 80 percent and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The reason it's 80 percent though is because you have the same people if you're dealing with like security photos  For example, you're going to have crappier photography. You're not going to have a straight-on image of someone. So that's the reason they suggested  So it's it's a chance to get more images of the same person like if you're trying to match somebody in a crappy photo  i'm just  I'm not saying that this is but there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can play it both ways. Yeah for sure. No, and that's a really interesting. Um  Perspective on that. I hadn't I hadn't heard or read about that. So that's a good point  um  However, you know, but at the same time 28  28 matchups  To those with mugshots proves at least a certain point, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it does I mean and they they talk about how cheap it is which I think we should have less than the mugshots the fact that you can take  25,000 mugshots train something run it through and then run the database of  Congress whatever and it only cost you 12.33  Wow, that to me is like holy cow  Yeah, so imagine taking all the images  All the images like imagine you're a stalker or something creepy  Um, those are the kind of things that I worry about  Less. I mean, yes, they do worry about racial bias. That's not true. I do worry about that but  This makes this technology super accessible in ways that I don't think we're quite aware. I mean you could build an app that  scans public parks  Uh for your employees who say they're out sick if you wanted to if you were that kind of employer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting to say the least  um  All right  I think unless there is something that I am missing. I mean the only thing that we didn't talk about was  free guacamole fail  At chipotle because I know you guys like to talk about chipotle. What was the free guacamole fail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, you could get free guacamole if you ordered online, I think it wasn't then of course it crashed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's like the amazon free echo spot. That was not  Chipotle just made a bunch of people sick in ohio

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sad why does this keep happening to chipotle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they they like those fresh ingredients and let me tell you when you have fresh ingredients you got to clean them real well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No kidding. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Parasites, I like me some chipotle. I don't like me some parasites

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What doesn't kill you makes you stronger? That's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um nine to five google is happy because this is the five year anniversary of what they call google's first hardware win  the chromecast  First hardware win, I guess so I was thinking about that. That's one. I thought we discussed that I um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When did the nexus come out?  Does that not a win?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's well, that's the question was that a win and was that google specifically, you know chromecast was google created hardware nexus was always  That's true. Yeah, it's a different company

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A real elegance from the beginning it wasn't you know, it wasn't a wait for the version three  They figured this out. It was it was useful and fun from from the very beginning. So congratulations  mazal to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chromecast that was it and it's evolved over the years, you know now you can do 4k hdr with the with the latest one  They you know initially it was like a stick  And then they went with the kind of floppy kind of hang behind the tv model odd places  Yeah, so it could fit wherever you wanted it to go now. It's baked into um android tv that no one has  and uh  You know and also also by the way, one of my favorite things was uh chromecast audio which now I don't need because  That's basically what I you know  One of the many things that we use our google homes for for kind of simultaneously playing music in different rooms before google home  You would do that with chromecast audio and have that hooked up to your stereo system  so  Yeah  Good good lineup of hardware. I think I think that really has worked with google over the years and it passed the parent test  When I went home to see my parents a couple of years ago  I brought a chromecast that I had and I connected to their tv and I showed my mom on her ipad  I'm like when you want to watch netflix, which I also signed her up for at that same trip  I said you push this button on the tablet and it sends it just make sure you're on the right input on your tv  And you know two days later. I called to check in i'm like, how does that work? And she's like it works great

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So wow, that was easy ever happened with mine. That was simple. I'd get the call. What did you do to ruin the tv?  I can't watch fox news. Oh, no, I expected that I did it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I expected it to not be easy and it worked although I like I like like your uh, I like your subtle direction there  I  Figure a way around it. Cool. Happy birthday chromecast

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey, what do you got?  Okay  Um because I am traveling I do not have a fun gadget to show you but I did promise you guys a review  Of a gadget that I showed a couple weeks ago, which was the osram lightify  outdoor rgbs  um, uh lights  and  They're relevant because philips hugh is actually implementing or offering some new outdoor lights. So  These were 60 bucks and they I think they extended about 10 feet and they produce a lot of light you guys  Um, they don't do a true white because it's just rgb  but the colors they do produce are beautiful and they go I have a  It's two stories at that part of my house so a two-story house and you can see it all the way up the side of the house  Um, and it lights the bushes up really well there. Um  so the one sad thing that I didn't like about these lights was that  What was it? Oh, you can't individually change the color on each light  So there are nine lights and they they're going to be blue. They're all nine could be blue  So but if you're in the market for outdoor lights, these are quite nice nice nice thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh  and then I uh  So i've complained about this recently on twitter because I feel like I feel like robo calls and spam calls to my  My cell phone have like gotten out of hand like it's crazy. I get I get multiples in a single day  I wasn't sure if it happened when I switched over to project five  It was a a symptom of that, but i'm pretty sure it's just everybody's getting these right now  And you know, there's a number of things that you can do actually this this weekend on the new screensavers  I cover a bunch of different things that you can try to do to help  But one thing I wanted to point out because I feel like somewhere in the news cycle  This really went under the radar. I I didn't find out about it until a few weeks later  But if you go into the google, uh phone  App just the standard google phone app and you go into your settings  There is a there's an area in the settings that's caller id and spam. You may remember a year ago  They added functionality that would pop up like a big red banner when a spam call comes  It says suspected spam caller and it's like flashing red  And so you of course never answer it because like why are you going to pick that up?  Obviously, you know what's on the other side google's telling you well  They added a new feature to that if you go into the settings that is filter spam calls and what that does  Is on that goes. Yeah instead of seeing that red banner now when it identifies it with the red banner  It's not even going to send it to your phone. You won't get a call anymore  It's going to go directly to your voicemail. And so it's one last thing you have to worry about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a second because I am currently in my phone app  Show oh show me I was trying to find it because i'm not seeing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The option to do this. Oh is your phone app updated go back jason to show where you got to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't have that. Okay, so  Interesting these days stacy. I have my uh  Pixel 2 pixel 2 yes, and is it up to date?  It is up to date  that's bizarre  Huh? I'll see  I wonder why it's a straight up phone app, right? Yeah, default. Yeah. Yeah, just making sure. Yeah, it's the straight  Yeah, if I if I hit that I just get uninstall updates  Instead that's so weird  So weird and if I go to advanced I can go to modify system settings, but that is not what it sounds like the same app

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that is it are you in phone or contacts or  Oh, oh there we go. Okay, so show  Oh, so no just go just go into the phone app don't go into the settings, uh into your setting like your apologies  Yeah, so just go into the phone app overflow menu settings from within the phone app there we go

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, I don't feel so done. I got one right that you didn't stacy if you made fun of me the first half hour of the show  one to one  Awesome, and then she just did that. I feel better guys are tied  Yeah, so now now you won't get those red red things anymore calls that aren't identified as spam. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they just go right to voicemail and of course you won't get a voicemail because they'll be like, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The voicemail. Well, that would be the worst if they filled it. Oh my gosh. I hate people who leave voicemails  I currently have two voicemails and I loathe both people who put them in there. Yeah, I know
