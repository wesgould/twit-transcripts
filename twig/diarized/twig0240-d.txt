The show where we cover not just Google, but the cloud, the Twitter, the Facebook, all  of that stuff.  The South By.  Her basement, her mother's basement, as all good bloggers do, Gina Trapani.  Nice PJs, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello.  Oh, you know, I actually do have pajama bottoms on.  This is a legitimate shirt, but I actually do have pajama bottoms on because, you know,  that's what you do when you're only the top half is only on TV.  I work from home today.  Okay, look, I'm just, I'm just embracing the stereotype here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got to know, are they, are they Mickey Mouse pajama bottoms?  Are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh no, they're just sprayed up plaid.  I, they're pretty, yeah.  They're delicious.  I can't believe I told you guys this.  The whole point was that they were off camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That you couldn't see them.  There's something, there's something about people who aren't wearing pants.  They feel compelled to tell the world.  I don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  To be clear, I am wearing pants.  They're just pajama pants.  Yeah, well.  Just so there's no confusion here about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina is in charge of Think Up and thinkup.com.  She's also the author of To Do Text and a regular host on All About Android every Tuesday  right here on this NetWalk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At 5 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern.  Thank you for being here, Gina.  Great to be here.  Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at City University of New York.  I'm wearing pants.  He is wearing pants.  He's also the author of What Would Google Do in His Latest Public Parts and blogs at  buzzmachine.com.  25 years old today.  Well, you know, I think that's miscounting because it was the twinkle in Tim Berners-Lee's  eye on March 12th, 25 years ago.  It took him another year before the World Wide Web existed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it was not until October 1994 that the commercial browser was released.  Right.  Still, let's give Sir Tim his birthday greetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, if you go to google.com, you'll see a little birthday cake with the numbers  Because Josh Windish was born today, but actually it's Happy 25th Birthday World Wide Web.  And he links to a guest post on the Google blog by Sir Tim Berners-Lee.  He distributed a proposal.  And this is the original proposal.  Information management.  This, my friends, is a diagram describing the World Wide Web.  Okay.  Now you know what happened.  This led to a bunch of people in their jammies in their mother's basement making a living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This, I mean, that, you know, when I first saw it, I thought, oh, and, you know, to think  what amazing things can happen from a sketch.  But that's actually a computer generated flow chart.  He puts them working on that at the time.  At the time that was a pretty avant-garde, you know, advanced Google document.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it isn't exactly what the web became.  He says this proposal concerns the management of general information about accelerators.  He's at CERN at the time in Geneva, which is the nuclear particle accelerator, and experiments  at CERN.  It discusses the problems of loss of information about complex evolving systems and derives  a solution based on a distributed hypertext system.  So the concept of hypertext is not new.  In fact, it was first described by Ted, what's his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, uh, the memex guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you know, chat room.  Ted Nelson.  Thank you.  Ted Nelson.  I think you, thank you.  I think it was the first to describe hypertext.  So and clearly from this memo that Tim Berners-Lee put out, that was a term that meant some sense  to somebody.  The idea of a linked information system.  Did he call it the World Wide Web here?  Yeah, he said he used the word web.  The actual observed working structure of the organization is a multiply connected web,  he put that in quotes, whose interconnections evolved with time.  So it wasn't the World Wide Web until later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He, we're going to talk about this in a second, but in his AMA today, Sir Tim said that when  asked whether there are other names for the web, he listed three.  Mine of information, the information mine, and the mesh.  But he decided web was best.  I think web's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's good.  And web led to a lot of analogies like spidering the web as you crawl the web.  So I love Reddit ask me anythings because they surface the best questions because they  get upvoted.  The number one question, what was one of the things you never thought the internet would  be used for, but actually has become one of the main reasons people use the internet.  Sir Tim Berners-Lee says kittens.  Kittens.  Isn't that the best?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are a couple possibilities for that response.  I like that he chose kittens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kittens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He later says, was asked if he put up a picture of his cat.  I mean, he said, cat no, dog yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think in the not too distant future, we'll look back and think ourselves lucky  to have witnessed a neutral, free and uncensored worldwide web?  He responds, I think it's up to us.  I'm not guessing.  I'm hoping.  Yes, I can imagine to all that all too easily.  If ordinary web users are not sufficiently aware of threats and get involved, and if  necessary, take to the streets like for SOPA and PIPA and ACTA on balance.  I'm optimistic.  But he's right.  We have to we it's up to us to preserve the free and open Internet.  Amen.  Tim is an amazing fellow, very unassuming.  You know, he got knighted for this, but he doesn't he doesn't act as if, oh, yeah, I  invented it. Which web browser do you use?  Don't know, says Java Beans, but his GitHub account says he commits to some Firefox  plugins. So that's pretty impressive.  He's a Firefox committer.  And then I'm Soral says, dude, it's Tim Berners-Lee.  He doesn't need a browser. He doesn't even need a computer.  He just puffs the end of an Ethernet cable like a hookah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, that's something that needs to be photoshopped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I can see him sitting on a mushroom.  Edward Snowden, hero or villain?  Tim writes, because he had no other alternative, engaged as a journalist with a journalist  to be careful of how he was released and provide an important net overall benefit to the  world. I think he should be protected and we should have ways of protecting people like  him because we can try to design perfect systems of government and they will never be  perfect. And when they fail, then the whistleblower may be all that saves society.  Right on.  Excellent answer. Excellent.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which Glenn Greenwald immediately retweeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good. So Tim Berners-Lee, I think deserves the honor.  Today's the day his eye twinkled.  But the World Wide Web was born actually more than a year later after he first wrote about  it. And we're all celebrating.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was asked whether the 404 came from the fact that he was in room 404 where he did  this. He just said, no, that's nonsense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where did those error numbers come from?  I don't know.  He probably didn't write those.  Probably the folks who did Apache, I would guess, wrote those error messages.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's the HTTP spec, right?  So, you know.  Oh, is it the spec? OK.  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the HTTP protocol spec, all those error numbers, 401, 500, 503, those  are all just part of the protocol.  I'm sure that a lot of people at Apache were probably involved, but it was probably a  different standards organization that defined that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. The IETF or the W3C, which Tim now works at, the World Wide Web Consortium, I  believe. Does he not?  And MIT.  And MIT? Really?  What does he do over there?  He teaches.  He teaches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's cool.  Yeah. In fact, I'm working with a company called Infinite Analytics that came out of  his class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, that's neat.  It is neat.  He did write the first HTTP server.  That's right. So he had to in order on a NextCube.  On a Next?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah. Well, you know, it was it was the Next was kind of designed to make it easy to  write scientific software and other software.  So.  I'm looking at all the Summer of Code open for application.  I'm looking at all our stories.  The 10th Summer of Code.  This is you've been involved in the Summer of Code, Gina.  Tell us about it.  I have. And I'm really excited.  ThinkUp got accepted as a mentoring organization this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a Google Summer of Code, which is their 10th year.  This is a program that Google runs to support open source projects.  So what happens is open source organizations like ThinkUp or like Firefox or Apache or  WordCop, they're open source.  They all apply to be mentoring organizations.  And then the ones that get accepted, then they open up an application project period  for students who want to get experience contributing to open source, but and who also can  earn a stipend from Google.  So students apply and then they get paired up with mentors in the mentoring organization.  So I'm going to mentor a student this summer.  And we've done it two other summers.  I've mentored students in the past.  And if the student passes, they propose a project.  And if they get a passing grade from the mentor, the student earns, I think it's a five thousand  dollar stipend for the summer.  This is a summer job basically working remotely on an open source project.  So you get incredible experience.  You make some money. The mentor gets a little stipend.  I think it's like five hundred bucks or whatever.  And Google organizes this and they fund this.  And it's an amazing program.  And Google, I think, really kind of uses this program to get students to get a good  job.  And Google, I think, really kind of uses this program to recruit developers as well,  because at least a couple of students who have been through GSOC, even through ThinkUp  have gone on to at least interviews at Google, if not jobs.  And one of my students actually got a job at Facebook.  Wow.  Graduated as well.  So, yeah, it's a really it's a pretty prestigious thing.  And in fact, Google's or sorry, ThinkUp's developer mailing list is just overrun with  students right now, kind of clamoring to put in their project proposals and asking questions.  It's a great organization. It's great for Google.  It's great for students.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm really excited about it.  Is it more I mean, do you really get a lot out of it or is it more a mitzvah to the to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the world of the future?  I love it. I love mentoring new students.  I mean, you know, one of my things is like, I really want to bring young people into  contributing to open source.  I feel like open source is still really hard to penetrate.  I think that there's a certain kind of developer, you know, the neck beard that kind of, you  know, find their way in.  I think there are a lot of young people who are to feel intimidated or really don't know  how to get in there.  So when you get paired up with a mentor, you have some kind of hold in your hand and showing  you the ropes and and working with you one on one.  I think that that's that's the thing that gets someone to to do this kind of thing.  That's how it happened for me.  So I really love it because we think of gets often long time contributors, you know,  students stick around.  We actually wound up hiring a student who we mentored last summer to do contract work  for Think Up as we prepare to open up sign up.  So it creates jobs, it creates relationships, it makes connections.  And and I really like helping students, particularly students who maybe wouldn't have gotten  into open source on their own kind of non-usual suspects, particularly young women.  For me, you know, just kind of like because I like the idea of bringing more women into  open source sorely needed.  So it's great. Everybody gets something out of it.  It's a lot of work. It's a lot of hours, but it's totally worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You obviously would need to be a computer science student or know how to code anyway,  right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I think I mean, it depends on the on the project and on the, you know, on the  project proposal.  We I mean, I think if we try to make it as general as possible, you know, if you have  an interest in learning how to code and you know, you have a really great product idea.  I mean, if you're a great designer, if you're a great copywriter, you could rewrite a  documentation.  So it could be that it could be technically writing.  It could be technically right.  Yeah, I mean, whatever the contribution is, as long as it moves the project forward.  And I really, you know, I've been trying to talk about this on the show.  I've been trying to really get out of that developer only mindset.  You know, I think that product development and technical development, you know, making  technical products isn't just about writing code.  I think it's also about writing copy and writing documentation and and user experience  and design. And I really want to encourage that as well.  I don't think that and a lot of these projects are extremely technical, but think up as a  consumer product.  It's very much user experience focused.  I mean, the code certainly runs it, but I don't think that that's necessarily the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  one of the skills that you need.  Where are you having problems finding any any skills?  Just as an educator, I'm asking.  So, you know, what do we train people to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, we tend to this program in particular tends to attract students who are  extremely technical and who are comps, I majors.  That makes a lot of sense, right?  And, you know, we think of particularly and I think this is true of most consumer  products. You need somebody who can write and can code and has a very good sense of  user experience. Right.  So and that's rare.  That's rare to find that combination.  So, you know, and we think of particularly, I mean, think of it as about social  insight. So we're looking for people who blog, who tweet, who do Facebook, who use  these social tools, have, you know, who are very experienced, who understand the  different cultures of these different communities.  I mean, we had a student build a YouTube plugin, for example, for us last summer.  And I'm not that active on YouTube.  I don't really know the culture of the comments in YouTube or what is liking  versus favoriting versus sharing mean.  Right. So we're looking for someone who is really embedded in that community and who  wants those insights and, you know, kind of wants to scratch the scratch their own

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  itch. So understanding that community is itself a skill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, for us, definitely.  I mean, for us, because we're about social insights, about about cultures and  communities, we do want people who understand those.  But I think every every project has different different needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the summer of code, go to Google dot com slash G.S.O.C., I guess.  Yeah, Google summer.  Look, if you can't find it, you probably should.  Why? Yeah, either. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. The student applications are open, I think, until like March 21st.  So if you're looking for a summer job and you're a qualifying student and, you  know, in a qualifying program, you should definitely apply.  And can you a mentor in jammies or is that not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All of my mentees have been in different countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yes, I was often in my pajamas while I was mentoring.  But you can't get down with technology in your hand.  That's what the purple one tells us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Prince. He doesn't.  He doesn't like emasculating, too.  It's I mean, you can't get down and you're emasculated.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, my co-founder, O'Neill Dash, he's a huge, huge, huge, huge, huge

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  fan. And I shared this link with him earlier and I said, cue the Jeff Jarvis  like rant about how technophobes are destroying culture.  And he was just like, oh, he's like, he's always been on this thing about, you  know, not taking photos at shows and whatever.  So but I thought it was funny because, you know, it's Prince.  Prince does not like technology.  Remember, he briefly sued his own fans for posting on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He tells people at the end of the day, he's like, oh, I'm going to be a  fan.  And he's saying, put your phone down.  You can't get down with technology in your hand.  But you know, he's he's right.  I just think he's a he's a little bit of a Luddite.  This is the guy who put out CD-ROMs 20 years ago.  Right.  Tell us what to think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  When I asked last year whether he owned an iPhone, he replied, hell no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the guy who did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the guy who did.  Well, the guy who did.  Well, the guy who did.  Well, the guy who did.  He replied, hell no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, hell no.  Hell no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, hell no.  But he has people who phone for him.  I bet you many in his entourage have an iPhone.  He did use a phone, apparently, to help on our senior hall, help a fan break up.  Did you see this?  I didn't. I didn't see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't see it.  I didn't see this.  He used a smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, let's see.  Things you might like Prince to solve.  And there's a gentleman who told my producer a story.  Prince always looks like a Prince impersonator to me.  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This is Steven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He just doesn't look like he really is there.  Anyway, this guy asks Prince.  He doesn't look like he's looking at you.  Well, big glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay, Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  We don't have to watch this.  It apparently helps Steve break up with his girlfriend.  Google discloses a pathetic $9.5 million in bonuses.  Yeah.  Okay.  Now, Eric Schmidt got $6 million all by himself.  The chief financial officer, Patrick Pichette, $3 million in a yearly bonus.  Chief business officer, Nikesh Arora, $3.5 million bonus.  Chief legal officer, David Drummond, $3 million bonus.  That's down a little bit.  These will all be paid in a couple of days, so get ready, Silicon Valley, for a big, big party.  No cash bonuses for Larry or Sergey.  They didn't get the cash bonuses last year, but I think when you're the owners, you don't get...  I don't bonus myself at the end of the year.  $100 million in restricted stock, though, to Eric Schmidt, along with his $6 million bonus.  See, that kind of tells you a little bit more.  In recognition of his contributions to Google's performance in fiscal year 2013.  That's just purient interest.  People want to know how much money they make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, on one hand, it's like, a $3 million bonus, it changed my life.  On the other hand, it's not very much for Google.  And actually, it's down.  Those $3 million bonuses were down, like, three, three last year.  Some are up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some are down.  Some people...  The bonuses are awarded based on merit, on contribution.  Now, I think there's some interesting stuff going on with the wearable technology here.  Some interesting comments.  Google's head of Android Chrome and apps at South by Southwest talked about wearable tech  and implied really what Google was going to do is make an SDK or some sort of low-level,  maybe an operating system for people who make wearable tech.  And I wonder, he said, in two weeks, we're launching the first developer SDK for Android wearables.  They will lay out the vision for developers and how we see this market working.  When we think of wearables, we think of it as a platform.  We see a world of sensors.  Sensors can be small and powerful.  There are a lot of information that can be useful.  We want to build the right APIs for this world of sensors.  I wonder if Google isn't thinking of Glass as more of a...  And I've said this before, a learning experience and an actual product.  And that ultimately, they don't want to make all the...  They want others to make the products, just as they want others to make Android phones.  And if Google's on them, then they will be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If Android is the OS of wearables and sensors, then that's an enviable position, which also,  to me, informs the interesting decision that Samsung made that their new watches are not Android.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, they're running tides in.  Because they were saying that Android's too slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if you companies have the resources of Samsung to develop their own operating system,  most companies will want to use it off the shelf.  And that's either...  I mean, there aren't that many choices.  There's QNX, I guess.  There's a few things you could use.  But I think if Google says, look, we've got a wearable specific SDK with our Android operating system,  it's small enough and powerful enough to do what you want.  And look, people using Google Glass got all this benefit out of it.  I think that's pretty compelling.  And to me, it kind of underscores what I always thought, which is that they didn't really  intend to make Glass be a product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a learning experience.  It was a learning experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was to stimulate the market.  Maybe it was like their Nexus phones and tablets, an example of what could be done.  But I think that they don't want to be a competitor to the people who might be using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, that raises an interesting question.  Because I've always said that Glass is the Newton of whatever follows.  Right?  But Newton tried to be a product.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are there examples you can think of before Google, before the Chromebook Pixel, before  Glass, before these speculative and the original Chromebook for that matter, that were...  What's the phrase you use for how good a product could be and we want to show you the way and  actually release something to the public but not make it into a product?  I mean, Apple never did that.  Microsoft never did that.  Are there cases where companies have done that in the past that you can think of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Were they released that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they didn't make computers until very, very recently.  They made the operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but they didn't make a computer to show other computer makers how to make computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They didn't need...  Well, Intel does that.  They've created prototypes.  Intel has been making concept PCs.  Yeah, they were concepts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were like cars.  So I see what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do exactly like Glass, which is make something, release it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Learn from it with the public.  Right.  What about those suitcase-sized cell phones?  Those were commercial products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were commercial products, but everybody laughed at them, right?  I mean, right?  Or did people just laugh at retrospect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Newton, everybody laughed at Newton too, but they wanted it to be a commercial product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  The Segway was a commercial product.  Oh, it was supposed to change the world.  Right, but certainly they knew that the Segway would have to change culture in a way.  People would have to change their idea of what they thought was dorky.  Of course, it didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Segway was always intended to be a product.  It wasn't a test for a platform.  They never open-sourced it or anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's interesting to use this power that they have at Google to put out a product  that sets the bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft always did concept PCs, but you're right, they never made a PC.  But I don't think they needed to.  There were so many people making PCs that they didn't have to do the research.  The Intel, hold on a second.  Microsoft put the telemetry into Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you see behind me, there's an Intel box.  I would go get it of a tablet right there that Intel was going to release.  Intel did it a lot.  They never released it to the market, but it reached that prototype stage.  Intel worked on that product.  They put a large team on it and put a lot of money into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a big R&D expense, as somebody's saying, to do as R&D to release a product publicly.  Of course, they got people to pay $1,500 for it, so I don't think they lost money on it.  Schmucks like me.  Why do you say that?  Don't you love it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm not trying to be mean to it anymore, but no, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, so look what I got.  You didn't even notice because I've been wearing this all day.  I've been wearing it for a couple of weeks now.  This is much more offensive.  Embra?  Yeah.  It's the narrative clip.  If you go to GetNarrative.com, it was a Kickstarter project under the name of Moto.  Remember that?  I bought it as a Kickstarter project, I think, or maybe right after it went out of Kickstarter.  I just got mine.  They're going out now.  The idea is it's a clip you wear on your clothing.  It records a picture, not a great picture, a 5-megapixel picture every ... This is not  it, so let me go ahead.  See, this is ... There you go.  Every 30 seconds.  It has a capacity for 4,000 images.  It's a USB connection.  Yeah, it's expensive.  It has two-day battery life.  What you do is every day or so, you connect it up to a computer, the software downloads  the images, puts them on narrative servers.  As far as I can tell, they don't have a web-based interface.  You have to look or view your pictures on your smartphone.  There's a narrative app for iOS and for Android.  I should put it on here so you can see the pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it just make stop-motion videos of your day or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's kind of weird.  Here, I'll show you.  Well, I can show you, I think.  The problem is, of course, it's everything, so I have to be a little careful about what  I show you.  It's private.  The whole idea is this is going to be private.  Yeah, well, I got to tell you, I don't recommend it for people with a large belly because it  tips my ... I got a lot of pictures of the ceiling because it tips the ... My belly tips  the thing up just enough so that I'm really not getting pictures of anything interesting.  I'm going to try different ways of mounting.  It's loading these up now.  This is the other weird thing is that the pictures don't live on the phone.  There's a nice shot of the ceiling.  They also don't live on ... Well, here's a walk.  Here I am walking into work, I think.  That's just because of how I'm wearing it.  It seems to take pictures up, so I have to figure out a way to wear this that it's not  quite so.  Every 30 seconds ... Now, this is trimmed, so somehow they're looking for good pictures,  just like G Plus does, down to 71 photos.  If I turn off the trim, it's actually twice as many pictures, but they've taken some out.  If you put it face down or you're in a darkened room, it just stops.  It's not very compelling.  Yeah, I mean, it's not supposed to be ... It's supposed to be everything you did.  It's not like you're actively taking pictures.  You go back through it.  I guess what I should show is something like ... The first day I wore it, we had a dinner  party, so let me scroll through here, trying to avoid ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do we get photos of the Japanese toilet in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You might if I showed them to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not asking.  I'm just asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't ... It shoots straightforward.  It doesn't shoot down, so you're not going to get anything too embarrassing.  These are the first images I took.  I'll tell you, I spent a lot ... Oh, if you double tap it, as I did here, it stars it  and says this is a starred image.  It's a lot of ... You could tell.  I look at the computer screen a lot.  Here's our kitchen.  It isn't compelling.  It's not supposed to be compelling in the sense that, oh, you want to save these pictures.  It's literally a record of what you did, what you looked at all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  When I look at, for instance, Mike Elgin now used something for glass.  I don't know if you guys already know about this, but it takes snapshots ... Let me see  if I can find his post.  Takes snapshots up front with your glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not on order?  That actually even bothers me.  Right.  Right.  Because I like that on glass, I can tell people, listen, no, I'm going to split this picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this is recording all the time.  Let me see if I can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At some point, this was years ago, when Yahoo started to do some of their geolocation stuff  with Flickr, they sent me a bike with a phone.  It was a Symbian phone at that time, mounted into the handlebars.  There was Accelerometer and GPS.  When the bike was in motion, it would do this.  It would take a photo every five seconds or 10 seconds or whatever.  It would automatically upload to Flickr, and then it would map it.  You'd have this like ...  That's more interesting.  Which was really neat and really, really cool.  I enjoyed looking at them, but I found that ... I took some nice bike rides down by the  ocean in San Diego, but I found that most of the pictures were not that usable.  It was just sky or there wasn't anybody in it or whatever.  Other than jogging my memory about what a nice day that was down by the ocean, they  were low quality or whatever, I didn't see a whole lot of ... It felt like a lot of data  and a lot of processing power for something that I didn't quite get the use for.  Now, for something like mapping, Google Maps or something like that, that makes a lot of  sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you guys ever see ...  The program Mike used is called Moment Camera.  It's for the Google Glass.  I don't know what's happening with this movie, but it made a movie out of his day and took  some stuff out and took some ... 48 minutes, four seconds.  This is from Glass.  The movie's not playing, unfortunately, so there's something wrong with that.  But he took a hike.  It was beautiful images, but it's not all that interesting, frankly.  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of my students has an effort to do this for people with Alzheimer's so they can try  to recall their day.  Well, that's what this ...  It happens back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so that's where this came from.  That was Gordon Bell wrote a book about this.  His wife, Gwen Bell, had Alzheimer's.  Gordon was the guy who pioneered this.  He wore one of these cameras years ago.  It was exactly it.  It's for your personal benefit so that your life would have total recall.  That was the name of the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you guys ever see The Whale Hunt?  Jonathan Harris's The Whale Hunt?  No.  No.  Go to, if you would, thewhalehunt.org and then click on the Begin Whale Hunt.  Jonathan is a magnificent and amazing artist.  So click on Begin Whale Hunt Night.  Now, he took a picture at least once every five minutes, more often if something was  happening through Whale Hunt.  Now, on the bottom right there, Leo, you can see that there's a mosaic and next to that  there's a timeline.  If you click on that, if you go to the right and see where there's a lot of photos, that's  where stuff was happening.  Well, guess what they were getting?  They had a whale.  Yeah.  And you can see the timeline, the kind of heartbeat of this there.  He's actually taking a picture.  But this goes far beyond in terms of seeing what a day is like and getting some sense  of it.  But he's using a camera.  He's using a camera.  But it shows you what's possible with this idea of collecting a day.  And then he sorts by people, by colors, by how many photos there are.  And it's really absolutely fascinating.  So there's something to this.  But just putting that clip on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's not for...  You're right.  It doesn't have any resonance if you're not me.  On the other hand, if I'm there, I think it's early yet.  And this is very primitive.  Yes, yes, I agree.  But on the other hand, so a couple of things I would change.  I'd make it a much more wide angle image so that even though it's pointing the wrong  way, it would get the whole thing.  I don't care if it's a little fish eye because I want to see the faces.  And then I'd love to be able to have some sort of interface where I could go in each  night and say, oh, that was Mike, that was Joe, that was Sally.  We were doing this.  And now I'd have kind of a record of the day that I could go back and search for and so  forth.  And that might be of use for somebody with memory disorders or maybe 20 years from now  if I want to kind of relive my day.  I don't know.  There's some obviously there's some interest in this notion.  The main reason I bring this up is because this is so much more offensive than Google  Glass.  It is.  I was wearing it at the gym the other day and I realized, you know, I'm taking pictures  of all these people at the gym.  They don't even know it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then the gym cameras are doing the same, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And this is just for me.  I mean, I'm not sharing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I think I think it's a very simple modification of that device that makes it work that you  have a camera you're constantly wearing and you can do a motion to take a picture when  you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't I can double tap this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then I think that's if you take off the constantly on, you just have the ability to record something  and it's always right there.  Really, they're as simple as that.  You don't pull out your phone.  You don't do anything else.  That has utility.  And it also is a signal that says, you know, Starship, you know, I know I'm doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Dr. Morbius, I love it says this is dumb.  There's a reason you don't remember mundane things you're not supposed to.  Brain noise.  It's just it.  And it what you really realize how much of your day is unmemorable and doesn't deserve  to be remembered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Totally unremarkable.  I'm like, oh, remember that old apartment we lived in?  How did we have that set up?  Right.  I would love that.  I would love to walk through the apartment I lived in 15 years ago.  You know, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess we'll have that, though, because we take so many damn pictures now with our smart  phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I go back through my Google Plus image library, that that is actually a pretty good  record of all the interesting stuff I did anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, just I think it's interesting.  Yeah, 279.  I can't really recommend it because it's pretty pricey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this a before you buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I bought it.  But I'll review.  I bought it when they first when they first announced it.  So I just it was almost a year ago.  So just came the other day.  I'll definitely review it on before you buy on Tuesday.  I think it's something that has some interest.  And for some people might be.  But I really talk about privacy issues.  Yeah.  But I mean, OK, so what so what is different?  I mean, I'm seeing everything.  Well, it's not recorded for my later review.  Is that somehow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the difference is very simple.  On glass as designed, I have to hit a button or say Google, take a picture.  And so it's an explicit act that I'm choosing to do and that one assumes that I have some  measure of permission to do this and that there is some transparency that I'm doing  it.  And that's the difference.  So that same device with an obvious movement.  I'd be absolutely cool with it.  No problem with it.  Somebody would know you're taking a picture.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  On.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bianca Bosker writing about it for the Huffington Post.  The sub the title was nice to meet you.  I've already taken your picture.  And by the way, this is completely typical of the kind of picture that you get.  This is a picture of her putting on her eye makeup from below, because that's the problem.  I mean, this thing is, you know, it's not it's nobody's aiming it.  At least with glass, you know what you're kind of what you're going to get.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  There's no viewfinder and you're not.  Yeah.  You're even if you just double tap it, you don't know.  You really don't know what you're going to get.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're sure it's rumpled or if I wear this in a bar in San Francisco, is it completely  reasonable that I would get beaten up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the difference between that and glass is that it's a much less, you know, or much  less ridiculous.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think it's less I think it's less offensive because of that to people.  Like, yeah, like it's glass is like in your face.  No, but even if they know, I don't think it bothers them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think I don't think they were complaining about being recorded.  I think they were complaining about about Google attitude and capitalism.  And that's what I kind of think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But I don't know.  You tell me, are you really annoying?  Is it really annoying?  Are you really annoyed by the fact that I'm taking your picture at all?  You know, twice a minute while I talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the truth is you can you can I mean, the spies do it.  You can put a camera in a button.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  But you kind of know you're doing something bad.  Put a lapel pin on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anything you want.  Right.  Yeah, this at least is kind of a it kind of looks like a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but it doesn't say what is that?  I mean, unless you are really geeky and watch the show, you're not going to know what that  is.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You think it's a pacemaker or something.  I see a lens.  You can see the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're giving a lot of.  Yeah, I got to put a lot of thought into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  When I just looked at it, I hadn't heard of it.  I thought it was some sort of Fitbit or something.  Yeah, that's what I'm going to tell people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's just my heart rate monitor.  Don't pay no attention to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But smile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, you're on Leo's chest camera.  You're on my camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, Prince, can I get down with this on my lapel?  Huh?  I wonder if I get thrown out of Prince concert.  That's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that now makes me want to go to a Prince concert with hidden cameras and just have  fun.  Yeah, just to mess with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Troll Prince.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's troll Prince.  So I think the Android based SDK is a very for wearables is a very smart move on Google's  part.  Nobody else is doing this, right?  They want to they want to be in the Android strategy worked right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The strategy was always to have this free operating system out there.  The more it's installed, the more developers will write for it, the more customers will  have it, the more power they have.  Hallelujah.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, good, good news for you guys in Manhattan.  You know, Microsoft still doesn't have a store in Manhattan.  Apple does.  And next, Google, Google apparently searching for retail space in New York City.  I'll be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that didn't they they put some money down on a place not far from the  according to cranes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're close to signing a lease for an eight thousand square foot, which is pretty small.  Eight thousand square foot facility at 131 Green Street in Soho.  Just a block hipster.  So yeah, just a block from Apple's own Soho store, which is nice.  Soho is where there's like art galleries and walk very fancy expensive shopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually now it's become so touristy.  It's got it's basically every brand you already know.  Yeah.  Was J. Crew and H&M and and Uniqlo and all that.  It's it's it's in a few galleries and right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's where I used to go to get my Oliver people's glasses.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I'm fascinated what was happening at Best Buy.  Best Buy is handed over huge boutique space to Samsung and Microsoft, less so Google.  I know that Google I mean, I sent Best Buy to Google years ago and they were doing it  on their own or actually they were there.  I didn't send them.  They were on their own anyway.  But but there was talk about about Google space in Best Buy stores.  I think Google could go beyond just saying here's a nexus because you can see it everywhere.  I think, you know, Google can can can wow us with the Google lifestyle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's when it strikes me is that Google doesn't stores implies that they're there to sell  something. There's a counter and yeah, I don't think that's really what these things are.  When I look, I mean, they have Chromebook things in the airport and it's really more about  just, yeah, look at all the things you can do with Chromebooks and nexuses and maps and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, people go into that.  And when we're I.O., right, everybody goes into the geodesic dome to play with the map  thing and say, oh, Google's cool.  And then Google needs to do more of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'll be situated in between Tiffany and Louis Vuitton.  That tells you something, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And maybe there'll be a line around the corner of people who have been locked out of their  Gmail account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this where I get support for Gmail?  Because I'm just I forgot my password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to see if they do a genius bar support area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you know, I think it's a game show.  The Google geniuses versus the the Apple geniuses.  That'd be fun, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that movie, The Internship, would have you believe that there's a fleet of, you  know, Google customer support folks who want to help you out with  the problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I've had issues.  I mean, they're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, Google, now, what's up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This afternoon, Leo, the time is two o five p.m.  You received a notification from Clash of Clans at two p.m.  Chief, our shield is about to run out.

Transcript:  Right. It's pretty it's pretty cool.  I have to say this is the touchless stuff on the Moto X is pretty amazing.  Apparently, what is that cyanogen mod phone?  The one one on one or whatever it's called.  Yeah, they're going to I don't know if you talked about this last night  and all about Android, but they're going to  have some sort of touchless control as well in the they say.  In fact, they're asking on their website now people to vote on what this  what this phrase will be.  Because it has to be something easy to say, easy to remember, but  cyanogen mod, a net.  Yeah.

I don't know if they're going to have the  capability that the Moto X does of having listening without using a lot of power.  So the vote currently, how would you like to wake up your one plus?  One is OK. One plus is number one.  Wake up. One plus is number two.  Alakazam in third place.  I like Alakazam.  That's something you say in regular life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, because you don't want it to be like, hey, hey, because anytime you say that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  hey, one plus, hey, one plus, there was a great Google Plus post last week  that somebody listens to us in their car with their Moto X there.  And every time any one of us says Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The big the big item, new item this week is Google Drive add ons.  Think about these like Gmail labs features there.  They're add ons extensions to Google Drive, not to Chrome the browser,  but in Google Drive.  So in Google Docs and the new version of Google Sheets,  there is a new add ons menu.  This is actually rolling out right now, and I'm not seeing it in my in my.  I got it. Oh, you got it. Great, Jeff.  There's a new add ons menu.  So you click on the add ons menu, you select get add ons,  and that's where you can install add ons.  And these are basically just little new features that are developed,  some developed by Google, some developed by partners that add functionality  to Google Drive.  They've got add ons that translate the selected text, find synonyms,  create a table of contents and certain maps.  Basically, as a lot of different kinds of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So where will we see this again?  And how do we see if we have it on the top of docs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, you have to be in docs or sheets.  The new version of sheets.  There will be a menu item add ons next to tools. Right, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, up top. So how do I get in docs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The best, the best, the best, the best, the best, the best.  What are the best?  Drive has trace changes.  Oh, that's huge.  Which is the irony of having had that wave  and never added in here.  Finally, it's through an add on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. Now, these are free or some of them are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so I think that some of these services actually may be paid for,  but I believe these add ons are free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the fax one, for example, charges you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is like putting, you know, this is this is directly competitive  with Word track changes as a feature.  Microsoft Word has had for years, but was always missing for docs.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a translate right within docs.  You can add a map within docs.  You can you can you can do a conference call around a doc.  Oh, this is great. Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can have a Google Sheet, for example, of names and addresses  and select all the addresses and generate a Google map with an add on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then they enter the add ons menu so that they'll be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Right.  They'll be there as they get released.  Lifehacker did a rundown of the best add ons that are available right now.  Hello Fax is one of them that Jeff just just just mentioned.  You can send a fax directly from drive with the Fax mapping  sheets, which was just saying you can select a bunch of addresses  and make make make a map.  EasyBib, which creates bibliographies using MLA, APA or Chicago style.  You just select select your sources and citations and it makes it.  There's an Uber conference, MindMeister track changes, tons of stuff here.  So this is a really, really big change.  And, you know, I love this.  I love the way Google has this history of like providing these hosted apps,  but then creating hooks for developers to create extensions to them, much like labs.  But what I like about this is that it's it's you know, it's open, obviously,  to external developers, at least our partners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you write these in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's that's the thing, right?  That's a good question.  They they they haven't exposed as far as I know, they haven't exposed an API or an SDK.  I think they reached out to partners  and you know, now on this initial release to see what they can get.  And hopefully they are going to make it.  I would love to see, you know, a store for this kind of thing, much like,  you know, the Chrome the Chrome store, the Web Store.  But right now, it's just selective partners and Google creating these these features.  And that was always my gripe with Google with Gmail Labs is that those those lab  features only came from inside Google.  But, you know, it's it's it's complicated to make to make extensions to a hosted  a posted app like that.  So, yeah, really cool stuff.  That was the big that was a big new thing this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Biggie, this you can sign docs with HelloSign, which gives you legally  legally binding signatures in docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if they accept it.  But yeah, you can just put a signature on and because I don't  I have a fax machine somewhere and I have to plug it in and plug it into the phone.  Like I only have one phone line now.  And it's a pain in the butt.  Yeah.  So now I don't even have to fax.  I don't have to I don't print out and scan the document.  I like that stuff.  I can just sign a document online with this and it's great.  This is so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I send the fax maybe once or twice a year.  And that that kind of thing is is so so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  HelloSign is the same people as do HelloFax.  I have to add that to. Wow.  Charts. I like the pro writing aid.  It'll it'll detect plagiarism as well as errors,  grammatical mistakes in your writing, consistency check.  This is really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Avery has a mail feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, charts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I could see you could you could not only get to,  you know, this is what Microsoft Office should do.  You could get to all of the power of Microsoft Office.  But the user controls the complexity by just adding the add ons  they need and adding it to the menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now imagine, for example,  that screenwriters could do an add on for formatting scripts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Well, I'm sure they will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All kinds of things.  This is really neat.  It's very neat and it's so quiet.  They read it just came out with a whisper.  Yeah, yeah, it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It did. It's actually it's pretty it's pretty incredible.  And it was pretty quiet.  And this goes so far beyond things just like templates.  Like I'm thinking I would love to see something like,  you know, something that connected help outs, for example, to drive like,  you know, you have some of those those review.  There's one add on that lets you get approval from your team like,  yeah, this document's good to go, the check mark.  But I'm just thinking about, like, say, writing your resume,  you know, that that kind of thing, you can start off with a template,  but then to have others review it or translations, also, you know,  translation review. I mean, in so many so many situations,  you want to collaborate with trusted advisors or friends  or maybe even strangers just to get, you know, get help with something  that you're writing. And I feel like this feel like a steps toward that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Create a conference call within a document.  Here's CodePretty, Formats Codeblocks is a pretty printer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And, oh, man, this is so much like me.  I had I actually had made the connection that this was very wave like.  But this is like the widgets and add ons that you can build into a page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. So go create a doc.  They've come. You'll see a new add on menu since I first saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I saw it like, you know, yesterday. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Huge less. You can manage your add ons here, rate them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is good. The music notation, that's new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I love that. Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's cool. Mail chimp merge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you could merge your mail with chimps. Yeah.  They'll keep writing and writing and writing until you finally turn out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thousands of monkeys, 10,000 monkeys.  You can design an email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So but they didn't publish an API for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not as far as I know. And this is typical of them. Right.  I mean, it seems like that they would that this is, you know,  the initial launch is just to see what people can do.  They'll see how popular it is. And then here's a blog lab,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  no, L.A.B. NOL dot org post that says how to write an add on for Google Docs.  You use HMLC, SS and JavaScript, kind of like any traditional web app.  Open a new document inside Google Drive, choose tools, script editor.  This is the app's script ID.  And then you could paste in this code that's going to give you this kind of  a generic add on.  And then you can write the server side script.  And then so this actually looks like something you could do pretty easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I stand I stand corrected.  Sabre changes choose from Amit Argoal.  Uh huh. Yeah, it's great. Yeah.  And then you can share it with other users.  You just have to share the document and view.  That's pretty neat. OK, so this is this isn't sort of the you know,  you can't get placed next to the folks like MailChub and HelloFax.  But yeah, this is a way to script.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you could put your you could put yourself.  It says you can add yourself to the Chrome extension store.  So it sounds like. So it sounds like it's like a Chrome extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is I forgot that the apps has this script ID where you can create  scripts much like macros, you know, in Microsoft Office.  But this is based on HTML. Yeah, this is great.  I mean, it's great. So I do I stand corrected.  There is a way to do this. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With Apps Script, you can create add ons for Google Sheets, Docs or Forms,  automate your workflow, integrate with external APIs and more.  And Google does document this at developers.google.com.  So search for Apps Script and there it totally tells you how to create a Docs  add on custom menu and Google Sheets.  That's sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm glad I was wrong about that. That's good. Sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we know, yeah, how do you get in that that menu of items?  I don't know. I guess Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other thing is that the track changes is looking a little bit awkward.  So I want people to compete and hope the best track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, let's make a better one. Right.  I'm going to write a word count.  It's going to be so good.  It's going to do spaces, words, paragraphs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to love it.  I use that more than you would.  Germans assign you by characters.  Oh, the Americans by words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huh? Character. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A character. I got I got I get character assignments from Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you can see you can use fewer but larger words and still

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  know your account German that defines German.  Finger spit in your field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, I feel like am I having a stroke?  I don't understand what he's talking about.  Does it make any sense at all to anybody?  Gina, you understand this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in a situation where you've got only so much space to print characters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, I guess I'm just out of it.  I stayed up last night playing half your chest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, big add on.  Go ahead. That was just the first of the Google change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, go ahead. That was the first and the biggest got a couple  of other minor items.  Gmail iOS app got an update.  Yeah, now fully supports background refresh, which means  if your Gmail messages will be prefetched and synced  as they are right there when you open up the app, no more pauses  while you wait for inbox to refresh.  This is dependent on iOS seven and you'll have to turn on background  app refresh and notifications for the Gmail app to work work like this.  And the Gmail app for iOS also supports sign in across Google iOS apps,  including Maps, drives, drive YouTube and Chrome.  So you sign into one, you sign into all.  Same thing for sign out.  So nice, nice update there for the Google iOS apps.  Yay.  Google quietly redesigned their newspaper archive,  which I didn't even know that they had makes searching through them easier.  So you get a news that Google dot com slash newspaper  and you'll see this archive paper that this archive page  that shows hundreds of newspapers organized by title.  You can search within those papers or look through other news sources.  You can look at issues from specific dates.  I played around a little bit.  I didn't know about this either.  I had no idea this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at the density of the text. Lots of newspapers.  But I have to tell you, the first thing I reached for was the New York Times.  Like, I want to get some classic New York Times going on there.  And I couldn't find them.  So it's a limited collection.  But as you can see, you can search for the New York Times at the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's how I when I when I did all my stuff about about the fiendish  Kodakers lying in wait in the 1890s about about privacy and cameras.  Yeah, that was from the New York Times equivalent.  And it's just great to read these things in the original piece.  It's it's it's so Google scanned these.  Is that where they came from?  Yeah, there's a limited sample of them.  I don't know how they how they got them or what the deal is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but right.  Wasn't this, Jeff?  Tell us, Mr.  Professor of Journalism, the whole point of newspapers in the US  was just they put the content in there as a something to separate the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One more, one last item.  The Google Wallet Android app is adding a new feature for orders.  This is tracks your online purchases using your receipts from Gmail,  much the way that Google Google now does.  So I haven't actually got this out yet.  This is rolling out to the to the wallet app.  But there'll be an order section in the Google Wallet app,  and it'll send you a push notification when an order has been shipped.  You know, if you're waiting for something from Amazon or Zappos or wherever.  And you have you do have to update it inside the inside the wallet app.  I think that you have to turn it on when you get the when you get the update.  But handy feature, a little redundant, because I do see that in Google now.  And you will you will, too.  But nice, nice to see that Google's trying to make wallet your,  you know, place where you buy stuff and place where to know  whether or not the stuff that you bought is on its way.  That's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's the Google change law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the consequences of self abuse.  Persons cured at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From that to the Internet, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But thank goodness the Internet exists because we can see this.  This is amazing.  So these are just all really obscure little newspapers that somehow Google.

Transcript:  And a month ago, they were at sixty seven dollars.  That's pretty amazing.  I don't want to calculate the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And and look how it jumped in February.  I mean, I think when they announced WhatsApp, it's been going up ever since.  So the market believes it.  I think I think that February jump is when their quarterly results came out  and it showed that they were doing very well indeed in mobile,  because that was the big question mark, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a huge thing.  And mobile was no, I mean, it was brilliant.  Mobile was nowhere for them.  And now it's huge for them. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think you made the most important point, which is that the, you know,  of the 16 billion they paid for WhatsApp, 12 was stock.  And so that's, you know, as the stock goes up, it.  I don't think that means they put more money into it.  Maybe it does. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, indeed, you wonder, I don't know when the deal closes and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does maybe they just set a certain number of shares  and that was valued at 12 at the time.  But they still end up with more. We don't know.  All right. Yeah, we don't know.  Samsung won in court.  Apple was asking that 35 Android devices from Samsung be blocked at the border.  Judge Lucy Coe said, no, no.  But the the Galaxy S5 could still  be in trouble.  Because there is a ban right now in South Korea  that keeps carriers from adding new customers or allowing their customers

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to upgrade phones because there were there were some reports  they were subsidizing too much.  Forty five day ban to $250.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. It wasn't specifically Samsung, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like carriers, nobody could take a new account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're on it's wacky.  The carriers really illegally subsidizing smartphones.  The law in South Korea is that only $250 can be subsidized.  And they were they were apparently giving.  I mean, gosh, when you get an iPhone or a Galaxy S4 in the US,  you're talking four or five hundred dollars subsidy in some cases.  Right. Because they've given you 200 bucks.  Twitter.  Is testing, by the way, speaking of tests,  the Google big giant ad at the top of the search engines, that's not going to happen.  No, not happen. Didn't work, I guess.  Anyway, they've decided not to do it.  But Twitter is testing a click to call button,  which allows mobile users to call advertisers directly.  So if you're looking at a tweet.  Or that's an ad, you could press a button and it would and you would do your.  Would you ever do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, we've had we've had that on web pages for ages and ages and ages.  I don't know whether it really was going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But remember, this is now on your phone, right?  That's a point. That's a good point.  Yeah.  So you are holding a phone in your hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but who uses the phone to make calls? I mean.  Good point.  I mean, really, like, it's just not.  Yeah, it's not the action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A New York woman whose child spent sixty five dollars  and ninety five cents on digital crystals has sued Google.  On behalf of all parents everywhere.  Claiming the Google Play Store is full of games and apps  that lure children into spending money.  The lawsuit was filed in San Francisco on Friday.  Her five year old son spent the money while playing Marvel  run jump smash on a Galaxy tablet.  It accuses Google of unjust enrichment.  Apple lost a case like that, actually had to pay quite a bit to parents.  I got a little five dollar gift card.  For this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But apparently the problem is it was like sixty five million dollars.  Yeah, it was a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They just paid a thirty two and a half million dollar fine  this earlier this year to the FTC.  So Apple, the way it works is once your password is entered,  it even says this is a warning on the screen now.  They just started doing this for 15 minutes.  You're you don't have to enter your password. So.  In Google, there's a 30 minute window following the initial purchase.  And in which you can offer stuff for sale without asking for a password.  So I guess the trick kids use in a five year old isn't too young to do this.  It's mommy, mommy, mommy.  And you only do it. I'm not this.  She unlocks it and then they buy stuff for half an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, like she bought the app, handed it to her kid, and then he did it.  And purchase. But, you know, Android, we talked about this  quite a bit on all that Android last night.  Android offers restricted profiles, which which which can restrict  in app purchases.  And I thought that there was a choice.  I just didn't know in that purchase yesterday.  And I thought there was a choice that said, you know, don't ask me for my password  ever again, which was which was unchecked.  So there's ways to change this.  It just seems like if.  If you know, in court, how is Google going to defend itself?  I think that Google has a strong case to say, look, we've you know,  we provided restricted profiles, we have some parental, you know, parental controls.  We have a setting to disable this.  So, you know, we have made an effort to prevent this from happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Next time you see Kevin Toff will give him a hard time.  His kids spent three hundred seventy five dollars on on digital fish.  Kevin should know better.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the responsibility is we were talking about this last night on the show,  you really kind of spread across parents, the developers, the apps.  And Google, you know, and the platform. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's also something about, you know, selling digital fish  is ethically challenged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, get ready for this, because now we know this is how you how you  if you want to make money in apps, you do in-app purchases.  That's it. Period. It's a schmuck tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But just like the lottery, it's a schmuck tax. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a lot of them. Yep.  Under Marissa Meyer, 31 of Yahoo's  38 acquisitions of startups have been shuttered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I didn't see that story because they didn't look hard enough.  It's my fault. But are those ones those aren't ones that she bought.  Those are ones that were bought or right.  So well, prior mistakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it doesn't mean that they're this is an article at Read Write Web.  Yahoo destroy it of startups.  But we don't what it you know, that Facebook does the same thing, too,  because they're often acquires where they they're not.  They don't buy the product. They're buying the team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Right. And this is about talent. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the first two months of 2014, Marissa Meyer acquired eight companies,  including AV8. Remember that incredible labs,  makers of the digital mobile assistant, Donna Spark,  a mobile marketing company and Tom Fuller and Enterprise Application Studio,  all of which, I guess, have disappeared.  I don't I don't use AV8. Is it still around?  Thirty one of the 38 acquired startups have have been shut down.  If you use Visify.  Here comes Sunset.  Donna ceased to exist one month after acquire.  Spark, some of Spark services are gone.  Sumley, you see Sumley, that was the kid, the teenager who  sold his company to Yahoo.  That's now in the Yahoo News app, which is great.  Yahoo News Digest.  I think these are I think this is not unusual, frankly.  I think it's unfair to call her a destroyer of startups.  I think it is unfair. A monetizer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And she and she always liked I think it was Steven Levy's book about  or article about her, about her, that manager program that she was ahead of  at Google. And there was a there was a point at which  he asked about, you know, that the the Googlers that they  she was training to be in management, you know, so many of them often wanted  to go off and be entrepreneurs and start their own companies.  And her response to that was, yeah, those are the people that we want.  We want people who want to be entrepreneurs and who want who are going to take charge  and lead and innovate in a way that, you know, who have that kind of desire.  So it makes a lot of sense that she would want to acquire startups  that, you know, not only, you know, had innovative technology,  but also had leaders within them that might help change the culture inside of Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Instagram, big update today on Android.  It launches faster, doubles the speed of profile loading and a redesigned camera.  I thought it looked a little weird, but I  I'm watching it right now. Yeah. Yeah.  So I know Instagram five point one doesn't it doesn't.  It's all flat. Yeah, it's the new flat Instagram.  And according to this article at the Verge, this is all about global.  I don't know why it would be, but apparently they're going after Brazil  and other countries that are showing some real smartphone growth.  Juice up global expansion.  Oh, because it looks better on low, low resolution, low resolution, cheaper  Android phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thus the illustration of a cheap Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I get it. Aha. Aha.  That's an Instagram is a Facebook company.  Hmm. Apparently there is a critical flaw in WhatsApp, another Instagram,  another Facebook company that for Android, but we'll be, you know, big deal.  Facebook campus was locked down last night due to an unsubstantiated threat.  Don't do that, kids. That's not nice.  It was a bomb threat. Yeah, that sucks. Yeah, it's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was I was very impressed with the campus because you drive around.  It just looks like, as I mentioned when we were we were there, just some,  you know, boring sun office buildings.  But inside it's Disneyland. Right.  And but you can't get in there unless you go through one of the buildings.  Right. Interesting.  As opposed to Google, where you can wander around the campus and gawk at them.  At Facebook, you can only enter Disneyland.  That's good. Through there. It is. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good idea.  The BBC has released its 30th anniversary edition  of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Text Adventure.  How geeky can you get?  It's the Infocom Text Adventure being re-released.  That's cool.  Apparently, they commissioned a remake of it 10 years ago.  And this is a reworking of the original game.  So there's a let's see where we can find this.  I want to get it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably have to be in Britain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that would be really terrible.  There's a walkthrough.  You know, you can get these Infocom games.  There are a number of players that will play the text.  Here you go. And here's all the games.  These were great games. Very difficult.  Yeah, look at that. Zork 123 Enchanter, Seastalker, Sorcerer,  Spellbreaker, Wishbringer, Starcraft, Suspended Planet, Farl.  I played almost all of these. Don't laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, reminding me of wasted time in my youth.  Yeah. I wish I'd wasted on something better than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently, somebody just eBayed the new the new HTC One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a good deal. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, here it is. OK, so this is I guess it's in Flash.  And you can play it. There we go.  Oh, look, it's even OK.  The Hiccacha.  OK, you wake up, the room is OK.  Well, let's play the little bit of this.  We wasted enough time. Oh, no.  You wake up.  The woman's room is spinning very gently around your head,  or at least it would be if you could see what you can't.  It is pitch black. What do you want to do, Gina?  Hmm. Turn on light. How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, turn on light. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, there you go. Good day.  Good start to the day. Pity it's going to be the worst one of your life.  The light is now on.  In you're in the bedroom in the bed, the bedroom is a mess.  It is a small bedroom with a faded carpet and old wallpaper.  There's a wash basin, a chair with tatty dressing gowns slung over it.  Let's put on the gown.  Forty two, somebody just whispered to me, you're not holding.  Oh, take gown.  You can't reach it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get out of bed. Get out of bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very difficult, but you manage it.  The room is still spinning. It dips and sways a little bit.  Put or take gown.  Got the gown. Luckily, this is large enough for you to get a hold of.  You know, something in the pocket.  Examine pocket. OK.  Open pocket. You get the idea here.  What I like is there's some little it's a little bit more graphic.  It's hard to open or close the pocket. OK, put on gown.  OK, you're now wearing your gown. Open pocket.  Opening your gown, the thing  reveals a thing your aunt gave you, which you don't know what it is.  A buffered analgesic and pocket fluff.  Take analgesic.  You swallow the tablet.  After a few seconds, the room begins to calm down and behave in an orderly manner.  Your terrible headache goes.  And from there, the end of the world.  You continue on. This is good.  This is fun. Cool. Yeah, it is fun.  It all came rushing back to me.  30 years ago, the Hitchhiker's Guide is actually older than the World Wide Web.  New York Bands, Tesla Direct Sales.  You can't buy a Tesla in this in Texas either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I say New York, New Jersey, New Jersey, New Jersey, my corrupt,  ridiculous state, the governor hates drivers.  He closes Bridget holes and he does this.  We don't like car salesman people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what the deal is?  And it's the auto dealers associations that raise a lot of money for  state legislators. This is pure.  Corruption. So in Arizona and Texas and New Jersey,  you cannot go to Tesla dot com and buy a Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Short Hills Mall, the Ritzy Mall in northern New Jersey, has a Tesla  showroom and two Teslas in it and all kinds of neat stuff.  And you can buy Tesla shirts and all that.  And I can stand there and dream and it's closed.  They're closing it. Gone. It's ridiculous.  The whole system of franchised car dealers is ridiculously inefficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, nobody wants to buy cars that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No one. We hate it. We hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the Tesla blog, they read, unfortunately, Monday, we received news  that Governor Christie's administration had gone back on its word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And next he's going to say, and Tesla's can't go over the George  Washington bridge.  And this is the man who wants to be president.  It's just not safe.  Do you have a link to that eBay sale of the HTC one?  Yes.  Chat room, give it to me at the verge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's right below the Tesla story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, because I want to see what that thing looks like.  Hit return or so. There it is. Is that is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. Yeah, that's the Engadget piece.  And that's the direct eBay link is right below it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you have an HTC one.  So this is the new one, the all new one, the all new one or the one to one.  Yeah, I see it right there.  From Droid Life. And here's the look, there's a lot of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, so got that by now.  If you scroll down, you'll see the original listing it got because it got it got

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  purchased. It is the one we have been waiting for.  Only got five bids.  Now, I think it could very well be bogus.  It's not like eBay is always perfect, is it?  It does. Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was the four and I was the buy it now price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would have done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, just to see. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, then it's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love the one and the new one looks pretty cool.  The dual cameras also has it has my interest at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dual cameras on the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, dual cameras on the back.  Why? Kind of like like the lightro camera so that you can do  depth of field editing and choosing.  Yeah. Yeah. Better editing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mm hmm. Ooh, that's a good deal.  If that's real purportedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, allegedly could be just the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't actually see the phone anywhere.  Right. I'm always nervous about that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was the the the dual cameras, though, there was a Telstra  brochure was leaked and it's pretty pretty pretty for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But again, in that listing, they only showed a box. Right.  You might have just bought a very expensive box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a box. Yes. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or a picture of a box or a picture of a box.  It's like those people who thought they bought iPads instead.  They got boxes with apples inside actual apples.  These things happen.  All right. We're going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Has pretty good feedback. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, that's is that why you do that on eBay?  You check the seller.  Yeah. See the feedback.  Is it 100 percent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  100 percent positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's pretty good.  How many? Yeah. How many?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fifty five. That's good.  That's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's enough. Fifty five hundred percent positive.  I think I think you can assume this person knows what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm. It makes it one.  I mean, this is where they get it.  Where to get it and you know, yeah, that they're willing to sell it and not get 32 gigabyte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So 500 bucks for the 32 gigabyte brand new one from Verizon Wireless.  When you probably be able to get it for two or two fifties subsidized.  eBay money. I don't know. That's interesting.  I don't know how we got that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm. Hmm.  Brand new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, in Maps. Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So you'll have a place card and it'll have upcoming events.  So if you look at a venue, I guess it'll show you what's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can add the Twitch schedule to Twitch page.  Really? That's awesome.  I don't know. Right? Couldn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess. If we were smart enough to put it there, we'll have to work on that.  Gina, what is your tip of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My tip of the week is for Android users who have KitKat, who may have been experiencing some battery drain lately, losing battery.  There's apparently a bug that Google is aware of where some apps that get a hold of your camera, apps like Skype, will run this daemon in the background and it will kill your battery.  There's a long bug report on it in the Android open source project.  And one of the Android open source contributors said Skype triggers this bug.  So if you're seeing sudden and bad battery drain on your KitKat Android phone, uninstall Skype until the fix is on its way out.  The fix is on its way out. Google is aware of it and they're working on it now.  And I actually haven't seen this, but Jason, last night on Jason Howell on all the Android said that he was having that problem.  So yeah, just something to keep in mind and kind of funny to see someone in Android saying, hey, uninstall Skype.  It's not just Skype. It's any app that accesses your camera that in a certain way that actually runs the camera, this camera process in the background when you're not running the app, which Skype apparently does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Makes me feel like it's a it's a Google bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does feel like an Android bug, right? It does feel like Android shouldn't let this happen.  And it is right. Google said that they know about this and they're issuing a fix.  So it's a it's a it's a process called M.M.Q. camera daemon.  And that's what that's what it is. You can restart.  You can kill that process or you can try it on uninstall uninstall Skype if that's an option for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, save some battery. Good deal.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week. My number is three. Three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many seasons? That's how many seasons. Big Bang three just got renewed for what?  You can't renew a show for three seasons.  They did. They did. I'm hoping I'm hoping there's no shark on the horizon.

Transcript:  I don't watch that show. I find it insulting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are. I love that show. I do, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel guilty about it. You should feel guilty.  I feel better about it now that there are actually like smart women on it when it was the beginning  and it was just Penny being an airhead that used to bug me.  But now that there's Amy and Bernadette, I feel good about it. Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know I know I'm going to lose my geek card, but I just feel like it's insulting to geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think a lot of geeks feel the same way.  I've gotten some some very some derisive stares when I mentioned I like Big Bang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You want to get some sense of how bad that show is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no. Oh, you're going to have a Jeff Leo fight here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You love this show, Jeff. I can't believe they've they've renewed it for three more seasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's blockbuster. I mean, it's been so successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go. There are YouTube videos of Big Bang Theory without the laugh track.  Because the laugh track is make makes you think this is funny.  But when you when you watch it without a laugh track, you realize there are no actual jokes in the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is in front of a live audience, though they do film in front of a live audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let's just see what it sounds like when there are no laughs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  This is really painful. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're just going to hide out in here to avoid the shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm very comfortable here.  Penny, do you why don't you shoot another silver bullet my way?  Get one yourself.  Somebody's been taking bitchy pills.  OK, I've had enough. Have you? Terrible show.  They should not renew it for even one more season.  Oh, my. Oh, jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is the chat room saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Try playing Game of Thrones without the laugh track, then see how you feel.  All right. I don't know why. I just that show does not grab me.  And I do feel like it's a little insulting to women.  Maybe it's better now, but a little better now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a sitcom. It's a sitcom. It is dumb.  Well, I hate all sitcoms, right?  That's fair. I'll accept that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, although there are a few good ones like episodes on Showtime,  very funny, very good, very talented.  Well, people hate me now.  You are full of it, Leo. You are so wrong.  Yes. 30 Rock was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you know, there are some great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, they're at the door with their pitchforks and their torches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  An army of nerds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But see, if you're to me, if you're a geek, you shouldn't like it  because it's so insulting to geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's so precious. That's just so so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do want to watch.  There's going to be on HBO a new show done by Mike Judge,  who did Beavis and Butt-Head in Office Space about Silicon Valley.  And what I've seen so far, it looks pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Amazon Silicon Valley show went nowhere, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was it called? The. Yeah, I can't remember the name of that.  I thought that was supposed to be good, but.  I also OK, just so now you can get it all out of your system.  I really hated the new cosmos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't see it.  Shouldn't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was just the intro. I should wait and see another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now that I know Leo's taste, maybe I should run to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Watch it. It was all special effect.  It was like it felt like the Disney version of the like a Disney ride  version of the universe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like it was any different from Billy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Billy was of things.  I just I I don't you know, I didn't I didn't I wasn't of the right age  to be influenced by Carl Sagan's Cosmos.  But this I just was not I was underwhelmed by it.  Now watch the next episode.  Maybe this was just because it was the intro.  I was and I was very insulted that I don't want to go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry. TV insults you all the time.  You know, it's like you're sitting there at home watching your TV just saying,  how dare you television? I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I talk to the TV a lot. I talk back to the TV a lot.  I'm really angry about True Detective, which started out really great  and let us all down, I thought significantly.  But I want enough TV reviews.  Do you have any other numbers to take our to take this bad taste out of your mouth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, I'll take another number.  I've never it's the first time in all the entire show.  My number has been rejected. I didn't reject it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say, no, it's a good number.  Have you ever have you ever heard of a TV show being renewed for three seasons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's unheard of. I will give you this instead.  All right. Tony Hale, who is the brilliant CEO of Chartbeat,  Chartbeat tracks pages and what we I love this thing by Pixel.  Yeah, this is great. Tony says, you know, I've been worried that native advertising,  right, native advertising is the stuff that tries to fool you into thinking  this is really content, but it's just a goddamn long,  texty, boring advertisement. And I've been worried people are fooled by this.  But I should have more faith in humanity.  People are smart. Chartbeat has found that when people go to a page with normal content,  seventy one percent scroll. OK, that is they're committed and they look for more.  People who go to native ad content, only twenty four percent scroll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That means they don't continue to read because they know it's bogus.  They know this is crap. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think that's that's important.  And then he had another number in here.  A stunning fifty five percent of people spent fewer than fifteen seconds actively on a page.  They've looked at two billion visits.  So more than half the time, we glance off the page like an asteroid off Mars in fifteen seconds.  Gone, which is to say most of the time we go to something that's irrelevant to us and crap.  Now, how do we get to that crap? Often we get to it from.  Links. And the other thing that Sharpie has said is that most people we've talked about this in the show before.  Most people share or like before they read this before or they never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this was really an interesting graph. Do we read the articles we share?  So there's four quadrants. The bottom is bottom half is low social activity.  In other words, lots of share. No sharing. The top is lots of sharing.  The left half is low read time. High read time is the right half.  So if you look at the high read time, high sharing, there's nothing.  If you spend time reading something, you just don't share it. And where's the most sharing?  Well, of course, we're not the things we don't read the least read time.  And we talked about this on iPad today on Monday.  It either indicates that people share to show how smart they are or like.  I think that they I think people just they share headlines.  They're not sharing the article. That's exactly it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's exactly it. And I think we share the motive to share is to is social capital is look how smart I am on the first one to share this.  And we just bug people with it. Right. And so I wrote a blog post about about what the proper metrics are then.  So Tony tears down some metrics. But I think we have to look at other metrics.  And it varies. Right. At Circa, the main metric they use is follow.  If you follow a story, it says, please bug me when something happens here.  That's a that's a good metric. At Medium, they track what they call TTR, total time reading.  And they're even going to start there. They're looking to around text.  I was with one of the executives there just yesterday.  And they're looking around text to basically charge on time like broadcast, which is what Tony Hales also backed up in some other research.  And so the idea that you could spend on time now attention is a good time spent as a good metric for things that are like that.  But I think it's also a bad metric for things like, you know, just tell me the fact and get me out of here.  Right. Well, I met with Jerry Yang many, many, many, many years ago in a conference room meeting.  And he said, our job at Yahoo is to get you in and out of here as quickly as possible.  Well, that didn't last long, did it?  Because they went with the old media model of trying to shove as many eyeballs in for your ads and for your eyeballs as they could.  They try to drag you down and give you friction and hold you there.  But that's not the best metric. If you just want to get a fact, you want to get in and out.  So efficiency is an important metric.  So anyway, I wanted to point you to Tony Hales.  Very good piece. And this is evidently now erased the memory of three more years of Big Bang Theory from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The more you brought that up again, the most click time, but least deeply engaged with articles had generic topics in August.  The worst performers included top best, biggest fictional in January.  In January, the worst performers, hairstyles, positions, nude and for some reason the word Virginia.  Lots of clicks, not so much engagement.  You know, I think that's true. I think we know that here.  For a long time, I felt bad that we weren't getting as many shares as I thought we should on social media.  And partly that's because we're long form video shows, not easy to share us.  But I think people get engaged with our content.  So I'm not going to worry so much about whether we're getting shared or not.  Although I bet you there's a few people tweeting that I'm an idiot for not liking Big Bang Theory right now.  All right. You will like this though. Two quick, two Android apps.  This is a Chromecast app. Did you ever play Cards Against Humanity?  Somebody in the chat room told me about this. I just installed it.  Casts Against Civility. It's a Chromecast app that lets you and one or two or three other people play this amazingly horrid but fun card game.  It's not the same company or same people who do Cards Against Humanity.  It's a party game for horrible people.  The object of the game is to respond to a question or statement that has a certain word or phrase censored by playing one of the ten cards in your hands.  Look, it's going to get a lot of groans and titters from your audience, from your playmates in this.  But you play it on a big screen. I think this is a great way to do it, a party game.  And it's free casts against humanity.  And then the other one is you're never going to stop playing this.  So I got to warn you, it came out first for iOS, but Quiz Up is now available on Android.  Have you ever played this game?  This is a trivia quiz game that has an infinite huge number of topics.  I'll go to the topics page and you'll see.  So there's something you can be an expert in in almost any category.  Not just geography, but drill down in Africa, African countries, Asia, Asian countries, Australia, Canada, cities of the world, European countries, landmarks.  Name the flag, name the country, name the landmark.  And that's just geography. I mean, there's tons of topics.  You want to play one? Let's see. I have probably some challenges.  People are challenging me a lot on this one.  Which one do you want to play? Dog breeds? Dr. Mom wants to play dog breeds.  Let's see how good you are at dog breeds.  So it'll play in real time. It'll automatically pick an opponent somewhere in the world.  There's always somebody to play against.  Or you can asynchronously play against your friends.  So Dr. Mom's already played this and gotten her score.  Now I'm going to play at the same time. It's got very dramatic music.  What is the breed which is among the most common of pet breeds?  Well, that's a Doberman, is it? Yes. All right.  So you see you can test your knowledge of dog breeds. It's really a lot of fun to play.  You also get dinged for taking too long.  Preferred breed for search and rescue has to be...  This is too easy. This is not a good test of this game.  It can get pretty tough. If I play the...  Whoops. I just went out of it.  If I play the...  By the way, here's a new quiz up challenge.  You guys aren't saying anything or you just really...  There's Karsten who was a resident of... I'm not a game guy.  I like trivia. Don't you like trivia? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've started a Big Bang Theory quiz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what? There is... You want to play the Big Bang Theory quiz?  You want to? I seriously...  You want to play it? All right. Let's see.  I want to see if you guys really watch that show.  Okay. We'll go to topics television.  You claim to watch that show.  TV. All the TV shows.  Oh, no. I didn't want to do that. Oh, crud.  All the... Big Bang Theory.  Now, I'm just going to play somebody randomly, all right?  I could challenge people I know, but I'm just going to play somebody randomly.  I'm playing Roberto. He's playing from the US. He's pretty good at this.  He's won 21 times. I don't think I've ever shot at this.  Big Bang Theory. Round one. Get ready.  What did Penny try to pay her electric bill with?  Leonard's...  Starbucks gift card. That's what I would have guessed. Good.  Was that a guess or did you know? Roberto got it right away.  It's pretty predictable. What is Sheldon's IQ?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, 194. Yeah, I copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not 187. Oh!  And then if you...  Sheldon attempts to train Penny using what kind of food? Cake, chocolate, fruit or crisps?  Chocolate. Chocolate.  Very good. Very good. Thank you. Thank you very much.  Round four. There are only seven questions.  Which episode does Stephanie Barnett make her debut appearance?  Is it the Dumpling Paradox, the Lizard Spock expansion, the Euclid Alternative  or the Friendship Algorithm? No, it's the Lizard Spock expansion.  Roberto's gotten everyone right so far.  Why did Amy Farrah Fowler leave the Scouts?  She didn't like the uniform? No.  They discovered she was a girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These are hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In which episode has Leonard proposed to Penny?  The Cushion Saturation, the Launch Acceleration, the Gothowitz Deviation?  I don't even like the names of this show.  Twice. Double bonus.  What is the name of the agent sent to interview Leonard, Sheldon and Raj  as part of a background check on Howard?  I think it's Patty Pearson, but it was actually Angela Page.  Ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to Roberto.  Ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to Roberto.  Eliza Dushku, by the way.  Oh really? I love her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I failed you, Leo. That was terrible.  I did terrible. You don't even watch that show, do you?  I do.  That's a fun game. I curse you for making me install it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you like trivia, it's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You talked about it last night?  I was talking about Android, and I hadn't actually launched it until now.  Now I can see that I've lost my night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really fun.  Then people start to beat you by one point, and then you get upset.  It's really good.  I want to play this cast against civility.  I think that's going to be a lot of fun.  I don't think they use the same questions as Cards Against Humanity.  Kind of a neat use case for the cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quiz Up, Casts Against Civility.  A couple of picks there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you very much, Jeff Jarvis.  Did you see the last episode of True Detective yet?  Yeah.  What did you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a little disappointed.  I'm not a fan of McConaughey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't like him as a human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love him as an actor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's the most awesomest actor ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I'm not a big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm kind of with you.  What's the show you're most excited about these days?  Big Bang Theory, of course.  Shut up. You know you're lying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing matters until the new season of Orange is the New Black.  I love that show. That's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As long as I'm giving you games that are going to kill you the rest of your life,  Threes is also now available on the Android App Store.  Have you ever played that?  I don't like games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You will like this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the best games ever, but you've got to get the right one.  Because Threes is so popular on iOS,  I see a lot of fake Threes.  That's not it.  It's got an 8 for the icon.  That's definitely wrong.  But somebody said the real one is available,  so I have to look and see if I can find it.  Look at all the fake ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like the Flappy Bird clones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you everybody for joining us.  I'm sorry if I've offended you.  I'm heartily sorry.  I'm sorry for those who are watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so sorry.  So, thank you so much.  I love you.  We'll be live for the public very soon.  Probably next week.  For all the popular kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to just show you real quickly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because you really can't get a sense of what it can do  until you see somebody's think up.  I'll just show you my think up.  So it shows you popular retweets.  Oh, people like the petition to end daylight saving time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, nice job on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Highly retweeted, 187 retweets, 34 replies.  These are the people who followed me.  The lists I'm on, key stats for my tweets.  My favorite is how many times I said, I, me.  What do you call that one?  Talk about yourself much or something?  Yeah, enough about me.  I get that one a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we've got quite a few new insights rolling out  in the next couple of weeks too.  So I'm pretty excited.  You have a good insight stream, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've got a very engaged audience.  Lots more fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love best when it says how many people I added  to somebody else's tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, because you retweeted it, half a million more people saw it.  And that's such a nice feeling.  I really did something good for somebody today.  That's Jeff Jarvis. He is the professor of journalism  at the City University of New York.  Just a jolly fellow.  I'm going to read his latest book on machine.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  His latest book is Public Parts, available everywhere.  Are you mad at me?  I like Big Bang Theory.  Are you mad at me for saying anything about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm easy going, I have a sense of humor.  Are you angry? Did I hurt your feelings?  I'm just amazed.  I'm not in a sitcom. I haven't watched a sitcom in years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You live your life with games. I waste my life with sitcoms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I watch a lot of TV.  You watch way too much TV.  I like TV.  I tend to watch the cable dramas.  Thank you, ladies.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for watching.  We do this week in Google every Wednesday, 1pm Pacific, 4pm Eastern time.  We are now on summertime in the United States,  a little earlier than a lot of the rest of you.  1pm our time.  You're just really pissing off, Leo.  Yeah, I don't want it anymore. Shouldn't we kill daylight saving time?  Just kill it? I think we should stay at it.  Let's not change ever again. Let's just stay right here where we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would make life with a baby a lot easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wouldn't it? Yeah.  I think we should do this Monday after daylight saving time begins.  Because everyone's exhausted.  Yeah, because you're one hour off and you're groggy.  These are fatal traffic accidents in the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  17% more on that Monday.  I was talking to a doctor the other day who got more people coming in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  feeling bad and depressed because of daylight saving time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do we do this to ourselves? What is the advantage?  All they have to do on daylight savings time day is just watch a rerun of Big Bang Theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure you'll feel so much better.  Who's your favorite character? Is it Sheldon? Everybody loves Sheldon.  I love Sheldon. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Jim Parsons is amazing. Amy Fowler.  It's pretty amazing. And she did a great interview,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  long, great interview on Howard Stern. She was just wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? Blossom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Blossom, yeah. She was Blossom?  Yeah. I didn't like that show either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's a Ph. She's an honest to God Ph.D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What? Yeah. Oh, yeah. She was teaching.  What's her doctorate in?  A thick, like in her biology or something like that.  And how does she justify paying such a nitwit on the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's not a nitwit on the show. She's smart.  Oh, Penny's not the neighbor.  Oh, yeah. Right, right. No, no. Amy Fowler is Sheldon.  If Penny was not Blossom, believe me, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I don't know. Yeah, you really, you really.  I don't know. You are clearly a communist.  The show of the Americans, it's about Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, I like the Americans. OK. For network television, it's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about Orphan Black? We talked about that? Yeah, I like that a lot.  I like that a lot. It's coming back. Oh, good. April. Yeah.  Good. Good. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's an actual neuroscientist. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, I thought she was the neighbor, but she's not the neighbor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no. The neighbor is, as far as I know, just an actress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She definitely doesn't have a PhD.  She probably doesn't have a bachelor's.  Are we out of here yet? Oh, I haven't said goodbye.  I have not finished the show. I'm still digging a deeper hole for myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are, Leo. You're getting dangerously close to equating beauty with dumbness here.  No, not at all. I don't know what Penny looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not saying that. It's just the neighbor is ditzy. Is she not?  She's intentionally, it's very sexist.  They play her as some bimbo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Particularly in the beginning. They totally cast her as.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have only seen the earlier episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As the show went on, she became more geeky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You were making fun of geeks having the crush on her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well. Yeah.  Okay. This show is on at 2,000 UTC forever.  But the thing is, never mind.  Thank you for joining us.  We'll see you next time on Tweet.
