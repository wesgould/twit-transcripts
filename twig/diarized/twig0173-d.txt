Thank you. So I hear you had a you got to visit the Googleplex recently and you got  to be in on a super secret meeting with all the like really higher up people in  charge and we've got all kinds of like cool secrets to share with us about  Google about the inner work workings of Google. Yeah let me make sure my blinds are

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  closed so they don't try to shoot me. All right. Yeah. So we're set. So last  week last Wednesday I went to the Googleplex. Now what's funny about this is  I'm you know I'm friends with a Vic and doctor who's you know the senior VP. This  is through Google Plus and I've kind of established a friendship with him. So I  sent him an email about two weeks ago and I was like you know I know YouTube  and Google Plus are starting to do this merge. I said there's gonna be some  backlash. You need to you need to you know talk to some YouTube people about  this and he wrote me back and was like what backlash YouTube partners are. They  love this idea. They're all on board and I was like someone is protecting you from  the news. That's true. This is not true. So I sent him an elaborate email just  broken down from the issues and by six hours later he messaged me back and says  we have to have a meeting either you come up here or we do a Google Plus hangout.  Now here's where the idiot in me didn't get it. I chose to drive six hours for a  30 minute meeting. First he was just doing a Google Plus hangout but I wanted to see  the plex. I'm new here to California. So did you go to the swag store. I did not.  It was very limited time. And by the time I got there and got the meeting it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  time to get the reason you go ahead and go. So you need to be wearing t shirts

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  today. It's great stuff. I am going I am going back sometime in January to get the  real tour. I was I was guaranteed that. So I'm telling you go to the swag store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They got great stuff. They got it. They got an Android ski hat with little ears  out of it. It's wonderful. But anyway go ahead. Yes. So I met with I met with my

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  good friend and I got to say he is so gracious like you know he's a he's over  so much stuff and to have me a user come by and talk to him was just which is  really wonderful. So I sat with him his chief of staff and a great guy from I  believe his name was just here from from YouTube. And we just he just wanted to  hear my point of view on it. So I just kind of want to relay that to you all  since you don't really get a lot of YouTube news here. Basically what YouTube  is trying to do is merge as you all know they try to merge Google Plus and all of  all of their items together into one cohesive thing. The problem on YouTube is  that as they're slowly starting to do it there are a lot of problems that that  creep out. Whereas a lot of people who subscribe to us don't get our videos.  They don't you know things that get things get broken. And you know we do make  money off of you know the videos as partners. So that definitely impacts us  and it impacts Google because they don't get their percentage off of it. So I  would think it would be in their interest to kind of fix those problems. And and  what I what I told Vic is I sat there I sat down and say do you want to hear the  truth. He said yeah be honest. I said the YouTube partners by and large hate  Google Plus. I just I didn't know I didn't because I get I get so much feedback  from it. It's not that it's a bad service. It's kind of how it's rolled out.  If you remember when it was rolled out it took about six months to get the  teenagers on board. And as we know on YouTube the majority of the audience is  13 through 17. So imagine me all excited about Google Plus as I was saying hey  everybody come join Google Plus is going to be great. And they're like we can't  join you know and that kind of killed a lot of the buzz that they didn't really  take that into consideration. They tailor toward the geeks but didn't tailor  towards the long term plan which was the YouTube people. So that created a sour  note right at the beginning with it. And you know YouTube keeps pushing Google  Plus and I need to say I enjoy the service I use it. I'm a big fan of it. But  most of the people who use YouTube that's not where the audience is. Their  audience is on Twitter is on Facebook Tumblr increasingly Instagram and so to  ask for fifth network is a little bit too much for too much for some of them.  And you think about some of the bigger partners whether it's I just seen Phil  DeFranco or even to a lesser extent myself. You know we've been on the  suggested user list. You know we've been blessed with that. Got a you know I got  one point three million people. So DeFranco has close to a million. I think  I just things around there. The problem is we post to Google Plus and you know  I know for myself after a day I look at the analytics or two five hundred people  out of one point three million people have bothered to see the video now. And  I mentioned that to Vick I said something is wrong with this. I said it's  not you know maybe maybe I'm just horrible with videos but I have to think  that a percentage some people would just click it just to see who this dude is.  And I said people are signing up but they're not staying around. I said so  there's there's little incentive for a YouTuber to push this if nobody's there.  I mean you think about I just think she puts a video up maybe a hundred people  will plus one it. She has over one million subscribers on YouTube. There's  a problem there that right. No one that no one's really talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lamar what do you what do you just context here before you go on. What do  you understand the integration is going to mean in terms of the YouTube  experience versus the Google plus experience. Oh I'm definitely going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  get to that in a second. Yeah absolutely. So you know so when YouTube starts  mentioning this merger obviously it's alarming. Anytime YouTube has done  anything you know we've been up in arms and gone crazy about it you know because  we know we're losing subscribers we're losing all kind of things that are getting  broken. One thing that they've done is they what the new outline it or you know  the new dashboard that it come out with is that they're removing the ability to  for you as I say Jeff you're a subscriber to me. You won't be able to see  my videos right away unless you explicitly click a small button that says  uploads only. And their reasoning is well we want to you know let's say Jeff is  only subscribed to two people and he's he's already seen those two people's  videos. We don't want something blank to be there. And so but the issue is if I'm  subscribing which means I want to see it I want to be able to see everything  versus some random videos that I liked or some other people commented. So one of  my suggestions would just put the recommended videos after it. So it's a  continuous stream. It's little stuff like that that are problems for YouTube  subscribers. Only 10 or 12 percent of our subscribers see our videos. I have  130,000 subscribers. If I get 10 to 15,000 views it's a good day. That's  a big number. That's a big number. So to answer your question about the merger  after I said all this Vic explained it like this. First of all you can now like  I did merge your Google plus with your YouTube so you can use your real name. I  think that's great. It saved me. You know now I can use my real name to market or  you can choose not to. But I do like that integration. One of the things that Vic  and them and they told me is that they want everything integrates. So here's an  example. Gina let's say someone types in Gina Trapani on Google and Google  search. Wouldn't it be great if on the right side it popped up. Gina is on  YouTube. Subscribe now. Gina is on Google plus. Follow or circle now. The  buttons are just right there for instant follows and subscribers. So that will  actually build our numbers. That's something they're working on for the  merger which is good. Another thing which some partners may or may not like is that  they eventually want to merge circles and subscribers together. I was going to ask  that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a confusing for the outside for the for the  mainstream person. It's kind of confusing to what a subscribe means. We  have to pay. That doesn't mean what you know can we hear subscriptions from  magazines. We know what that means. Well here's the other thing Lamar. You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  one of the secrets of Google plus that's a secret but one of the obvious things  about Google plus is you have a million people following you circling you. They  don't see everything that you put in the algorithm filters the algorithm tries to  give people what the algorithm thinks they're going to be interested in. So  there's no guarantee that when you say hello world the end of the world is  coming. But those people are going to see what you do. Whereas I think in  YouTube if I subscribe to you I'm pretty much assured to get every new video  because I chose to subscribe to you. It's a different verb but it's also a  different system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's part of the problem is that we think that's how it should be. But I  couldn't get a clear answer from from the guy. And I know they're going to do  100 percent of the people subscribe to me. Will they 100 percent get my video  because if they do then then then I understand and it's my fault that I need  to change my content. I'm not appealing to them. But I am convinced that 100

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  percent of people are not getting the views on on on Google plus I can  guarantee you because because otherwise you know I said not some really wonky  crap. And you know at some point somebody in Thailand would say you're boring me.  Google plus is choosing not to send that when I spoke to Google plus team about  30 40 people when I was last in Mountain View I kind of alluded to this and they  kind of in that smug way nodded you know that I that I was on to something there  that I was right. And it is algorithmic. OK there ought to be a way that what  you can do of course is that somebody can go in on you and push the bar over  and say I want to see everything Lamar has. But that requires a real effort to  do that. You've got to know it exists. You've got to go do it. Yeah. I mean this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is interesting. This is why I didn't this this kind of the same reason I think  News Feed ranking is kind of the new SEO war. You know what I mean. Like wasn't  this why Cuban said that he was upset about Facebook. He was losing leaving  Facebook because people weren't seeing the team posts and he didn't want to have  to pay to have the post appear. Of course they weren't before anyway because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook also operates algorithmically and what it feeds to you in a news feed.  You're absolutely right. Whereas but the other secret about this is Twitter. You  know I don't even use my Twitter main feed anymore because it just got too  big and I don't want to groom it. So I have a media wonks feed and I have other  other other lists that I have. So the truth is that we all think that there's  some numbered audience of the stuff we put out there and it's not true.  It's not true.  Yeah.  With you know old days of blogs and web pages you did get server stats to know  who opened your page and who wasn't a robot doing that. It all if you're  actually right. You're Gina and all of the feed stuff. There's absolutely no  guarantee. I suspect Mark told me if I'm wrong here I suspect that when when  someone subscribed to you on YouTube and they looked at their subscriptions they  would see you at least you were guaranteed that they were you know you  to was going to decide not to give me episode 267 of Lamar because I think  you're going to like it. Jeff.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know that's the problem. I can't get a concrete answer on that because on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube it's on the old YouTube.  Yeah, I'm gonna ask.  The only old tube on the old YouTube the way it was the way you're you're  concerned about preserving. If I subscribe to you and I went to my  subscriptions I would see every episode. Is that not true? The old way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is my understanding. Yes. That's how.  That's how it was. And it was I mean the sub boxes would be broken sometimes but  but at least we knew the people who subscribe. It was less people at the same  time. We have to understand that as well. It's more people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now I think that that on the gene is absolutely right. And so what happens is  that these companies will come to you. Twitter is doing it in its own way  saying well you know not that we don't really see it. We won't say that but we  can charge you to really make sure you're being seen. Facebook is doing the  exact same thing. Google hasn't done that yet. But from both the producers  angle but especially from the user's angle you know Gina I want to see  everything you post if the algorithm show me everything you post and you think  well I wrote this thing and I did maybe I didn't plus Jeff Jarvis in it but you  know I thought he'd be interested in this and he's a silent what a jerk.  Right. That that that breaks the link that these social things are supposed to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  create right. Yeah I mean the verbiage is interesting you know when you say  subscribe if I subscribe to a magazine like old school style I don't expect  that I'm only going to get the issues that the company has determined that I  might like you know based on the information they have about me. I assume  that I'm going to get every issue just like if I subscribe to a feed in my news  reader which is also kind of old school now right. I expect that I'm going to get  every post and that and that and that feed. So yeah you are kind of taking the  risk with with you know with if they're going to merge subscriptions and circles  as the content creator you really at a disadvantage. I mean if you look at it  though from Google's perspective like they have to build this stuff there's a  very there's a small group of content creators and there's a vast community of  consumers right. So they have to optimize this for the consumers. So from their  perspective they they only want to show the stuff that they think is interesting.  So if Lamar does a video on Android and Google knows that I'm you know big  Android fan and user you know that should pop up in my news feed. But if  it's about something about dogs you know maybe maybe it won't be. I mean that  puts Lamar at a disadvantage but it's supposed supposedly a better experience  for me. I mean just kind of trying to argue the other side. Sorry wouldn't there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  be a fairly simple fix though that that function that says you could move the  bar over to the right and see everything somebody says. If you just kind of  reminded me of that regularly it would have two features. One is that I could  say I want to see everything Lamar does. I want to see everything that Gina and  Leo do. But it also tells me oh gosh I guess I'm not seeing everything from  everybody else. It would be a clearer experience I think at least. So Lamar  what do they what do they say to you? Did they did they nod at you and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  axiopathetic? Yeah they completely acknowledged it. The YouTube  engineer you know says well hey you know we realize that only a certain  percentage get videos but mostly he said most of your video views will come from  search from related videos and you know and from sharing and that's just kind of  a that wasn't a console you know I wasn't. No it's not at all because you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  want to have a the whole point of you existing as a career and the point of  YouTube backing you is they want you to be a brand and it shouldn't come up  through SEO through links through search that should be ancillary to you. You  should have a loyal following and that's where your value is right? Exactly so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  what I told them is like look this is if you're gonna do it like this this is  fine but the mistake that you all are continually making which is a Google  mistake is they they throw something out there and then try to explain it later  and I got the you know the YouTube guy who's a great guy to acknowledge that  and say he says I need to do a better job of letting my staff know so they can  let you know because the YouTube staff and I said you know just they don't do a  good job when we have these partner meetings it's the same old same old you  ask them a direct question they can't answer it either they can't or they or  they won't I don't know what the issue is but the thing is communication if  they told us this is the 10-step plan to the merge with Google Plus see what what  he told me is that we're only at 10% and if we're only and so there's gonna be  problems why not tell everybody that so we know that hey there's gonna be some  growing pains right now we're not at a hundred percent of this merger you know  that'd be you know that'll be helpful one more thing I suggested is that look  it doesn't have to be me it could be I just think it could be Phil DeFranco it  could be those a hundred original channels that are some of them are  getting cut but some of them are staying around somebody needs to be a champion  for this Google Plus and for YouTube so get a liaison to say you're absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right you're absolutely right I've been arguing that somebody I who doesn't like  me wrote a column in the New York Times last week arguing that we need auditing  of algorithms and I disagree with that there's this kind of demonization of  algorithms but what I have said for a long time when it came to disputes over  AdSense or over Google downgrading a site because it was presumed to be spam  that there needs to be an appeals process not just to Google which in those cases  has the power of God but to some kind of jury of your peers some kind of group  and Google just doesn't think you know humanly enough for that but I absolutely  agree I think if they had kind of a users council a producers council from  YouTube to be able to you know that it's not their company that's not a vote but  it's just so you can hear and know what's going on and also try to give  some input like you you went you drove six hours just to give them free advice

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  exactly so you know I would say would I do it would I be the liaison of course I  would but hey get someone with the big audience make those 100 original  channels force them to have to use Google Plus and I don't mean just  putting their videos there that's not using Google Plus that's that's that's  throwing it SEO you know using it integrating with it getting to like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so they'll your brand community there right which is what they want and they  want they want to know who likes you and they want to know who likes you and like  something else and that's that's where the value to Google comes in and all  this let me ask you different question Lamar on this whole kind of announcement  that they were gonna cut a bunch of channels and put a bunch of news  channels was that like trying to work in a newspaper these days where you  wonder if you're gonna be the one to get fired how did that all work you know it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  doesn't affect anyone like me because I was you know these were specific  channels that were funded and and given angel investing well I'm using the wrong  word but they would give a specific funding from you and there I mean I saw  off the beginning I looked at the list and I just knew which ones are gonna be  cut because you know I'm getting more views and a lot of them and I'm not  getting a penny from Google to do anything so I knew they were gonna be  cut there's gonna be some more specific ones coming in they're gonna tailor one  thing I mentioned I was a little upset about is they didn't have a tech  vertical at all you know all of these channels you know they got a shack  network you got the Madonna dance on as it wears the tech people but you know  maybe they'll working at it on some point no that's something I was worried  about they're trying to build these shows to be like TV the reason why so  many of them are failing in my humble opinion is for that reason YouTube  audiences don't want TV when they go to YouTube they want YouTube they want  personality as one of the reasons I changed my content to be more personable  because I was trying to be a show for so long and it shows just do not work on a  hole on YouTube there are a couple exceptions but most of the time it just

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it just doesn't work you absolutely need to be an ambassador for the content  creators on YouTube I mean I mean it's clear that they that Google needs  community ambassadors both producers and consumers but Lamar I nominate you  because you know what they need to do so it's interesting I didn't realize so  there are you two partners who have to who who have a relationship with Google  that involves an advertising relationship but then there are there's  this at the second level where where producers get funded like production  gets funded so like give you money and says make an episode you just make your  episode but then you have a deal with them and make and make revenue through

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  advertising is that is that correct yeah that's that's my deal that's 99% of  YouTube's deal you know this thing would happen a lot last year they were called  I don't know if it's called the original channels or premium channels yeah each  of them got anywhere up to a million dollars to make a production and you  know and then Google would keep all of the money that it would make off  advertising a lot of them just didn't they didn't make the numbers they were

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  getting the views oh so so that was kind of an advance Google would keep all the  money until you made back your advance and you'd make over that absolutely and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  what was weird is that it should be in YouTube's interest or Google's interest  to push those channels but I can only tell you of a few of the names of the  channels without looking at this they make a lot of them just weren't weren't  pushing that's what a lot of the complaints are privately coming from is  that hey you all are counseling us but how many times did you all promote us so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  talk again for a second Lamar about the secrets of success for YouTube channel  personality but but is are there channels that have content are they  purely entertainment you know what are some of the things that make your mind a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  business success on YouTube I think personality is first and foremost and  that's where a lot of people fail that's where I was failing for a while because  I didn't you know it's a it's about the audience and as much as I'm a control  freak and like to control my stuff I have to acknowledge that without the  people watching you know the channel it doesn't exist so that's first and  foremost and yeah you you gotta have you gotta have great content I know that's  cliche to say have great content but you really have to have something that that  appeals if I have 13th or 17 year old to majority watching me which they do you  know I you know I have to appeal to that group you know if it's a bunch of boys I  better not do too many videos on One Direction you know I better not make it  too geeky and tech-heavy so you have to look at your I look at my stats almost  every week to try to tailor the videos to specifically match those people is  and a lot of it is just luck Jeff I don't be honest you can have I mean you  can have everything down and you understand marketing 100% on YouTube but  a lot of it just comes down to luck who shares you and and who I thought you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  said looks I honestly thought you said looks and of course that was I know why  you succeed them you're the handsome guy on YouTube I get it he is one handsome

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  fellow yeah have more numbers than that it sounds like you're saying Lamar to  have a successful YouTube channel which I think is the goal I think this is the  golden rule for any kind of content online is knowing your audience  interacting with your audience using analytics to figure out what your  audience wants giving them what what they want but also remaining true to  yourself and doing the content that you're passionate about because if  you're not passionate about it that's gonna that's gonna come across right  but like striking that balance between your ideas and your inspiration but also  knowing your audience and serving them what what what they want or what you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  think that they want connecting with them what you and Jeff does is it any  different it's the same principles for blogging or for this show you know you  do things to connect to the audience and that's why it works for you all so well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well we also we also sit in the penumbra of Leo report yeah and you know somebody  at my school said last week was Leo back you know he doesn't get any views  without Leo there I thought well thanks a lot it's it's it's true you know and  and and he really has the you know that spirit and last week it's hard to get  last week when I sat in in Gina's chair you know the second substitution it's  it's a different mindset right it's a different mindset or thinking oh my god  I keep this thing going and what's happening and and you know it's already  talked enough and all this kind of stuff and to be friendly and inviting and  those are all the things that Leo keeps in his head that we don't have to yeah  you know we gotta have opinions we got to talk we got to do this we got to do  that but we really you know don't have to that does does YouTube ever try to  give you advice about how to be better succeed more get more audience anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  like that yeah yeah I've gotten personal calls from you know YouTube reps or they  you know where they have these partner meetings that are a lot general they've  also come out with a playbook which gives first-time people the basics and  on how to do your titles how to optimize for search but I want to be honest that  playbook and all of those general things work for the very very beginner after  that you have to play ball and I'm not saying you have to do anything unethical  whatever but you have to play ball with everybody else you try to be 100% up and  up and do it exactly by the book you it just will not work they want it they  want everybody to do it like that but that's not that's not you know the  realistic thing on YouTube you got you got a you got to do what you got to do  to make a living and I for the longest time I've been you know the super moral  guy and having jumped in so it's frustrating to look at other people fly  past me who aren't doing half of what I'm doing as far as quality but you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they're doing side steps yeah you got you got a hustle you got a hustle I mean  think when you write online too it's tough when you see other other  publications doing crazy slideshows and fly over ads you know the kind of page  view trickery that people do and they get crazy page views but they're doing  it but you know you got a hustle like you said sometimes yeah I mean I imagine  Google's playbook for getting better YouTube is using various tools you know  to share and to you know promote and I'm sure that they offer analytics tools and  that kind of thing but yeah it seems like that would be the the basics right  and then once you're in it you got it you got to do your thing yeah so yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and just and just to make sure Google and everybody is aware I mean I I have no  issues with Google Plus I have no issues with with YouTube other than better  communication on what's on what's going on and and I think that came across to  Vic he really appreciated it and and just here and while I'll talk to the man  like I love the services I really do that's how I'm you know primarily make a  living so I just we just wanted to be better because like as I told them guys  if you don't fix this you lose money and I lose money I said don't you want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  make money and they should appreciate it they should appreciate it greatly as I'm  sure they do and as you say Vic's a very a very gracious guy and yeah you you  went out of your way six hours out of your way to give them attention all right  one last question did you at least get a free lunch out of this free free lunch

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know I gotta say I did well I had Vic and they're in office I was like you  know dude I'm here six hours next to seven you know I'm just saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it didn't work I you know I think there's a larger question here about the  merge about you merging YouTube and Google Plus I think we talked about this  a little bit when you're here last time Lamar is this idea that you have this  really established community with with with rules and kind of social norms at  YouTube that's very established community and then you have this kind of  new thing Google Plus and you can kind of see you can kind of imagine how these  are gonna merge right so thumbs up become plus ones comments become actual  Google Plus comments you know subscribe become you know circle and and it all  becomes kind of the same the same thing but you know you you always risk I think  when you have someone like you Lamar who's embedded in the community who  loves the platform and to make a living off the platform and who you know  engages in the platform that there's a difference between being the user and  being a creator I mean that the folks at Google they've always been very  analytical and maybe a little divorced from kind of the human aspect of these  tools I mean in their mind merging the two makes a lot of sense and and having  this sort of this consistent experience I think is the word that they've used  across all Google products that makes sense in the long term but there's  always that risk of that backlash of the established community I mean YouTube's  been around has it been ten years almost ten years right it's just it's just tough  when you start changing the way that things work for the consumers and  producers and I just think in that process it you know would behoove  Google and I hope that they that someone there is listening and they take our  advice to have sort of ambassadors and a liaison and I'm glad that Vic called you  up for a meeting I'm glad you went up there but that shouldn't have to happen  after you know you wrote an essay to him and an email that there should be more  open communication so I hope to see that happen and I'm interested to see what  the next what would do you have any idea what the next big change in YouTube the  the plusification of YouTube is gonna be do you have any idea I'm thinking they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  really working on the real name thing like that's the that's the thing they're  pushing even for channels to have a page on Google plus and now already  people are you know not liking that idea because to them is like they're forcing  us to use this the service that we don't want to use but I think I think they want  to establish like Facebook to have the real names so they can weed out you know  just just like what happened with Facebook connect hit TechCrunch and  weeded out a whole bunch of garbage immediately and I think they want to do  that for YouTube comments things I think that's the next step and then that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  really important point you're right because the comments on YouTube are our

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  pain horrible right now classification there probably would really improve

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  those right I mean in theory and a plus one but I'm an advocate for the plus one  button versus thumbs up and thumbs down not because I'm a weenie and can't  handle thumbs down is that it doesn't it doesn't really do any justice I don't I  mean there's a reason why Facebook hasn't had it or Google doesn't have it  you know if you like the video you plus one if you don't you leave get out go  somewhere else as a creator so I think the signals from plus one would  definitely benefit us in search so I'm looking forward to it this has been a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  great great report I really appreciate this and and you're sticking around for  the whole show so we can talk about lots of things Gina and I are kind of sharing  Leo duties she's opening the show closing the show and I'll try to keep  some things going and go to commercials and stuff before we do that  Gina ready for the changelog let's do it  I tried to talk slowly for the for the sis the sequel there but a little bit of

Transcript:  Jeff Gina would you mind if I bop in here briefly to ask you are you saving  money Gina are you saving money for Edda's college education yes I know  she's a newborn right now but I gotta tell you take it from me I got a 20  year old 19 year old she's gonna be in college before you know it and if you  don't start saving now you might be in trouble so I got an idea for you if you  got it if you're saving for a rainy day if you're saving for college or saving  for health care I know a lot of us just put a portion of what we earn right in  the bank maybe you're trying to save up for a nice forward huh or a down payment  on a house I hope you know we're all disciplined enough to do it but can I  make a recommendation a great way to get more from your savings the American  Express personal savings high yield savings account high yield means you're  gonna get more than your bank offers it's it's nice because it integrates  perfectly well with your bank you don't have to change financial institutions  it's an online savings account so you can link it to your existing accounts  automatically transfer money as needed back and forth you can keep track of  your balance via a phone or the web 24-7 there's no minimums no fees you know  like that and you get that high yield and great phone support whenever you  want to talk to someone this is a great compliment to your existing financial  tools and this is probably where you should be putting that money for at a  the American Express personal savings high yield savings account it's an FDIC  insured account offered by the American Express Bank FSB for your savings needs  now how do you find out more it's simple personal savings comm slash online  savings personal savings one word comm slash online savings I'm typing it in I  just want to see if I got the right place there you go you're gonna like  this you're gonna really like this especially the high yield give it a try  today personal savings comm slash online savings that's the high yield savings  account from American Express Bank FSB member FDIC we thank Amex I'm gonna try  to get Amex to be on this show for a long time because I'm a bit of what was  it Jeff you said I'm a member since 1981 you said like 1974 wow and we thank them  so much for their support back to you Jeff and Gina isn't that great

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  keeps us in the conversation even when it's disembodied like I really got to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  set up one of those accounts for my baby  now that's what I'm gonna do so I think Leo's landing momentarily so maybe God

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  knows maybe he'll dash in at the end of the show if we go long enough but I  suspect he's just getting in now so you'll see Leo next week  fear not but for now you got to see him in commercials which gives you more  reason to watch the commercials hey all right so other news I am jazzed about  the word that Google and Dish Network are reportedly talking about Google  starting a phone network with Dish I saw Charlie Egan Ergan the head of Dish at a  an off-the-record business conference last week where it's no big deal he  talks about it all the time he owns a bunch of bandwidth now and he's been  doing deals and this that kind of stuff but he could start a phone network and  what a perfect partner wouldn't you just jump onto the Google telco what do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  guys think if they do it right yeah and they have an opportunity to do it right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they do the word is that it would be a data only right with phone would just be  the add-on yeah that's void that's Google Voice isn't that the starting  definition for us of doing it right is to recognize what really matters is data  after Sandy here AT&T you know nicely enough said that they would forgive  overages for minutes and texts for those of us in storm-ravaged areas but you  know the truth is we don't care about that what we care about is data

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  absolutely yeah I have that Verizon plan that you know that the share you know  share everything or whatever it's called where you you know the voice and Texas  and afterthought you get it unlimited free and I love that because it's really  putting emphasis on the data that's what we're all using so I will love phone  over I never want to have a landline again in my life you know so everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  needs to go over data to me totally agree and honestly I this is I mean this  is the kind of the dream is getting the data plan with the extra minutes I'd  like to get unlimited data and then just pay for whatever minutes I use because I  just use so few and honestly with Google Voice you don't even really need to pay  for text I'm pretty much a full-time Google Voice user and so you send text  messages via just your data connection so that that would be nice to although  Google Voice has its problems doesn't support MMS and so you know that and for  some delays here and there but yeah I would be really excited Google could do  this is this is Google's best interest right is to focus on data right because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google let's talk about two things you know first you said if they do it right  Gina define what right means what would be the ideal Google telco well thinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  completely from my the way that I consume services on my phone and and what  I want I would want pure I'd want pure data or unlimited data I'd want to pay  primarily for data like I said with with with minutes as an add-on with text as  sort of an optional thing and I don't want a freaking contract I don't want to  be locked into a contract for a few years I want it to be more like in Europe  where I could just be like hey I could switch to this phone or that phone or I  mean this is this gets into a carrier you know issue I mean obviously if I was  with the Google carrier you know I wouldn't I want them to create a package  that's so compelling that I don't want to have to go go anywhere else I'd want  to be I prefer GSM just because I travel internationally and yeah I just want them  to undo all the crappy things that every other carrier does to you and I'd want  them to do it because I'd want them to I'd want them to want to compel me to  connect to Google everywhere and anywhere that I am right so now so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lamar what about you what makes the ideal Google telco I think what Gina

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  said is perfect like I want unlimited data I don't want to have to think about  metering as one is one of the things I hated about voice and I'm glad that's  unlimited but I hardly call anybody or I don't have friends so people don't call  me so I just limited date I'd pay a hundred bucks flat for it and just  don't meter me and then allow me to have access so I use almost everything  Google I don't have an Android but I do have I use everything all the services  that Google offers so I just want easy access to that and no restrictions or

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  anything of interest multi-device consideration right I've got a Chromebook  I've got a Nexus 10 tab Nexus 7 tablet and I've got my Android phone and how  can I share those connections between them without hacks or without crazy apps  or just you know I'll pay a little extra reasonable price whatever I just want you  to know who I am what all my devices are I want all my devices to be online I  want this to be one reasonably priced package that's data centric and I don't  want I don't want to feel like I'm getting screwed over for data I'm not  using or minutes I'm not using or that I'm losing you know services that I  didn't use I just want to feel good at but the multi-device issue is definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's absolutely right yeah and and you know I think it's clever if if they  don't position it as a telephone company because telephone is the old way no no  no this is a data company this is this is Wi-Fi on steroids this is this is just  reuse and oh yeah by the way you can make phone calls because who cares about  that who does that anymore right and so it becomes a data company so two things  that about the business environment and the first is to Google's interest I've  said on the show before that it was Google's services not absolutely but  services that drove me to Google hardware and I'm really fully there now  I'm gonna talk about this on a later show but I am I am living through  Android and Chrome and it's working and because I use Gmail Maps calendar all  this stuff and it drove me to the hardware and now I I don't look back at  Apple at all there are now probably scud missiles coming into my home for saying  that but so Google can drive us to using their services more I've said on  the show too this is a signal generator Google will learn more about all of us  it's in their interests now the interesting thing to me though is what  does this do to Google's relationship just as the hardware that they're making  with a round robin of of hardware makers to try to also keep Android going in  that ecosystem what does this clearly do to their relationship with the telcos is  it is it does it free it from that does it mean that Verizon might stop selling  any Android phones where do you think this can they can they not do that  because Android is too big now Google's cleverly gotten that big what do you  think the reaction will be of the existing telcos to a Google tell oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  they're gonna be terrified of this you know they they didn't like you know they  don't like the ideal of Google Voice to begin with and for them to now step into  their territory is is gonna put some pressure on them I mean I can imagine  Samsung at some point say you know that that OS we were thinking about making  for our phones you know maybe we'll go ahead and make that to please the  carriers and and sidestep Android or you know do something like Amazon Day which  is steal it and make it your own but it's gonna be some trouble that Google  is stepping into too many areas one of our our upcoming stories is about power  you know they're stepping into and so that it's like where does it in and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  know a lot of people worried about that yeah um all right so by the way I still  have I received my Google Nexus for 8 gig only and I am such an erotic sob I've  still not opened it I'm still going around like I got a mini-sim I'm waiting  do I want to do it should I send it back happy I'm really happy with my Google  Nexus is a waste of money should I wait till later and get a 16 gig I don't know  what to do you got any advice should I open it not I don't know how you're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know how you have a brand-new shiny Nexus 4 in your presence and you  have not opened it I you have much better willpower than I'd ever have my  god are you dying to just break it out appeal that I love to peel the thing off  the front of the touchscreen it's like the best part do it just open it all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll get it in the break I also fear though I've got to switch Sims I'm  afraid that then that process the last time I did this switching from my iPhone  to the Google Nexus they took away my unlimited data and then a really really  nice guy mr. Hugo who works in a and a an AT&T store in the Midwest out of  nowhere saw me on Twitter and said I can't stand it we make that mistake and  and I he said I want to fix it for you at work tomorrow I didn't even know that  he went in on his vacation day to do this God bless you sir and yeah it's  really really great of them and you know a company should have a million mr.  Hugo's and then life is good because then they actually cared about the  customers so anyway I'm just scared of going switching Sims and I'm gonna mess  it up and I'm neurotic as heck would you open it more yeah it would have it would

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  have been opened in the box demolished and everything would have been very  excited just to play with it you know it could have some LTE I'll be a little  upset about that but you know I won't argue yeah I'm okay with that though

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  all right so some other other Android stuff while we're on this have any of  you have either of you gotten an invite to ingress or you can't Lamar because  you're not on Android Gina have you gotten an invite to ingress I haven't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and I don't know if I'm happy or sad about that because I it looks really  cool and interesting I have this wariness I think I have the same  neurosis that you have about gadgets about games I'm always worried about  describe what we know about it it's like losing my whole life I'm so scared  so I have not got an invite although it looks really really cool have you gotten

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in fighter you have you played no I just said it and I'm not game guy at all but  it looks really cool do you want to describe what it looks like Gina it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so I don't know that I even really have a good what I am from what I understand  it's sort of a real-world massively multi more game massively multiplayer  aren't online role-playing game is that is that correct so it runs on your phone  and from what I understand it gets you outdoors and you sort of explore your  neighborhood and there's some you know elaborate plot about the rebellion and  there's the missions and quests that's all that's all I really know from the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  same company that are the same now division of Google was going to be a  company that created the the tourist app what's it called I keep on always  forget field trip so you know it's a general strategy apparently of Larry to  get you to look up look up look up

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right tomorrow you're gonna say there's a huge problem with this you're asking  geeks to go outside and I'm not sure I'm not sure how that's gonna go over well  for them so well I'm worried about what's gonna happen I read a blog post

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  where someone said a big gamer said you know he got got an invite and wound up  going on sort of an impromptu two-mile walk around his neighborhood because he  was so engrossed in play so that's that sounds really that sounds good I mean  you know some block people so especially Southern California's but but yeah it  sounds really fun and and I do I do I want an invite so I maybe I'll start I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  actually got an invite guys yeah I did yeah I have now I only got it here let  me see if I can find a camera there we go I'm far far away but I only got this  invite this morning so I'm still on the tutorial mission what I'm doing right  now is I'm walking around the world finding XM which is this sort of matter  that I need to move forward in the game and so man I wish I let me see what I  can do here with with showing you guys what's going on this is gonna be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  quite so a video of it if you wanted to show that oh yeah you know what that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah here let me show first this is this is what I'm rest it's time to go there  you go good right so this is what I have right now and it's basically just a map  and there are little XM orbs around so you can see them further off here in in  the in the game sorry this is very impromptu so these these little orbs are  things that I need to to grab in the world so this this trek would would be  you know what I would do to pick up these these XM orbs and there's a few  over here once I do that I'm not sure what I'm gonna really do with these orbs  but that is what I'm in the middle of doing right now so you need to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  outside physically go outside and do it or you on the on the app so you have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah yeah so it it it harkens back to the navigation in Google Maps when you  do walk navigation to get to a place you have the normal arrow and sort of a  bubble around you so you I would be walking around Petaluma trying to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  these these orbs Lamar so right you're gonna see you're gonna suddenly see guys  you've never seen outside with skin paler than mine walking around trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to look at the world the problem that I had with it just in this tutorial  mission is to figure out where I'm gonna pick these up I'm actually walking down  looking at my phone on top of that I didn't have my headphones in so like I  was walking then it was like mission update you blah blah and it started  talking and there's people around me and that felt really weird like that my  phone was telling me that I had just gotten a mission right exactly and then  on top of that it looked like I couldn't turn off my phone screen put it  in my pocket walk in a direction and pick up these orbs what I really wish  would happen is it would say wow you've moved here's your history this is the  history that we've we've captured of you you went from your house to work then to  a place to get some food and then back to work during that that thing you picked  up this this many orbs that'd be great but it looks like right now that  functionality isn't in it and it is the biggest battery drain

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah well basically has turned you into Pac-Man pretty much yeah yeah except

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  except a very immobile Pac-Man that has to look at their phone to make sure that  they're going towards the correct orbs to get wrong you don't look up yeah you  look down at your phone the whole time now now this is just the tutorial mission  the video which if I was good I'd have up already the video it looks like you  will go to maybe like art structures or points of interest that might be pulled  from the field trip app and then you you may have to do something there you may  have to look at it or you may have to say something that you've learned maybe  there's a plaque that you have to read to to input into into the app it's it's  it's you it's still open I haven't gotten that far so I don't know it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  interesting that means Google's really never been into games like this before

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  true true true this is I mean this is the first game other than Google doodles  that I can think of that Google ever made and on top of that it's a full it's  a fully featured app with voice actors and and a complete user interface it  seemed yeah it really seems like this is this is a step beyond and and I here let  me go ahead and play the video that I have it it's it is hard to tell where  they're gonna go with with this where what their what their game plan is or  maybe it's just to have fun and to push the boundaries of Android and what the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  mobile space can do if there was a beef in the chat room said that Google needs  you to visit places they need more info on that would be hilarious yeah go to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to a restaurant and then what you have to input is the opening and closing time  of that restaurant and then you get XP or if you think about something more like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sandy you know like missions that help people you know like some so a situation  like Sandy go to this place pick up these supplies drop them off at this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  place real physical supplies that would be amazing amazing go to the homeless  shelter give some some soup to the homeless folks and then head back home

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right Thanksgiving morning if you if you spend time with the soup kitchen you get

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  XP right for example right and so if right now in the video it looks like you  can put down nodes and and then increase your your your then these two people  meet each other like they're playing the same game like that would ever happen  and and maybe you can increase your your reach amongst the city it seems like if  you were into it and and instead of a Facebook check-in whenever you landed at  a bar you opened up ingress and and started playing and putting down nodes  it might be compelling I just this tutorial mission might kill it for me  that the fact that I have to go on a big long walk to and keep my phone on the  whole time and look down at it to make sure I'm collecting orbs that might just  be the killer I might not be able to get past that so Gina are you tempted or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am kind of tempted I this sounds like a perfect game to come pre-installed on  the Google Glass right so you don't have to look down and it kind of happens  automatically I mean the only other game I've ever played game quote-unquote that  I've ever played that's really gotten me outs outside is or doing different  things outside is four square I go to a lot a lot of new different places with  four square I've been thinking about like when you have I mean I think  invocations are really powerful thing and so when you think about something  like this and you think about something like Google testing same-day delivery  from stores and you think about the way that Google you know like I said about  Sandy like creating tools for people to help one another find one another in  times of crisis like you really can see how you know imagine a time when you  know I've got a few hours something like a task rabbit I've got a few hours to  kill and I'd like to make a little extra money and Google just being like here go  do this pick this up drop this off at this person you know this person's house  and then we'll just drop a ten bucks into your Google Wallet account you know  they really kind of got all the different pieces to like program humans  to do their bidding which is kind of kind of weird but kind of fun for you I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  actually looked up my for the thing you're gonna mention at the end of the  show that I won't mention yet but I looked up my school's address and and  Street View had my school address wrong and yeah you could correct stuff yeah  yeah you can correct that. Who are you gamer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Console mostly you know but I don't think this would be cool until it gets

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on the iOS platform so I'm happy. Well well well then we're gonna go right to  the video of what we Android people think of you you you lemmings you you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  all right well it would not be an episode of twig without a paranoid whinging moments for me  worrying about the future of the internet and government threats to it but I'm glad at least  now I'm not alone because google has stepped up thank god at last and ahead of the ITU summit  coming up in December their warning of the dangers to an open internet the ITU has explained in one  of the videos we have here on the rundown is a very old government organization that was in charge  of telephone numbers and the and there are various efforts there was a leaked report out of the  kremlin that Putin wants the UN and the ITU to take more direct control of the internet away from  us to centralize it more to do all the things that are dangerous to the net so google put out  a video of nice people just saying that a free net matters to us and a free net matters to us and  a free net matters to us which is fine little namby pamby but good as far as it goes but they also  put out a site where they want to have people sign up if nothing else is a matter of awareness  and say yeah a free net matters to us now there are some who say that this ITU thing is not really  a threat but as far as I'm concerned every time a government steps up France Germany Russia China  Iran the United States of America the UK Australia Canada they've all all recently put in more  efforts to try to find more control over the net because the net threatens them and by god people  it's time for us to stand up am i ready for a march here I um you know I wonder if there's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a weariness I wonder if the government there's always just going to be these potential these  looming policies that are gonna that are gonna you know hamstring the internet I wonder if users  are gonna get tired of constantly having to you know we had you had sopa which was amazing right  and then but it feels like every month is like this is the new sopa right there's a there's  another new thing I actually thought that Google's video wasn't so great I like the video on what is  the ITU.org better video isn't it better video explains better what the ITU is this is a weird  thing it's like it's so it's 11 days until this meeting where a bunch of government officials  from different from different countries all vote on on policies and regulations that would  for the internet right and one each country gets one vote right and this was like a secret meeting  the details of this meeting and the details of the of the policies they're voting on were leaked  right this isn't something that people aren't you know it's a little different than than sopa right  I mean I guess it's not so different in that we have to pressure our politicians to to stand up  for the internet but it's you know it's one of those things where it's like oh again you know  we're in the middle of the holidays of course which I guess they schedule these things so that  you know they they get less less press I mean it worries me but on the same time at the same time  I'm like you know what people figure out workarounds for stupid policies yeah which we that's that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  always what you do that's always what you do this hacker you say don't worry about it Mr. Paranoid  we'll just find our way around it and I I pray for that I wish for that but I think if we don't deal  with the worst case and I always say don't deal with the worst case don't don't don't restrict  the internet because privacy the bad things could happen right so maybe I'm doing the same thing  here of just worrying about what the government could do to the internet but it really could you  know see what happens in China and Iran it really could we should we should worry about it right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we should care we should worry about it and I don't mean to be a cop for this to be a cop out  but you know even when I went to China it was like oh you can't get to Facebook from here I  couldn't get to Twitter but I figured out a way to tweet through you know a separate thing it was  it was a pain and it and it stunk but even you look at things like Weibo right like that's their  Chinese kind of Twitter stories get broken I feel like with the the the forward march is toward  openness and these are just kind of last-ditch attempts by people in power to to change that  I don't know maybe should I not have this totally I tend toward optimism and you tend to are you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  uh have is your glass right now half empty or half full you know I don't have uh an opinion on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  only because I haven't done enough research I don't want to just blab out and just say anything but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you what to think easily I have no problem doing that Lamar

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  yeah in general I mean the idea of anything free and open it sounds great I just you know before  I jump in and say yeah let's do it I want to read more on it which I didn't get a chance to do so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I apologize all right no that's that's absolutely fair um uh Chad I think about a minute into the  ITU video it starts to kind of say a little bit what is the ITU uh do you want to just show 30  seconds of it or did I pop this on you telegraph old as in morse code when founded in 1865 it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  called the international telegraph union unlike the internet the ITU was not built on open  discussions among scientists and engineers instead only governments have a vote at the ITU  and these votes take place behind closed doors if governments succeed in giving the ITU more power  to make decisions about the internet we get an old school top-down government-centric organization  replacing the open bottom-up governance that made the internet so world changing and that's just the  beginning of our problems the ITU is not transparent the ITU's draft proposals aren't public and it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what the ITU is and where it goes let me bounce around a little bit I want to come back to Google  and freedom in that but but but related to this is that there was a another alarm that went off  Matt Cutts sent me to the ITU thing originally and there was another alarm that went off this week  when Senator Leahy reportedly backed a changes in a in a bill that was intended to give our email  greater protection and then turned the bill into the exact opposite where it was going to allow  22 government agencies including the justice department to have warrantless access to not  only our email but also our Google Docs also our Facebook walls also our Twitter direct messages  not only without warrant but without notice that this was happening and it was the the quickest  furor I've ever seen there was a furor within I think about 12 hours and suddenly Leahy was  backing away from it like it had cooties which was a good thing which is a great thing  but it does show that we do have the power I think to stop these things sooner and I think this guy  saw images of SOPA in his head and wanted to get away from it did you guys have any sense of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  going on it was this over so fast that that happened so fast that I that I missed it and  I'm glad that it happened because that is complete BS that's complete BS and so I'm glad that we have  SOPA so that politicians can can back away very quickly from anything that causes an uproar like  that I mean that's a that kind of thing is especially in Google's interest to to take care  of right and any anybody who provides cloud services has to has to fight that kind of thing  and I think it's absolutely right for users to be absolutely outraged and and I'm feeling regretful  about what I said earlier I'm not saying that that people should be apathetic about these things we  do need to care about these things I think you know you're absolutely right you know what your

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  governments are doing if we cry wolf too often if you put up the cat signal signal too often  then when when when the real threat is there we won't route troops so you're you're absolutely  right to worry about that I that's why I don't know when we shouldn't and should not you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this this schmidt there's a there's a video I hope I'm not jumping around too much but there's a video  in the rundown about yeah schmidt was doing a doing a little bit a little bit of a talk about  government regulation and a few different topics but he said something interesting about Egypt which  was that you know when there was the the demonstrations were happening in Egypt people knew that they were  happening you know just another demonstration whatever but it wasn't until the government  shut off the internet that people were like wait a second something's going on and they did not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  side with the government you know so that's what that was an interesting point he said they realized  they had a choice and a lot of them chose the revolution yes yes and so and that revolution

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  happened right so I mean you know it's not too late when it happens but it really it is one of  those things it's like if if one if one of these crazy insane laws passed in the United States that  that censored sites or I just feel like people go bananas and that was part of schmidt's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  schmidt schmidt said in this video I think was an interview for the rand corporation and he said that  Google's pinning a lot of hope on the internet becoming so integral to people's lives that they  will not tolerate that happening yes and so you just recognize how Google more and more  it's it's yes its interests are aligned with the internet and the business model is very simple  Google said it very very simply the more people use the internet the more money Google makes period  so it's in Google's interest to have a free and open and widely used internet and to be able to  do that and so they are fighting for a principle that matters to us as well now granted when I  when I promoted this this this effort for them to against the ITU a lot of people in comments  and Twitter said yeah how about their deal with Verizon and I agree I can't stand what they did  with Verizon neutralizing net neutrality in a way but yeah when schmidt talks about this stuff I  think he's eloquent and and hopeful and and has a point he also said in the same video that that  parents should have the internet talk before they have the sex talk with kids which I think is is a  great way to look at it but but in line with this there's a story that's related that that Google  is now and very quietly those I didn't see a lot of coverage of this yet but is pushing for  a vast increase in the amount of Arabic content on the net which I think is exactly what the  strategy that you just said Gina is the more people use it feel that is part vitally part  of their lives and part of their society the harder it's going to be for governments to turn

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it off yes now can we rewind a bit as a new parent the that caught my eye the whole you should have  the internet talk with your kids before the sex talk so you're a much more experienced parent than  I am Jeff and and also I know you have things I've done wrong Gina well and I know you have very  strong opinions about about publicness and privacy and and the benefits of being public online and  you know my daughter is only two months old but I'm already I'm thinking about you know how am I  going to talk to her about when she gets online how am I going to talk to her about the information  that she shares and you know should I raise her being scared and being worried and having  to use a pseudonym or fuzz her details or you know am I going to raise her with the idea that  that that privacy is safer right I mean in a way I feel like I need to do that because when she's  13 when she's 12 13 14 you know I don't want her publishing Instagram photos of her and her friends  like in their bikinis at the beach you know because like that freaks me out that there would  be creepers you know looking at my daughter for example right um but at the same time I do want  her to understand the benefits of of publicness and the the connections that you can make with  people in the communities that you can tap into and the support and the resources that you can get  like you've talked about so many times with your illness and and even just you know take down the  companies like Dell and that kind of thing right but but when she's a child it does feel like a  matter of safety so how do I teach her to be safe but not be but also appreciate the benefits of  publicness I don't know I don't know I mean what did you talk to your kids about I'm lucky because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because my son Jake uh Facebook was not available for high school students until he was in high  school he was the first class that had uh Google and had Facebook in high school Mark Zuckerberg  was in the first class that had Google in high school which was interesting uh Jake was the first  class on Facebook and they kind of set the rules and they knew what they were doing and it was  still a closed world right adults couldn't get in then it was just high schools it was it was  you know younger people you couldn't quite get in yet um and he's sensible and I and I and I you know  I think I think parents generally have to learn more than anything to trust their kids my daughter  doesn't really like doing it uh Jake said you're gonna have to in high school she does but she's  not that much into it so I don't really have this problem uh that I know of to to deal with that I  think I think there's a surprise problem in Facebook which is to be surprised to me which  is that it's not so much that what people reveal it's that you end up comparing yourself to the  idolized versions of other people's lives and right so you see you see a a version of the world  right which can be good or bad then again a colleague of mine said that his um when his  daughter was I think uh in second grade or first grade she was using the net and a friend of hers  said uh search for boys kissing boys nothing wrong with that but that wasn't all she got obviously  yeah and we got really scared and came in mommy what the heck is this vision of the world I haven't  seen right so yeah it's difficult but I think in the end you know there's there's a columnist  former columnist I used to work with at the daily news named Lenora Skanezy who talks about raising  free-range kids and she's very controversial in New York because at an early age she sent them out  in the subway and she said we you know they gotta learn these things on their own they gotta do this  stuff I'm tending to agree with that I'm tending to think that that they were raising children as  veal yeah and and that's not my line it's somebody else's but too protected now I'm not suggesting  that we throw them out there in the world but I do think we have to arm them with the judgment  and tools to be able to deal with things and we have to also arm them with the trust to have the  judgment and and be ready to talk about stuff for up until the age when they stop talking to you  Gina which happens right what do you think what's your advice to Gina yeah this is interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because I don't know if you all knew I used to be an elementary school teacher so this was around  the time where myspace and tag.com were coming up and you know the kids you know it was new so they  would post their inappropriate things there and you know one one thing I never wanted to do even  though the school started to do it you know school schools will block things I really wanted the kids  to get the education of why they shouldn't what's the reason behind it and I think that's the most  important part is that you they're going to do it I mean now I'm not in teaching now but to try to  block the internet on in schools is crazy now because they'll just flip up their phone and be on  LTE do what they're going to do so you can't stop it the best you can do is educate them on it so  you know for Gina maybe you know as she gets older coordinating with the with the school system so  that there's a one-two punch on you know saying you don't use the internet it's scary has creepers  so does so does walk into the subway so does walk into a store to get something there's creepers  everywhere you know that's you know you have to learn how to army cells against that but the most  important part is the education of why it's a bad idea to put certain content out online the  ramifications of it even though like eric schmidt said in a in a article yeah your criminal record  gets wiped at 18 but you know in the u.s but not you know your social life that that's the imprint  that stays forever so you just have to be more careful about it so yeah number one you know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  think as I think about it I think the key word that I would think of if I were you is to teach  her that she has control yeah and that that's the essential idea and and and and Dana Boyd talks  about this a lot that that young people do worry about their privacy and that they they they have  mechanisms to it as she puts it they control meaning over just mere communication and but here's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  thing if something goes viral you don't really have control you know if you post a picture  somewhere like it doesn't go away you might not have you know if she posts something embarrassing  I worry about this as an adult and heck and I have the same problem as what you were saying earlier  you know seeing the idolized versions of other people's lives and becoming kind of a bit of a  performer like these platforms sort of encourage you to perform some you know idealized version  of yourself to share with your friends and I think those are all really interesting sort of  sort of effects of these platforms but but there isn't I mean this was schmidt's point right that  there isn't a delete button that once you shared something online I guess what I'm saying is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  same thing I'm agreeing I'm agreeing that that there's a moment when she loses control  and that moment is when she exposes her her her moment her real identity her whatever  and that she should feel jealous control of those parts of her life and they are hers to control  they're not even yours to control to some extent because she's going to do what she's going to do  right that she's got to realize that value the problem is children are not taught to look forward  right so I'm all in favor of not allowing  Facebook to 13 year olds right but but that's but that's not the way the world works Dana also  found that the majority of 12 year olds are on Facebook and that 76 percent of their parents  help them do that pew just had a survey that I haven't read yet but I just saw it come out  yesterday about about privacy and kids and parents are concerned we know that you know but I think  to your point Lamar part of this becomes and I'm being very idealistic here but part of this becomes  my belief that and I've said on the show before where it's it's my theory of mutually assured  humiliation that at some point we become a more tolerant society when we realize that we all had  embarrassing moments when we were young so what and if and if you're the person who rejects someone  because they did something stupid 10 years ago then you're the bozo not the person who did the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  stupid thing but are you so let's talk about Zuckerberg remember when Narc was 19 or 20 years  old and he said that his users were idiots Facebook users were idiots for sharing their  information with him right and so now he's one of the richest people in the world and head of one  of the most powerful internet companies in the world are you able to forget that he said that  at that point and I know he said look I was a kid it was stupid I shouldn't have said that  because he learned still in my head though that at some point during when he was making this thing  he said that to someone so carelessly like over I am I forget what the quote I think he's just said

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like but I also think that if that had stayed the essence of the culture of Facebook and the  essence of his worldview he would have failed that he only could succeed if he learned and  grown and and matured enough to see where the value really was and where trust really was  and I think that it speaks to because otherwise then we were a million we're a billion dupes  we're a billion idiots and I don't believe that I really don't I believe that we're a billion  people who use his platform and that he recognizes the value of that and then he could learn the  lesson and I think you know if you look at any major executive and try to go back into their  career when they were that age there were dopes right one of them surely right right I'm suspicious

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of things that Facebook does especially around privacy and partially because that story is stuck  in my head and partially because there was that major motion picture made about what he you know  whatever that was not representative of a reality but that stuff gets kind of stuck in your  consciousness I mean I think Facebook has made such a compelling product that a billion people  use it but I don't know that's still it's still kind of in my head so it's so it's interesting I  mean I want to be enlightened to the point where I can say hey you know god knows I have plenty  things that I had stupid things that I did when I was 20 years old that I'd be embarrassed to be  you know public or you know that people I wouldn't want people to judge me on now  but I do want to get to that place where we just say hey you know what anything that happened  before you were 20 or before you're 25 before you were 30 let's get crazy doesn't count

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah that that line moves doesn't it Gina then when you get up to where my age is of course it's  it's because I'm old and and and and feeble that I do stupid things so it's okay you get the excuse  back let's go on to a few other topics because we got we got a whole bunch of legal stuff I kind of  want to you know go through with some some dispatch so we can get on to other things but there's so  much happening this week around around both Google and around some some legal and legislative matters  um I got into a debate in the UK I happened to tune in to a hearing that was held by the finance  committee of the parliament in the UK led by a woman named Margaret Hodge where she was just  eviscerating Google and also Starbucks and Amazon arguing that they weren't paying their fair taxes  and that they were using havens in Ireland and Bermuda and this was awful and so on and so forth  and the Google guy I think kept saying as best he could we're just doing what's legal and she said  it's legal but it's immoral and so I had fits on Twitter saying this is ridiculous  you know what do you MPs voluntarily pay more taxes what's Google to do is to is to decide their  own tax rate and what they think what what what should be considered fair and then what do they  do that in every country in the world every country wants a piece of their skin so the the  observer that is to say the Guardian Sunday paper had me do a debate with her online we'll put it  up on the rundown but it's it's a fascinating and very emotional issue and especially in Europe  where there are fights around taxes here in the US we wish that Google would bring more of its  revenue on shore they're not paying taxes and some of the revenue overseas they're saying well  we're mainly an American company it's why we don't pay a lot of it here a lot of our real values in  America clearly every country wants their piece of the pie speaking of which France has just  outright sent a bill to Google for two billion dollars saying you just owe this because you owe  it because you're not doing things the way you should even though the things that Google is  doing they have lots of lawyers are illegal what do you guys think all right first I want to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  about your article I read it and I laughed because you and I are so alike and that you smashed her  because there was there was nothing nothing she said after what you said made any sense after  that because when we all do our taxes what what happens you know we we'll do whatever it takes to  get a deduction or a or you know a tax break and and so that's all these companies are doing it  they're within the law and you when you mentioned about the looking it up on the Bible I was just  done I was like okay Jeff knows how to argue so see it was I was shooting the fish in the barrel  I know but you you were right it's I mean it's what that that you know country allows so if you  want to change it like you told her we'll go and change the law that's what you do that's your job  if you don't like it change otherwise hush I think that's what you were saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah I mean it seemed I thought I thought that the larger point right is that this is sort of  our reckoning the global global marketplace sort of reckoning with with the future what business  you know how business runs now and you know it's tough like I I agree Jeff that you you won that  debate I could see how you know you were saying why would a company voluntarily pay more taxes  and she was saying I'm not we're not asking you to voluntarily we're just asking you to pay  local taxes but of course the laws exist that everything that Google is doing sort of is is  legal so it's so the the issue is they have to change the laws so that's not possible right  um but yeah it's it's a really interesting debate it really is just about like our legal  infrastructure international legal infrastructure allowing for the kinds of businesses and the kind  of global marketplace that we have now and and laws take longer to catch up to technology right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well and also also it's it's not just about that it's and when I go to Europe I see this and this  is this look at me in trouble with folks in our international audience but I but I sense that  there's kind of in some circles not all circles but in some circles there's two other forces  there's a bit of anti-americanism going on oh and another big American company and there's a little  bit of it's not anti-capitalism but anti-big company anti-corporate think there and so that  if you're this big successful company you're such a target speaking of which now there's been talk  in both the EU and the US of going after Google for anti-trust um and so that was the report going  into the rundown and then this morning there was a piece up on uh Bloomberg that said that the US  government is now wavering on the idea of going after Google for anti-trust not sure that they've  really found a consumer harm not sure they found anything wrong and this is in the vertical search  areas this is in the idea that they that they benefit their own stuff and so reportedly the  FTC really wanted to go after uh Google uh John Liebowitz was uh was hankering for that but uh  says one report in Bloomberg um no they're not doing anything illegal or anything wrong and  there's no consumer harm but we've had this discussion a little bit on the show before  do you think that going after Google for anti-trust is a worthy investigation or a witch hunt

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I always tend to think that going after a big company uh and investigating their what they're  doing is that's not a battle that I'm like usually willing to fight because you know  Google's got plenty of money they got plenty of power they got plenty of lawyers and they'll be  able to to work it out I think that it's important for us to kind of question what big companies  are doing are doing big powerful companies are doing and you know I don't I don't think it's a  witch hunt I think it's I think it's a healthy thing to question that just from the standpoint  of like if you're gonna if you're gonna go after anybody I think it's you know it's the people with  the armies of lawyers and tons of money that they're kind of worth worth questioning I know  that people see them as a big target but I think it's just kind of a healthy part of the system to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it the price of success I'm interested is there an arc to the story that if ever you become  successful then then you become suspect is that a necessary you really think so oh I do I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  yeah I do happen with Microsoft and it's happening with Google there's talks of wanting to break them  up into you know different sections so yeah that's the price you paid and kind of sucks you know you  want to build a big business you know you know you're going to get attacked as hard as this and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if I agree with that yeah the problem is then then then if you if you yeah if you don't  want to live with that kind of hassle in life then it's moderation to an extreme isn't it it's  just saying okay I don't want to grow that big I don't want to go public I don't want to grow that  big I want to stay small that your limit the kind of growth you can have if you automatically become  suspect it's kind of the belief that well Siva Vatanathian kind of says corporations must be evil  is that what you're saying Gina would you go that far

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  corporations no I wouldn't say the corporations must be evil but I think it's very easy for them  to become evil I think it's just important for I think in general it's important for people to  question both companies and people who are very wealthy and very powerful pretty much all not all  the time but whenever there's a question the question should be should be asked you know Google  they they're they're gonna be okay they they're gonna be able to fight their fight they're not  you know I don't you know I'm not worried about them I don't know maybe am I being too uh I  think it's important to question those in power in general yeah I think I think that's that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  true and I certainly say it about government all the time when I gave a talk about about public  parts in Germany before I wrote the book and I talked about the German paradox somebody said  what about the American paradox that you Americans have good government more than we've had but you  distrust government more than we do and maybe that's why we have better government and maybe  the same can be argued about companies though note that Google you know but this one report  may be on a on a road away from antitrust the other good news for Google this week is that  Hamburg in Germany has decided not to prosecute based on the data collections on Street View  saying there was no criminal intent so no harm and no criminal intent one more legal thing and  then we'll move on to back to Geek's Geek World but there's just so much legal stuff is a fascinating  moment this week where the Republican Research Council I think it's called released a very brief  white paper on copyright that was just so unbelievably sensible and smart and said that  you know copyright was not really there are myths about copyright it wasn't just intended  to remunerate creators it was intended to improve and increase creativity and an innovation  and that it's gone on too long and that we need these following reforms and it was a great thing  and then you could know exactly what happened which was that Hollywood got their  clause into Republican lawmakers and the report was pulled offline though Lauren Weinstein god  bless him managed to cash it before it got put there and I thought it to be a fascinating moment  where the RSC said that we take pride in providing informative analyses but this thing just kind of  didn't go through proper channels I don't believe that for a second I think that it got out there  and then Hollywood went berserk so I recommend reading reading Lauren's  cashing of the old document because I think it's it's it's from the Republicans and it's a good  you know even so is my tone my my presumption here even so it's a I think a very sensible and  very good view of copyright did either of you have a chance to look at that at the original

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't I didn't but so much for Eric Schmidt saying that we shouldn't be a  society of information leakers I mean in some cases it really it's a good thing yeah exactly

Transcript:  Lamar you want to start um yeah I thought the story about the youtube app and the nintendo we was  pretty cool because it's the first time they're widely pushing out the webm video codec so it's  supposed to be cleaner simple interface it's funny that the we is the only console that's out there  hasn't had uh you know youtube on there so it's great to see it looks it looks good I have not  played with the Wii U I may do that tonight at a friend's house just to see how it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  what I would ask you is this do you if you have a console do you watch  youtube on it I have a very hard time watching youtube on a on my 47 inch I'd rather watch it  on my phone or on the desktop vice versa I can't watch hulu on my desktop it irritates me I feel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like I have to wait up who actually has tv I do I do I actually have google tv you know I've started  to use youtube's watch later function uh so as while I'm working I come across videos I want to  see later I hit watch later and then when I'm feeding the baby on my my google tv I just bring  up the what my watch later list and it just cycles through it so I yeah I have been watching videos on  my big screen just because the google tv the youtube app on google tv is actually  pretty pretty nice yeah you know I can't watch videos like entertaining videos kind of at my  desk while I'm in work mode because it just feels you know I feel kind of trapped like oh I'm you  know I'm in this weird different mode so I enjoy I enjoy watching on the on the big screen I really  but only because of google tv I don't I've never used I don't even know if there's an app for xbox

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  which is the console I have yeah it's just it's just like for hulu I can't I can't stay  watching on my desktop I need to be laying down on my couch or bed to and that relaxation I still  haven't parted from the tv yet so I need maybe I need help I don't know but I haven't transitioned

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yet do you know a story you want to pick out um just sort of quick story apple's having a black

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  friday sale have they ever done this before I don't think so I don't think so either apple never does  this kind of thing I mean I didn't think that they ever had sales period really I thought the  price was the price was the price but yeah if you go to apple.com it says there's a one day  shopping event it looks like it's if you shop online or in a retail store and I've been kind  of having this not argument but this little debate about black friday amongst my geek friends in fact  lamar tweeted in on it at some point where I was saying you know you know at this time of year  every gadget tech blog does some sort of rant about how black friday is stupid and the deals  aren't really good and all the people tent you know camping out outside the best buyer dumb and  whatever and um you know I find that kind of interesting I think I said something like you  know it's it's easy to to rant about black friday when you can afford to buy everything at full  price and you know people people like deals because they you know they're strapped uh but uh and which  conversation went from there I don't everyone's got a different opinion about black friday but  it looks like you can get some deals on apple stuff just just by shopping online so it's  interesting it felt like a departure from apple's general retail strategy by the way if you go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  black friday.com you can see the black friday circulars for all majors best buy walmart sears  dell all those places right now and know what it is you're going to get it and of course a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just to irritate them I think you most stores with a decent policy will let you bring in the receipt  and get the get the lower price I think apple has done that when they've lowered prices I think  I think I could be wrong don't check me on that all right I'll give you one story and then we'll  do our our closing bits I found it interesting Cory Booker who's the mayor of Newark and full  disclosure I'm an advisor to waywire which is the company he helped start during Sandy he was  absolutely incredible on Twitter my wife pushed me to make sure to subscribe to him he's always  pretty amazing on Twitter but during during Sandy he was quite amazing where he gets out in Newark  he gets around the town people would tweet him with problems he would tell people where to drop  off things he's just really really quite remarkable well he got into a fight on Twitter  about the cost of food and food stamps this and that he took he took a challenge where he's going  to live on food stamps for a week with whoever was challenging him on Twitter he figures it's  about four dollars a day in food cost and this all happened on Twitter and he's going to do it on  Twitter and it's really pretty amazing to watch a politician live that publicly among his constituents  using these tools and I just love it he's going to be president he's amazing yeah he's trying to  decide now whether run for governor or senator from New Jersey we'll see what happens Chris  Christie did himself pretty well and I'm a Democrat but he did himself pretty well in the  storm and you know I think GOP has been making a fool of themselves criticizing him for talking  to the president before the election but you know Christie had to call Murdoch to kind of apologize  for being nice to Clinton I mean for to Obama but yeah Booker's got a history got a future  and he's building himself a good history all right so shall we move to Gina your tip of the week
