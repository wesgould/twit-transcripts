Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hello

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Boy there were so many big stories this week. It's kind of hard note to know where to start  but I think probably the district court judge who threw out the  FTC lawsuit against Facebook along with 48 state attorneys general  Saying wait a minute guys  You didn't prove that Facebook is a monopoly now. I have to point out the judge  The judge was a little salty  He said you act as if everyone accepts that Facebook is a monopoly

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you have in fact not given me any evidence, but that's so true about how the discussion is going these days  So, of course, we're in film bubbles. Of course, it's a monopoly  And and in a suit you gotta you gotta come up with the evidence you yeah, you have to prove it they didn't do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well good or bad news depending on if you're Mark Zuckerberg or not  Is that the there there are 30 days to refile and the FTC could very likely and many experts say  Within 30 days provide that evidence to the judge. So the judge didn't really throw out the case  He just said you look you got you got to give me something. Give me help me out here  Give me something to work with what they say get your act together what you know, Ben Thompson said, of course, it's not a monopoly  What would you say I guess you probably agree with Ben Thompson Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, cuz I put that in the rundown and you didn't we've already got over the  And you don't and I aired Ben's opinion and you generously are now area in his opinion as well actually you said I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Not Ben Thompson's Benedict Evans. Well, also both actually, you know and put in Ben Evans  Okay, I put in I put in Ben Evans and Ben Tom. Oh, I didn't erase them both I guess so  Disagree so the monopoly would be in  personal social networks PSN's  What is that? Well, and I think I think it I think it would be monopoly would mean that they had a dominant position  And I think you could say well, what about Twitter and all, you know and this  What about us yeah, what about what we're doing right now, we're not a social network in that work that all you want was

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is this actually? What is it? So what is a social network? Actually? What is a social network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Some the thing you got a different  Monopoly in it what a lot of if you the takeaway for a lot of people was oh, that's right  Because our antitrust laws are out of date. They were written in the 30s and they need to be rewritten. In fact  One member of Congress said this is exactly why we have

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  six antitrust goes in front of us. Well, let's go to that how bad those are but but  No, I think that they shouldn't be rewritten for the time  They should you should go for the principle  But the question is our antitrust as opposed to Europe is based on consumer harm  Now if you want to change the nature of antitrust  Then you do it for everybody every company every industry and that's okay  But it shouldn't we shouldn't be directing this at one set of companies we should be talking about  What we expect for fair competition and consumer benefit

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think let me pose this question to you to you all not just you Jeff, but to all of you  the thing that I think  Congress and the FTC are concerned about is the idea that Facebook  When it saw a competitor coming along would just acquire it. So that's what they did with Instagram. That's what they did with whatsapp  It's what they tried to do with snapchat and since it's failing that with snapchat  They essentially duplicated the features of snapchat and Instagram thereby took away enough market share that snapchat was no longer a threat. So  How about that? I mean that's not  Currently that's one of the laws by the way would specifically address that I gather that that the Sherman antitrust act has no  What's the tension of that idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What Thompson says is that when Instagram was bought it was mocked because all this is too small  What are you doing?  And now it's big and and would it have been big on its own without Facebook or did Facebook make it big?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  These are hard to show that you can't really do. Yeah, additionally the FTC approved the merger  So yeah, it's not like they weren't given the chance to stop it in  Progress and in fact that kind of underscores your first argument because the reason they approved it as well  Hell you just bought a little app with 27 people  Who cares it could be an acquirer. Yeah  But I but but what about that Stacy should companies be  Prohibited from acquiring competitors to stifle competition  Explicitly to stifle competition. Well, they're not gonna say mark didn't step up. So, you know, we got to buy Instagram  They're gonna kill us. Although I  There are  Emails  So maybe that would be something that the FTC didn't know about it. Maybe yeah, so  Yeah, whether they say so or not if it's if it's this is  Visibly the problem case

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is where I do think we need some updates if not at the legal level at the regulatory level  So in part of this is this is why I hate social networks. I don't I don't think about them because I don't know enough about them  I don't like them. I  Don't I don't have a theory about them like I do about harder technology but like in  For example when the FTC is evaluating like telecom mergers, they have a set of standards that defines the monopoly  The height it's the Heifman her  Something I could ever remember. Anyway, they've got math they could do that. I  Don't know if they could establish those equations and in doing so we would have a debate over how good those equations are and what?  We should measure and all of that that would be one way to come about this and then be able to prove that's that's basically  What I think the judge is asking them to do which is to define what the whatever social network market  Yeah, what is your market where and then you know, I  Do think we should think about the potential for consumer harms even though  That's hard when you're buying an app  I don't think we have  So we should be defining the market  But then we should also be taking a very hard look at what network effects can enable  With regards to stifling competition and that's probably a separate  Process or should be and it should be individual of  The big companies and should look at the entire market and what kind of advantages that that has and brings and we should figure out  redresses to that harm  If there's harm could be applied horizontally, there's definitely harm associated with network effects

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's also also benefit. I mean you go back to your question. Well, that's a lot of company. That's the point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we've got to discuss like what what harms are okay, what are the trade-offs because we we can't just  We can't just say well, this could be good or it could be bad  I mean, that's kind of like saying technology is a tool and it's neutral  Yeah, it is but we as a society then have to come in and actually do something the government actually has to govern that so  That's what we need to be talking about. I think the other hand here we have the people that are governing this be

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Up to snuff on all of this technology educated on it, you know  Don't have someone that knows nothing about social media platforms  Trying to regulate it because it makes no sense. They're not gonna understand a lot of the nuance in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They all want to go back to your question too, which is because there's talk about this here we just  Forbid them for doing any M&A. Well what that puts a chill on? Yeah, that's by the way, that's the that's the law proposed

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Which is they shouldn't be allowed to acquire anybody which is going a little far. Yeah, so right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So look at let's say but I think that's in response to the fact that it's hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's so hard to demonstrate that they're doing it for any competitive reasons, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But let's also let's also look at the benefit to the acquired company look at like Tony Hale was scroll and Twitter  Right. So he was struggling along to make it ago. He's really smart. It was okay  But being part of Twitter the network effects now let him build the alternative business model  That he couldn't build independently as much as he can now and so it benefited the the the acquired as much as the acquirer  And the market in turn potentially Tony's a very smart guy  I believe he's gonna do a good job of it, right?  So if you then took away that market then the VCs are gonna say well  I'm not gonna invest a lot of startups because they're not there's no exit now  If they've taken away the major exit we have SPACs are gonna go away like cotton candy  IPOs are nowhere. So you see a drying up of investment in  Innovation and entrepreneurship. There's an unintended consequence that comes from this M&A is bad because Facebook did it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And definitions are part of the difficulty here and so  The law that is proposed which is absurd is no M&A because we can't decide if you're monopoly  We can't decide what your market is and we have no idea if this cop if this acquisition, you know  It's crazy because that's why we have the FTC and presumably that's one of the things the FTC and other  Regulatory bodies that have to approve these mergers

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Consider that's their job. Well in as we I mean the digital era has has basically flattened all  Distribution and some of the production, you know capabilities of a variety of industries, right? So everything from newspapers to  Book publishing. Okay, that's all information based actually  but what what happens is  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Where'd my point go your point is well taken it  FTC's looking  Because because this is flattened you normally you would say well they can't  But but but Instagram a  37 person in  Application company that looks like nothing could in fact and I think Mark Zuckerberg  Correctly reasoned be a huge threat to this multi-billion dollar operation  It that's your point and I agree with you. It's so that's what's different nowadays

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And well, it's yeah, and it's easy to enter into these new markets

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And then again, thanks to network effects you can start controlling the Facebook knows that because they killed my space before they were very big

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in fact, yeah, well, you can even see it in things like I mean we saw it back when  Comcast bought NBC  This was this was a big deal because again the delivery of content is now flat and easy and who owns what?  You know matters so and I would argue that if you look at something like, you know a  AT&T buying time Warner  Not well HBO. Well, yeah that I didn't go so well, but  But when they did that, you know  Did you did you look at AT&T from the position of well, they've got a physical pipe into X million homes that is you know  Not really geographically competitive, but it's competitive with cable in certain areas  I mean or do you look at it like AT&T is gonna own all of this content and  Do some self-dealing with their streaming deals. I mean  the types of questions that the regulators have to ask are getting so much more complex and  You have to be so much more forward-looking  And you might even still get it wrong. They may bet on you know, I don't know  you know self-dealing with with the content when in fact their real advantage was I  Don't know zero rating on bandwidth. These are we just don't know those Stacy to your to your examples

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It also goes to the competence of the acquirer  Right what Comcast Comcast in the hands of Comcast a very smart company these acquisitions  Had more impact on the market in the hands of Verizon and AT&T not so much because they're idiots

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, but the fact is they bought it to put to keep them from being a competition  Whether they made a success of it or made a failure of it  I know the main goal happened which is these companies never became a competitor to Facebook  Ben Thompson pointed out in December and he was quite right that the FTC pleading  was really  Had twisted in order to prove a monopoly for instance, they said well LinkedIn is not a social network  Strava the exercise network is not a social network  They they they really I think improperly narrowed the definition of social network and all to the point of saying well  Look see Facebook does have a hundred percent of this market at which it's the only player. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is Ben Evans argument about about Amazon as well. What's the market?  Is it bookstores and is it all a retail if it's all the retail that it's not really a monopoly

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'll stipulate that no, but that goes back to my original question was isn't there is some interest though in society  I'm not gonna say government because people say oh government has no interest in regulating anything  So let's say society in the form of our government  But we won't have to mention that society has some interest in keeping these companies from doing things like acquiring little companies  in order to put out a business a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Data monopoly so think about the amount of information  you know about  Consumers about the people you work with about the companies that host on a Google knows all that Google knows as much as well  That's what I'm saying. I'm just starting. I'm trying to figure out how we can define  I think it's what's a meaningful way to measure a market that is as you would say Stacey on the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is the discussion to have rather than what Congress has done is they leapt in and created eight  Really dumb laws and the FTC created a really bad suit

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It seems to be going up over time I  It was five I think compromising and I think it's six now and then there's reconciliation  There's probably one of the Senate one in the house and oh my god. It's a mess  All of this though is with I'm gonna give them credit  Maybe that they don't deserve the honorable intent of trying to solve this it's not easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they're trying  Okay, they're legitimately trying to have these conversations  Also the discussions we see about these bills and the conversations that are actually happening about them  So the public facing discussions are very different  so that that's something that like when you start covering Washington you have to be aware of and  You know  What we end up with I have no idea and it will probably be half crap half good because that's how compromise works

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Meanwhile  Amazon is actually petitioning the FTC  To have its new chair Anita conn, Nita conn  Lena conn, I'm sorry  recuse herself because when she was a professor she wrote a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She was constantly criticizing Amazon  It wasn't just that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She wasn't constant she was actually thinking about what we're trying to ask people to talk about she was actually trying to figure out  how to think about monopolies for  Network effects and the types of companies that were emerging on the internet and yeah  She's criticizing Amazon because she's building her definition of this and in her definition  They were act they were a problem  You can't blame Amazon for trying can you?  Oh no, I can't blame them for trying  I'm like, of course they're gonna try this and if their lawyers didn't you'd be like, what are you paying your monopolies for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Amazon writes chair conn has made numerous and highly detailed public pronouncements  Regarding Amazon including on market definitions specific conduct theories of harm and the purpose effects and legality of such contact indeed  She has on numerous occasions argued that Amazon is guilty of antitrust violations and should be broken up  These statements convey to any reasonable observer the clear impression that she has already made up her mind  About many material facts relevant to any Amazon's antitrust capability  She's publicly affirmed these conclusions not only as a legal scholar  But as an advocate for an antitrust advocacy group and then as a lead author of a major congressional report  You know, they do have a point there. She has made up her mind. She were a judge

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She would have to recuse herself now. She's not a judge. She's an advocate  If she had if she had talked about this at a level of principle and an example, but she did attack  Amazon and you're right Stacy because she thinks it's an example of what shouldn't be but it puts her in a position where  You know eyes on you now

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  She got the job so why she got a job but it does the FTC chairman she sets the agenda  But ultimately all she can do is sue and you go to court  Right  So she should be an advocate for the position by by default of the law

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is  This is where I get frustrated. She is taking a pro consumer view

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wouldn't you want the FTC chairman to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm gonna argue it's not a pro consumer view. It's an anti consumer view  Because because what Amazon has done is reduce prices like crazy and other companies don't like that  But it's created a wonderfully competitive world where I can buy books now a lot cheaper  No authors aren't crazy about that publishing houses aren't crazy about that  But it's really great for consumers more choice than ever lower prices than ever. How is that not pro consumer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So consumers are getting hurt by false false reviews. They're getting  Amazon is pressuring consumers are also producers  You could say consumers are getting hurt because people who buy things also end up working for Amazon  You could say the companies that work with Amazon also  employ people

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's also price. There's also price dumping and there's I mean there there is a predatory behavior where companies reduce prices making consumers happy  But with the long did you see the Wall Street Journal story? No, what'd they say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Today in the Wall Street Journal, they weren't poured it out a story. What the warrants?  No, this is  Yes. Yes the stock warrants. Yes  Amazon basically saying that if you do business for certain companies, they're like hey  If we're gonna take shares in your company for as part of our deal signing a deal with you, Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is a this is a really good example  I think because you know back in the day of startups every landlord in silicon San Francisco Silicon Valley would demand warrants of the startup there  It wouldn't just demand the rent. They would also demand warrants and  Yeah, but not on the board every I know I know I'm but let me just let me just  About to agree with you. So give me a sec  So so that's a landlord who was in a position of some power, right?  Amazon is in a position a much greater power to demand the same thing and is that a misuse of power is an excellent discussion to have  See we agreed me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I was like, yes  It is important things to talk about. So yeah, it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a good example of something to talk about I think about whether or not here's an activity of the company  Is it a misuse of their power in the position that they have because they're so big?  I'm all so let me ask that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let me ask for this because this gets into a big this is like a giant issue associated with writing legislation  period which is  Do you address the individual harms or do you try to establish a rule that works across a wider?  Either pattern of behavior or  See, I don't think we can afford to do that because the government moves three to five years or even twelve years in the case  of anti-trust losses  So that I think that's where we're running into the internet economy and the regulatory  The pace of regulation and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't have this is just discussed what we just discussed. Those are eternal principles  Those are in the laws now. That's the definitions of misuse of power are there you could prosecute that  Now you don't need a new law for that. The principles are there  So no, I think I think you've got to start there  And if there are things that you think Amazon or Facebook or Google or doing right?  I've long said on the show where Google is vulnerable and the government's only now waking up to it. Sorry  Darn telephone monopoly

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So yes, it's too bad you don't have AT&T because you wouldn't be getting junk  We'll talk about that in a moment. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a joke I'm an AT&T customer just to be clear here

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, that wasn't your cell phone either so no wasn't it anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The principles are there and and and I think that you know what I was gonna say was Google has been vulnerable for  Years on its on its advertising behavior, it's not about search monopoly. That's that's laughable. That's ridiculous

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's like ties in doesn't it? I mean  It's part of the monopoly. They haven't searched gives them a leg up in advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but the well, but but so does  So plenty of other monopolies and that would believe other oligopolies and advertising to the issue there is I mean  Search is not the issues because Google so much more than a search coming now  It also uses advertising in my mobile and all these other ways the advertising behavior and the and the concentration of its power  There is where it's more vulnerable and they're only kind of now waking up to that and and they didn't need new laws to deal with that  They could have dealt with that ten years ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I  Do agree with Stacy though that?  Because the world has changed technology has changed so many things especially I like your  analogy of the flat  Economic hierarchy, I don't know if the Sherman Antitrust Act written in 1933  Couldn't really encompass that  I don't think it's wrong for Congress to try to  not not  Completely replace it wholesale but to try to kind of  To polish it up and make it more applicable you think that the law that the Sherman Antitrust Act is sufficient

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Generally yes, but I think where where where where I'm disagreeing here  Is that if you're going to attack a change fine, but attack it at a universal level  So that it pertains to banking and it pertains to retail and it pertains to other industries to say we're gonna  We're gonna create a law just to go after one company is not how we do things in this country the same way  We wouldn't go after all create a law to go after just one person and and so the I think these laws are targeting are targeting

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Two companies don't know not even tech just two companies companies. Yeah, and and and that's look at Australia in that case

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They were I had this discussion. I had this exact discussion with the people who wrote  Malinowski's 230 law I talked to the legislative aides and I talked to Malinowski about this who's my representative and  And they wrote it in such a way. I said well watch out guys  The way you wrote this trying to come up with a definition that would only include the fact that the law is a  Definition that would only include those two you actually ended up including newspapers and  They're not gonna because because because you basically said anybody uses algorithms to rank things. Oh and as of a certain size  I said well the size you picked is the size of the newspaper company headquartered near-state  Reflect that guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right, so they try like the Florida law that goes after social networks that don't own amusement parks

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Blatant I  Put up there was a great use. I don't know if you saw there were two people Mike Masnick did a brief  Thread on that there was a much larger one from Eric Cohen  It was just brilliant covering the hearing and the judge was just nonplussed with Florida. It was it was it was hilarious  and and the Disney

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Thing came up and yeah, we should point out that those bills are going through markup right now  and Zola off-grid and others have  pointed out there are all sorts of issues and they're trying to adjust those so I  I don't think the bills as written are anything near the bills that will end up getting voted on and then of course  There's a Senate version and there's reconciliation. So we're a long way off and I think it's a good starting point, but I agree with you  It's not yeah, we should be talking about it. Yeah, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll see how fast it goes  I mean the other thing is Congress should not be taking so many freaking breaks. They should actually sit down and fix this

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, but that's just me don't forget they're the saucer that cools the hot tea kettle or something  Is the saucer that cools the cup the cup the boiling water is the car is the house of representatives and the president is  In this analogy  Is he the tea cozy? I think he might be  So let's take  Yourself around it's an old I think it comes to the federalist papers. It's an old analogy

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Okay, I'm just like I'm like sitting here. I'm like hot dome scandal

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The tea let me see where this the history of this only George George Washington told Thomas Jefferson

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Back old George told Tom he said the Framers created the Senate to cool house legislation  Just as a saucer was used to cool hot tea. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Remember those days they created the Senate to make the southern states happy, but that's another yeah. Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's a tradition that Thomas Jefferson coming home from France  There's your critical race there called George Washington to account at the breakfast table  For having agreed to a second and as Jefferson thought unnecessary legislative chamber  Why asked Washington? Did you just now pour that coffee into your saucer before drinking really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did it was that a thing people do you still yeah? Yeah, when in the original?  Let's see what I you got me started Leo here goes in the 17th century 18th century 17th century coffee houses  That is how they bought their coffee they they poured it into a saucer and drank from the saucer  Wow sense what they did Jefferson said to cool it glad I'm here for the Georgie to cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Georgie my throat is not made of brass  Even so said Washington through his solid cherry wood my teeth are made of wood we pour our legislation  Into the senatorial saucer to cool it and there is your bicentennial minute visit your local public library kids  We're gonna take a little break come back with more Stacey and Jeff  Lots more to talk about but first do you like my shirt?  Debating whether to keep it a buttoned or unbuttoned no no no no no no no no no no no no really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I don't I don't want to see the undershirt. Well. I know I never see your undershirt

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't want you to see the chains next no no, but you know it's funny because it's dimmer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Battle well, I think this is Microsoft spin I think I think this is this is why the

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The truth started when Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai became CEOs  Here you go. This is this is from 2011 before the before the truce  The following scene represents wait a minute this might not be you do your top sound  oh  Yeah, hold on second hold on. This is I might get the official one. This is not official. This is somebody's  Somebody you know it may be that actually Google has pulled it down because they're so embarrassed about it  Let me see if I can find the official one  Paul Thurotte a host of Windows weekly loved these and said  Microsoft should do a lot more of these I was on the other hand a little  Let's see it's on Microsoft's I bet you Microsoft has taken it down yeah, they have all right  We're gonna have to look at an unofficial version because Microsoft doesn't want you to remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Gmail learn now up next what Microsoft doesn't want you to yes. Oh, that's a good tease. I like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  the following scene  represents the opposite experience of  Office 365 says Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I know it feels like a parody doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Not 2011 not so long ago good morning senders and receivers ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Carolyn Johnson get up off of that painful itching and burning of yours come check

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Just skimming for certain keywords shortly after this  Google did in fact announce they were no longer going to go through your mail for key  But they were doing this at the time  And in fact I pointed out when Paul was crowing about these  I pointed out that well, let me let me ask you something Paul does outlooks  Eliminate spam. He said yeah said well, how do you think they do that? Yeah by reading your mail  The only difference is Google was using it for ad keywords. Yeah, that was the added  But it's not that Microsoft or anybody else doesn't read your mail it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Machine the debate we should be having we should be building laws about the situations  We want to use this stuff in so like how it's used. Is it okay to use facial recognition for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tracking well, this is an example of why laws should be written a principle not technology, right?  You have a right to privacy only in your first-class delivered physical mail  Not in your communications when it gets to government here, right because they wrote it into that specific technology of the mail not anticipating other

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Messaging mechanisms. Well in the mail is a government service  That was the other thing that was worth noting when we we started

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, when there were federal laws against reading your mail, even if it was a postcard, which is what?  Oh, you could read they could read your postcard they had  They had to yeah. Yeah, but but if it's in an envelope, they can't look in the envelope, right?  It's illegal without a warrant without a warrant  So apparently for the last five years ever since Satya Nadella became CEO and Sundar Pichai became CEO  There was a non-aggression pact a truce between Microsoft and Google in which they agreed not to aim their substantial  lobbying firepower

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Against each other. This is a Microsoft never paid attention to that. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, this is according to Bloomberg  That truce that old non-aggression pact if you like Soviet era  Language forged at the time by two new CEOs wanting a fresh start in a formerly acrimonious relationship had already been fraying  Before it lapsed in April isn't this antitrust  Well, you can't agree not to lose each other's employees. We know that it's not collusion

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean to agree not to sue each other is in collusion. No, but you agree not to criticize each other

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know that's in I won't criticize you if you don't criticize me. That's so that's that's a questionable thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I would say I was surprised to learn that you can't agree with another company not not to implore  Well, you can't agree with another company not to poach employees Apple made an agreement with a number of other Silicon Valley companies  Steve Jobs wrote email saying hey, look  we won't try to get your employees if you would stop headhunting ours and that in fact is is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Illegal under the because it's a it's a harm for the employees. I mean that creates the harm  Documentable harm. Yeah, let's figure out the harm for

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, everybody. Well, you know, I'm giant companies lobbyists. It's a giant companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who hold on to their piece and for somebody else to come in and compete with them  They can't break through the wall. Whereas if Microsoft's criticizing Google for something that I have a company to answer that  That's a good point, you know that I can join in with Microsoft and on their slipstream

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Professor Jarvis, I will allow your suit  I'm judge Leo  You know how much judge Judy makes every single year made she's much tired a lot  I think sure it yeah, she's retired because she could she's retired on her 50-foot yacht probably  She was making  Wait a minute, right? I'm gonna make sure this is right  47 it was like I with 47 million dollars a year according to a journal. I respect highly called Entertainment Weekly  How is this related to Google by the way because I'm judge that information. I  Thought it was interesting anyway  the first signs of strain between the two companies according to  Bloomberg Dina Bass and Nico Grant  Appeared more than two years ago when Microsoft protested to Google that it's search ads 360  Wasn't keeping up with new features and ad types in Microsoft search engine Bing  It may in other words, they were favorite after Google's spots

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Microsoft was testifying against Google Microsoft was doing ads against Google. They can't remember trade organizations against Google  They went against Google in Australia. There's no there was no troops. That's BS

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, they weren't lobbying against each other I guess it was a sort of a truth and I thought Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were they were a lobby for a while  Like recently like last year. Yeah, it's that not a thing that's happening anymore. They've been doing it the whole time

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Especially in Europe, but they've been doing it the whole time

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  and of course Brad Smith is  Microsoft president Brad Smith has been going to Congress saying why aren't you investing?  Thank you for not investigating us, but why aren't you investigating Google?  All right, anyway the truce is over so get ready for the gmail man to come back  LinkedIn hacked once again. Oh, yeah. Yeah  700 million LinkedIn records are for sale on a hacker form as of yesterday  What's it? I'm sorry June 22nd. Sorry a week ago  What's in them? That's the thing that's a little scary things like imputed salary  I don't know why LinkedIn does that but there's a lot of information in there  Public and private profile information. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you what are people having their private linked that's what I'm saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, is it things like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People who are looking at other phone or

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Phone I remember seeing a lot of phone numbers and this personal contact information being readily available for people linked in by the ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's denying this yesterday. They released a statement saying we want to be clear  This is not a data breach and no private member data was exposed  The data leak was linked in says an aggregation of data from a number of websites and companies as well as the publicly viewable  Member profile data, of course, there's been court cases over whether you can scrape link and scrape like then  Yeah, and by the way, LinkedIn has lost it most recently lost that  It is legal to scrape LinkedIn  But they say not tech like technically a breach  So, okay  anyway  Not not a breach. You're right. You're posting stuff in public. You can't complain that somebody knows it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See the lawsuits around

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go on

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I was just saying that goes back to my argument about journalism today. Everything is considered a hack and stuff like that. Right?  Yeah, not really a hack. It's just no that's someone actually just left the door open. Yeah, he said walk in. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  How's your blood pressure right now? Jeff is it is it settled down a little bit? No, okay  You want to watch some more tennis for a minute so that I don't make me happier you  Seventeen researchers across disciplines from biology to philosophy  published a paper in the prestigious  according to recode prestigious  PNAS  Earlier this month. What is PNAS?  It is the proceedings of the National Academy of Sinuses

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anyway according a bunch of snot according to this

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I  Never I never realized what a terrible acronym that is  according to these researchers  We that we should treat the study of technologies large-scale impact on society as a crisis  Discipline in other words a field in which scientists across different fields work quickly to address an urgent societal problem  Like global warming or or endangered species  Our lack I think this is this I don't find this hard to accept our lack of understanding about the collective  No, of course not. It's in PNAS  I haven't finished but at least I started

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Collective I got to the point. I got to the point where I just said I can't I can't do this right now  My blood pressure is too high. That's why I asked  That's why I asked

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The tech the issue is we don't really understand the collective behavioral effects of  New technology and they submit that it might be a danger to take my to democracy into scientific progress  for instance, they use as an example the coronavirus pandemic and the  Epidemic or infodemic of misinformation that has hindered widespread acceptance of masks and vaccines  I don't know if that's because of technology or social networks. It might be because of our political environment more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which has been exacerbated the polarization our political environments been exacerbated by our social networks

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's true. I mean we have to do this but you go back. It was a lot worse in the early days of media  It was tons worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The authors warn if left  Misunderstood and unchecked we could see unintended consequences. I've been arguing this. I don't think that's  I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not controversial. I don't feel like it's controversial unless you're Jeff and I feel like  It happens to me I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See this is where  Let's have a discussion and then this is how you have the discussion. No, Jeff. Let me ask you in all seriousness

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Do you is it your position that there is that we understand the behavioral impact of technology and social networks and  Answer this I'm asking you within all sincerity. We didn't understand the impact of print

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We ended up with a 30 years war and a reformation some good some bad  Yes figured out in the long run to same thing here. I just wrote a book about just this  Right, so, you know, they argue in this paper to quote from the paper  Neither the evolutionary nor the technological changes to our social systems have come about with the express purpose of promoting  global sustainability or quality of life  No Twitter started and I think still runs with an effort to improve the sustainable the quality of life  Facebook says now we can say that they do a really rotten job of it  And that's a perfectly fine argument  But they believe and I believe they believe when they started that a connected world is a better world  Google starts with the effort to make the world's information accessible. I returned to my argument about the the the pandemic  I returned to my arguments about black lives matter  I returned to the arguments about the good that comes this thing is filled with leaps that require wormholes to get through now  I'm done

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so they're not arguing that this is bad  What they're arguing is we don't understand the effects of what they call expanding the scale of a collectively behaving system by eight  Orders of magnitude and they're saying that we need to look at that and they're calling it a crisis because things are happening faster  They're happening globally and the impact is affecting far more people at a macro level than the introduction of print  which I I like your parallel actually because  It led to many changes in society, but it led to those changes over a  Longer time frame and it affected people. Yeah, Jeff. I mean we have seen  Documented changes in how like the the people we've elected how we do that  So how we talk about building laws, I would even say  How we public health is perceived all of these changes are happening  And they're happening at a level like people not everybody knew how to read right but now  More people have access to this than people had access to print. So it's a much faster  Distribution of this type of behavior is what that's all this papers arguing. It's not saying it's necessarily bad or good  It's saying we should probably study this so we should probably study it real fast because I  Agree with studying fast. I agree with all that but no the  Way this is work

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They just said in here that none of these changes were kind were aimed at improving quality of life  That's the kind of prejudice that's in here that starts us off and I  What about like five times?  What about this sense political communication research people like Joan Donovan in particular has long described how alterations of network communications technology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  appear to impact social movements  institutional politics and political parties  You wouldn't disagree with that right well, I know I would point out that the penny press did the exact same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and they don't say negatively they just say alterations. It impacts it a

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  consolidated  transdisciplinary approach to understanding and  Managing human collective behavior will be a monumental challenge yet is a necessary one  Given that algorithms and companies are already altering our global patterns of behavior fight for the right to change  patterns of behavior for financial reasons  Like media you can't deny that yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Their motivations in other words so should we should we have stopped as as newspapers wanted to do to radio should we have stopped?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't think they're saying stop it. I think they're not saying stop it. They're presenting understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're presenting as a danger this could have been  I'm agreeing with the need. I just said to study and I hope we can end the debate Jeff segment  I'm agreeing that we need to study and we need to study quickly  Absolutely, I couldn't agree more we need to invent better systems. Absolutely couldn't agree more  But again, it's the way that it's presented and then the way it gets presented in turn in the story is what?  Worries me because then we then it feeds into bad legislation like we're seeing in Florida  Sicilian and about 230 and that's my concern. It's always my concern. It's the same thing. I've said it a million times I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think our bad legislation is service

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Go ahead miss Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just gonna say I think our bad legislation is more a function of corruption in terms of having the influence of  interested parties that  Are not necessarily elected or are not necessarily citizens, right? So  That that's where I would say bad legislation comes from less bad date  Like not as much a lack of understanding about the issues on the ground. Go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Headline read the recode headline, would you well that might be the wrong?  That's the point you've got to be aware of the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, actually in a way that's all it is it comes off as a gloom and doom and I totally leaned with mr. Jarvis on this where  Social media has done quite a bit that that all and given a lot of voices to people that didn't really have a voice  Not granted on the other side of that corner is sometimes I wish some people didn't  Will just shut their mouths with some of the foolishness that comes out  But it's still nice to know that they do have this this these different platforms out there that can really help  Shape change around the world from a societal standpoint

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And wouldn't this kind of study be the first step before legislators kind of weigh in to again better understand it again agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why some biologists ecologists think social media is a risk to humanity how much more

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's recolte risk. So so just say just say recalled got it wrong because I don't think that that's  That's a proper statement of what this  Agreed I'm just saying I have to say I'm on the other side of it  While I think this would be very valuable. I think a bunch of social scientists getting together and debating  The pros and I don't think that's gonna you're gonna get anything valuable

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go a different step to I couldn't agree more. I'm in fact, I'm going to be convening a bunch of people  I'm working with two people who couldn't disagree with me more who've written books the opposite of mine to bring together researchers  To ask what are the question? What do we know? What don't we know? What do we need to know about research?  Couldn't agree more absolutely couldn't agree more  But the the issue that I have here is the starting point to me is what do we want to build and?  The starting point too often in this discussion in the way Rico presents it especially is it's broken  How do we do incremental fixes to the world as it is? That's not imaginative enough. That's not  Daring enough. That's not demanding enough. Yeah  Create the competitor to Google, please create the competitor to Facebook, please right?  That's what I want to train my students to do. That's why I'm working on an effort  For an initiative and Internet studies to do just that so I have absolutely agreed  But if the starting point is constantly that the Internet is broken and that limits the discussion

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not saying anything about the Internet. They're talking about social media here

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, they're not saying even that it's broken, but just we need to understand how it is  Yeah, they're just saying that we know and what we think we know and what we believe and

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Like that. I think that that's totally fine for them to say, you know what this this this is a  Really big big piece of subject matter here that we don't quite understand  We are seeing a lot of positive things with it and we're seeing a lot of negative things with it  But to come out and say hey  We're at risk of this problem and that problem when you don't really quite have a full grasp on  Everything that's happening with all of these different platforms. I just don't like how this was  didn't I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Don't I didn't Erasmus say we ought to really consider the impacts of this printing press  Because it could be good and it could be bad  But we need to understand better what's gonna happen to society because of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know Erasmus said straight out that he feared that there were too many books for mankind

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He did he did jump to the next step. Yeah, maybe he was okay. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Baby, I haven't read that all Ferris  I have not had the time to read the whole paper first and maybe it turns around  I think there were lines at the beginning that set it up where I think that it has an impact on the discussion  I think what those very wrong. I haven't read the whole no. No, I think you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But I think what those early lines are is to establish the fact that this is something we need to do now  we need to pay attention to because  It's potentially damaging

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They address that they address that in the paper they note that there are risks and benefits  They even talk about like in this regard social media's influence provides a unique source of both risk and opportunity  Changes to a few lines of code can impact global behavior processes. They're talking about recommendation engines and things like then why such changes are ongoing

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  With or without scientific on this story and saying why some biologists and ecologists think social media

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because that's a risk and a benefit. I'll tell you the risk you want to know the risk to society link big headlines  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Don't I didn't read this because I see headlines like this pop through my little Google news thing all the time and I don't even  Bother because I hate the fear-mongered  Headlines out there today. It's just I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's a bad trend and that is also by the way driven by financial considerations  And I think you know, you could actually quite reasonably  Rewrite this entire paper and say link bait headlines in place of social

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Networks make it very easy to share these things. Well, that's true. They amplify these link bait headlines

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The reason I could easy to share me too. They also make it easy to share black lives matter  They also make it easier to share the news by the way, Bill Cosby

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The judge overturned his I just saw that headline what?  It was a terrible prosecutor and then it was actually maybe a justified  Decision I don't know that for but it was it was a technical issue. Yeah, it was a technical issue  They used evidence from a civil suit to prosecute him when they had declined to prosecute initially and the civil suit followed

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but that's he didn't he said in some kind of public statement  He didn't plan to but there was never a promise made that since it's but it's over. It's too late. It's over

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, and you know what? He's a hundred years old. I don't think you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, he's 83 and he should have to pay for what he did think about all the women

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, he was a predator this oh he's old well, he should use a predator in prison you thought he should die in prison. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And he was made by media, right? He was he was and I was part of it  I was a TV critic who liked the show then didn't like the show and he hated me for it. But  Right so we  Elevate people to a level that they too often don't deserve or we demonize them to a level they may not deserve to in me  It's those extremes. It's what I am saying. That's clickbait. That's what clickbait does

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think ant wrote this this headline here. It's not a pixel book. So sadly, mr. Jarvis won't buy it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I  Appreciate it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is the Android central review of a brand new Acer Chromebook 514 we've really liked these Acer Chromebooks  All right. I know Kevin Toffle loved the spin  This is a new one the Chromebook 514

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Pricing on it was too low for mr. Jarvis last week's too cheap. This one we brought up  Where is where the Thunderbolt 4 ports?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Intel processors is less expensive than the spin seems to have some pretty good capabilities  It'll start at six hundred dollars on sale in August  How do you rate the processor and such that's a good processor  Eleventh generation Intel processor. I mean, you know, yeah, I don't think Chromebooks really require run Chrome OS

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Be plenty powerful. Yeah, it's gonna have that price point would lead him to believe it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The six hundred dollar one is a penny of gold. I probably wouldn't get that but I three or I five would be just what's the the  Proportion screen that's the other thing. I really like these three by two screens, but this sure looks like a 16 by nine  Yeah, I think it's a 16 by two. It's a 1920 by 1080. Yeah  so it's a nice HD screen, but  Do you use your touchscreen on your pixel book?  Oh Jeff, do you think that's important you want the touch? Yeah, so it also helps with carpal tunnel. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Too much with the trackpad  Really hurts and and so I can scroll and I can click both hands. It helps a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We could just get Kevin to give up his master's degree program. Maybe we can get him on to recommend a Chromebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure if you asked him he would give you a Chromebook recommendation. Okay, just email him  Also, he does have a whole site that recommends Chromebooks  So, you know, I feel like you could find them just check about well, that's right. I go there every week

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah religiously and I read his email newsletter religiously  But he's such a fair man that he kind of says well, it could be this no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This having worked with Kevin for over a decade I feel you I'm like Kevin

Transcript:  You know, mr. Jarvis  I appreciate you bringing up the touchscreen in your use case for it because I just recently reviewed a laptop for hands-on tech  Couple weeks ago and it had to touch screen in for windows. You use windows, right? Yeah, right  And I use windows and I never quite got on that that train with touch screens on laptops because I don't want my fingers on  The screen I don't want fingerprints on the screen now  I get having a stylus to use on a laptop that makes perfect sense to me for me as a creator  But I just don't see the point and tap it just does windows and tabs and things like that  But what if you bring it up carpal tunnel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, that light bulb but I'm trying to get a window in ants mind if you moved your camera and show me your desk right now  Would it be really neat?  negative  Not even surprises  And yet yet you're obsessing about fingerprints. I I don't I don't get it, but I'm looking at pixels

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, he's looking at his phone. Okay. All right. Yeah, you're looking your photos. That's true  It's neat relative to mine  so we had a hands the hands-on tech which will come out right after the show is  Ant and Micah talking about their home setups because of course with covid we sent them home and  We were curious, you know, they both put a lot of work into getting really good quality home setups  They wanted me to do it, but I didn't want to show my messy desk

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So but I didn't what is your policy gonna be boss man dictator on  In office versus homework going forward what's what what have you learned?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm not the dictator in this particular case  Okay, that's true and we have announced you're going to ask everybody to come back to work after the fourth of July holiday  So we will we won't be opening the studio to a visitor's quite yet that that's gonna take a little bit longer  But when people come to back one to work on July 5th  They will be working in the office and most of our hosts will be working in although  We've told them that they could work at home one day a week if their supervisor allows it  and  in some cases people like Ant and Micah and  Jason probably will work at home more because as hosts they they do a lot of weird getting ready to do shows

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I get more done now  I get more done at home quite frankly and it's always been that way with me in my professional career

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, we're of the opinion though  And you know, I think a lot of bosses are Apple just said the same thing that there is a nice synergy that happens when people  Are all together in the office and when we have a host office where Ant and Micah and Jason share a space  I don't have to go in there. Thank God, but  But I think that  I think that we have that host office sir. You're only one of the times ever in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know no no no before pandemic when all three of us were in there. We were all in headphones

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz they didn't want anybody to do it. We're busy  Yeah, but there I do think that in our business  It's one of the reasons I started to it is because I missed the  conversation with other people in the business because I don't think you can hold an opinion by yourself as  Well as you can if you have it challenged by others and I think there's so much information that one person can't gather at all  so I think there's a lot to be said for having a corpus of

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Journalists wrong I do look forward to Wednesdays and being in there and seeing everybody from sales  That's just because we have free lunch on and food  I was getting to that. What were you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think as a reporter I  Fundamentally believe reporters should never be at their desk. I mean unless you're writing you should never be in the office

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's different. Yeah, but you're gathering out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well  So like for giga ohm I would either be out gathering information or I would I mean I was virtual so it didn't matter  but your home testing devices you're either like  Oh, but I think time you're ever sitting at your desk is when you're writing a story

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I come from a culture where if you're testing devices  you do so much better when other people are around and you can bounce off of them and  And they can give you feedback and input. It's so I think much more useful to form an opinion  As a group than it is as an individual. It's just much more realistic to be honest  Because no one person home devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think that may be my issue. I'm like computers sure light switches

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess it's possible to have the  Aristotelian truth about it life switch, but but if you're  Kind of have to get other  Yeah, people's points of view because everybody uses it differently. I mean, it's just a anyway. I think it works better  We're gonna bring everybody back  You know, I I had ever left and John and Burke our engineers never left  Some of our editors because it's easier to work on the computers at work than it is virtually. No, you can't leave John

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey everybody else got the time away now, it's my turn. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's what's really happening nationwide is

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Workers are not wanting to come back to work. I used to go in every single day take a job

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They just want to stay I don't I don't want to do it now. Yeah, I'll go in I go and teach obviously  I'm not gonna go in nearly as much as I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Isn't it funny though because when we first happened it was first started teaching via zoom seemed less than ideal. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  Especially for I mean it depends on the level but especially for younger kids the issue Leo wasn't the teaching the issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  for  student I've been in a grad school was the cohort right the  because because because I  Don't want to tell any tales out of school literally  But I think it was  That matters when I started that's exactly what I'm saying too. Though is the cohort this exactly what there's also  But I've also seen it go too far. I've also seen more the programs we had one year  One of the programs I started the cohort only saw themselves for a year and a half and it was too much  They got they got sick of each other. Yeah, right. And so we had to mix them up with other students more  There's there's a fine line here. Yeah, and what happens too is that is the slack?  It's this is this goes back to the to the  Fine professors writing in penis or whatever. It's called  I don't even hear that place. I don't allow myself. I know I know  Sorry, I didn't get I didn't do that on purpose folks. I didn't get that  Is studying what the impact is so slack on a group that does it doesn't have a cohesion in person and  Then there's one troublemaker who can start stuff in slack  It's interesting what happens then and so there's some fine mix of enough  Cohesion and too much cohesion and the tools have an impact. Yes  I mean again, I will say again. Thank God for zoom without zoom. Many of us would have been unemployed  I wouldn't have been able to teach at all  Made a huge difference. So all the whining about zoom  I'm not terribly sympathetic to because it saved us in the pandemic but overdose absolutely  And slack overdose

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Google is no longer requiring publishers to use the amp format. Remember the all the back-and-forth  We did over amp. I wasn't a fan  We brought your friend who's head of Google News into defend it  Richard Gingras Richard Gingras  Richard Gingras amp accelerated mobile pages was I thought on the face of it a good idea the idea that pages should load more quickly  They should have less  scripting on them  But then the requirement that all the scripts be served by Google seemed to me a bad idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wasn't it wasn't a requirement. It was just the easy way to do it. You could have had your own amp

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So yeah, Google knew that everybody just used Google and so they said oh or you could set up your own servers. It's okay  So amp and the other thing that Google did was they favorite amp results in their search results  They even had an amp carousel for a while  I  Was against it because it kind of undermined web standards

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Although I understood Google's desire to speed up the web and and get rid of the chunk on web pages. There's so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah  We're thinking about Google to a bigger extent yeah, that's why I said to it instead

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Amp is no longer required to get in the news carousel. So that's good news  This article though from Scott Gilbertson at the register says it may be that what they replaced it with is worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sites then I I didn't ever got down to what are they replacing it with I could core web of vitals

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Do we know what that is? Well, it's a set of standards  I think it's a set of standards kind of like amp but not as much of a requirement so that  The page is still loaded quickly  So  Let me see quality standards. Is that it? Yeah, and and okay with you know  I think everybody understands that the web went kind of crazy  with  loathing JavaScript and stuff like that, so  Let me see if I can  Web dev slash vitals. Yeah core web vitals report fix poor user experiences on your site  This will tell you how your page is performed based on  Real world usage data field data that Google collects anyway be in the process of spidering. So it's about load times  It's about other issues  You know, I don't have a problem with this  Google it's Google's funny because  They know they are  They come across as a little bit arrogant. We know what's best. We're going to for instance HTTPS  We're going to use our massive clout to make everybody do what's best and I can't argue that that's wrong  But it does seem a little heavy-handed for instance by saying if you use HTTPS you'll show up better in search results  That's that's a very powerful

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Carrot or is it a stick? I was at a where where am I was done the same thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but Apple doesn't have the apples near the cloud Google has in its search results. That's that's massive

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, no, they don't they don't I'm just saying Apple is has been pretty known to  Well, no one would ever call Apple arrogant would they based on  Based on what they think you're supposed to want to do, you know, yeah, you know Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Apple's opinion is that we know best what to have how to have the user experience be Microsoft's opinion is  Whatever you want. I'll just let you do anything you want  Somewhere in between perhaps but at Google has all this market cloud and I think they're not very willing to use it  Which I'm not sure I really think is a good so so yeah, I was proved wrong on on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was at the news Geist in Helsinki. I think four years ago when this was discussed and  AMP was tied to news pages at that event and we were asking Google for help to get  Portable content models. There was more to it than just speed and then Google came back and they said we're working on this amp thing  This is great for fast pages. Da da da da  Remember one of the Google people in the room on violating shadow of house rule, but I won't say which one  One of Google rooms said no if we if we touch it then people aren't gonna they're gonna they're gonna reject it because we touched  We're too big and he was right  That's part of what happened here is that there are people like you who said what's going on here?  I think your point about Google is is that  they often  What's in their interest is often in our interest, right?  And they are they constantly trumpet that they are in favor of and defend the open web  It is in Google's interest to do that. It is in our interest to have an open web, right?  So it's a case where we are in that case aligned now advertising isn't an open web  But they have there's other things that aren't but that's one area where in trying to get a better web experience  It seemed that our interests were aligned the limitations of amp were often  Technical like the URLs remain screwed up to the end  Gosh, yes. Yeah, and and so  You know then suspicion is a really didn't serve Google to have screwed up URLs  But people were saying well, they're doing this so they could serve everything  Just it was a weakness of the of the architecture  But the presumption in too many quarters is what's Google really up to here and the suspicion hurt the effort to make it speedier  Now Google was gonna make amp and the system the beginning was open source and they did kind of change the governance a little bit  But they never really made it open source and that I think was the big mistake  I think that if if people had adapted standards for a fast web and then shamed publishers and advertisers in the medium  Then we would have a better web today

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So here's what Google uses core if you by the way score high and core web vitals your your this will help your Google ranking  So again, Google is using its big stick to get people to go along and I don't think anybody would disagree  These are important things they're they say by the way that these metrics will evolve over time  So this is the set for  2020 that they were using it goes comes down to three aspects of user experience loading  interactivity and visual stability and the measurements are  LCP which is largest  contentful paint and  You want to basically have the mat the majority of content painted up on the screen with under  2.5 seconds. I don't think there's anything wrong with saying that  I think there's a little something wrong with Google saying and by the way your search results won't be as good if you don't  Do this, but I understand they they believe they're making this a better web for everybody the next

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and they have to do something to inspire people to do it adopt it, right? Yeah, but that's not it. They're a private company

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't think that Google should be using its search index as a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They want to have a good experience just as they don't send you to places that have a crappy spammy  Advertising they don't want to send you a page

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Loads in four seconds and ranks lower because of it  Is it because it's a bad page or because there's a lot of content on it or no

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Add things or no, there's lots of things it could have a bad done CSS first input delay measures interactivity  This is the second metric pages should be allow you to  Give it your input within a hundred milliseconds one tenth of a second  And if it's slower than three tenths of a second, it'll rank down and then finally cumulative layout shift  Yes, which I do agree with  Visual stability if  Now I let me that this is moving around the screen. Yeah, you don't want things you don't want things moving around

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So also is is a dark pattern too  Because you end up trying to click to make the box go away the box moves you end up clicking on the ad

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I guess this is this is an example of well since there's no regulation about dark patterns  Then we're just gonna let Google do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but here's the thing. Yeah, this is my argument in Helsinki was that was that  I would prefer outsiders to have prefer that my own industry had done it, but we never did it  We just we messed up the web and there was never a movement media if the W3C

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Did it then I would not have the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably have a different search engine. I mean you could always say you know what? I hate that Google penalizes people  I want to see even the slowest crappy is loading pages. I'm gonna go to duck duck go

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, unfortunately duck duck go really is just a Google  API but  I'll use being I actually have an answer for your question coming up last week. I recommended brave search  I have another one. I want to show people there. What's interesting is all of a sudden  there is this kind of for whatever reason perhaps because of all the  FTC and  Attention and the chrome is like a bloated crap. There are a lot of search alternatives suddenly popping up and that's I oh I was saying  I think it's more about prizer privacy, but I because they're all privacy focused, but I think it's very interesting  Google has also said it's and this really should be in the changelog  But I'll given that its relationship to what we're just talking about Google has also warned people  When you search for something that there is no good answer to yet  It's rapidly evolving so you'll start seeing warnings on search results like this here  Let me make this a little bit bigger if you search for UFO and 106 miles an hour  It looks like these results are changing quickly  If this topic is new it can sometimes take time for results to be added by reliable sources  Good  You object to that? No the notice isn't saying what you're seeing in search results is right or wrong, but that  There may be more information to come  Yeah, well, okay. I have mixed feelings about it  No, I do because it's an editorial decision and  Should Google be editorializing? I guess you could say that they do all the time with their search index  The world goes after them for saying you're linking to horrible stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're allowing horrible stuff to be linked to you should clean it up, and then they clean it up and they say well  No, but now you're taking too much power. It's a it's a  Is it editorializing or is it just any effect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean they have the ability to see this so are they just saying hey, this is changing

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I that's an interesting question. How do they know find some way to call that some sort of censorship to you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's coming down  I mean you could say hey, okay, if you're gonna put this tell us how you've developed this metric, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you how do you decide if something's changing a lot? What does that?  Entail but once they publish that then people will game it. So this is why I mean  Transparency and search is a real big problem given how much economic value a high search ranking can drive  Look I'm not saying it's easy for Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  By the way, this is a test didn't happen when I did the same search on  My Google, but so you may not see it and they're just trying it out  I would like to know more and of course they'll never tell you but where do they get this signal?  How do they know that it's a changing?  They might give you a hint of it  Well, you're speculating they haven't given us any  Indication well if they do give us that indication then that's ignored  I know but I'm saying that they said

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey relax blood pressure we can agree  120 degrees in Seattle they they agree. Yeah  No, it's hell freezes over  So Daphne Keller who's brilliant brilliant

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not sure if you're gonna be able to tell me that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure if you're gonna be able to tell me that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Daphne Keller who's brilliant brilliant legal mind at Stanford  This is about the Sicilian bill and and 230 but she said that the what the bill prohibits in self-dealing  Potentially says that it opens the door for Infowars Breitbart daily Stormer at all to bring must-carry claims against the platforms  Or demand higher ranking  Because when the platforms make these decisions which you label editorial  Which I would say are for a better experience for the users  Then they're gonna get accused in even even this Democrats bill of saying they can't discriminate among similarly situated businesses  That's the that's where this this goes then if you say well we don't  Clean up the web, but don't clean up the web  This is the this is the vice that they're caught in and this is the essence of the 230  And this is the essence of the 230

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Would Google be better or worse if they just did PageRank like that's it  You don't we're not gonna say anything at all. We're just gonna do PageRank, which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Basically a more gameable as hell. That was the problem. That's Matt. That was the problem  It was a game. It was game like crazy and they had to come up with other signals  But they have to constantly evolve those signals because the the gamers are always ahead of them  The malign influences are always ahead of them  And you know, that's what that was Matt's life  That's what Panda was I mean everything and the panda was a perfect world

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we're gonna have these trade-offs. So we have to say this is gonna be the anticipated trade-off. Do we?  Carve out an exception for it. Or do we say well, we'll see what happens. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know when I work with about calm, I don't actually I think you could make PageRank not be gameable  Wow  Well, okay. So how do people game it they create a link farms, right?  Yes  All Matt would do is say the quality of the result from a link farm is not  Should not be included in the search results. That was the panda. Well, they did that but then they that's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But to do that you have to say things like okay an article has to be X number of words long  And then they'd be like, okay now I mean that  The issue is gaming isn't just like it has to be quality. It has to be scalable and like done by computers  So anything that's done by computers as opposed to human judgment and also even human judgment  I mean some people find some things offensive some people don't so and there is no way to give people  Your there's no way to stop people from gaming systems and there's no way to give everybody the exact web they want or think  They want. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sorry and all and I love transparency but when transparency gets used against you that's an issue. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Stacey you and I are green a lot today. I just I feel like there must be a way to do  search results  That I feel like there should simply search results without any okay. So here's here's here's an idea for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I  Feel like we should have these anti-trust cheap. Well, yes, you know, well Google's more than that and Facebook building some of that  not much  Here's here's a way you can go an antitrust  In a settlement with antitrust you could say because the reason duck duck dough is you know is what it is  It's just because it's as you say it's off the Google API. It's but it's privacy forward. That's all  Yeah, but but Google could but what the strength Google has is it's scraping  Google to release that as a full API and anybody can build a search engine on top of that database  You know you could you could you could come to a settlement where they have something like that and you could let a hundred  Search engines then blossom with all different kinds of structures

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's a that's that's one way to think about I'd love to see that. I wonder why is it because Google is so dominant  That

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well used to be that that was that was part of their secret sauce was that we have the scraping you don't and and yeah  Now that's less high-end  View what they have instead is their AI analysis of that. So the simple scrapes  aren't the  Special competitive advantage that they were I

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Just wish there were a better way I  Just I I feel do you not feel like Google's results are  Considerably less good than they were in the early days of Google. No, is that just me? It depends on what I'm looking for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think they're actually overall. I think they're better

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, oh, yeah often the search results aren't till at least halfway down the page

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's so miraculous to me Leo is how I what was I looking up this morning  I was looking up something where I couldn't remember somebody and I don't yeah, I know it was  It was a I needed to find somebody and I suddenly couldn't remember the name and I knew where they appeared often and  That their their their sexual identity was part of their public identity and  something else and  Second one of the search was right. It was that was that Wow Google. Thank you. You found the exact person I needed  Now I had to guess enough to say that but I didn't know  Its ability to ferret out your intent is  Beyond whatever was before and then again, sure. It's not it's not filter bubbly  Because there have been studies that show that they don't where your search results and my search results are not that different must range asking for pizza  in our neighborhoods  But if you ask for questions in certain ways, it's fine  It's phenomenal. The other thing Stacey you mentioned last week  Translation I've been translating  books in Google  Biographies of Otmar Murgenthaler. I have such a fun life, you know  And my German I've been taking my German lessons with with with audible but it's not good enough for some of the stuff  So I end up yeah, I got a sentence and I said, I'm not sure just type it into Google and and it's phenomenal  It's absolutely phenomenal. So the secret sauce is no longer Google has servers everywhere with they know every site  The secret sauce is Google how it analyzes if you want that plain vanilla  Crappiest site on top. I  Say they should let somebody have the same argument that  Is made by some people to Facebook  you should allow people to if you want to pick just the  On an algorithmic feed and see how bad it is  you should be able to do that and you kind of can't Twitter this week got in trouble because  It seemed to take off the cron option and there were people were doing stories Twitter abandons cron option and cave-on the product  I said now we got a bug. We're fixing it relax

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, actually did not put that in the rundown because it was just a bug. It was ridiculous. Yeah  Yeah, people got very upset about it. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you use the do you use the filter to the chronological option Jeff? I use the filter. I've gone back and forth

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've tried a lot and I find the filter really  Filter you mean the the the the algorithmic top tweets first  I find that it's it's it shows me things that I'm glad I saw that I otherwise would not have seen  Huh? I'm sorry. I mainly use I mean I use lists a lot Stacey so that doesn't get that  My kovat list my book history wonks list a lot of Gutenberg and Mergenthal are in there  And things like that so that doesn't get that benefit but I know what I'm getting there and I I curated that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you use Stacey? I use the the chronological and  My my Twitter is pretty curated a benefit and what do you use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I use the algorithm because I don't have as much time anymore and it's nice that it seems to be working for me  But most of the time I'm on the list  I open up Twitter and I go straight to three different lists that I have in particular

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do you may I ask where your lists are photos one of them? I bet

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  One is creators one is my Twitter family and  There's another one is called tech and gadgets or something like that, okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We would ask the oldest question, but he's gonna say that he doesn't use

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's take a little break and then actually yeah, let's take a little break and then we'll do the Google  changelog if you would  like  Our show today brought to you by AT&T active armor. I'll tell you one thing. I don't like  Spam calls in the middle of anything. I'm doing on my smartphone  We do so much on our smartphones these days whether it's watching live streaming content  I was watching the f1 race the other day. That was exciting wasn't it?  Catching up with the family on weekly video calls. I have one every Thursday with the fam. It's fun or watching  your favorite podcast like this  But what matter what you're doing on your phone. There's no room for fraud calls  Thankfully AT&T makes customer security a priority helping block those pesky calls. It's not complicated AT&T active armor  24-7 proactive network security and fraud call blocking to help stop threats at no extra charge  Did I say that at no extra charge compatible devices service required visit?  ATT comm slash active armor for details a TT  comm slash  active armor for details  Who is that? Who's the woman who does those AT&T ads? She was on?  Master of none. I just love her

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What's her name you mentioned the race and I  Laughed fun. I love the way it ended because it reminded me of Deon Sanders playing football  Right before he scores a touchdown how he dances right before he gets to the goal line  Never dance before he gets to the goal line  I'm telling it seemed like that's what Matt's for staffing did just before he crossed the finish line because he was so far ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He just slowed down and wait wait to his team. Yeah, they do that. I always makes me nuts  There was a tick tock. I know you could do it. He's he's really been dominant this year. It's very interesting to watch the  Dutchman from the  Red Bull team do so well. Yeah, Lena wait  Lena wait, right every time I do those AT&T commercials. I hear her voice in my head. I go do it more like Lena  All right, let's play the drums slowly it's time for  Half of what we talked about today could be in the changelog. Here's some more Google is delaying flock  Till 2023 that's two years from now  Cookies well, not so fast. Don't get rid of cookies.

And and you can even have surface those in search results saying oh you're looking for food support  We have a page just for you. That's fine. I don't have a problem with that  I just I think that I don't my biggest problem is with Google using its huge  market clout to push stuff  When it should be a priesthood it should be as a as kind of neutral as  Well, I know it's a business. That's why the government should take it over  And that's the Google change law  Replace this theme with the international kind of to the moon Alice.

So what you do is you've got your halo. You've got your app on your phone  To set the app to record you and then you do a series of prescribed exercises like five quick exercise lunges  Bends that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know Amazon gave it to people for free for like the first six months  And then I know I got it again for another six months because I don't think enough people were like really  $4 a month after that

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Lengthy  I thought you were paying for it. I probably am I didn't stop it for anything. I just never wear that I think  I'll get the I'll open up the app. It'll tell me  Anyway, very cool. I'm gonna I want to do this. This is a great idea cuz I am getting old

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we I think we talked about that earlier in the show you you you alluded to it. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  getting  All right, all right, all right, knock it off ways gay it's time for Jeff Jarvis's number of the week  I'm debating  How  About I do my thing of the weekend then you could do that first  I wanted to show you yet another search engine this from if two former Googlers  Sridhar Ramaswamy and Vivek  Raghu Nath on  They worked at Google in the ad division. They thought they should start a new paid  Search engine so they didn't have to do any ads. It's called Neva and double e VA  Currently free it will be five dollars a month  It's very easy to install it has Jeff. You'll love this dark mode  You can have a so you can eat just use it at Neva comm  Once you have an account you could also install a chrome extension Firefox extension. You have a variety extensions  Let me do a search that you guys would know by the way, it says trackers be gone in the search  Window, what would be a good search? Should I search for Jeff Jarvis?  Sure, yeah, cuz you know, you'd know a pizza would be good. All right. So there you are with the twit artwork  Here's a picture of you American Journalist. I hate that picture. I so despise. I know it's hard to get rid of these  I hate it. I hate I hate the pictures to Google chooses  This is kind of they do some kind of fun things for instance  You can get up to four months free by doing various little things including connecting an app creating your first space  Conducted a tour. Yeah, here's buzz machine by Jeff Jarvis  So this is your appearance on buzz machine. There's your wiki. So there's a pretty good pizza is a good one, too  Let's see what they do with pizza  Pizza now I did say you can use my location. So they're gonna show  the location of pizza  Dominoes are the first things that come up and those aren't ads those aren't ads  For some reason they're giving me the ten best pizza places in Tampa

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So go to Google and look for pizza. Okay, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's oops, I I'm sorry. I have to go to Google calm. I made a neva my default search here  I'm actually like I like Neva so far, but it's very early days. So this is local pictures  Well, yeah, okay, not dark mode. It didn't pull up pizza. Actually, there's Pizza Hut. There's Domino's so  By the way, those are the first search. I should point out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait  Did you mention that Neva cost five dollars a month? I did. Yes. Thanks for listening. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I was telling my daughter to get me more chocolate chip. The reason I like that  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The reason I like that is because that's their business model. It's not yeah. Yeah  Yeah, I don't know if people do that. You can also by the way tell it which news sources you want to see in your  Start page. So there's some you can you know, I've thumbs up thumbed up a few and thumbs down a few I like that  I don't know  I think this is worth taking a look at much as I thought it was interesting to see what brave is doing  I but I'm really interested in how many  Startups there are attempting to compete with Google  I think that tells you something especially since they're all privacy focused like duck duck go and Neva and brave  So anyway, here's another one to take a look at and double e  va  Dot com so far so good

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How long you think they'll be around if you would are looking to your crystal ball depends on how you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  How much runway they have doesn't it? What are the odds? It's here at a year  All right. I think it probably will be here in a year. Yeah, I think so  Six I have a six month free trial so I mean, you know  You can connect so you know, I've connected have to afford these are the apps and I connected Google Dropbox and slack  What's nice is that is now in my search results  So they index my gmail my dropbox files and my slack  Messages because I gave them permission I might add and then that will show up in my search results  I kind of think that's nice. You're gonna have different workspaces. So I have a tech news workspace saved for later workspace  You could have more of them  You could choose your news providers. You can see you know, these this is where you turn on and off dark mode Jeff  Oh, isn't that nice much better? Don't you like that? I feel so much better. So much brighter you could turn on this by mr. Gibson  Yeah, I don't know I didn't I don't know what he would do to vet it it's not open source  So it's not like you could you know, you know vet it it has an incognito mode  I mean, you know, it's a matter of trust that they're they're doing what they're doing properly  Mostly I the only thing I care since I've tied Google to it. By the way, I see my calendar over here  The only thing I would like to see is how good the search results are and so far I think they're not bad  I was weird to see  Domino's and Pizza Hut up top, but it was also the first search results on Google after I got the local search results

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are they also using Google's API? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What's the story on this? I forgot now. Let me let me go back to the fast company  They have a 60 person staff ex Googlers  They've secured 77 million in funding from Greylock and Sequoia so they do have some runway  The main thing is no trackers no ads, but where are they getting their search from that's that's the question  I  Don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's fascinating I  Just wonder how much money is in the bank right? Oh one other thing you'll like Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  20% of top-line revenue will be turned over to publishing partners  including Quora and medium I  Can't stand  Jeff you're full of opinions

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Like you're not is that like isn't that like the number one search engine around the planet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here's something else. You won't like Scott Galloway as an investor. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that man's hilarious. I'm sorry  Scott

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm very interested. I just I like seeing this. I'm sure somewhere in here. They talk about  Where the data is coming from because it's that's the biggest barrier to entry right now is how do you build it an index?  As good as Google's you know, uh-huh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's what I was trying to say earlier. I'm not sure that's the real barrier and they hired a UDI member

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Who is a you know big key search guy?  And he left Google because he was frustrated with ad subsidized search  So he was you know, that's a that's a big acquisition  I  Don't know I should I apologize I should have I should have figured that out before I  Got to it. I like a lot of the features. It knows your zip code, but that's all  Anyway, just not saying this is the right thing to do but it's certainly worth  Taking a look at I like the idea of all three of these new and I love the idea but duck duck go as well  Let's see  Yeah, I'm scanning through the article to see if they talk about this is Harry McCracken's story about it  Which is as I would expect from Harry very thorough which makes it harder. Yeah  Yeah, it makes it harder for me to find that information  Jeff now I've given you some time. How about it? No Accenture came out with a information packed

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  report and  Slides about the state of  newspaper revenues and  One headline to me was I put them the in the thread that I have there in the list  Is that they say that over this period of 2004 2018  Search had a fifty one point four billion growth dollar growth in revenue  But says Accenture three-quarters of that came from new business small businesses couldn't afford media before  And the other quarter came from directories and B2B and trade and they insist Accenture does that it didn't come from newspapers and magazines  Meanwhile, of course newspapers lost  F'ing fortune  Over this time from a high of 60 billion dollars revenue to a present in 2018 of 27 billion dollars  So a half drop in revenue  most of that came through  classifieds  In 2004 newspapers had 81 percent of classifieds now  They have 11 percent of classifieds and the total market is about the same 22 24 billion  But that doesn't include all kinds of new ways to do classifieds that aren't just having listings  subscriptions for job sites and and revenue shares and all kinds of other things that people have done and  But Cirque revenue is fairly circulation revenue is fairly standard though  The online revenue is only point eight billion dollars. And as we've said the show before  Two-thirds of that goes to three count them three brands in America Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post  So I don't think that's that much because if you think well, okay search revenues hold the steady that's that's pretty good  Well, they have a look at play advertising revenue  Drop is in the tanker tanker room. Yeah, and even if you look at search revenue my  tenth post  Which is Maxios not from this is that changes in monthly traffic before and after Trump left office  Boring news is yielding a lot less traffic for especially extreme sites  But also mainstream sites Trump was good for everybody. Well, that's the conflict of interest ladies and gentlemen. Yeah
