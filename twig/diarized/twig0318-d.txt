Right now we also do a lot of media coverage because of this guy right here,  one of the world's most renowned, most prestigious media pundits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to look as renowned or prestigious as I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't look prestigious. You look crazy.  Jeff Jarvis, he's a professor of journalism at the City University of New York,  the author of What Would Google Do? Public Parts, Gutenberg the Geek, Geeks Bearing Gifts, and blogs at BuzzMachine.com.  Hello, Mr. J.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good to be back on the show. How was New York for you?  I love New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know how anybody has a car in New York.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It takes, even with Uber or taxis, it takes forever to get anywhere.  We ended up on the subway.  We did. We ended up on the subway because it's the only way to get around town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the best way. It's a 600-mile miracle.  It is, really.  Yeah, it's phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is. I had to persuade Lisa to go on the subway.  No, no, no. It's the only way to go.  Yeah, but once we did, she said, why haven't we been taking these all this time?  It's like, well...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the frustration of sitting in traffic is just awful.  No, I never drive into the city. I drive to the river.  Yeah.  I make the train underneath.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also here, Kevin Marks.  Hi there, gentlemen.  From KevinMarks.com.  KevinMarks.com.  I could give you an equally long list of credits, probably even longer.  No problem.  But one of the early creators of the concept of podcasting, he was working at Apple, ABC for it before that,  and he's worked also at Google, British Telecom.  Now he's sitting in the rain in his garden.  It's not raining over there.  It's not raining here.  It's raining here, so beware.  Isn't that good news?  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very good news.  So it may come this way, yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, have umbrellas so I should be all right.  No, it'll be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if you have to move, we can make accommodations.  Do you have a dog?  I have dogs.  Does your dog bite?  It's not biting.  It's a dog.  I want to get you out of here in time for the Republican debate on CNN, so that means we got about 80 minutes.  I think that should be enough.  I want to start with we had a great conversation with Jenny Jardin on Triangulation on Monday.  Love her.  Love Jenny.  She's so great.  Posted this morning on Boing Boing, Arab-looking man of Syrian descent found in garage building what looks like a bomb.  Of course, Steve Jobs' biological parents were Syrian, or his dad anyway.  And there he is building what looks like a bomb.  I saw it in movies.  I am so glad.  This is one place where social media has such a great job to do.  Of course, Anil Dash taking the lead on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anil Dash is really taking the lead on Ahmed and it's great.  You've seen Obama's tweet, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the president got involved?  Good.  What did he say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's on the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it the POTUS account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and he tweeted, it looks like a cool clock and invited him to the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'm going to cry.  Cool clock, Ahmed.  Isn't that the greatest one?  Want to bring it to the White House?  We should inspire more kids like you to like science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that the best?  On the rundown, I put in Ahmed's Twitter account.  Oh, good. Let me go there too.  Near the bottom of other.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's nice time with Ahmed.  So here's a 14-year-old kid, freshman in high school, brand new school.  He's kind of a maker.  He's kind of a geek.  He wanted to impress a little bit.  So he, in 20 minutes, because he has a lot of stuff in his bedroom,  a lot of electronic stuff because he's a maker.  He built a clock.  He thought, I'll bring a digital clock into school.  That'll impress kids.  Irving, Texas.  Science teacher sees it and says, you know, I'd put that away.  Do not show that to anybody else.  Ahmed doesn't listen.  He shows it to another teacher who immediately calls the principal.  The principal calls the police.  He's carted off in handcuffs, taken to a juvenile detention center.  The police officer said, it looked like a bomb.  Actually, he said it looked like a movie bomb.  And he was, before he was put in a cell, fortunately,  this poor 14-year-old who just wanted to, by the way,  wearing a NASA t-shirt with handcuffs on him in the picture that made it  to the Dallas newspapers, he just wanted to show he was a geek with some cred.  Instead, he's three days suspension.  He could conceivably be prosecuted, although I did not,  I did not listen to the press conference.  I didn't either.  I don't know what the minute is.  Stupid.  Well, it's beyond stupid.  It's racist.  It's racist as hell.  It's horrific.  It's Islamophobia meets techno panic.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I wouldn't have led with it, except I just loved that picture that Jenny  posted of a Syrian nerd in his garage.  And I think that's the most important thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's the most important thing.  I think that's the most important thing.  I think that's the most important thing.  I also just love the fact that now this is the coolest kid in America.  Yeah, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It actually was all worthwhile.  I can't imagine how kind of scared he was when the police came and put him in

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  handcuffs because even though he told everybody in the school,  it's a clock, it's a digital clock.  They said, oh, it's a bomb.  The police described it as a hoax bomb, even though he's suspicious of the  police, he's a little bit of a freak.  The thing is, you know, it's a, it's a, it's a, the kind of clock they put on  bombs in movies for a plot point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You wouldn't actually put anything like that on a bomb.  If you've got a bomb, there's no problem a certain time.  You don't put a bright light on it.  There's counting down.  That's just a plot device.  Well, so it's, it's, it's, it's exactly, you know, Bruce Schneier's movie plot  threat nonsense.  It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a,  it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a,  it's a plot threat nonsense personified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it also to me underscores how ignorant most Americans are about how  electronics works.  They've seen digital clocks.  They just never bothered to look inside to see exactly the same kinds of  components.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  By the way, if it's a bomb then where are the explosive elements of this?  It's a circuit board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a minor, a minor detail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This, this, this will break, this will break your heart.  The second tweet in this, which obviously I think Anil helped do,  Ahmed says, thank you for your support.  I really didn't think people would care about a Muslim boy.  Doesn't that just break your heart?  It breaks my view of this country right now.  And, and I know people, your viewers get mad when I get to be political, but  F it.  I don't care.  This is exactly why Donald Trump is a demagogue and an evil for trying to  bring this, this hating of the others up.  And this is the result.  You know, it's Irving, Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The mayor of Irving is famous for being an Islamophobe.  Look at all the great pictures in solidarity with Ahmed.  I think so.  This is where social media is just fan.  Tastic.  This is all from his Twitter feed, which means he's seen every one of these.  And, and I think that's a great picture.  Grant Amahara, who is a wonderful fellow.  We know, make stuff for the myth busters.  Absolutely tragic.  When I was his age, I took everything apart too, and tried to make things.  This is not what America needs.  American needs people who make things, not terror and fear.  Of a homemade clock and ignorance.  I wonder if the Donald will mention this on the debate tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the journalists will.  Hillary Clinton tweeted assumptions and fear don't keep us safe.  They hold us back.  Ahmed stay curious and keep building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm, I'm glad to see the response and the support.  He tweets about to meet attorney.  I imagine the, there'll be a bit of a lawsuit in that, which is a shame.  Cause really that's not, that's not the solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The solution is this, which is so, but you need, you need to, but, but, but there  needs to be consequences for bigotry.  Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cause what if, what if this kid, you know, what if it hadn't come out on social  media? What if there hadn't been an Aneel and, and, and this kid just ends up  being miserable for years, hands forward.  Well, and there are lots of kids probably in that position right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  For some slight, that's not as, as, as so colossally theatrically stupid, right?  As this Texan moment.  It looked like a movie bomb.  Jesus.  I saw some reference in the news that he was not going to be charged.  No charges are being filed.  Yes.  They dropped charges.  Well, yeah.  What would you charge him with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A movie bomb?  There is no explosives.  It's a circuit board and a clock.  You charge him with scaring stupid people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you scared.  You know, if that becomes a crime, we're in deep trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amen.  So on behalf of STEM education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They also questioned him without his parents' presence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there is going to be a significant, significant, significant, significant  lawsuit.  People should lose jobs.  At least people should lose jobs over this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whoever arrested it, the principal of the school should be out of his or her job.  The teacher who reported it.  I would push for a 10 year fight on that.  The police who did this, the mayor, they should be hounded out of their jobs because who wants  such idiots in charge of such important things as education and safety?  It's not a bomb.  It's a clock.  All right.  I just I had to bring that up because I'm glad you did for crying out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google is I hope I'm not stealing your number.  I have a number if you don't.  No, no, no, I've got numbers.  So I did put this in the numbers, but I found it so fascinating.  I saw that Jason put it up on the and I raised it for mine because it's an appropriate number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two billion lines of code.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  Because it's an appropriate number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Two billion lines of code run Google.  Well, now, Kevin, you're a coder.  Is that a lot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sounds like quite a lot to me.  I mean, you know, lines of code is always a silly man.  Yes, I agree.  Yes.  It is like what it depends on.  Terse your languages and also encourages people to write ridiculous spell scripts to fit on one line, which is which is not right.  That's not good either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Microsoft Windows, they estimate in the realm of 50 50 million lines.  This comes from Google's Rachel Pogba.  That surprises me.  I think that's a low number.  I don't think that's accurate.  And I know it's oh, yeah, absolutely.  That's low.  Modern operating.  I bet you Chrome.  I bet you Chrome is 50 million lines.  Really?  Well, lines doesn't mean anything.  Yeah, that's not an efficiency as as I'm pointing out.  Some of those lines are comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Kevin's right.  There's that we lost the scarcity of space with memory.  I remember way back when when I worked on the services examiner, we had S.I.I. terminals.  They were smart terminals for publishing.  And when somebody put hyphenation and justification and managed to fit it locally in the terminal, that was just that was mind boggling.  That was possible.  Absolutely mind boggling.  That can be done.  It can be done because there was such incredible efficiency in the code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chromium, which is the open source version of Google Chrome.  Of course, we can count the lines in the open source project is 17 million lines of code.  That's for a browser alone.  So 50, I think, is low for Windows.  But in any event, two billion.  I don't know.  Again, like like Kevin says, doesn't really mean anything.  But it's yes, there's a certain amount going on here.  Rachel Potvin mentioned this at an engineering conference in Silicon Valley.  It's an estimate that includes Google Search, Gmail, Google Maps.  Again, it's a rough estimate, although I suppose you could count them there in a single code repository.  That, to me, is more interesting.  All 25,000 Google engineers have access to the Google code repository.  She says, and I think this is probably the case, it's the single largest single code repository anywhere in the world.  Well, that right.  That's a big deal, isn't it, Kevin, to put all of that code openly to it in a repository.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like one repository.  That sounds you know, that sounds a bit of an initiative.  It's GitHub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, GitHub has a copy of it everywhere that it sits.  So it's get get run GitHub.  Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, not GitHub.  Get I think it's get now.  It wasn't get when I was there, but that may have changed.  It was in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bet they use get do they use their own CV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was a mixture of things.  There was there was some that was in the Curio and there was some that was in per force.  I'm sure it's all moved to get by now.  They may well have moved to get by now.  I don't know.  And they've done a big project to move a lot of the external face and stuff to get certainly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So did you I mean, when you were there, could you access this the repository?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was that I mean, that's I mean, that is true.  That's the point is the point is that everyone can see the code.  You've still got to send pull requests to people if you want to change things.  But there's a process of doing so.  Well, there's a complicated process of different kinds of committers and who gets to commit things.  And you have to have what they call readability in different languages.  So you have to in order to submit changes to something in certain language, you have to prove your competence in that language.  And so there's there's a sort of big peer process for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, this is interesting.  So the main Facebook app is 20 million lines of code, according to this article.  And Facebook and Google are working on an open source version control system based on Mercurial.  We're attempt this is a pot fit again.  We're attempting to see if we can scale Mercurial to the size of the Google repository.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, because they have been using Mercurial, which is the Python based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Explain to people who are not programmers what a what a code repository is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the point of having a source code control system is that it doesn't just keep the current version of the code.  That's useful. It keeps all the previous versions as well, unless you see what they've been checking in and out.  The analogy would be the edit history you see on Wikipedia.  So you can go back to any previous version of the code.  You can see who made the changes.  And you can selectively also create what are called branches.  So you say, OK, I want to go off and try a side project here that doesn't go with everybody else's code.  Work on that. And then when you're when you're happy with it, bring it back in.  So it's a model for doing lots and lots of edits on text in parallel and making sure they have all the versions of it.  And this is obviously this is a core program problem for programs.  Before we had this, it was you were doing the same things people do with documents where you save like version one, version two, copies and all that stuff.  And if you know, it's also we get bits of this behind the scenes now in if you look at Google Docs or words changes and things like that, there is a sense that there are previous versions of the documents there.  You know, Apple has like previous versions of the documents.  Conversioning is very handy.  But it's but it's a it's it's a hard problem.  But it's a lot of computer science been thrown at it.  So we've got good ways of doing it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But years everybody use subversion Linus Torvalds famously dissatisfied with subversion with all the code repository.  There was CVS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a whole chain of years.  But the previous model was that you the idea was you would have locks on each file in the repository.  You check it out.  And then when you had it checked out, nobody could modify it.  You would check it back in again.  That's how CVS worked.  And subversion was was close to that.  And the big change was with get particularly and Mercurial as well does the same thing was the notion that merging should be so straightforward.  You can have multiple versions.  So the idea is that most of the time you you check stuff out and have your own copies and then you push stuff back in and it merges automatically.  And it's only when there's a two of you have edited the same line or something that you'll get a merge conflict and you have to go and fix that.  And that's so the source code control is now designed to be done deeply in parallel.  But there was still a cultural sense of there should be one true version that you should get permission before checking things in and so on.  And one of the things that GitHub changed was the institution of the first thing you do is fork the code and make your changes.  And so both versions exist on the site.  And then when you're done, you send a pull request to say, I've changed this.  Here's here it is.  You can go through and look at it.  But in each case, you're you're working in public with all the variations on a theme.  And that was that was that was an interesting cultural shift in the in the way that open source worked.  Because before that, there was very much this culture of the the benevolent dictator who decided whose code made it into the project.  And that was that done through main list and so on.  And that was why Linus built Git in the first place was to to to help him manage that process.  But in effect, the the GitHub thing of making it all basically publishing your own fork by default does provide a different way of doing that.  So you can instead of saying, I'm going to go and argue with you about which version to go in the code, you can just say, here's my version.  Take your own pick.  So you can be passive aggressive about it or you can just put a version up there and then send a pull request saying, I've made these changes.  Right.  You know, what do you think?  What do you think? But the point is, both versions are available and people can decide between them.  So there's sort of before this forking a project was this like the only thing that only happens after a gigantic fight between the founders and usually causes all kinds of grief between the maintainers rather than the founders.  And now forking is the thing you do first before you do the changes.  And then when you're happy with what you've got, you send it back.  So it's an interesting nuance in in how the social activity changes by making more versions public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you get to feed the cat, Jeff?  Yes, I did.  I was trying to beat his cat.  So I asked Kevin, you asked me to speak something that would make me something that would take a long time to answer.  What is code versioning, Kevin?  How does that work?  Lines of code dot org, code dot org says they have their people who've used code dot org, which is a great site for teaching kids and even some elders had a program.  Lines of code in the code dot org tutorials.  Seven point four million people have written code on code dot org.  I like that.  Anyway, two billion.  What I'm surprised at is that every engineer at Google has access.  Isn't there a secret sauce, a Coca-Cola recipe in there somewhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, not in a in a compact form like the Coca-Cola recipe.  You know, it's the thing is that a lot of it is wouldn't you worry about somebody just kind of copying it and going to Yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the thing is, you can't, you know, well, we have this conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We were open sourcing things when I was there.  And the problem is, well, you can't really run this code without Google's infrastructure.  It's not just the code, is it?  It's not written.  Well, it's the code.  But it's the way they've got all these systems that run on multiple computers in parallel, you know, MapReduce and all the other things that they've produced out there.  And some of them some of those have been released, but a lot of them haven't.  And so there's this giant infrastructure that spins up machines on demand and spawns processes and makes stuff flow back and forth.  And so there was, you know, at the time it was, well, why don't you open source the search algorithm?  It's like, well, the search algorithm isn't any use to you unless you got all this other infrastructure and B got a copy of the web on your servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Jeff, if you if you need to make a trip into New York to get something, just let me know and I'll ask him what MapReduce is.  Actually, MapReduce is kind of magical, but I don't think we have time on this show.  Let's talk about something.  I can give you a short version of it.  OK, let's see.  I'll start the timer.  Kevin Marks, MapReduce, go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the basic idea of MapReduce is instead of building a database to store things, you store the data in the original format and construct databases when you need them.  And so the classical database model is you design the database, build indexes, and then you can ask it questions.  MapReduce, but if you want to actually touch the whole database, it will be very slow because you have to go through a bunch of indexes.  Each read and write takes a lot of touching indexes and things because it's designed to be able to be flexible.  And MapReduce sort of turns that around and says, OK, we want to go through this data set and make some sense of it.  So we will read every entry in the data set once and perform the operation on that.  And that's the map phase.  Then you've got this giant intermediate product, which is, although basically that operation run on every entry in the database.  Then you do what's called a shuffle, which is the bit that people don't talk about, which sorts them into some order.  And then you do a reduce phase where you collect those back together.  So if you're counting the number of words in the document or the current particular word in the document, you run a little program in the map phase that finds documents that have that word in.  Then the shuffle phase, you organize them together and then reduce phase, you go through and output all the documents that have that word in most frequently.  And that's your, sorry, the count of how many times per document they occur.  And that's your answer to the query.  It's kind of like a compression algorithm.  It's more a way of doing like, basically it's a way of doing a large transformation on the data.  And classically, this isn't something you do classically with databases.  You put data into databases and then ask the database about it.  And the process of importing data into the database is something you do once and it's this horrible code you write once and everybody hates doing it.  But once you've done that, then you've got an official way of updating the databases.  And MapReduce sort of turns that backwards and says the script that translates the free form data into the database is the bit that you spend the effort on.  And the database is a disposable output of that because you can always run this thing again and adjust it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure they didn't invent the concept, but they're quite famous for their MapReduce algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sure they completely invented the concept, but it was the thing that sort of spawned the idea of big data.  But I think that's a misnomer. It's more about messy data.  The problem is the classic database thing is you're building a data model and organizing the world to fit that data model.  And then the exercise is constructing the great data model and then working out how to get the data into it and then working what questions you ask of it.  Whereas from Google's point of view, they were starting with the web, which is like the most giant collection of random bits of text in the world.  And so they were trying to construct meaning from that, which meant that they knew that the source of the data was always going to be messy and it was going to be growing all the time.  So having a process for finding that order was the important part of it.  And so they built this process and scale it.  The scale of it was hard, too. But the scale isn't the key part of this process way of thinking, because you can computers get faster and get more capacity.  It's more rethinking the way you're thinking about data in the first place to say it's not a big data problem.  It's a messy data problem.  So what signal are we looking for this data? We'll run the map produce and extract that, see what we get with the assumption you'll keep changing that map produce processing to do more things in future and you'll get other versions of this database out.  So it is a different worldview.  And it's one of those things that's quite, you know, this is part of the Google induction is they explain all this process to you and how it works.  And it is sort of, you know, now there's third party ways of doing this.  There's Hadoop and other map produce like processes and things like that as well.  But it is a very much different way of thinking about things.  And it was for a while that was very much Google's competitive advantage was not so much that they had all these resources, but they had a way of approaching problems that other people hadn't thought of to use yet.  And that has now trickled out and there are other people who use that methodology.  But it's a different way of thinking about data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Moving on.  No, no, I know I love this stuff.  And I've been having a hard time wrapping my head around map produce.  So I'm glad you explained it so succinctly.  Have you have you Jeff downloaded Apple's iOS nine yet and taking a look at their new new was no I have not because I've got to do it on my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pod. Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I, I phones. That's a phone, I think. No, it's not. It's an iPod touch touch. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. And I have a touch that I use for running iOS as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. Well, I don't want to find another phone contract.  So right. Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's where I went. There's where I went wrong.  I get I keep getting new phones. I should just stop and get some non phone stuff.  Of course, this is a new platform for news.  Facebook's done it as well. Google and Twitter are now supposedly teaming up for instant articles.  Are all these the same kind of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just did a column for this and the observer in New York's observer.  And yes, to the extent that their radical distribution of content, the content is going to go to the people.  The people are going to go to the content.  Instant articles. We've talked about a lot of their show.  Everybody knows what that is. This Google thing, which is still officially report, you know, reportedly, but it's happening is very, very interesting.  And I'm going to make an analogy that's probably not technically true, but conceptually true at I.O.  Google showed custom Chrome tabs that allowed you to a developer to preload and prefetch preload a browser and prefetch content into it so that when a user clicked on it, there would be BOMB right there.  So it's solving the same fundamental usability problem that Facebook is solving, which Facebook argues and Mark argues is speed.  But this but Google is doing this as an open standard.  And this is a discussion that I've that I've had openly and here on the show.  I got back from News Geist, the news Google confab last held in Helsinki.  There was a lot of discussion of this because instant articles just come out.  I was one of the ones in the room who said, OK, Google, sorry, I said that folks are all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, Siri, wake up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, Google, you've been one up.  So, you know, with the creation now, what are you going to do?  And the thing I would say, they listen to me and not say it's probably already in the works forever.  But I said, why don't you do an open source version of instant articles that this kind of distributed structure I've been arguing for for years.  I think I wrote my first piece like four or five years ago, arguing that this is the ultimate extension of the link economy,  rather than forcing people to link to our sites and click to our sites that we go to them.  We embed our content wherever it is.  That's in the Facebook flow.  It's going to be on sites everywhere.  So, yes, the Apple news thing is one more piece of that where you go to your audience where they are, whether that's in Snapchat,  whether that's in Apple, whether that's on Facebook, whether that's on other sites.  And I can see a world here where, you know, the Washington Post can say can do a deal with the New York Times and say, well, what the hell?  We'll prefetch all your stuff.  You prefetch all of our stuff and, you know, our own ads stay with our own content, our own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And incidentally, ad blockers will stop working, right?  No.  Do you still have blockers work on this content?  I would bet it would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's part of the game of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that ad blockers won't or will work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so part of what's going on here...  If it's a cached image of the page...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're not sure what's cached or what's going to have to be fed live.  Among the questions that have not been answered yet about this is exactly that question.  So the content can be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everything will look like it'll be from first party if it's cached.  But if the ads aren't cached, then that will be blockable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the reason they may not be able to be cached, I think, this is just me speculating here...  Because you won't get metrics.  Well, no, you could still have a ping back.  So here's to me the choice.  And again, this is just me blathering here.  I have no knowledge of this particularly.  I see two choices.  One is to cache the ad, but then to write a ping back in this structure.  So it will ping back at the server and say that it was seen.  What if this content was cached two weeks ago?  And what if you have programmatic advertising, which is...  And retargeting advertising, which is supposed to...  Which is trying to go to you exactly.  But it can't because it just becomes a one size fits all ad for everybody.  Because it got cached into a page and you don't know who's going to call it up.  Right.  Now, if you do serve the ads live, the problem is you're back to square one in terms of the speed problem.  Because that's what slows down all these damn pages.  So I do not know what they're going to do about this.  So, you know, serving the ads live isn't intrinsically serving the pages down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, Google serves the ads live, but they do it very well.  It's more that my sense is that we're in the stage that, you know, when the credit and fault swaps thing happened,  it made money for a while and then the margins were going down.  So they doubled up on the kinds of credit and fault swaps they were doing until it got out of hand.  And I sense we're in that phase with web advertising where you used to be able to make money just by sticking AdSense in there.  And now it's like, oh, that does not make enough money.  Let's stick something in there.  Let's stick this next thing in there, which is how you get news websites where you open the page  and it downloads several megabytes of JavaScript from a bunch of random sites you've never heard of before.  And so, you know, Google's interest may well be to sort of strip those out and replace them with their own ads and say,  look, we'll just put ours in because we know what we're doing.  And there's obviously a...  But the publishers won't allow that.  But the publishers may not allow that.  But that's the question.  I mean, do you remember Google Fast Flip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  Oh, yeah.  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Google Fast Flip was a previous attempt at this.  When was this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like a circus act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Something on AGT.  So basically what they did was they rendered the pages as bitmaps.  So they would download a...  like load the web page in a browser on Linux and rip it to a bitmap and then serve you that instead  because that was faster than rendering the HTML from all these sites.  Yeah, that's what this sounds like.  But it's not.  I assume they're not doing that this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're prefetching the whole page because the idea here is behind this.  And this is what...  Don't forget, this is around this digital news initiative.  And so it's going to be trying to be nice to publishers.  It's not going to be offensive to publishers.  That's the given of this.  So the publishers say...  It's gone now.  My...  Oh, jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's gone in a big way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They didn't even bother with a fancy URL.  Oh, that's because it's Google Labs, which is also gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a Google Labs thing, yeah.  But this was...  They want their...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The publishers want their ads served on their pages.  They want their analytics and their brand.  And they want their look and feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but we're entering a world of...  Today begins the ad block ellipse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree, absolutely.  But you know, I've been thinking about that.  I've been trying to work on a post about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We should mention that's because iOS 9 comes out today.  Apple will finally allow ad blocking in mobile Safari.  There are already at least three different programs,  including Crystal, that will do that.  And I'm sure they'll be very popular on the App Store.  The real problem with blocking ads,  as soon as...  Once you do it, you never want to go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I wrote a piece for The Observer.  I'm doing that weekly now on this.  And I can argue, as we have on this show,  we've had this discussion on the show,  that you're stealing candy from the mouths of journalists  by using ad blockers.  But the truth is, we screwed it up.  Advertising is so awful.  I think they brought it on themselves.  So irritating.  So slow.  They brought it on.  So what we have to do...  So I wrote about what I called an emotium xlax cycle here,  of blocking and unblocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've done this before.  Remember pop-up blockers?  Pop-up ads got so annoying that every browser  built in pop-up blockers.  They all have them now.  Nobody said, that's the end of the web.  But this is a little more global than that.  Right.  That blocked just one form of annoying advertising.  This blocks it all.  Including, in most cases, all analytics.  The Washington Post...  Half the people are doing it because they don't want to see ads.  The other half are doing it because they don't want to be tracked.  Speed is the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The apps are relying on tracking.  The most annoying apps are the ones that stalk you around the web.  Right.  Every time you touch a page, things get thrown out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't want to block the whole damn thing.  On the other hand, Kevin,  on the other hand, irrelevant advertising is also irritating.  The problem is, it's stupid relevant advertising.  You see the boots on Amazon, the boots follow you around,  long after you bought the frigging boots.  And so it's not just so much creepy as it is incredibly dumb.  So we've got to fix advertising.  We've got to make it relevant and useful and informative  and engaging again.  The only way it can be relevant is if I know something about you.  Well, that's the creepy line.  That's privacy.  We've got to figure out...  I think we need to find a way to find a structure for consensual advertising.  Neelay Patel tweeted,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's Apple's attempt to kill Google's revenue tonight.  It is.  He said Google's revenue.  I absolutely agree.  Because Apple, by the way, will not block ads in mobile apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple failed basically at the ad business.  Apple was supposed to become an ad giant.  It never did.  It failed.  So it's going to ruin it for everybody else.  There's a moral hazard.  The ad blockers on both sides have moral hazards.  The ad block plus and all that has been called by many often,  and I agree, racketeering because they charge you for the waitlist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we do not recommend ad block plus.  That's not our choice in any respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then in this world, Apple has a moral...  It's also not a very good code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ublock Origin is the one we've talked about.  Steve Gibson did a whole thing on security now.  Once you start using it, you will never stop.  Everything loads fast.  It's not even about not seeing ads for me.  It's about how fast the pages load, how uncluttered they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's what both Instant Articles and this new Google attempt to fix.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My friend Tantec runs his browser with JavaScript turned off by default  so that everything loads quickly.  And it also helps to see which people are not using the web,  because he's an HTML guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's hard to do that for very long.  You run NoScript and pretty soon you realize  that you've turned off pretty much everything on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or you can turn little bits back on again.  Yeah, you have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Otherwise, even our own site, even our site, won't work without JavaScript.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's...  So part of this is the ad scenes.  One of the talks at XOXO this weekend was Heather Armstrong, Deuce,  talking about how she gave up blogging  because of the things she was expected to do for advertising now.  Because she used to be able to write what she wanted  and fund it with the banner ads.  But in order to make the money, she had to do what they call...  Native.  Native content advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a shame, because Deuce's blog was one of the proto blogs,  is one of the great blogs.  I didn't know she was going to have to give it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, she tells that story, and the video will be up soon.  I don't want to take her punchlines away.  But basically she ended up saying that  she was being forced to editorially compromise  what she wanted to write by the people who were subsidizing it.  She was being expected to go and do things with her kids  and take photographs of them using the products and all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, mommy bloggers in particular are subject to a lot of that pressure.  She couldn't resist the pressure, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, she did. That was the point. That's why she stopped.  That's too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She uses federated media now to sell advertising on her site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Federated media was part of the discussion.  Anyway, I don't want to reiterate her whole talk,  but we'll see when that comes up.  But the point is that it was very much a...  This has led to part of my sense that we have this problem  where...  Well, Maciej Cieklowski describes it as  we don't really have advertising value.  We have investor story time value, where you tell your investors  that you're going to make lots of money from advertising in the future from this stuff.  But in practice, it doesn't make that much because there is a gap between the...  Because there is a saturation curve in what looks like an exponential curve,  and we're sitting at that now with advertising.  And that is the challenge.  My point of view on the challenge is we just find other ways of paying for content than advertising.  No, I disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There isn't enough money, Kevin, to support what we need and have.  And journalism won't be supported that way  because journalism is information rich, and information is immediately commodified as soon as it's known.  So this idea that we should be paid for our content the way that HBO was paid for Game of Thrones,  we're in completely different businesses, and the models are completely different,  and I don't agree that paying for content is going to work.  The other problem with paying for content is it redlines journalism and redlines knowledge,  and only those who can afford it get it.  And democracy, that's big trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's the point.  That's why I'm saying we need to be paying for content, but not gatekeeping content.  It is the...  We need to reinvent the brought to you by viewers like you model of  I am paying so other people can see this.  That's part of it, but we also have to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think we can give up yet on advertising.  I think that Apple's given up and Murdoch's given up, but the rest of us can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm not saying you can yet.  I'm saying it's down to technologists like me to think about ways of doing this better.  Yes.  The thing is, at the point where advertising is paying you a thousandth of a cent per viewer,  you're already in trouble, and that's why we end up with these sites that are full of several megs  of different advertising desperately trying to claw a few more micro cents out of each view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why we have the 8,000 versions of the same story.  There's 800 people who are going to the debate tonight, journalists,  as if they're all going to have their own special, wonderful, unique perspective.  No, they all want their own take, so they get their own ad on it,  so they get their own pennies from that.  And we don't reward original work.  We don't reward real reporting.  We reward an old business model, an old mass media business model of volume.  Yes, no, exactly. And so that's what I'm getting at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the point is, if one person likes your thing enough to send you $10,  that outweighs 100,000 ad views or more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I'm not against that. I'm not all against that, but I'm just arguing.  We've seen this argument for micropayments, for Blendle.  What you end up getting is the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What you don't get is dues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's supplemental, but it will not fundamentally pay what we need to pay for.  The amount of ad revenue that's there, and again, a lot of it's inefficient  and wasted and repetitive, and I've got other problems here.  But I say job one is to fix and rethink advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, see, okay, we can agree to disagree,  because I think job one is to replace advertising with something  that doesn't have as many perverse incentives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we're going to supplement advertising with those things  so we can agree to agree on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about Google Contributor? Is that a good middle ground?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how much, Google should say, I'm going to bet you that the amount of money  from Google Contributor is below the minimum.  Yeah, I think that's probably true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sure, but it has the same micropayment problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Whereas if you look at the money from Kickstarter, that can actually do these things,  because it encourages you to pay an actual sensible amount of money  rather than a fraction of a cent that you have to track across all the sites you go to.  So the question is, can we find a way to encourage that kind of model for news  rather than just manufacturing things as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are those who say advertising, you pay for advertising.  Advertising isn't free to you either.  You pay for the advertising through paying higher prices for the advertiser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but in a competitive marketplace you end up paying less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I've had these conversations, I had nauseam,  and I'm sure those of our audience who watch all of our shows would agree.  But we have a model, I know for a fact, well I don't know for a fact,  but I have some evidence, a considerable amount, that we could not do a paywall and still survive on Twitter.  So advertising works well for us, but we have been very careful to respect our audience with the advertising that we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure.  Kevin, where we absolutely agree is I had an event at CUNY, my school, two weeks ago in membership.  And I argue we've got to look at, right now in media we see membership as another word for subscription.  Give us money.  We've got to see ways to serve new tribes.  We've got to have new ways that people contribute to value to us besides just cash,  which includes marketing and expertise and information.  And we've got to give people new rewards besides just access to content, social status and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What would you do if you were me?  I'm curious, either one of you.  What financial model should I have going forward?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that is the challenge.  The challenge is, well, there's one thing here is there is an inherent assumption in a lot of these arguments is that there is a single price.  And this is a sort of chivalry of economics, that there is a single price for things.  And if you try and have differentiated prices, then that will fail for you.  So you draw your price demand curve and you find the sweet spot between how many people pay us a dollar and how many people will pay us a hundred percent or whatever.  And the thing that I think is fascinating about the Kickstarter experience and Patio and some of these other ones is that they're all humble bundle.  There are several of these things.  And what they say is, well, what is it worth to you?  How much do you want to give?  And this draws me back to the sort of the public media thing of what level are you contributing at?  How much do you want to support us?  And so on.  And the point of that is it's not so much you're selling variable prices is you're giving people permission to pay a different amount and a reason to do so and an emotional reason to do so.  And I think understanding how that works is going to be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We do see that sometimes with the musicians and other artists where they will say, pay what you think it's worth.  And the experience of most musicians is that that works very well.  Who was it that did that with there? Was it Nine Inch Nails? One of their albums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, some of them did that.  And Zoe Keating publishes how much she gets paid on different systems things and talks about this event and says, yeah, there are people who will pay me five hundred dollars for an album because they like what I do.  Because they love you.  Yes, and certainly Amanda Palmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amanda Palmer has gone that way too.  And I agree.  But look at look at fine.  Look at public media.  That's how they work, isn't it?  Not well.  But advertising is absolutely vital to its survival.  Right.  They have huge ad sales.  More and more all the time.  Less than 10 percent of the audience pays for the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can no longer distinguish between whatever that is they call in public media and an ad.  It sounds exactly like an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My advice to you is that you have you already have the model and I don't like native advertising and when it tries to fool people.  But advertising that is in the flow that you frankly can't get away from that works and that's what you already have.  So you're already way, way, way ahead of the advertising model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, Apple has introduced a new ad blocking feature, which nobody recognizes an ad blocking feature, and it's Apple TV.  Skip seven minutes.  They have a variable length skip built into Apple TV via voice.  And that's why I didn't know that one is an ad blocker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember when the DVRs were.  Yeah, replay TV got put out of business for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They got sued to death.  Yeah.  And the other thing I think is possible reprogrammed the button.  Yeah, Tevo hit it.  They just had a Easter egg.  Thirty seconds skip replay actually had a 30 second skip button.  They're gone.  And the other thing is Apple.  But Apple has enough market clout that they can do that.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, unless unless there are efforts.  In fact, right now in Europe, Springer, who led the fight against Google, is also fighting against ad block and they're going to court.  I don't think I'm blocking the blockers is going to win.  I don't think suing is going to win in the end.  But I think we should try in any way is fine.  I think Apple could be vulnerable here.  I think that people go after Google all the time.  I mean, I think Google all the time, an antitrust.  It's Apple that's operating to a moral hazard in these cases when it comes to the advertising business.  The other piece that you have and I know you played with this in terms of you've had to contribute buttons, which are nice.  You're grateful to bring it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We started with that only we said I said I won't do ads for the first couple of years.  Public broadcasting's model, I'm told, is that about four percent of the audience will contribute.  You have to go in for it.  I asked them to death for that.  I wasn't willing to do that.  So we got about one percent.  It was enough for me to do one, you know, to not to have an employee or it was enough to.  But there's another question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that there is a there's a kind of membership structure that could work for you.  If you're a security geek, you want to support Steve Gibson.  You pay for Steve.  And you should be not paying for Steve's content.  You're paying to support Steve's good work.  You're paying for him to be there.  And again, you have to rethink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Eighty thousand people listen to that show for free.  Right.  So that's a tribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a that's that's that's probably go down to ten thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much should I charge?  Five bucks a month charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, don't charge.  You don't charge patronage.  So the next questions are how to give him value.  Right.  Right. And what privileges of membership do they get at some level?  You know, there's a book called The Curve.  This is exactly Kevin's point a minute ago.  There's a variable value here.  We treat everybody media all the same.  You go to the variable value, the author of The Curve.  I didn't read it.  I just listened to his lecture online for free.  But he said you need a long tail to convert a certain number to pay a certain amount.  But you then can convert some number of schmucks to pay a thousand dollars for fake hay to feed to fake cows.  There are people out there and Amanda Palmer, if you haven't, we've I think you've all watched Amanda Palmer's amazing Ted talk about about this.  There are people who would pay a thousand dollars to support Steve, who would who would go to an event with Steve and pay for that privilege to be with Steve or to be able to get a little bit consulting from Steve at a certain rate.  There is a variable value that you could capture, less so for a show like this, because, you know, Jarvis Plathers screw it.  They're not even worth that.  Free is too expensive.  But Steve has incredible value to people.  People want to support his work.  They believe his work is important in the entire ecosystem.  Yeah, I think you could have the Steve Club, but it's not about charging for access to the show.  Instead, it's about giving people.  Have you watched the Amanda Palmer Ted talk?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's about giving people the opportunity to be generous to you.  And right now they don't have the opportunity.  They have a they have a give button or they listen to the ads.  That's really all you have.  If you think through a membership strategy more, it goes around different ways to contribute in different ways to get rewards.  Social status.  If Steve mentions, you know, here's my 10 biggest patrons.  Thank you very much.  These 10 people, they'll fell happiness.  And Steve has done this.  Yeah, we're going to take a break when we come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A new Google project.  You're going to be excited about Jeff called Project Aura.  But first, a word from our sponsors, all those words you love to hear.  But first, a word from our sponsors.  Actually, Samsung SmartThings is a sponsor that started with crowdsourcing.  The SmartThings Hub was originally a Kickstarter project.  And they were and they did great because they were trying to solve a problem.  Anybody who's tried to solve the home automation conundrum wants to solve, which is how do you get a bunch of different things using different protocols, different apps on the smartphone to talk to one another, to work together?  How do you simplify that?  The SmartThings Hub, that's how the SmartThings Hub talks to everything.  Hundreds of devices, including SmartThings own devices, allows you to use a single app on your iPhone, your Android phone or your Windows phone for monitoring, for security, for lighting, for entertainment.  One app does it all and can combine actions from a variety of unrelated devices.  So everything works together.  I really like that.  The new SmartThings Hub just came out.  I think you're going to like it.  Phones, light bulbs, everything, even your appliances can now be controlled from the SmartThings, the Samsung SmartThings Hub.  Different actions when you're asleep, awake, when you arrive home, when you leave home.  Get an alert on your smartphone if water is detected where it doesn't belong.  No contracts, no monthly fees and installation is a snap.  There's nothing to do but plug it in.  SmartThings, it's the easiest way to protect your home.  And we're going to get you a deal on any of the featured SmartThings kit.  There's the energy savings kit.  By the way, they're fully extensible.

We're so glad to have their support for our show.  And that is one thing that does happen is you have a real...  I don't think that's such a bad thing as you have a relationship with these companies to support the show.  We were at, last week, the reason I was in New York, Jeff, was for the IAB, the Interactive Advertising Bureau's first podcast up-fronts.  And that was very interesting.  You know about the regular network up-fronts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I wish I'd been there to go to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure you've gone to a few when you were a TV critic.  Oh, yeah.  So they'd bring in all the stars and they'd show the new shows and then they'd say to the advertisers,  would you like to buy this brand new show for the next, for the upcoming year?  That's not exactly how the podcast up-fronts worked.  None of the podcast stars were there.  There weren't that many.  Well, you were there.  Well, I was there.  But I, you know, I've been, I don't know if I'm a podcast star, but I am very committed to the medium.  So I wanted to support it.  And there were some big advertisers, some big agencies.  But, you know, podcasts don't sell a year's worth of, we don't announce the new season.  There is no season.  There's barely a season in TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Up-fronts are about a scarcity.  You want to beat somebody else to it and get the price before it becomes big.  And so you're, it's like an airline buying gas when the price is down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the star of the show, of course, is Serial.  Serial Konec was not there, of course, nor was the guy in prison.  But I was stunned.  Serial has set a new bar for podcast listenership.  Twelve episodes, a hundred million downloads.  And that's counted by PodTracker that does our metrics.  And I know PodTrack's very conservative.  If they say a hundred million, it's at least a hundred million uniques.  That's pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Gimlet guys were at ExoXO as well.  Yes.  And they were talking about this at Summit Center.  They were basically saying, we have very, very good ad rates.  This is good, but it makes us a little nervous because we're not sure that's going to last.  They want to keep doing what they do.  Well, we're all nervous.  And they've made some very successful podcasts there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sure have.  Sure have.  Between Startup and the podcast.  Startup is the podcast about starting Gimlet.  Anyway, it was fun.  It was good.  But there's still some spec, some nervousness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At least there's so many ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We sell ads.  We have several brokers that sell ads, including PodTrack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it worthwhile for business to go there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it wasn't for us.  We were there as guests of PodTrack.  So Lisa was very polite and did not pitch any of the advertisers there.  Or Lisa.  She was very polite.  But that was a big deal.  And I was glad to go there to kind of support it.  One of the things I told people is that when you...  I said, A, we turned down a lot of advertisers because what we're doing is...  And you should understand this.  The reason podcasts adds work is we're introducing our community,  our precious community, to an advertiser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Talk about that for a second.  Because I think that's critical to...  That's the scarcity we have to create in advertising.  Is the idea that says that there is a...  If advertisers want to be next to you, you create the flow,  which is native like old radio, number one.  Number two, you create relevance because you want to think things are going to be relevant to us as an audience.  But number three, the thing that you don't talk about much is this idea of something passing into your standards.  And not anybody can buy on Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, there was an audible gasp when I said, we turned down advertisers every day.  And at first I thought, Oh God, have I made some horrible blunder?  But everybody said, No, it's okay.  But they were shocked because that's not how it works.  Nobody turns away money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're protecting...  So nobody resents...  I don't think people resent the ads that you have on these shows.  We recognize what it is.  And because you do that, give us some examples.  I don't mean specific companies, but the kinds of things you turned down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, when we get inquiries from...  Well, sometimes I would turn down advertisers to protect them.  They want to spend money.  We're not going to do any...  We're not going to work for you because for a variety of reasons.  I'll turn down a product that I don't like.  Lately, a lot of antivirus companies want to advertise.  Well, we don't have any antivirus companies advertising because it's my opinion.  You no longer need an antivirus.  So that's the kinds of things.  Sometimes companies...  You don't have the conversation before the buy about what they want to tell the audience.  I wish you could.  Because sometimes after a company makes a buy, they say, now we want to say this.  And then I have to push back and say, you're not...  Well, you do with an RFP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like Deuce does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we don't do an RFP.  But like Deuce does where she says, no, I'm not going to do that.  But we try to pick advertisers that would understand that upfront.  You get this.  We're not going to lie to the audience.  We're not going to misrepresent your product.  We're not going to tell them a need exists where it doesn't.  And so we're pretty careful about who we pick.  And I thought that was the message.  Actually, the main reason I went to New York is to tell these big agencies and advertisers.  Your idea of what advertising is has to change in the new world.  So talk about that.  You have to treat the audience with respect.  And the whole reason for ad blockers is a lack of respect for people's bandwidth, time, and attention.  And so we say you're coming to our audience.  We want you to come as a peer.  Talk about features and benefits.  Hat in hand saying, would you like to buy our product?  Here's what it does.  And we protect.  I'm protective of the community because that's our only that's our real asset.  And that's all I care about.  That's why we do it in the first place.  And so the the advertiser we do because we need to pay for all this fancy equipment.  But so it's a it's a beneficial relationship as long as the advertiser understands that they have to respect the community as much as we do.  It doesn't always you know it doesn't always work.  A lot of people are very offended when I say you can't buy ads like what's wrong with us.  And we try not to say, well, I just think your company sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you lose agencies that represent those clients?  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sometimes we'll turn down.  It will turn away agencies.  A lot of advertisers go through agencies still.  That's a big problem with podcasting because agencies want to spend millions.  They're they make money lazy.  Well, they make money on commission.  So they get a percentage of the amount of ads they play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They won't one stop shopping at big audiences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they would much prefer to buy the Super Bowl than a podcast.  Even though a Super Bowl ad at millions of dollars, probably, you know, you spend too many dollars on Super Bowl and you could buy a podcast for the next 10 years.  But Lisa says, stop talking.  I haven't said anything bad.  I haven't said anything bad.  So an agency prefers to buy a big thing like that.  Right.  Because an agency gets a commission and it's a lot easier to get a commission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of a moral hazard.  Well, the agency is not motivated to save you money and you're by the agency is gets a cut of what's sold.  So the agency is motivated to make you spend more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's that that occurs in a lot of places in the world, doesn't the doctor who prescribes you medicines that you don't really need?  You know, I mean, I can go on and on and on on that one.  Now, this is what Lisa tells you to shut up.  Yeah, she's saying shut up.  I'm shut up.  I've been pretty much saying this for the last 10 minutes.  I don't mind.  I think I like to be transparent.  I think that's part of the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's part of the value that you bring is that and that people can't be here unless you you that's the scarcity.  Trust is the scarcity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, Tuck says you only choose US based stuff.  I don't choose the advertisers.  Don't think that we're choosing the advertisers.  We we we try to we go out and sell, but we do turn away advertisers.  And if we can't get we have mostly US based advertisers or many US based advertisers, but that's where US best US based company.  That's kind of just the way it kind of is.  I would love to have international.  That's hard to do.  And that's another case of where it's just there's never been a market for that.  When Ford buys an ad on NBC, they don't care if people see it in Germany.  They're going to have to start, aren't they?  Yeah, they do.  But they certainly don't pay for it at this point, right?  No.  Project Aura.  Google has high.  You know, those guys who were working at Amazon doing the fire phone and then Amazon went, Never mind.  First, they canceled the fire from this.  Then they filed AB lab to 126, which I'm told were very smart people.  Well, they're now working for Google.  Project Aura.  A U R A.  It apparently just started in June.  It's focused on reviving your favorite Jeff.  Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At least three employees, according to Business Insider from lab 126 work in the new group and they have a dedicated recruiter doing more hiring.  What would be the next generation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something simpler that does one function.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like wearables are.  I still believe in wearables, but I've yet to see one that I really like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Howard Stern is going to he refuses to wear the Apple Watch because he doesn't want electronic thing on his wrist all day on his body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is he afraid it may give him cancer?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we ever heard of risk cancer?  I don't maybe there is.  I don't want to make fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As far as I know, the real danger was when we had radium on the dials and the women who had to lick the brushes to apply radium to the glowing watch faces.  They didn't do so well.  But I don't you know, I think that the dangers of electronics next to your body are a little overblown.  I don't know.  I'm not a doctor.  Um.  OK.  Howard Stern's a little bit of a weirdo.  He's not he's not how we study that Dell weird how we yeah, man, Dell weird.  But he's he's you know, he could I could see I could see Howard wearing rubber gloves and fist bumping people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, Robin and Howard are having a fight last week about who's more insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Howard.  I don't know Robin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Robin's gone and had ayahuasca and decided to do odd cults and things.  OK.  Now she's freezing herself.  She's in that that hyper cold thing.  Was she doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But when she dies or just generally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no.  As a live person, this is the new thing.  You know, it's you know what you're in.  You're in air.  You're not immersed in this stuff.  Right.  I thought you were getting in a tub at one hundred sixty five below.  But no, you're just in a it's just chilly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just in a slightly colder room.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just chilly because air doesn't conduct as you know, air does not conduct all that  well.  It would.  I wouldn't do it in water or some liquid.  Actually, would.  Well, yeah.  Listen, they burn you.  You get frostbite.  Whatever happened to Google Books.  Big article by Tim Wu in The New Yorker last week.  That was a good article.  I thought it was a great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like Tim Wu.  He's a man who just went to the attorney general's office in the city of New York.  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was a professor at Columbia, right?  Yes.  What's he going to do at the attorney general's office?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cyber stuff.  So, you know, I liked him too, but Tim's been a little weird retrograde in some ways.  He wrote the kill switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're the kill switch.  And he writes for The New Yorker.  And he's talking about this project that is kind of sadly moribund to digitize all the  world's books.  And of course, it's the authors guild and it's ilk that shut it down saying, hey, well,  we want some royalties for those books nobody wants.  How do you feel you're an author?  How do you where do you come down on this?  I would guess that you're you're pro books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm very pro Google Books because I think that, you know, listen, I've written nobody's I do  still people still do by Google do, you know, and I'll get an occasional thing.  But at some point, let it be found.  And the problem with with this is that the promise of Google Books was all these outer print  things that you can't get even in a strand bookstore shelf suddenly could be exposed to the  air again and people could read it again.  But nope, that stopped.  And and I think that it was copyright fundamentalism to some extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, like Ursula K.  Le Guin, who said the deal that the publishers did with Google was a deal with the devil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's difficult because anything you say about it applies in the same way to libraries as well.  So it's very hard to work out what the model is.  Larry Lessig had a great solution.  He said, it's very simple.  When a copy when a copyright is about to expire, you you publish it and you say and you can renew

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it for one dollar.  And if there's anybody willing to pay, you know, if any author is willing to pay a dollar to retain  their copyright, then you renew it.  Otherwise, it goes into the public domain and Google.  It also works if you reduce the copyright turn back to a sensible amount.  I mean, right.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The problem is that the way copyright is the moment, but things never go out of court.  No, because we keep extending it.  So Mickey Mouse is never available.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And here's the public domain.  So it's a bit.  So there's a there's a challenge there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But so but the other half of this is, you know, how do how do libraries work?  And the Internet Archive has done a bunch of work with this as well, because they scan  physical books, too.  And they're trying to work out, OK, I'm going to do this.  No, no, he doesn't know.  He's trying to work out how to be an actual library, because that's what he cares about being.  He wants to preserve things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the library versus Google Books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what you can check out books from the library.  You have to check them back in again.  So there's a certain weirdness about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there's a notion they've only got one copy of the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've tried to do that with audio books and things that are digital.  It's just very strange.  And it ends up being it ends up being a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  wrong.  Yes, you check out a digital copy of a book and then you have to bring it back after two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  It's like, hmm.  So they did make a deal in 2008.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But apparently, for the first time, they were in the middle of the year.  So they were trying to do that with audio books and things that are digital.  And it's just very strange.  And it ends up being it does end up being sort of completely obviously odd.  Wrong.  Yes.  So apparently, for let's see, four years ago, a federal judge threw out the deal.  Right.  And they're still in the same the copyright issue should be decided by.  Oh, this will be this will work.  Congress.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that'll work.  Of course, leaving things to Congress, Tim writes, has become a synonym for doing nothing and  predictably a full seven years after that court decision.  We're still waiting.  Meanwhile, Google stopped, I presume, has stopped scanning.  I don't know what they're scanning.  Maybe they should just keep scanning it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, at some level for them, it's data.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they love data.  Their idea was to make what it was to make the world's information available to everybody  available and searchable, organized and accessible.  And that's exactly what this is, especially books that are obscure, out of print, not  out of copyright, thanks to our ridiculous copyright law, but still of societal interest,  but not of any financial interest to any author.  Right.  Apparently, the Authors Guild has proposed a solution called extended collective licensing  that would allow the owners of scanned out of print libraries like Google or actual nonprofits  to make a limited set of them available with payouts.  The U.S. Copyright Offer supports this plan.  This sounds a little bit like what this kind of weird hybrid thing that libraries are doing today.  Tim says, I suggest something simpler, the Big Bang license.  Congress should allow anyone with a scanned library like Google to pay a price, say $125 million,  to gain a license subject to any opt-outs, allowing them to make those scanned prints  available to institutional or individual subscribers.  That money would be divided equally among all rights holders who come forward to claim it  in a three-year window, split 50-50 between authors and publishers.  Yeah. Why would Google do that?  That's basically saying...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, the point is, Google would, you'd have to get legislative backing for that.  It would be a compulsory license like we have for a couple versions of songs or something like that.  You have to actually pass a law. So that is the challenge of that.  Nobody's going to pass a law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We do have some good news about the dancing...  President Lessig, maybe.  Lessig, President Lessig.  You know, I think maybe the fact that all of these candidates are just eating themselves alive might...  Maybe it's like some sort of annealing process where all of this junk gets burnt off and then all that's left is Larry.  And he becomes president.  And then he quits.  And then he quits. He has a very good... That was his plan.  I'm going to have a really good vice president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was actually the Howard Stern plan for governor.  Really?  Yeah, back when?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In the dancing baby case, which was a sad, sad case, a 2007 YouTube video of a toddler dancing happened to be a Prince song playing in the background.  Prince sued.  It's all the way up to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals now.  And actually, this isn't really about that dancing baby video.  The kid, by the way, is now like 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wanted to see if there was some follow up to the kid.  This kid should have gone to the Supreme Court just for the fun of it to say.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But more importantly, the justices ruled, and we're going to talk about this on Saturday with Denise Howell, our tame lawyer on the new screensavers.  The justices ruled, this is the big thing.  Copyright holders like Prince must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown.  Yes.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  To the good president.  On the other hand, they also said, but automated programs could be part of this too, which is like, that's the big problem is that all of the programs cannot distinguish fair use.  If we can't even get expensive lawyers to distinguish it without actually litigating, it's very hard for a program to do that.  And that is part of the challenge of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a huge change because up to now, and I've always was told this, fair use was a defense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, as Larry Lussak has always said, fair use is the right to hire a lawyer.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So in other words, after you get sued, you can now use it as a defense in court at a great expense.  But this court is now saying, no, before the takedown, the copyright holder should consider in her head, is this a fair use of my copyright?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if that person, if that copyright holder does not and goes after again and again and again, I presume that gives us some recourse.  If they take down twit shows again and again and again, at some point you can maybe have some basis to say that they were negligent in their obligation to fair use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we've been whitelisted because we did for a long time get tagged on YouTube all the time.  And to my knowledge, that stopped. Right.  What?  And of course, it was content ID. So it was automated, as you say.  And so the point is that on an automated system could be with some human intervention used in a way to protect fair use.  You could say, no, no, that's a news organization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when you try to do it, costing them money with staff to review all these cases, and at some point they just say it.  Whitelisted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Say, you know what, Twitter, Twitter's going to do this all the time.  People are going to complain all the time.  But Twitter is a news organization.  And traditionally, news organizations are allowed to use small bits of copyrighted material as part of a news story.  Anyway, we'll watch and see.  And we'll talk more about this with Denise.  She is. Yeah, she's an attorney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the series series youngs article at Mother Jones was a good summary of it. Good.  I will build that up. Good news anyway, I think.  I think it's a recognition that there's something else going on.  But the algorithms is a little bit tricky because as Sarah points out, there are four tests for fair use.  And one is how much of the things you use and that's anything algorithms can measure.  And they're only approximating.  Well, I'll give you an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could whitelist us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You've got lots of weird takedown things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, if I started using a Prince song as a show open, that would not be fair use.  Right.  Even and so you could whitelist us.  But that doesn't mean that everything we do with stuff is fair use.  It doesn't not everything passes those four tests.  Right.  Hey, if you need a lawyer, you need legal zoom.  Well, I should be very clear about this legal.  Is that is it now native content if I didn't like say and now a word from our sponsor?  Your voice changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, people know people know what I'm doing in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Legal zoom is not a law firm, but legal zoom is great if you need to do legal work like trademark copyright, last wills, living trusts, form a business, an LLC or S Corp.  Legal zoom is awesome.  Most of that stuff is just paperwork.  You don't need to spend hundreds of dollars an hour talking to an attorney.  You can do it all yourself on on legal zoom.com and they're very transparent.  You know exactly how much it's going to cost up front.  They're they're fantastic for the basic stuff.  Now, occasionally you do have a question and that's where legal zoom has a brand new thing that I love the legal zoom legal plan.  They can connect you with an independent attorney.  Base and at a at a flat rate pre negotiated flat rate and you know it's nice as you can.  They have profiles of the attorney, but even reviews customer reviews so you can really see what you're getting.  Legal zoom is not a law firm and they have to by law.  They have to say that, but that's why they give you such great value.  They don't charge you by the hour.  Instead, you get transparent pricing.  You get customer reviews so you know what you're getting up front.  I think we should just have customer reviews for the legal business in general, don't you?  That would fix a lot of things.  If you do need legal advice, their network of independent attorneys can provide the straightforward guidance you need in most states.  There is at least in your house.  You go to legal zoom.  You know, legal zoom is awesome.  Legal zoom.com.  Don't let legal hurdles become an excuse.  Protect yourself.  Protect your family.  Do it right with legal zoom.com.

Transcript:  OK, I just updated the iPod.  Yeah, took a while took the entire show.  Yeah, I'm looking for Apple News.  Where do I get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go to your home.  It should be on there.  Really?  Go home.  It should be probably on the front page.  They've taken newsstand off.  You shouldn't see newsstand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see newsstand with a little tiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, make sure you got iOS 9.  Maybe you got 8.4.1.  Maybe you haven't been updating religiously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shouldn't see newsstand.  General about.  Where do I find a nine version?  Number nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't see an icon that says news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I found it.  Icons.  Stupid things.  Icons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You may have to update apps as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I think you get that.  I don't know.  Actually, I don't know.  I haven't done it yet.  Tell us what you think.  A first look at the new news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple News.  Waiting for it to do anything.  There you go.  I'm going to go to the news.  Round and round and round and round.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is my comment on the Facebook eight seconds thing as well.  They say when you click a link in Facebook, it takes eight seconds to launch the web.  It's like, well, when I click a link to Facebook from the web, it takes eight seconds to launch Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The next hour there, Kevin, you're not launching anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're building your news sources now, Jeff.  This is a one time only.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I've heard that story.  I guess newsstand, I'm being told by the Charm, is still there as a folder.  The magazines it used to be in your newsstand will be in there as standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You see, you put it in that folder, you put things like our uninstall folder somewhere you've hidden on the...  The junk folder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Every iPhone has it.  I don't use Apple weather, Apple stocks, Apple tips.  But you can't delete them.  Google has invested in Oscar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's only in New Jersey and New York, and it's a new insurance company.  I'm just going to remember now.  I think they were an advertiser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Didn't Oscar advertise with us?  I think they did.  Yeah.  So they are kind of a high tech health insurance company.  This is one where I was reluctant to take them as an advertiser because it is only New York and New Jersey.  But I thought what they were doing was so cool.  It really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It starts with technology.  Tell us your symptoms to get started.  You can shop for a doctor, pick one you like.  Exactly.  Just click to talk with a doctor right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really liked this idea.  They said we're going to be going into other states too.  So I thought, well, let's do the ads.  I mean, talk about US only ads.  This was in New Jersey only.  But that's another case where sometimes an advertiser will just...  I want to do their ads because I think what they're doing is really interesting.  Interesting.  Now I think that's validated by Google, which has put $32.5 million in Oscar.  They're now valued...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With misfit.  And when you hit your daily goal, you've got to buck off up to $240 a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nice.  Isn't that good?  So it kind of incents you to take care of yourself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're $1.75 billion valuation.  So they're a unicorn.  And they want to make the health insurance business work more like an internet service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's not available in my area.  Yeah, that's kind of part of the problem.  I'm in New Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, don't know.  Don't know.  They're focused on individuals, not groups.  Anyway, I really like them.  Anyway, good on them.  Google's really gotten involved in the medical area, hasn't it?  Those contact lenses for diabetics that detect...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the other fascinating story is they hired the top mental health official in the US.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A mental health moonshot.  Boy, I'm behind this.  Dr. Tom Insell, director of the National Institute of Mental Health, for the last 13 years, he's joining Life Sciences.  And Life Sciences, that's the two-year-old research division that, among others, was spun out when Google became Alphabet.  And they're working on mental health.  Here's his statement on the NIM website.  I'm so thrilled to see this.  This is great.  Yeah.  Mental health treatment in the United States is barely medieval.  Amen, brother.  As some of you know, as I know firsthand.  And it's not about better drugs.  It's just about destigmatizing it, doing the research, doing the hard work.  But I'm glad Google's putting some money behind it.  That's great.  Really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  I'm picking sources now.  Oh, good.  What are your choices?  Get news in your inbox.  No, no, no, no, no.  Don't do that to me.  Oh, I just...  They were there.  The New York Times, The Guardian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How about tech sources?  Were there like tech blogs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Recode.  Yeah, it's going to be all the big names.  So then, all right.  So the first one.  Oh, you see this is not...  It looks like Kanye West watched a lot of Star Wars while designing his latest collection.  OK, that's one I don't want.  No, Apple.  No, Apple.  That's your first story you give me.  Don't want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you minus that?  Can you use the new Facebook dislike button?  Which way do I go?  Left or right?  Oh, I thought that would set him off.  I was hoping that would set him off.  Can you use the new Facebook dislike button?  There is no dislike button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My colleagues in this business got it wrong.  You're wrong.  Just listen to Zuckerberg.  He said dislike, but he said it wasn't a vote down button.  It's an empathy button.  An empathy button.  I'm not going to like the fact that your mother died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to give you empathy for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we were getting all excited in the news business because the idea was kind of like  Reddit style up voting and down voting, right?  Wouldn't that be cool?  And I'm sure Facebook would like to do that, right?  No, they don't want to do that.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because Zuckerberg said in his town hall, that's not the kind of community we want to  build.  You shared something.  You put yourself out.  You showed something in the world that everybody comes along and says, hmm.  Well, that's true.  I guess.  Nobody in the world wants that.  We don't need more of that in the world.  I agree with Zuckerberg on this.  There's plenty of that.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But we have that on Google Plus.  Oh, no, there's no minus one, is there?  It's only plus one on Google Plus.  But what the problem is, you just post, oh, Jess, I'm really devastated.  My mom just died.  And then what am I supposed to do?  Like it?  Yeah.  So empathy would be like, what's it going to be like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to be like a little Zuckerberg.  So I learned this, of course, just now.  And Mark Zuckerberg invited Ahmed to Facebook.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's the poor Ahmed is never going to get to go to school anymore.  He's going to the White House.  He's going to Facebook.  He busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  MIT invited him.  MIT invited him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's going to have to do the Ahmed Ahmed World Tour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, he said, can you can you come over here and tell us why WatchOS 2 wasn't released?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a press conference while we've been on the air that I just saw the lower third said that he might consider transferring schools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I would at this point.  I don't think you'd want to walk that walk of shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't care.  What's so special about the Apple News?  So much a bunch of stories, most of which aren't relevant to me from sources I already have with no no ads.  Oh, I know.  Wait.  OK, fine.  Big deal.  And no way to say, no, I really don't like that.  You're wrong.  Because the app, because that's the Apple attitude.  No, you're wrong about us being wrong.  So you can't downvote that, Kanye?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's the first thing.  That's the first thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know I'm shrieking right now.  The New Yorker Zuckerberg.  How about an oof button?  Oof?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or what would be a good Yiddish?  Oi.  Oi would be good.  I'd like an oi button.  Oi.  That says a lot.  We need we need meh.  And if you hold it down, it tends to do oi gavalt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it's like it gets bigger.  So the thing that's the interesting sort of variant on this is the thing that Slack did  with the emoji.  I don't know how much you guys use Slack.  You've seen this.  They invented reaction emoji.  So when someone posts something, you can react by posting an emoji and other people can click  on that to increment that emoji.  Oh, wow.  So the reaction goes up?  So the count goes up for the number of people who've clicked that one.  So you can you can use it to put two alternatives in as, you know, do you want, you know,  a burger or a burger or fried egg and put the emoji in like that.  But you can anyone can react with an emoji and then other people can sort of pile on  that emoji.  So it was their way of saying, OK, I suspect it was their way of getting around the whole  do we do likes with hearts or stars argument by saying, well, why not all possible combinations  of strange characters?  So you can react to things by sending people goats or 100 underlined or whatever other  emoji you like best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, here's the iCloud News publisher at iCloud dot com slash news publisher.  If you're a publisher, can we get on this right away?  You can enter your publisher information and add your RSS feed to Apple News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you have to run it through an Apple shaped validator.  So it's like the podcasting one with some extra nonsense on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We can we can handle that.  Yeah, they did.  They made a totally unique RSS format for iTunes podcasts, which, by the way, we still  adhere to.  And interestingly enough, oh, I can't talk about it.  I'm not disclosed.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't say you're looking for Richard to say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's not even that I'm not disclosed, but the people who are not disclosed mentioned  this to me.  And now I don't want to get them in trouble.  It has to do with Google.  But I'll say later.  I don't know.  Are we is it official yet or not?  I don't know.  Patent for giving up or regaining control of self-driving car.  I think you need a meh button.  Google self-driving car patent reveals how you'll let A.I. take the wheel.  It's called Google chauffeur.  And there's an arm on the steering wheel, kind of like your turn signal that could be  pulled to engage the self-driving mode.  At that point, the system checks to see whether it's ready and able to actually take control  from the driver.  If it can't get, let's say, get a GPS lock or something, the driver could see not available  on the dash.  Otherwise, you'll see a ready light, at which point you could start taking your hands off  the wheel and your feet off the pedals and start texting, apparently, according to this  patent, at 64 miles an hour using an iPhone.  Anyway, just because they have a patent doesn't mean they know how to do it.  If the passenger identifies an emergency situation, the passenger may take control of the vehicle  immediately.  If you see an obstacle, the computer hasn't identified like a bicyclist or road construction.  You don't even disarm the computer.  You just grip the wheel just like cruise control.  This is just like cruise control.  There's no news here.  It's just like cruise control.  And of course, I say about Apple News, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.  Supposedly Android Pay is rolled out.  I'm sure you talked about this yesterday and all about Android.  Have you got it yet, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had to install it.  I had to go out of my way to install the update.  So basically, it's kind of confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry I interrupted your lunch.  It's okay.  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was at the end of the bite.  Android.  So it's called Android Wallet?  Android Pay.  Android Pay.  Yeah, so the old Google Wallet app is magically turning into Android Pay.  Right.  So you pushed out a new Google Wallet app to the Play Store to be your transferring money between people app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it says I have Google Wallet installed, as I would expect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It also relies on a current version of Play Services, which might not be updated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It says this app will update to Android Pay soon.  Yeah.  So I guess, you know, is it a staged rollout?  You got it?  Look at that.  Look at that.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There we go.  Now, did you get it automatically?  Yeah, I didn't do anything.  Okay.  Let me look at mine.  I had to install it manually in order to get it.  I haven't really played around with it very much yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you install it with a sideload?  Yeah.  Oh, well, that's not how you're supposed to do it.  Coming soon, Android Pay and a new Google Wallet in the next few weeks.  So Android and Google Wallet will turn into two simpler apps.  It's the first time I've ever heard,  Wallet's most popular features will move to two simpler apps.  Okay.  I don't know what's simpler about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you guys either really use NFC Paying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I used it for the, well, I've used it on the watch just because I wanted to play with the watch.  Yeah, I know, playing with it, but do you really use it?  I used it yesterday at the, or Sunday at the, Monday at the ball game.  Oh.  But it's kind of just like, you know, it's not that, it's not.  I use it occasionally, but the thing is.  Occasionally.  It's not that much easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the thing is, since they launched that, it's gotten more annoying because there are people who are turning it off selectively.  Before you would see a little sign and say, okay, I can use this and they'd tell them to be surprised it would work.  Whereas now they have the terminal that says you can use it and then you can't because they're like, oh, no, this is CVS.  You can't actually use it.  And I did use it the other day because I'd accidentally left my wallet at home.  It's handy for that.  It's handy for that.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's not.  It's not, it's sufficiently quicker is the thing.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so I use it at the ballpark.  I tap it.  The guy says, no, wait a minute.  And then the thing says, wait a minute.  Then he says, okay, now do it.  And I did it.  And then I still have to sign something, which is.  Oh, no, you're kidding me.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You still have to go through the flow, basically.  So it's really no different than if I'd taken a credit card out and swiped it.  I mean, I do use the Starbucks thing every day.  Yeah.  But you have a special card for that, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if it's under the thing where the credit card don't have to sign, then it is a bit quicker.  But if it's over, then you've still got to sign something.  Yeah, this was a.  And you also confuse the checkout person as well.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He says, what does it say on your screen?  It says, don't.  It says, stop.  Okay.  Russia says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, like I'm going to trust Russia.  Russia, they did.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To their credit, they got we did this fast.  Everybody else is still thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yes, this is what happens when you have a dictatorship.  You go.  Yeah.  You can cut through a little bureaucracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google found guilty of abusing dominant market position in Russia, Russian antitrust agency.  It's funny they have an antitrust agency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You are not owned by us.  You are antitrust.  What does it even mean to be antitrust in a socialist republic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Russians antitrust agency will have 10 business days to issue its ruling on the case in full.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They opened the probe in February.  So seven months later, that's not too bad.  Company was not found guilty of unfair competition.  But they were found guilty of abusing their dominant market position.  The course, the action was prompted by Russians.  The Russia's search engine Yandex.  They complained.  Yandex said, quote, We welcome the positive decision by FAS, which is figured out is complicated by the Russian antitrust agency.  They complained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yandex said, quote, We welcome the positive decision by FAS, which is figured out is complicated case.  And having studied the proof has confirmed Google's violations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think this has any potential influence over what the EU is also like just from a well, it was well, they won't be alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They won't be right.  I have to worry about being the only one.  Right.  But I don't I can't imagine.  I care.  We're down to the seas and the stems almost done here.  Google says it's not going to make cars.  It's going to license them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which does go to the European point, though, because because as media went bad on on Google in Europe, the auto industry was ready to go next.  Yeah.  They were they were scared.  They're very scared of Google.  And so Google coming out and saying in Frankfurt speculation at the Frankfurt Auto Show in Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We want to work with you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is you we do not intend to become a car manufacturer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is coming from Philip Justice, a Google representative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yet they just hired the former president of Hyundai US.  Wow.  For Google Auto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that makes sense, because you're going to deal with automakers.  You would like to have somebody inside who is an automaker to talk the talk.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a respected guy.  And it shows they're serious.  It shows they're very, very serious.  Have you turned on your on hub?  Jake did today.  Yes.  And he said that the speed is about the same.  It'll across the how the only thing it'll prove is that closet behind me over there.  Yes, that's not my dog.  It says that closet appointed right now that has the router in it.  Put your router in a closet.  Well, you know, you're supposed to put it right in the middle of the living room.  But that's where the wire is.  And so the problem is that it would improve the speed, he said in this room.  But I'm the only one who gets benefit of it.  Right.  And so I don't know if you bought two of them.  Would that be OK?  Do I want to spend 400 bucks right now?  I don't know.  By the way, this just in Ahmed has been invited to two of the most expensive cars in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ahmed has been invited to Twitter.  Should I invite him?  Let me just tweet.  Ahmed, you got a job here.  You could build clocks for us because we're never on time.  You're never on time.  You can use your clock.  That would be your clocks.  That'd be a good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That'd be a good tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Let's see what we're making something back.  They come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That'd be funny.  Hey, for all I know, he's a big fan.  I don't know.  You know, he's a geek.  You know.  So there is a tear down and I fix it of the on hub router.  Yeah.  Speakers bigger than it needs to be.  It only is used once to pair to the phone, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought we had said that there was only a small speaker, but no, it's a pretty pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not as big as the Sonos, but it's pretty hefty.  That's weird.  It's not an echo.  The odd little plug in the speaker grill is an ambient light sensor, which Google says doesn't work yet.  In fact, there's a lot of stuff in this which doesn't work yet, including Zigbee transmit, you know, radios and thread radios.  There's a Bluetooth radio doesn't work yet.  It's all sorts of stuff.  So if you I don't know if you if you care, I canceled my order and just got a kind of more common ASUS router, which I've been very happy with.  Let's see what else.  I got a fix for the final stage fright flaw on my AT&T Note 5 and on my Nexus 7 tablet.  Have you gotten a fix yet, Jason?  This phone has not gotten a fix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got a security update on my Nexus 5.  My Nexus 6 too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the first monthly security update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, this is going to be a regular thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, because I got all these updates.  Now it's like, am I getting six?  I didn't think I was getting six yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then you're getting your monthly update to get used to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It didn't even change the number.  It was still five one one.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. But look at the bill.  That's where they change the little subtle numbers down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't I actually want a release note for that because that process is very slow.  It's like, OK, I'm going to sit here and like patch 200.  What am I doing?  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. If you've got a lot of apps installed, it takes a while.  It takes a good 20 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lately, that's what everybody, Apple, Microsoft, they're all just cagey about what's going on.  So this is the Moto X Pure.  It has not been updated yet.  And by the way, the stage fright detector to get is the Zimperium one.  They're the ones who discovered the flaw.  Z-I-M-P-E-R-I-U-M.  And you see, it's this one little red one there.  It's the last one to get fixed, but it has been fixed now on Nexus devices.  It's been fixed on the Note, oddly enough.  Samsung fixed it, but not yet on the Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, I've I haven't seen tweets.  I haven't verified what's going on, but apparently the new Moto phones.  Yeah.  Unlocked, you know, by yourself.  People aren't being able to put them on Verizon.  Oh, no. Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  I don't I haven't verified. I don't know what's going on, but I got some tweets.

Transcript:  Somebody else write this story, which is a glasswork.  But the Post had an amazing story this week on the disappearing  American love for the pawpaw fruit.  And that's the kind of story that doesn't get rewritten everywhere.  It was a great story.  You know, you know, you know, but the pop I never even heard of the pop.  It's all been around.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.  Oh, I love FreshBooks.  It saved my life when I was a freelancer.  If you're a freelancer or a small business, and you know how painful it is the end of the month when you've got to send out the invoices.  Well, let me ask you a question.  Which of the following tasks represent your favorite part of being a freelancer?  A, formatting and sending invoices.  B, collecting your receipts and tracking your expenses.  C, following up with clients who don't pay you on time.  D, none of the above at all.  Anytime, ever in a million years.  That's probably the answer you give.  Certainly the answer I give.  FreshBooks changes all that.  It makes it easy and fast to send out invoices.  Invoices that get paid faster because there's a pay button right on the invoice and your clients don't like paying any more than you like.  You know, I mean, it's a pain for them to sit down and write all those checks.  Make it easy for them.  You get paid on average five days faster.  And if clients don't pay you on time, FreshBooks automatically will send out emails reminding them in a nice, subtle, but effective way.  Even if you're not a numbers person, you'll love, especially if you're not a numbers person, I'm not.  You'll love FreshBooks.  You'll be creating and sending invoices in seconds, watching expenses organize themselves.  In fact, the FreshBooks app lets you take pictures of receipts, add them right into the invoice.  Oh, man, I wish they'd had that when I was billing Rogers.  I used FreshBooks, but this is something more recent.  It's really great.  But they always had a great team of support folks at the FreshBooks headquarters.  They still do award winning support rock stars waiting to go above and beyond whenever you need a hand.  There they are.  Aren't they cute?  FreshBooks.com saved my life.  And they got me paid a lot faster.  They could do the same for you.  Try it free for 30 days.  Go to FreshBooks.com slash twig.  And when they ask you, how did you hear about us?  Don't forget to say twig twig this week in Google.  That's where FreshBooks.com slash twig.  Real quick note.  You know, there are fires going on up up north of us in Lake County.  One of the places that burned to the ground is a little museum of telephony.  The J.K.L. Museum of Telephony lost to fire on September 10th in Mountain Ranch, California,  was just kind of a labor of love.  Oh, that's sad.  Isn't that John K. LaRue, whose initials just happened to be the number five on most telephone dials, J.K.L.?  They had telephones and related equipment from all over the world going from the 1880s to present day.  They were working on getting many of these working.  Look at the Pac Bell exhibit and these ancient phones.  And oh, it makes me sad.  All lost, lost to fire.  But they want to rebuild it.  And I'm really thrilled.  And they say we don't know how.  But I think if you visit the site, J.K.L. Museum dot com, and you can you can just give them some love and support anyway.  And they still have a huge website with photo galleries of all sorts of stuff.  So big that you could help them get it to load faster.  They probably appreciate that.  Look at those.  Remember those, Jeff?  Yep. Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  None of you kids remember those.  We used to have to dial our finger.  Dial.  Wait for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You never wanted a number with a zero in it because it's like 30 seconds.  It felt like all the way around.  Wrong number was painful.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you should try texting with these phones.  It's murder.  So I just thought it passed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason, Jason, are you young enough?  You never saw a dial phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, not true.  I used to have one.  Absolutely.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My kids, though, and I'm sure Jake in their 20s, I don't think they've.  Oh, no.  But they still talk about dialing a phone, I think.  And hanging it up, which is ridiculous.  Hanging it up.  There's nothing to hang up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With one of those, if you hung it up really hard, you'd hear the ring.  That was like the satisfying.  That's right.  Ding.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm having to slam this phone down.  You get a little ring out of it.  Kevin, I think you might be muted, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, there was a plane going over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is so sad.  This really looks like a neat museum.  Of course, lots of people losing their homes in those fires.  We have some stuff we'd probably be willing to donate.  Jammer B donated this to us back in the early days of the Twit Cottage.  Hello, hello, central.  Hello, central.  That is classic.  Where did you get that, John?  And then this one we found somewhere like in an antique store around here.  This one hangs on the wall.  This is your kitchen phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Man, I bet this is Western Electric before they invented Bakelite.  That's solid metal.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mr. Kevin Marks, you got a tip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wanted to do a few things.  One of Jeff's numbers was the Google logo in 305 bytes.  I thought you'd like that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a really interesting one.  We haven't really talked about that yet.  The original Google logo was how big?  14K?  Right.  The image.  And the new one?  Yes.  305 bytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so the thing is, the point is that you, and it's easy to draw an SVG.  So I got the G down to tweet length just by playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Serifs are hard.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Serifs are hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, actually, they're not that hard because you actually do have cap.  So there's, I just put the SVG for the G into the chat.  So serifs are a little harder, but it's more that the ablate shapes, you need to use  Bezier curves and that takes a bit more stuff.  But you can still do a pretty good vector version of it.  It's just not terrible.  And someone else did a full version of the Google logo as an SVG that was fairly small.  So this guy that does it here, he's doing it wrong.  He's basically saying, oh, I can construct it out of chopping slices out of a circle,  which you can, but actually SVG has a path operator, which is so in my one says,  go to the middle, draw a horizontal line, draw three quarters of a circle.  That's the G and drill two, two more circles.  You know, so basically you can do it in a bunch of paths.  So the.  So you can actually got a graphics language that can draw straight lines and curves  and complicated curves to the SVG.  So part of this for me is like the thing that's exciting about this, because there's,  you know, I don't want to go around the Google logo nonsense again, but the  SVG is actually really interesting.  SVG is a vector format for images, which we've had vector formats for images for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you've used Illustrator freehand, that's a vector drawing program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or if you've used like picked on the Mac, you know, I'm talking a really long time.  Yeah, that's right.  Quick draw.  Mac pick.  Yeah.  So.  Mac draw rather than Mac paint.  Mac draw.  Going back to the Mac draw was the file format.  PIX was a file format for Mac draw.  So Mac paint was a bitmap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You draw dot dot dot.  But Mac draw, you draw circles.  Yes.  And it's easy to represent those because those are mathematical formulae.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So SVG is scalable vector graphics.  It's a part of the web standard.  It's a series of web standards.  It's basically an XML format for drawing vectors.  And it's really nice because you can draw vectors that are very small.  And the other thing that's really nice about it is now that we've got all these very high DPI screens,  you don't have to store a giant bitmap to show something that's crisp.  You can just draw a curve.  And so the Google logo thing was a bit weird to me because they were saying, oh, the serifs, they take up too much space.  It's like, those are just curves too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we can make it look better on small screens.  It's like, no, they're just drawn this way to be fashionable.  And yes, you can make it very small SVG, which is kind of cute.  But you could you could make the original Google logo fairly small in SVG as well because you're just drawing swirly shapes.  So and they will still look crisp at any size.  And if you've got a, you know, a 4x like 400 and something DPI screen like this, they'll look lovely on here as well.  And you won't have to store a series of bitmaps.  And one of the things that's annoying about this is that lots of lots of the operating systems and websites that we use all the time are behind in the support of SVG.  So with the building iOS apps, they insist on you making bitmaps for them for lots of things.  You have to have a bitmap for the splash screen and you have to make one at different sizes, all the different iOS devices and so on.  You can't upload an SVG to Twitter or Facebook or Pinterest or Google Plus even.  So this is frustrating.  So what I did as a kind of as a sort of tongue in cheek joke, I did SVG.  You are dot com, which is like Imager, but for SVGs.  But because the point of it is, is like you should be able to hand these things around.  They take almost no storage.  You can actually sort of paste them into tweets and still have something useful.  So this was a little, you know, prank thing that I did, a semi joke thing I did a while ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is this site? SVger? Is like Imager for SVG?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Imager for SVG. So this is a site that I hacked together a while ago because I wanted to pass SVGs around.  And you'll notice that most of them are like me playing around with Google logos and other little bits and pieces, Indie Web logos.  But the interesting thing is that they are really small and compact and it's a very useful way to represent things.  So if you're doing web design, you should be using SVGs.  Oh, and they can animate too. You can see the rotating surface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And all browsers render them properly and everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Most browsers render them properly.  I mean, it's now at the point where all the browsers you care about render them properly unless you're really unfortunate and you have colleagues who are running IE8 or something.  But they are, you know, they passed over the install base of Flash about three years ago.  And if you look at caniuse.com for SVG now, it is like in the 90s of install bases and it's all the mobile ones.  And that's where you really care about this, because the mobile ones is where you tend to have the multiple DPI issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it wouldn't be such a big deal to test the platform if it can't play SVGs to offer something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no. So, I mean, I do a full back thing with this for Twitter and Facebook.  I give them a Twitter card that has a ping in it so they can display something.  But yeah, but the point is that if you're actually designing for the web these days and you're doing things that would represent well as vector graphics, obviously it doesn't work for, you know, sunsets and things.  But if you're doing things that are actually icons and logos and graphs and anything that is composed of lines, you're far better off using SVGs than anything else.  And the other neat trick is that you can inline them into HTML fairly straightforwardly.  I mean, you can inline images into HTML by putting data URLs, but SVG you can just put the SVG inline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which means it's just text. Yeah. And you can animate them too, which is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's, animating them is a little tricksy. There's different ways you can do that.  But yeah, they have an intrinsic animation model. I like that.  There's a little bit less support for that. Then there's, you can also animate them with CS animations in the same way you can animate with CS animations. Sure. Anything. Any image.  So what do you use to create these? You can use Illustrator. You can make them by hand. Or you can, if you want a free thing, there's Inkscape, which is an open source app.  And it runs in X window, so it's a little bit weird, but it's a fairly good SVG editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I want to add this to my 25 line email signature. A little animated SVG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They may not display an email. That's the thing. Because emails use this sort of weird broken old versions of HTML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look, here's the Singapore rail map in SVG. That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was interesting because the problem is there they didn't do the text as text. So each character in there is an individual line, which is not ideal.  So someone was posting this and saying we need to clean this up. We need to fix that one. So where can I see what the code looks like for the...  Well, don't do it on that one. But if you do it on the Google logo there, just do view source. Right click and do view source.  I suspect element maybe.  Where's the code? I don't see it. Oh, it's embedded as an image. So hang on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Never mind. That's all right. I believe you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What does it kind of look like?  It looks like XML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. Wow. Really? Wow. That's really cool.  Svgur. That's a good tool. S-V-G-U-R. You don't mind if people use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't mind if you use it. I mean, don't destroy it. But yeah, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's a fun little article somebody just sent us from 2011.  Turns out in the Steve Jobs biography, when Steve Wozniak was in 12th grade, I remember reading this now, he built a fake bomb.  He took a metronome, realized it sounded the tick, tick, tick, sounded like a bomb.  So he took the label off some big batteries, taped them together with duct tape, put it in the school locker, rigged it to start ticking faster when the locker opened.  That's Woz. Not just happy with the tick, tick, tick.  Later, he got called to the principal's office. He thought it was because he had won, yet again, the school's top math prize.  Instead, he was confronted by police.  The principal had been summoned when the device was found, bravely ran onto the football field, clutching it to his chest, and pulled the wires off.  Woz tried and failed to suppress his laughter. He got sent. He did go to, he went to the juvenile detention center, spent a night there.  But of course, what did Steve Wozniak do in juvenile detention center?  He taught the other inmates how to disconnect wires from the lamps, attach them to the bars, so people got shocked when they touched them.  Now that I don't know what that means, but Ahmed Ahmed, you are not alone.  But he was trying to make a fake bomb. Ahmed was just making a clock.  Jeff Jarvis, your number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we have a business insider.  Jonah Peretti, founder of BuzzFeed, has some surprising numbers on the traffic that BuzzFeed gets from various sources.  Now keep in mind that traffic to BuzzFeed's site isn't always the point of BuzzFeed.  BuzzFeed is really good at putting stuff everywhere. BuzzFeed is built for this distributed world we discussed earlier.  Nonetheless- Interesting, but how do they make money if they do that?  Because they're basically what they do is they sell their skill to advertisers that we can make your stuff viral too.  Oh, okay. So it's not about the ads on BuzzFeed.  No, it's when they make stuff, it's they want people to share it and it's through that sharing that they create their value.  So they're built for a new world.  So 21% of its traffic comes from Snapchat content views.  What?  21% joined Snapchat's Discover in late July.  It's already that big.  The other numbers that it said here, 23% direct to the site or apps, 14% YouTube views, 2% Google search to the site.  What are you really searching for, BuzzFeed besides cute cats?  Right.  6% Facebook traffic to the site.  But again, keep in mind that's not necessarily the goal.  27% Facebook native video, which is huge for them.  Wow.  24% images on Facebook and 21% Snapchat content views.  I don't know if that adds up to 100% or not, but I found that really interesting.  And the thing that fast feeds about Snapchat is that any I know lots of really, really savvy social media people.  I mean, we're on a degree in social journalism.  I know lots of them.  Anybody over the age of about 25 is like a 60 year old and says, what is this?  What do you kids love this?  I don't get it.  I can't figure it out.  It's phenomenal how there's an age barrier there.  And Snapchat's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You may say they don't make any money on ads, but the very first thing is a Pizza Hut ad.  Oh, and by the way, one of the things about Snapchat, it's not an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it is, but it's a it's got other pizzas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I never use these emojis, so I'm just going to try them out here.  Newborn puppies ready to take on the world.  I think Discover makes sense for quick hits.  So like I always thought ESPN sports highlights and discover, which is one of the things makes a lot of sense.  That's I think that's an anti smoking ad.  Maybe not.  No labeling, no.  No, I guess not.  Yeah, it's definitely it's definitely anti smoking.  Oh, yeah. See, truth.  That is an ad.  That's a paid ad.  Conquering Home Luck or maybe that's not paid.  I don't know.  I don't know what that is.  Face aerobics.  Now, if you slide up, you get more.  Someday you get the rest of it.  So these are these are little snippets from the bigger viral video or whatever that there.  Where will I meet my true love?  It's horoscope.  Photo that will give you major bold lipstick goals.  Not me.  These are girls not to kiss.  Go ahead. Let's try it.  No, these are these are the girls you don't want to kiss.  You get all over you.  And back to smoking.  Oh, it says add.  There is a little tiny almost invisible ad.  You can't see it, but I can see it right at the lower right there.  Oh, man, I guess teenagers like this.  Those kids.  Kids love this stuff.  Ramen, mozzarella, steak, was feed gigantic by gigantic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right, though.  I think anybody over 25 goes, I mean, I know all about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not just it's not just not liking it.  It's saying, I don't get it.  It's a confessional moment.  Well, I get it.  But these folks is is I can't figure out what to do with it.  I can't figure out, you know, bring my company to it.  I don't know what to do.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is just this is waiting in line entertainment.  That's all this is.  And this I don't what I don't like about snap feed.  I'm trying to get back. Here we go.  Snapchat is grandpa.  What I don't like about the snap feed is that everything disappears.  I know that's what the kids like, but I don't want to spend any time making content.  There's a new feature which I can't get to work on Android, but it works on the iPhone.  If you're going to take a selfie and you hold your you press and hold your head,  it will start doing weird animated stuff to your head.  Yes.  Have you tried that?  I have seen examples of that.  I can't get to work on Android.  It says only newer Android phones as new as you can get, but it doesn't work.  Well done.  BuzzFeed. You figured you've cracked the Internet.  It's Snapchat.  Yep.  You know, Yahoo pulled it off.  Remember Yahoo had a Katie Couric news update.  Yeah, I don't know why.  Maybe they weren't getting 21 percent.  Content views from it.  I wonder if that if the content view is when I see does that count when I slide up?  Is that a content view?  That's a good question, too.  Content view.  I can't because Snapchat doesn't really give you a way to link to a website, right?  No.  No.  So they must say what are they?  In fact, what are they saying?  What is that in that page?  Is that what you're looking at?  Yeah, this is so this is discover on Snapchat.  These are brands, Tastemade, IGN, Mashable, iHeartRadio, CNN.  So you go to the brand and they make Snapchat specific content.  So in the case of news, it's just and this just keeps repeating.  Boy, this is boy.  This is news, isn't it?  This is hardcore news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's it.  This is an ad for the news.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then you swipe it and you get something else.  Now see, this now becomes more content because I swipe it up and there's an actual story.  I bet you that's what BuzzFeed counts as a driving traffic.  It's a reference, right?  Because there's nothing else you can count.  Yeah, it's aimed at the under 20 set.  That's for sure.  That's for dang sure.  Tura Tunde uses it.  Makes a snap a Tunde every day.  He's making snap a Tunde.  I got a number for you.  You want to know my number?  Yeah.  Can you get a wide shot?  This is my number.  5.4 pounds.  That was this Sunday's New York Times.  5.4 pounds.  That's not a record, I'm sure.  Oh, not from the old days, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's the people suddenly it's the first time that you had any heft.  Look at the size of this thing.  It's all the arts and leisure preview stuff.  High level advertising.  But you can't tell me they're not making money on the print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On that, they're making money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On that issue, they made money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  5.4 pounds.  So I'll give you a quick summary on the Moto X Pure.  First of all, I love Moto Maker.  That's the feature that Moto Roller gives you to build your own.  Many, many different possibilities.  Plastic, wood and leather backs.  I got the nice ebony back, which I think is quite pretty.  I had bamboo one year.  I had leather another year.  And this champagne color.  So you can control a lot of this.  You can even get your name on it.  Although it's not engraved, it's just kind of cheaply printed on there.  The first Moto X back in 2013 was really the phone of the year for me.  I was really impressed with what it could do.  And each year they've come out with some new features.  This is 5.7 inches, very high res.  It has UHD, or not UHD, quad HD screen.  It's snappy.  They only put 3 gigs of RAM in it.  It's not a beast because it's cheap.  It's about 400 bucks, depending on how much storage you have.  You can either get 32 or 64 gigs of, or maybe 16, 32.  No, I'll have to look it up.  I got the 64 gigs.  And I didn't really need to because the other thing that's cool about this  is you can put an SD card in it.  And this goes up to 128 gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it have any problem with moving stuff back and forth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a lot easier, much easier now on Lollipop than it was before.  But generally you keep the apps on the internal storage.  And the external storage is for pictures, music, movies.  I have all my audio books on here and stuff like that.  It's very snappy.  This is only a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808.  It's not the latest, greatest.  But that is probably not a bad thing.  I don't think you need all that horsepower in the Note 5 and other devices.  It's got the great Motorola stuff.  So they've always been really good about this.  It is an LCD screen, not an OLED.  So when you hover your hand over it, it gives you the time and notifications.  But because it's an LCD, it has to turn on the whole screen,  which the old OLEDs did not have to do.  It also has the gestures.  You know, you do this to take a picture, and it pretty quickly goes into the...  It's hard to do it over my shoulder camera.  Never mind.  It never does that.  Chop to turn on the flashlight.  There you go. That one worked.  There's also a way to get it to do a kind of a personal...  Stop it. Thank you.  A personal Google Now interaction by just lifting it to your ear.  But you have to do this kind of thing,  and I've never been able to get it to work quite right.  There's some negatives, though.  There's no fingerprint reader.  There's no OIS.  20-megapixel camera.  21-megapixel camera means it's got great images.  I'm going to do a full review on this,  but I have to say battery life is a little disappointing once again.  It's maybe eight or nine hours for me, which is not long enough.  I wish it had a fingerprint reader.  It needs OIS.  The 21-megapixel camera is pretty good.  I'll show you real quickly some photos from Google that I've taken.  It does well in broad daylight.  But the neat thing about 21-megapixels is you can do digital zoom.  This is actually zoomed in, but you get pretty good resolution.  You can also control the exposure with a slider.  So you see I dimmed it down until we could actually see the sunset.  I took these of a tire swing, so that's not very interesting.  It has a selfie flash, a front-facing flash.  It does great in broad daylight.  Here's some other zoom shots.  Let me show you real quickly an example.  Sorry about all these.  These are all panorama, you know.  I don't know why.  Okay, so this is heavily zoomed.  I'll show you the original shot is here.  I zoomed in with digital zoom.  And because you have so many megapixels, this I find interesting,  you really can take advantage of the extra megapixels by getting a very high-quality...  You know, there's not a lot of artifacting in here.  High-quality shot, even zoomed in.  So that's kind of nice.  So it's a good camera in daylight, not so great in low light, especially without OIS.  But I have to say it's a nice camera.  I mean, a nice phone.  I just don't think it's really up there with the top-of-the-line phones  unless you really want a wooden or leatherback.  I'm not crazy about...  I feel like this would have been a great phone last year.  And gosh darn it, they've got to get the battery life better.  You weren't considering this, were you, Jeff?  This wasn't one of the phones you were thinking about.  Nope.  You are waiting to hear what happens September 29th though, the Nexus 5, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yes, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we will cover that live.  I understand it's going to be a streamed event, and we will be covering the live stream.  Early in the morning, 10 a.m. for you, Jeff, 7 a.m. out here on the West Coast.  Where is it going to be?  Tuesday the 29th.  I think it's in San Francisco. Do you know?  Oh.  We don't know specific details yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Haven't been invited yet.  Yeah, there hasn't been a formal announcement of any sort.  But yeah, the rumor is San Francisco somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it's in New York, let me know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we will. I don't think it is because it's 7 a.m.  Oh, I guess it could be. Yeah, 10 a.m.  You know what? I bet it is in New York. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying. So if it is, I'll get an invite and I'll go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is at City University of New York.  Mark Cuney also blogs at BuzzMachine.com, joins us every Wednesday for this fabulous show.  Will you be here next week?  Yes, I will.  Nice.  For sure.  Kevin Marks, always great to have you. Thank you for being here and explaining.  I've got one more little link for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  This is IndieNews, news.indiewebcount.com.  Ah.  Which we had it for a while, but it was quite hard to submit.  It's just got easier to submit to.  So you just have to link to it now and then send a web mention.
