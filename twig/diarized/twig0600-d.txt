Yeah, it was really fun  We got to do that again as soon as we can conviviate then of course, yes, and COVID hit and now we don't see anybody anymore  So just to recap  the long  Taudry story of Australia and the Internet  So Rupert Murdoch who was of course Australian and you know kind of coincidentally is also 600. He is the  Well, he's pretty he's pretty old  Close very close Methuselah Methuselah of journalism Rupert Methuselah. Did he started it was his first newspaper Australian  I know he is Australia. Oh, yeah. Oh, yes. Yes. He inherited from his father  Okay from Kenan Murdoch and then he bought like the Sun in Britain he brought some

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Eventually eventually he ended up in a battle with Rupert with Robert Maxwell and won that to get the Sun  But no, he built his empire first in Australia. And of course now the Wall Street Journal Fox  He is your post

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Times of London the Sun a media baron and apparently has quite a bit of clout and loss in  Australia because he yeah, he convinced the  Australian Parliament to consider a bill which was likely by the way to be voted on this week and pass  That would essentially establish a link tax to companies like Google and Facebook who publish news snippets  they  Would not the the value they sent to  newspapers and magazines would not be  Compensated in any way it merely the fact that they're using the content some a small amount of that content  In their search results or in their links that the Parliament said well, there's going to say you've got to pay for that  Google was the first to capitulate first threatening. We're gonna we're gonna retract search. We're gonna if this passes, we're gonna leave Australia  Apparently they that really didn't either didn't work or they didn't they lost their nerve because shortly thereafter they made a deal  For paying some unnamed sum to Murdoch and other publishers  Thought to be at a fairly hefty amount of money

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tens of millions of dollars to the Benjamin's tens not hundreds but tens. All right. Well, but  Two platforms times tens times five years or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it was one of those deals where there's a face-saving going on as well because well, we're gonna work together  We're gonna create stuff. It's gonna be a joint venture that kind of thing instead of just here go away take some money  Which is what it really probably is  Facebook however  Actually did what Google's threatened to do they took they withdrew news from the Facebook  news feed in Australia  That was a cup only a couple of weeks ago  A lot of upset  Last week was a lot of upset in Australia over that because some government sites also lost their pages  Brianna Wu was telling us law

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interpreted news broadly so Facebook chose whether petulantly or not to use that interpretation of news in in fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But then put Australian health back up health authorities for among others were pulled down and apparently when shutting down  Stuff in Australia, they accidentally shut down US versions of that as well. It was you know, it was kind of messy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well all of a sudden

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Facebook is following Google's path. They did a deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff I'm sure you're covering this. So what was the deal? So the change? Yeah, I think this is this is all this is all kabuki  the but they got they want to change in the law and  so the law now has an escape hatch if the minister of  Murdoch  decides that  He's actually been called that the media if the minister Murdoch decides that the  Only two platforms Twitter for some reason didn't ever get in this  It was only Facebook and Google as the major big bad platforms if they were in good faith  Negotiating with lots of news companies then they wouldn't be subject to the law  So the problem here is that is when you call it a link tax?  No, they weren't paying one for one for the links. That's ten cents. That's ten cents  No, they weren't doing that but the issue was if you link you pay  So that's why Facebook said then fine. We don't link and Australia said you're threatening us and Facebook said nah  so now basically there's more time to negotiate and  Facebook started doing some deals and if they're seen to be  Sucking up to the publishers efficiently then then the law though passed  Doesn't come into effect for them including other difficult  Clauses like one is that the law would have them notify the publishers and only publishers of algorithmic changes in advance  like every two seconds  The law would require them to cover news  Facebook maintains its right it says to say no we'll do this again if we don't if  You know you can force us to try to negotiate  but if we don't come to a negotiation deal, then we'll we'll leave again and  The law also called for arbitration and Facebook just goshed  I don't know why didn't trust the arbitrators to be assigned to this case  Is that a clear explanation has the law passed now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's about to it's about to this week they expect  So Facebook what's fascinating?  Capitulated essentially they did they do roughly the same thing less than Google did but yes, they made a deal  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and  And you know I wrote a piece. I've had a long long long relationship with the Guardian  I love the Guardian, but I wrote a piece that I tried to present to the Guardian  They ignored me, but I put in crikey how disappointed I was that the Guardian allied themselves with the devil Murdoch  the when the Guardian went in Australia a rich guy said we need you here because we have Murdoch and  One other company that's even worse than him  And so you're supposed to be the opposition to Murdoch, and then they ended up  Doing the deal with Murdoch which I found very disappointing, but they got money to crikey didn't back the legislation  But still got Google money  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There might be a consequence to making this deal for both Facebook and Google because  Canada says it wants to do the same thing the EU says it wants to do the same thing  They may be making deals globally this may end up costing them a lot of money and  Microsoft really should just shut the heck up  Oh shut up yeah  Any Haskell of tech companies they've decided aside with the European publishers against their arch rivals Facebook and Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mrs.. Cleaver I noticed that Wally  Is not willing to pay the publishers I would be happy to Mrs. Cleaver

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nothing I know but they sucked up to the EU so  Do you think strategically this was a bad move on the part of Facebook and Google it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think I had any choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I said last week that this is the process you threaten you threaten you end up negotiating  And you come to some sort of agreement that is tenable to both sides here's an interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I was gonna ask isn't this more of a win-win for both parties here  No, so lose for everybody except Murdoch, but I see only one who wins because now the platform is gonna have this happening all around  the world  There is a precedent now for a link tax  Publishers sidled up next to Murdoch and got some on them  I think it's a lose that's what I've been saying I was on the ABC again saying it's a loss for the Australian  Broadcasting company not the Americans version yeah, they're there. I shocked them with my American bluntness  I thought Australians were blunt, but evidently I'm blunter

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's just let's just watch a little bit of it. We'll call that New Jersey right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will be restoring news to its Australian

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is he what is he what is he sitting in front of it's like a giant plow what is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's a journalist and analyst so they're not doing that this is a lose

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely everyone except as usual Rupert Murdoch

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Crikey so I'm probably gonna get so here's  A

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  consequence and that I think could come with this is  My friend Aaron Pilhoffer at Temple University tweeted this morning. He said you know  Facebook news tab and Google news showcase were just  Drawers in which money was there to launder it to hand it over to publishers to shut them up for their lobbying  And before all they did was link to the publishers right, but now they're actually licensing full content  They have full news content on Google. They were forced to create a walled garden  So my friend Aaron said, you know, it may not happen, but what if Google said hell we're paying for all this  Why don't we make a really good news site out of all this complete content, which is gonna screw the publishers in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's only gonna be careful what you lobby for people. You also brought up a really interesting point in your tweet storm  Jeff because you pointed out and I had forgotten that Murdoch wanted to be  Facebook he bought my space he created he's done a number of things  He bought Delphi internet  He yeah, I like dark mode Jeff just you know in full disclosure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was the head of content at Delphi internet under Murdoch for one month before I had the sense to get the hell out  I was at it was then I like to I guide  Yeah, that's why I guide was was a waste of  unbelievable millions of dollars with MCI  MCI an old phone company you kids pulled out a week or two before the launch died  They did a big Fox thing. It died. He bought my space for half

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For five hundred eighty million dollars and sold it for thirty five thirty five lost his shirt

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He started the the iPad newspaper the daily you remember that daily. Yeah started a search engine II thing died  He has failed at the internet at every case  So what he's doing now is he's a sniper hiding behind the newspaper press just shooting at the internet  Because he couldn't tame the internet he tried and tried and tried and tried again and failed every time  There's a chart that I put up that's from 2010 those were his failures up to that date there were more since

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's kind of amazing. So this is you know, you say we should investigate Rupert Murdoch  And certainly he's kind of a but not a not a he's kind of a  Baleful influence on the news industry worldwide. That's that's a your master of understatement  he  he  So if this is gonna happen now in Canada and Europe, can we just assume this is gonna be a global phenomenon?  Everybody every government will pile on and say oh, how do we get how do we get some of that?  That you see

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, how we win our beats well  You mean the question is how low does this go right so so crikey said that  90% of the tech money will go to the two biggest companies two or three biggest companies  And by the way that money ain't going to journalism  If it happened in Canada the largest chain there post media  Which I used to be an advisor to is owned by a hedge fund the same hedge fund that owns the National Enquirer  Money ain't going crikey is a person. He's a site

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Slash a you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm like, oh, it's like Australian Oh crikey

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is it's both. Okay, it does  proper noun craig e dot com that a you says  That the deal 90% of the cash goes to News Corp  Seven West Media and nine three companies owned by two folks Rupert Murdoch and Carrie Stokes. Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. So what's gonna happen world around?  Yes, the Guardian supposedly got ten million dollars and the Guardian is the one place that will put it into journalism good for the garden  but the world around  You know this happens in in in in Canada again, it goes to a hedge fund  It goes to the owner of the National Enquirer. Is that really what you want? Wow  and  But you know one thing I've been saying in all my mini media appearances if you want to tax  The platform is more get more money out of them. Okay, you know, that's that's your pass a tax law and do that  But then who is to say that that money should go to entitled old?  Screwing up never figured out the Internet news  But I'd have it go to Internet access or education or health or lots of things

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Crikey points out that half of the money will go to foreign owned media won't even go to an Australian owner. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is a big point that Murdoch had to when he wanted to buy TV stations  He had to become an American citizen and right relinquish his Australian  Citizenship there was there was amazing testimony from Kevin Rudd former PM of Australia  Who together with Malcolm Turnbull former PM of Australia?  Is trying to get the Australian government to start a royal commission on media read Murdoch monopoly and it was amazing  Because because he sat there. This is a former prime minister  He sat there in front of these senators the politicians that he said, let's be honest. We're all scared of Murdoch  I was scared of Murdoch. You're scared of Murdoch. Nobody disagreed with him for a second. We're all scared of Murdoch  That's how this happened and that's what's happening in the UK  Tom Watson who tried to fight Murdoch there is now out of government  In the US, you know, I'm trying to get journalists together to do something about Murdoch, but we're nowhere there though today  There was a hearing in Congress trying to put pressure on  Cable systems to get rid of OANN and and Fox and so on though. I you know as much as I love that pressure  I don't want the government to put the pressure on  Murdoch is a big problem world around and that's the part of this story that gets lost  I'll stop now so Stacy can wake up and join us again

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm here. I  Was boring you terribly nuggets such as wait what cranky's a person

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well in other news GameStop stock went up 100% today

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What the hell I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Got a breaking news. I was like what why this the stock trading was high held it twice for  volatility ahead of the closing bell up 104%  before the close  Little profit taking after that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No one knows why it's high. Yeah, but to hurt the hedge fund people were

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Knows what's going on?  Stomp all the house of mirrors and it's ironically and I think unrelatedly  Read it went down entirely about 1 o'clock this afternoon

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I heard that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Also heard something happening with Federal Reserve Federal Reserve was down this morning as well, which means no  ACH's  No wires that's back up. They say it was an error  in  You know one of their somebody screwed up  Reddit is back up as well. So I don't think it's really like save to stonks  What a weird world we live in well, too  What a weird weird world we live in all right, well, I think we can stop with the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With the Ozzy Facebook and thank you for dealing with that. That was that was good

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anything well, there is another one other Facebook story  as you know, the oversight board at Facebook is reviewing the  the  deplatforming of president former President Trump  apparently  They're they're deciding now on and I thought they'd already decided to decide on it  But those they have I think 90 days former President Trump has appealed directly to the oversight board to rejoin the platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According which they said, you know, he had a perfect right to do he could submit. Yeah, that's who does it right?  The person who's deplatformed. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah  All right, can you imagine?  All the Facebook news you ever

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wanted I can't oh, yeah, I can't get into my Facebook account. I wanted my  Haven't I haven't been there in two years  Are you didn't kill it you just suspended it or no, I just I just ignored it didn't go but my  My theater teacher from when I was in high school. She passed away and so I was you know  Yeah, you want to go there and memorialize her sure  but  apparently in  Because I logged on last from a computer that I no longer owned Facebook was like well  we don't know if it's you so we're gonna have to have you authenticate but the only way to let me authenticate is by I  Know what it is. You have to hold up a Rupert news near Murdoch newspaper with the current date on it. There we go  And my birth certificate. Yes. No, I have to  Facebook wants me to call some of the friends that selects for me. Oh, yeah, I'm for a code  Yeah, but the people yes one of homes my husband, but the other two are  Like not people I actually don't have phone numbers. No, I just I'm like, oh your acquaintances. I don't even have a phone number

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't that ridiculous? Yeah, that's that Facebook recovery process  So, you know, you might want to look this gift horse in the mouth and say all the teeth is there. I'm buying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I can't I mean now I can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't you have to log in to deactivate it so I'm just gonna be in this Facebook  With all the babies  No, they're limbo you gotta get your  They go to limbo because they're babies they have an edge there's original sin, but they didn't do anything  So I don't know how to get out of limbo  Yeah, I'm like I feel like babies should go to heaven

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's just me and we're we're not gonna argue theology. I kind of agree with you. I kind of agree with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why I remember all those fun facts  from catechism class Cheryl Sandberg and top Facebook executives  silenced an enemy of Turkey  This is quite a quite a accusation. This is from ProPublica  During the 2018 Turkish military campaign  The Turkish government demanded that a page of a mostly Kurdish militia be blocked on Facebook Cheryl Sandberg  Wrote in an email. I am fine with this. That was her one-sentence message to the team that reviewed the page  They're still down three years later

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So this is a very interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is the problem is that it's very hard to do what Facebook does and not weigh in on these right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  True. Yeah  And and following nations laws gets you in trouble with right nations that have better laws, right? Right?  This is again why I think that in a way I would bet I have not heard this many one  But I would just bet that there were people inside Facebook who said let's just leave it alone. No news. No news fine  Puppies parties getting laid. That's not too bad. Let's go back really. It's a good life. That is society speaking to somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who's lived that life? That's a good life  All right, let's take a little break that was our entire  Bundle of Facebook news our Facebook news spindle

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Taco Bell is back in the taco Bell news. This is a major tease. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I want to know but I can't because it's time to tell you about forward networks  I'm suffering here. No, actually I love forward. It's not that I just want I want the Taco Bell story. Oh, well  Stay tuned. It's coming up your network, you know, it's kind of coinkied ink  Federal Reserve Board down read it down  Your network is kind of mission-critical right in some cases the network being down if you're you know, the Federal Reserve Board  That's a big deal  Maybe we should send them a little note about the forward networks. This is really cool  I talked to the guys who created this they were Stanford  PhD students the four of them and  Worked on they were actually they actually kind of felt the pain network operators felt by the mystery  Operators felt by the mystery, you know, if you've ever run a network a big network, you know, there's a lot of mystery  There's that big puffy cloud that we talked about that hides a lot of details. It's a mystery  What's going on sometimes in the network? So they decided look we can use software. This is so cool to  create a  Software generated digital twin of the network a literally completely accurate  mathematical model of  Your network when we can sense, you know  it's kind of like Google does since spiders out to find every corner of the network find every device on the network and  Map it out and then present this on the screen as a single source of truth. So, you know exactly  What your networks doing? What could you do this?  You can determine if your network is in compliance with your policies if it's configured properly if it's  Behaving as you thought it would and even maybe more importantly you can figure out what's gonna happen to the network if we make some changes  Forward networks calls this behavior diffs  it's like a text diff except it allows a side-by-side comparison of your network as it is right now and  What it will be like with those configuration file changes your you're contemplating  You can you can actually in one view you could see all the changes for any device between any points of time and know exactly  What's going to happen?  So so that's the problem is somewhere like the Federal Reserve Board a guy comes in changes a configuration file or a routing table  Suddenly the whole thing goes down if they'd had forward networks  They'd be able to accurately predict the impact of those changes across every possible traffic path  And once they verify it's gonna do exactly what they want on the forward network  Simulation on the model they could say okay now we can do it and they can do it with confidence  Keeping your network healthy keeping your network agile. This is so cool  You get a beautiful dashboard if you're watching the video you saw but I'll tell you if you go to the website  You can see it for yourself forward networks comm slash  tweet you you'll see  Visualizations that you can immediately understand what's going on you can export them  You can send them to the boss to the board  It you can automatically create an always accurate network diagram full details about the topology of your network. What's on every  node  It's search network behavior configuration and state network wide. It's got a really nice search tool  You can do end-to-end path analyses across your network both on prem and in the cloud. I mean everywhere your network is  So you can verify that it's behaving as you expect on prem cloud virtual overlay networks  You can set check and customize policies for the whole network  This will give you on average 50% faster resolution of network trouble tickets  90% faster fixes related to audit processes  33% reduction in a board of network updates due to identified errors  Wouldn't it be cool? You could do a search to see what's causing the problem  Forward networks, it's it's actually a great story  Goldman Sachs they they led the series C funding round last October  Along with Mark Andreessen over to Andreessen Horowitz who thinks forward networks is amazing threshold  65 million dollar funding round  Forward networks worked with PayPal  PayPal was doing that thing that the dance that all of us do design versus  Build they were gonna build their own instead. They found forward networks. They said oh, this is it. This is it  They worked with Bank of America with Verizon  If you're down under they worked with Telstra  For this is something every big network needs network automation and verification  For an intent-based network with forward networks your business depends on it federal reserve board  Get a demo at forward networks comm slash twit forward networks comm slash twit  They also have a podcast if you want to listen to it. I love the name seeking truth in networking  It's wherever you get your podcast you get a copy. Check it out forward networks comm slash twit  I almost feel like especially times like this. This is a public service announcement  Everybody needs to know about this  No more  No more configuring your BGP routing table so that all the internet traffic goes to Maine no more of that  Forward networks comm slash twits time has come  All right, you teased us with Taco Bell  What is the story?  Which line? Oh here it is. I found it which line it's on eater dot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody has to have an entry into the chicken wars and Taco Bell's held back  To decide just the right thing and I think they might have done it. They have their entry into the chicken wars

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's this goo dripping out of the end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is oh, it's a special sauce. He got to have a special mayonnaise. It's always mayonnaise. It's gross

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but it's just color me. This is silly. There's food coloring

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think I think a pickled jalapeno  Is a notch above  Popeyes pickle  I think this is a major advance in the form crispy chicken chipotle sauce

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Cradled in a folded flat bread not approve. I can't believe you called it a jalapeno  It's jalapeno

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What kind of nonsense is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  jalapeno  um, you know what I had I finally went to Popeyes I made my uh,  My wife drive me to Popeyes. Oh Popeyes those biscuits. Did you have the sandwich? I had the sandwich  It was good. What'd you think? It was very good. That's good. Yeah. Well  Okay, so very stuff one thing is  And this is I guess a pro they're using real chicken  The problem with real chicken is it doesn't have a consistent, uh size shape  Texture so it was a thick part and a thin part exactly  There was a big lump of chicken in the middle and then there was like crispy around the it was good one issue  So you've experienced this bolus the chicken bolus issue. Yes, the chicken bolus. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's let's call that just a feature of chicken y'all. I mean, do you really want  And that's the advantage  I mean, yes, they could they could pound it part but even when you create a like a cutlet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It could butterfly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Sugar if you don't put sugar in a cake or a cookie  You don't get the christmas you can use honey in a cookie for instance  But the thing about the sugar when it bakes it crisps  And honey won't do that and i'm thinking that probably popeyes is putting some nice white sugar in that bag

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's cackle lackey time on this week in googie

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, i'm sorry google google, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's talk about ethics and ai. Oh god. I've been avoiding this story. You know what? That's why  because another ai ethics researcher fired we had you know, remember tim rick gebru who was fired and then  margaret mitchell we tied the story a few weeks ago that she was in trouble because  Uh, she apparently was exfiltrating  email  From her account google was investigating she was fired on friday afternoon tweeted merely  Two words i'm fired  Google confirmed her employment had been terminated after conducting a review of this manager's conduct  We determined there were multiple violations of our code of conduct now  As I always disclaim before we do these kinds of stories employment law  it's tough because  Employers are very limited what they can say about a termination  We will never get both sides of a story on on any termination  So we just should say that up front, but it does not look good for google once again  Um, you know having trouble with their the people they brought in specifically  To run their ethical ai team

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have now both been fired. Yeah, this is not this is not cool looking  As they say the optics are bad. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, well knowing that optics are bad yet, they continue to proceed with this  So it makes you wonder what exactly did happen on both sides of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I mean the research I will say the research they put out that kind of  Made google's burnt burnt  Social, uh, sorry search algorithm look biased. I can see and maybe not as effective  I can see google being like, uh, yeah, please do not publish the paper that makes us look bad  but I can also see the argument in favor of that especially into the in like the current climate of  Being aware of bias in ai  and yeah, the I will say the way that google handled this  is incredibly clumsy, I feel like they could take a page from like  lobbyists for the telco industry for really like  Coming in and co-opting somebody else  And in making it, you know feel bad without looking quite so bad to the rest of the world  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go. Google's young they're learning and at the same time they come out with a new policy  On diversity and these actions have an impact on on that statement

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're changing its their diversity and research policies the head of the company's head of ai  Apologize for the handling of the margaret mitchell and timnit gobru  situation  You know  It's complicated

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it's all I don't know. I mean, it's just so hard to know what's happened. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hard to know what's happening on the inside, but I will say firing  An african-american woman and then another woman because they disagreed with your  Yep  Male management team. Yeah  I mean i've been there  I've not been fired, but I have disagreed and I have left companies because I've disagreed and

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I didn't I mean the reason why I would have gotten fired is because I didn't tow the party line  And so then the question needs to be like hey google. Are you self-aware enough to change your party line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, if you hire strong  women  to oversee your ai efforts and you don't like what they say  I  Maybe there's other solutions than firing them. I it just it seems like that's why you brought them in watchdog

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, right. Yeah, they're there to be a watchdog and then if you don't let them watch the dog  Yeah, now they're a canary. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they have just fallen over on their perch  Uh, there is though. We do have some testimony from a guy who was at google and  Left the founder of ways wrote a piece  Uh at paygo which I gather is yet another  Subscription. Yeah medium slash subscription thing  uh, noem bardeen  Said why did I leave google or why did I stay so?  long  He talks about uh ways being acquired by google seven years ago  How he was promised autonomy as you know google and other companies always do given them they left

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, yeah this guy's post

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like  Buddy, what kind of fairy land were you living in that you thought this company?  Would buy you and leave you completely autonomous. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know that happens anywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't because it's not tenable for the acquiring business. Oh, right and they left it more independent than anything else

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Any normal company would have just merged it into google maps and that's that the fact that they left it as a separate entity  To do development honestly was kind of stupid in israel  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then the other thing I would say is in here he talks about  Running from his existing board because they had conflicts. So it was like instead  they were running away from their current board to google thinking that was going to solve some of their problem, but  You cannot grow your startup as a startup in the midst of a big company

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  His biggest complaint was and this is common in a big company he couldn't hire and fire as he chose

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh boy. Yeah  Gosh, I hated that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know and you know why because bigger companies have larger legal liabilities  They don't necessarily do a bet or a better job as we can see but they I mean  That's what they're there for and  Uh  Okay, well I'm basically basically this guy just read is entitled and super naive and i'm just like what you're a successful entrepreneur in this  I don't know. Sometimes i'm just i'm bitter. They had great technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, they managed to develop it a lot more. I mean, I still use ways instead of google

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I still have a huge fan base ways did not lose his personality  It's still very much like it was right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh in this guy and this guy also complained about you know  He had used a four-letter word while speaking on a panel his analogy wasn't pc  His language wasn't pg. So he stopped speaking  And people like he got his wrist slapped by him and yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did he use the word cancel in here anywhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but he did say he did say tolerance is gone at google in the words  Are and words are bigger than or greater than content. That's the new silicon malli mantra of political correctness

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can say terrible things as long as your pronouns are correct or you can say super important things  But use one wrong word. It's off to hr  With you. It does seem a little naive  um, he also  published a brand report which showed that ways  brand all by itself  Was better than band-aid hp southwest and hershey's  Although I have some question about this top 50 brands because okay apple google amazon netflix pinterest

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh people love pinterest beating android spotify pixar disney's number nine

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay  Where do you think disney should be? Well, disney's a pretty respected brand. Don't you think?  Well, yeah, that's why it's number nine. I don't know where this ranking the brands.com. What the heck  Okay, you're right good point  Some guy's idea of what a brand is  Okay  That's I guess that was my point is brand ranking for you next week. Yeah  That was kind of my point is like I don't understand this list at all  It doesn't make a lot of sense to me. So yeah  Somebody like question for you all. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With with all of this stuff going on from firing the ai ethics people  Does  Google's been doing or actually a lot of the tech companies  They've been doing all of this woke stuff and making all of these different contributions to  to help  Unfortunate people especially in the lines on the sides of being people of color and yada yada yada  We've seen all of these campaigns. We're giving back. We're trying to you know  invest more into to  Allowing kids of color to get into the stem field and yada yada yada yada  They're saying all the right things and I think I said a couple a couple weeks ago that  I want to see more action and then stuff like this happens  Does all of that lip service just get diminished based on?  these recent firings

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's really a question more for you aunt because all of this is is aimed at you  It's like oh really trust us we like black people we we you know, we're we're all in you know on black people and then  But you do have to judge somebody by their actions. The words are easy. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think part of it is also  women

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  women too, absolutely, yes women too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep, I  I think when I talk back or argue with a man

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A certain kind of man not just shut up stacey. I don't want to hear it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  goes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would be I would be interested in the response if aunt and I got together and argued with  individual yeah, because  Like I I mean I think in lord help black women because yes, that's probably even worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um and black women in tech  Probably makes it  worse yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep, and so I I think in in some of it  I will say if i'm google and i'm actively trying to recruit black women  people of color women in general  These are not good stories to tell and to see and it's people are very I mean, it's clear. They're not walking the talk  Is that the right place? Yes, that's exactly right. Yes, they're not walking the talk  Um  And they did appoint the woman they appointed to replace margaret mitchell or meg mitchell was a black woman marion  I want to say  Call see colatar a colic collar something  anyway  but  I look at this and i'm like I would never want to work there  I mean you would have to defend yourself not only to everybody within google but to everyone who's probably your support network your

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, why would you go to work for them? They're awful. Yeah, they don't have a nice track record at all  just don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just  and it's unfortunate because it's  google is so  important in terms of  How people it's a frame through which a lot of people see the world. So it's important to get more people  Who resemble the rest of the world in there, you know?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is actually the what margaret mitchell said in her tweet that I think  She believes and others believe was the proximate cause of her firing not the emails that she was going through  Say you have a problem. She tweeted with consistently alienating black women and have caused serious damage in their lives  You could a try to undo that damage  Or b try to form more black people to like you the tokenism approach  Good luck  So she's saying that exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's that's one of the things that it was right after syndar said he was going to go to the historically black universities  and try to recruit but  I mean  Having someone  This is this is tough and this guy who wrote this entire aggrieved blog post basically a good portion of his message was like  I left after seven years because I told it like it it was I was too real for google real  That man lasted seven years right right point

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah, i'm here to report things things at google are pretty good for white men. I just want to say, you know  We're doing all right here. Just want you to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he felt like so justified in writing this fan this like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And he left he wasn't fired. He wasn't fired. He left he left

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No  And people were like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So surprised and he was like I I just was tired because i'm kind of a confrontational person and I was tired of not being me  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Admit it. We're both attitude. We're both reading between the lines quite a bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This attitude don't get me wrong no he wrote that in there he wrote those little words

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know  And and don't get me wrong. This isn't just me attacking google  I I say this about pretty much all of these large corporations out there because it's  There's a bunch of corporations doing the same behavior  That we don't hear about um smaller  companies, you know under the fortune 500 of whatever so this is just  You gotta if you're gonna freaking talk about what you're doing  You need to walk the walk too as our chat rooms sit there. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes walk the walk talk the talk I think  Is is stacey?  To your point. It's it's one matter to be a person of color a woman of color a woman  Inside the behemoth that ann talks about  But the key here is about the lesson that i mean god knows i'm a white man and i'm going to learn lessons every single day  But the thing that i've learned most in the last two years  Is the need to truly share power and it's a lesson I have to learn how to think about that every single day  um, and in this case  Google didn't share power  Right. They they said you're in charge of keeping us honest in ai. Uh  Not that honest  And and that's the problem that don't have the job then don't have started the job in the first place  And don't put a black woman in that job if you're not going to mean it that to me  Yeah, is the key issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're going to put a token up there and say  And then tell the token that it's actually a meaningful player when it's really just a pawn then yeah, and of course they're going to be pissed

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and i've been on the other side of this coin as well that I think should be addressed and  Basically what we said at the beginning is we got to know both sides of the story  I've been in a situation where I was terminating somebody that was working on my team and  Black person and they wanted to throw the race card at me yada yada yada and i'm like person i'm black too  And these rules that are in place these protocols that are in place. They were set by me  so that's why yeah, not because you're  Black it's because you didn't follow my protocols and I live by my protocols  so it's still it we got to understand that it's still going to be two sides of the story and  Don't always assume that it's just a company being idiotic and racist because sometimes there are just some  Flood out rules being broken and procedures not being followed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes  I will say  Not in your case aunt, but in many cases the rules are there to protect the established class. So sometimes you're like, uh,  But I will also say the rule the reason google said they fired both of them  the excuse in both cases was  Involved not following the rules in in transferring large files was one in both of their cases  And that's one of those rules where you're kind of like that's in the that could be  Really nefarious like anthony levendowski nefarious, but it can also just be like yeah  I wanted to you know, take some work home or something trying to work from home every day

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. It's just trying to work from home

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I look at I look at their excuses in this case and i'm like  Okay  And the google is totally fine protecting people too when they fire someone that has done something well andy rubin

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah egregious somebody. Did somebody say 90 million dollars? Was that what you just said 90 million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. So I mean if we look at all the people who were fired because they probably got a little too  happy with their assistance or  You know actively harassed people but just were left, you know, oh we're gonna let you go  You know, and maybe they get a 90 million dollar severance  Maybe they don't but google doesn't throw them out in front of the you know, throw them under the bus with some stupid  We're firing you because of xyz  so right  But you're right we should wait but we're never going to hear both sides  So in this case all we have are the optics. Can I ask to take that a completely unrelated but meta question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Of you journalists because i'm curious  We never you never have the whole story, right?  How do you handle that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You write I mean  I have always written when I write about things I write about it for  The consumer right and this this doesn't  In this case, it's a little less  Apparent but you write about it from that you understand who has the power  And I err on the side of the people who don't have power. That's a good. That's a good attitude. I think yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do too and then in fact that's behind important in the in the field that i'm in of tech journalism because  It's very easy to be punditry  Pardon me punditry  Sorry, I lost my head for a moment  That it's very easy when you're doing that to uh favor the big companies to favor the tech companies  You know, they're gonna spiff you with free stuff and you know  You want to go to sources same thing  I suppose in beltway journalism when you know your sources are all members of congress  You kind of don't want to burn your sources access, but access is so important  But at the same time really what who are you representing? You're representing those not in power. You're speaking truth to power

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's also but but we also get full of ourselves  um  And think that you know, we set the agenda we shouldn't the public should that we know right how things happen  And so it turns the other way. Pardon me. Can I just get a license to say this just once in the show?  And then I won't say it again  You know, it's the problem I have with the switch from utopian to dystopian moral panic and coverage of tech  Neither is true  And and and so the credibility of the coverage so often now I think there we go

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you a little flash of moral panic there a little subliminal moral panic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I asked for permission. Well, actually no I asked for forgiveness  Um  uh  You know where I think that the the one of the words we love in journalism and my friend jay rosen says we always use  It wrong is narrative. You know, we think we control the narrative. We have the story. We know what's going on  We know how to put it in the context and oftentimes we don't  um, you know, i'm sure we've all had the experience too of being interviewed by journalists and it's awful  because they take the one thing they need to fill in their story and  Um, you know, you understand why people don't trust interacting with us  Um, I we've got to change the form of what we do  That's why I have students to do that because i'm too old

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  by the way in a related uh  To the australia update apparently according to writer's alphabet is in talks with spanish publishers to bring google news back

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't understand this story because that was a law that gave no option and no choice. Yeah  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So i'm not sure what's happening. He's not gonna change the spanish cultural ministry says the government is working on a draft bill  So they're trying they're looking at changing  Change, you know, okay, then that's this is the famous case publishers. Yeah, there's a famous case the publisher just demanded  Payments for snippets. Google said screw you closed google news in spain and it hurt the publishers badly. That was back in 2014  So, uh, I guess now  Uh spain is going to do something about that and google might come back  Uh  Good good good talk everybody. Thank you very much  Pundit that's what I am a pundit actually stacey to be fair in my  In my bio service journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I thought you said you were a pundit

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you say that now after you slapped me around  I thought you said that no i'm teasing. Absolutely. Absolutely. I do not consider myself a journalist  That's why I said I want to ask the journalists on the panel. What do you do if you have insufficient?  You know and you know you have insufficient information, but that's just the nature of the world. You never have perfect information

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and you could always call more people. Yeah, I mean, but at a certain point you do have to file  Yeah, yeah

I thought wow  Yeah, um, i'd love to get your take on it in a second but first a word from gabby  I have so i'm so  This is the story  I'm sitting i'm watching tv  Uh, lisa is kind of hair on fire says they just raised our home insurance eight thousand dollars  And I said, oh, yeah, I guess because we're in the wildfire area and stuff like that. She said oh my god  I said, you know what? I really should do I should shop around  Because I bet you we can find a better price and I started you got to log into each individual company's site  You got to answer a whole ton of questions and it's very repetitive  It's the same questions, but you got to answer them over and over and over again  And I thought gee there ought to be a better way and then  On the tv this guy comes on I said I gotta try this download a gabby  long story short  Uh, we saved two thousand dollars on our home insurance. So put the ad app on my phone  What it's really quick very fast they say on average if you were shopping around  It's about 1100 keystrokes per insurance  Company that you'd have to fill out forms and so forth  So this they go to the 40 top insurance providers progressive nationwide travels and really what gabby did what hana did  Which is really interesting. He convinced them to have an api that they could scrape  He said you've got to make this  Easier for people to shop around you you know, this this going to each site is crazy  So gabby actually has kind of influenced the industry to make this possible  But what will happen is you go to gabby, uh, they do homeowners and they also do auto and I did both  And I want to warn people about this because I got a couple of emails from people saying did you know they do this?  Yes, I do and this is this is how they save you keystrokes  You log you give them the logins for your insurance current insurance  That way you don't have to type anything they get everything all the underwriting information  From your current homeowners insurance and your current auto insurance  That's one of the ways they save you a lot of keystrokes by the way, absolutely private  They are that they make their money and commissions from the company that you end up using if you end up using them  They don't sell your information. They keep it absolutely private  They you know, so it's completely safe to do this  Uh, but by so I entered that in  You link your current insurance account or accounts  And within in most cases it's going to take you just a few minutes to get the to get a quote for the coverage  Exactly the same coverage you currently have that's why you want to log into your existing account  You want the same coverage. It's easy to say oh I could save you a thousand bucks  But only if you promise never to drive your car. That's no good  Uh, so this is you're going to get the same coverage  You there's at this point you've spent nothing  There is no obligation if you want to move forward with one of the quotes you say, you know  Uh, I won't I don't want to name any particular insurance company. So I won't but we found one we say wow, that's great  Yes, let's move forward with this  Then the insurance company select reviews your details to confirm the final price  They have to do the full underwriting thing in some cases that may involve a phone call with gaby or a phone call with the company  We didn't have to do any phone calls  But we did have they they did adjust the price we ended up saving just about two thousand dollars  One thing I really loved they looked at the car insurance. They said, you know what? You're getting the best deal we could find good job  That was kind of nice too. They didn't try to you know  Bait and switch or anything. They just said look you're already getting the best price. So that made me feel good  We had a good we had good car insurance. We got a great deal on our home owners homeowners on average gaby customers save  961 dollars per year  961 dollars in your pocket on average on car and home insurance  If they can't find you savings as they did with the auto insurance to let you know  And actually that's a nice feeling, you know, hey, I got a good rate  They never sell your info  Uh, I used a special phone number a special  Email address as I always do when I try these things out to see if they're going to sell it  Never not one call no spam. They really do keep it private  This is a great thing. I want you to know about it. I want you to try it  If you're not overpaying it'll be nice to know but if you are overpaying and on average most people are by as much as  961 dollars gaby can save you g a b i gaby.com slash twig  gaby.com slash twig as I said  We got the we got the insurance packet last week in the mail  Signed off save 2 000 bucks right off the bat. That's fantastic. That is a nice feeling. Thank you gaby.com  slash  Twig we appreciate your support of this week in

Transcript:  Gabby gabby is the new gift gabby gabby

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They sent me you know saying it's pronounced gabby. Well, they said it's pronounced g a b i and I said, okay good. Thanks  Thanks for clarifying  I think they don't mind either way. Hano says gabby. How would you say with an australian accent? Gabby mate get it get it get it  Gabby gabby gabby  Alright, alright. Alright, what did you want to talk about? Oh, yes, the White House has said  Yes, there's an issue  Uh with uh chips with a shortage and we want to see what we can do about it. Tell us about that stacey come on  I you're muted. I hear I hear nothing. I just see her. Sorry. Okay. Okay  Tell us about that stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right for those of you who are not just riveted by the chip industry  There has been a huge shortage  of semiconductors not  The new york times actually reported it early on the automotive side  So people actually can't make cars right now because they don't have enough. It's amazing. Isn't it? Yeah  Yes, and this is happening in europe. And so everybody's going to like tsmc and other

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Our audience knows it because they can't get graphics cards  They can't I mean, there's a whole bunch of stuff. So that was the next thing. So it's not just cars

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gsm chips are in short supply. Wifi chips are so hard to find so like your wise garen  They actually were like we're not going to do at least and launch any more wi-fi products for a while because we can't get the chips

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some of this is cove actually there was though and I didn't know about this until alex lindsey told me  And maybe you didn't either stacey. I don't know. There was a big  fire  at one of the  big chip  factories october 20th  in japan  This is the akg sem audio semiconductor factory  They make d acs digital analog converters and adc's analog digital converters used almost everywhere  All the employees got out, but the factory was destroyed  And and that's another source  Uh, it's going to be offline for at least six months  So in the next for that was in october, so october november december, maybe it'll come online next month the month after  but  That affects tons of stuff including cars

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's like a basic component because you know your analog. Yeah, that's the real world digital is your computing world  And you got to translate between the two anyway  so  biden administration's coming in and  Europe is actually doing the same thing. They're they're trying to figure out. Well, what do we how do we tell?  You know the chinese government  please  Get get taiwan on the you know, how do we tell china? How do we tell taiwan?  How do we tell japan to get their factories?  Not only operational but sending the products to us and not their own customer or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not their local customers. So this is one of those executive orders. They're a little controversial

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This afternoon biden is going to sign the executive order. He did basically he did sign it. Yes signed it now

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do we have the actual language of the executive order? Yeah, the order includes I do have it. I'm this is from cnbc  Uh biden signs executive order address chip shortage  Through a review to strengthen supply chains. The order includes a 100 day review of key products  Semiconductors and advanced batteries in electric vehicles followed by a broader long-term review of six sectors of the economy  Allowing for policy recommendations to strengthen supply chains with the goal of quickly implementing the suggestions  This action follows calls from bipartisan members of congress and industry leaders warning about the potential consequences  of the semiconductor shortage

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So and this is a big deal and right now just to add a little bit more context  There is actually a group of activist investors coming after intel saying they should divest themselves with the manufacturing capabilities. Yes  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Intel famously their new cvo pack galsinger is the one that's going to decide that at some point soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so  Having this sort of political, you know  It's the opposite of a tailwind helping them, you know  Then that off will be good. But here in the u.s. We have actually  several high-end  Plants samsung has a 300 millimeter fab that's running at a pretty high process node micron. They make memory  They've got excellent fabs here in the u.s. But we don't actually have a lot of the smaller  Components. We have a couple  really ancient  fabrication plants  That do some analog chips, but we  79 percent are almost 80 percent. I believe of the chips made  Today are made not in the u.s. They are made in Taiwan or China or Japan

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And so only about according to the semiconductor industry association  12.5 percent of semi conductors are made in the u.s

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of strategic 79 percent are in Asia. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But what can you solve this with a stroke of a pen Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, so what you're gonna have to do is build or retrofit more fabs and I will tell you right now  We have fabs in this country that people are not  That that have just lying dormant or getting transitioned to like they're not shopping malls, but data centers or something else  The other thing is fabs are very expensive. Yeah even  and  They take a long time to build you need access to a lot of fresh and clean water  So there's a lot of like New York is really big into this because they actually they poached it from Austin y'all  They stole semi it was the Innovation Center that was established in the 80s in  Austin it helped create actually Austin as a tech map or a tech kind of juggernaut and it was the  equipment and manufacturing  Industry Association for the semiconductor industry New York stole it  and now New York is you know gonna try to finagle some money and whatnot to probably  I'm guessing produce or build fabrication plants there

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We talked about this last week didn't we the TSMC bought a thousand acres of land in North Phoenix in December  They're gonna start a 12 billion dollar fab  Which won't go online as you exactly as you said it's expensive and it takes a long time to build for a few years  But we'll make as many as 1900 jobs there and but this is you know, that's a few years off. I mean  This is the kind of problem. I don't think you can solve right real quickly. Can you so what when I'm talking to my sources

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who are having trouble a couple things and actually my guest this week on the podcast is talking about this on the consumer side  For the consumer devices  What they're having to do is put down more like order more in advance

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's why Apple is not suffering a shortage. They went to TSMC and bought their entire production  It said we'll take it all and they bought so much they could lock it in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So smaller so what's gonna happen is if demand doesn't so they're gonna they're buying more chip like a year and a half's worth of chips  Worth of chips so in another year or so if demand hasn't you know  They demand has fallen or is it meeting what they thought they would you're gonna see some great sales on electronic devices. That's it  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean Leo's point is obviously you can't solve this overnight. But if you're trying to have over the next few years a  Policy that would help our strategic requirements here. What would that look like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it just tax breaks? Is it? Yeah, you you start building in the US, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a couple things you  Like Arizona is a terrible place to make chips. It's great because the land is cheap. You mentioned water water is expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you see them in like Idaho Oregon is where Intel has been making theirs, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have they have fabs. They have fabs in both actually their their next generation fab is actually in Chandler, Arizona  So yes, you should but cities already do this like in Austin when we were vying for fabs  We gave them everything when Samsung was looking at their advanced 300 millimeter fab that they put in Austin  The city was like  Yes, you want land? We'll give you a land. You need guaranteed access to water  We'll give this to you by the way in Texas during the power outages. We lost a Samsung plant  We lost a TS or not a TSI plant  We lost actually a couple semiconductor plants for like a week because they were offline because of the power shortage  It's because of the power. It's not gonna help. Yep, and  water  Texas I  Know but yeah strategically all you can do is I mean  Hopefully this will get the activist investors off of Intel's back. I guess I mean like you don't want to fight  You don't want to fight the government, right?  to  tax breaks three  Even even pinpointing and saying hey, this is going to be a focus of ours is going to help  And then some of these things we can't solve like access to rare earth minerals for batteries, right?  I mean, we don't have those stores  So maybe we stop pissing off China quite so badly. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, this isn't there is no short-term solution and that's what the auto industry saying and there's gonna be big shortages and cars this  year and so forth, but  Of course that doesn't mean you don't do anything  It just means there's nothing you can do this is gonna help in the long short term  But you could start thinking in the long term about how do we solve this and I think that's what the hundred day review is  designed to do  Acknowledging that we can't make everything here too. You also have to work with your international partners as you mentioned for rare earth  Materials and so forth. It's important for defense as much as it is for private industry  So administration officials have met with automakers are in discussions with foreign counterparts on ways to increase increase  chip supplies in the near term  Detroit General Motors has shuttered three plants in North America from February 8th to at least mid-March  Ford has seen production disruptions in the past several weeks of its pickup the f-150. I  Guess I'm lucky. I got the car. I did  Because it has a lot of batteries in it and a lot of electronics  But they built it late last year and I wonder  So this is yeah, I'm glad I look at just I'm just  I'm glad that we have somebody in the White House who at least is paying attention to this stuff. Anyway, yeah  Whether they can make a difference well, that's gonna depend  That's gonna depend

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can put some fabs in coal mines in West Virginia, maybe we can solve a few problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There you go. Put the miners to work  The pixel 4 saved an unconscious man from being trapped in an overturned vehicle for hours. No, not Tiger Woods  The reddit user you post no spam his real name is Chuck Walker  Posted on reddit about his experience with car crash detection on his pixel pixel phone  He was in an accident on his property in Missouri with a bobcat load on a car a bobcat loader  You have a machinery rolled off  Ledge and fell into a small ravine landing upside down. You want to see the picture?  Wow  Upside down he was trapped  Injured  The emergency exit was blocked on the bobcat the main exit blocked  Seven broken ribs four broken thoracic vertebrae. He had a pixel 4xl  Now that I read this even though the phone was thrown out of reach during the accident it was enough to trigger trigger car crash  detection the phone  Contacted 9-1-1  It's awesome. He was unconscious  But when he woke up he yelled for help only to hear through his Bluetooth earbud  Which apparently survived the rollover that an emergency dispatcher was connected and it already sent rescue services

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you say technology is a bad thing. I do not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  None of us have ever said that Jeff never not once I say Facebook's a bad thing. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really want to find my pixel. I want to start carrying that around  So if you have it if you have a pixel phone look for the safety app and in that app settings  There's an option for car crash detection is not on by default. I guess he had turned it on  It was originally exclusive to the pixel for public service here. How do we turn it on safety app?  Open it up and in the settings for the safety app. There's a car crash detection option

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've never turned it pixel 3

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  5-4-a 4a 5g this this article from 9 to 5 of Google implies that you already have the safety app  But if you don't see it, maybe you do have to I don't see it  Maybe it's in settings. Here's a picture. Here's a picture personal safety  Send status updates during emergency sharing and then turn on car crash detection  I'm going to settings. Yeah, maybe you have to maybe you have to download the  Personal safety app to download. Well, I don't know what they're talking about. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Looked for the safety app and did not see anything. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thought it was a part of the way the second way the second I went to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Open no, I went to  Settings I then searched for safety and I see a personal safety app here  Continues me. No, why would I not want to continue as me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it under where is it under settings? Yeah, I thought it was in all

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Contacts. Oh safety my I just found out that my pixel 4 is at home. So I can't help you here  Thank goodness find my phone works though. I  Don't know where it is  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Forgot I had that are you are any of you neurotic like I am if I go out to mail

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Found it but I had I had to search for safety and it is called personal safety

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then but then Stacy I didn't find the I didn't find the auto thing in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So mine is it's in settings minus enabled already. Oh good permissions contacts. Oh good all my oh  But I am denying at my location so it won't help me yeah, it'll send them the wrong spot

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right. They say that in the article to make sure you turn on location permissions. Yep  And I also need a microphone yours is already enabled. Maybe so I might have thought start set up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Physical activity access interesting  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What were you saying my wife and she'll think it's a spam call and not answer it yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Were you saying Jeff you don't even go to check your mail without your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, just in case I have a heart attack in the yard. It's a good idea. I'm neurotic. That's a very good idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't actually this is my car key  So I I can't go anywhere without my phone because it opens the car for me and starts the engine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is a nice fancy really uncomfortable like if you lost your phone you have a key though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so you get so this is where this is that new Ford Mustang Machiavelli. I got you get one fob  And I said what this is it. They said yeah, you only get one because you can have up to four phones act as a key  But I thought but yeah, I had the same thing like well, what if the batteries dead?  So turns out the car also has a password that you can use to drive  So when you so you set up when you get in the car the first time you give it  There's a keypad on the door that you can just open the door that won't start the car  But then there's a button you can push on the car and you type in the password on the key on the on-screen keyboard  And then the car drives so I feel I feel like I leave the fob at home now  I don't feel like I need the phone is the phone is it talking to the cloud because like if you're in the parking garage

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where there's no service Bluetooth, okay?  Service Bluetooth, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So now I just doesn't have to talk to the cloud when you set it up  It's setting up a it sets up a secure token on here, but that's all we're first setting it up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay  Because like I can't start my Tesla from my phone without a cloud connection. Yes. Yes. I know yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I remember that the Tesla Apple let you start the car, but this is different  This is like Apple has a similar process only works with a couple of BMWs right now  But that the phone is a car key using Bluetooth le  So as I as I approach the car with my phone the car lights up  I can push the button open the door. I get it. Happy to see you. It's like it's happy to see you  It actually is it's kind of cute  It's a nice feature you would you would like this Mustang Stacey. I think it's a very  Has many it's like they learned from the Tesla. I think they probably stole everything they could

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, what do you drive in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a purple Jeep

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, my car still requires an actual key. Yeah, there's no key

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's no key for the door. There's no in fact, you know, the fob will have that emergency key  You can pull out of the fob on mine. It's just there's nothing it's on it's on  stick  I know there's nowhere to put it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fancy fancy  The kids today and they're like what is this?  What's that do is this how you open that the front?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you think of it a key is very medieval like yes, I have machined this metal in such a way  Only only it can open this door is it's a crazy idea  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It worked for a long

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For hundreds of years sure did. Yeah. Yeah, but I drive a Chrysler 300 a nice car, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I always say who somebody fancies visit in the studio and an aunt pulls up. That's a fancy guy  It looks fancy. It looks fancy. No, my car is a beater. It looks like a limousine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think the dark ages are dark ages they're not the key was invented between the years of 870 and 900 Wow  attributed to an English craftsman  Theodorus of Samos. Oh  That's what I often call invented I'm sorry it was invented  The first full all metal locks appear between 870 900 the key was my sam or see us of Samos in the 6th century  BC BC

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  BC so it is more than medieval. It's almost prehistoric prehistoric. Yeah  Oh  Portland has decided they don't want a smart city either you remember Google sidewalk smart city was rejected by Toronto now the Google  smart city plan for Portland, Oregon also sidewalk labs

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's a spin out technology called replica replica  Yeah, so it's yeah, they spun out a company for mobility data called replica and kind of the same reason more they just rejecting

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, because replica did not want to share data with the city at the level the city wanted

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it didn't want to share how it built its own place  Portland was the wrong place. It was also rejected by Kansas City. Oh, wow while you're getting all haughty about Portland replica told the BBC

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was unwilling to share data to the level of detail requested by the city at replica  We believe better insights should not come at the cost of personal privacy  We were not willing to compromise our privacy principles  Which frustrated our Portland Metro client and ultimately led to an early end of the project?  You know, that's interesting that the it wasn't the Google spinoff that was trying to spy on people  Well, I guess it was but they don't want to share with the city

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they were worried about their algorithms. They didn't want to share how they were

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Deriving the insights that that's not what they're saying. They're saying the city wanted the data  The software used  unidentifiable non identifiable mobile data location  Mobile location data show people show people move through a city  The plan was to use the data to make policy decisions about where to build bike lanes  How and when to repair roads this would be great and to make sure bus services were big would be efficient and reaching all communities  Fast company reported there were concerns about a lack of transparency around how the technology worked  So maybe you're yeah, maybe we're hearing stories from different stories from each side  Like Google's replica saying they wanted all the information in the city's and we wanted to know where that information came from

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it too expensive to just down throughout the city?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a lot more expensive if everybody's carrying these things and think about it you don't have to do anything  You just have to get us phenomenal. You get the location data much better than those little rubber by the way  Ironic, that's how that was Bill Gates first business  Trafo data he and  Paul Allen when they were in high school  Created a company remember you've seen those little rubber things on the street  Trafo data was a bit partnership between Bill Gates Paul Allen and Paul Gilbert in the 70s to read the data  From those traffic counters so that traffic engineers could decide what kind of you know use the road was guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, I figured those things still work quite efficiently and effective. Yeah rubber hoses

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They create air pulses  Recorded by a roadside counter in the 70s accounts were mechanically recorded on a roll of paper tape  When they were in high school Paul Allen and Bill Gates  Decided they could process the data cheaper and faster than the local companies  So they had classmates. This is so  Classmates to read the whole patterns in the paper tape  Transcribe it onto computer cards and then used a computer borrowed a computer time at the University of Washington  to produce the traffic flow charts  Paul Allen's father was a librarian at UW that's how they were able to get that computer  Of course, of course, yep. Yep  Anyway, I don't know how we oh, yeah sidewalk replica

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Portland yeah, there's a there's a red red tail media org  The woman who has been covering this since I guess day one. It looks like a he said she said yeah  And if you read it that this story is epically long, but it goes into a lot of depth

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Damaged trust  It's damaged trust, you know, this sounds very much like the he said she said in in in Toronto  there's just these there's just this some sort of mismatch between

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  City government and these these I think it's because cities cities have to do two things  They have to provide a service that their people their constituents can understand and to  They are accountable to these people so they have to provide  Information about what that is and if they can't get those things they don't want to do the project

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I make sense. I have to point out sometimes cities are a little  grasping also because for instance  It's happened in a number of cities that the data about mass transit like subways and buses  Which really should be public data?  The cities are withholding from Google Maps and others because they want to make their own app  for when the subway or the bus is coming next and  Instead of letting this be part of a map app and that's but I'm my opinion that's public data  They should they don't own that data. That's that's everybody's data. And if Google wants to put it in a case

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's there's there was a wonderful case where?  If you go to Penn Station for a train you see a whole bunch of people like this  Ready to run because they never tell you where the train  I hate that is coming in and tell like two minutes before everybody runs down  So this guy came along with this great thing and he said okay  I'm gonna look at the history of where the 476 to run Kakama comes. That's actually long island, but it sounds fun  and  I'm gonna tell you the odds of  You have 93 percent odds that your track three. So you stand by track three  so 93 percent of the time you win the  NJ Transit tried to stop him and  Insist that was coming like private data own data and the courts said uh-uh. No, so he still has a service. It's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Good. Yeah, the cities are not necessarily always acting in the best interests of their of the voters

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or in privacy I always say that government is not your friend when it comes to privacy government once a  Trove of data and you don't know what they're gonna do with it. I  libertarian but

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Good news as Samsung has just announced that Galaxy phones and other products like tablets launched in the last two years since 2019 will now receive  Four years of security updates. That's better than Google which only I think does two years. Oh, that's really good. Thank You Samsung  balls in your core Google  Did they explain why they're doing that? I don't know but I guess it has something to do with a  Loss of market share to Apple because people think that Android phones aren't very safe  And they're right in some cases, you know that these are these patches are important  I would regards. I bet it's also the business market Stacy  I would guess you know because the business Samsung's trying to get you know businesses because I think Knox and so forth are  You know trustworthy reliable and this probably has a lot to do with it as well. Go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well, I wondered if because the EU is actually looking at adopting the  planned obsolescence law that France had enacted a  Long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacy my thing this week is ting  I'm gonna have you know, it is not no it is not the two cows  Mobile service, okay. Let's see. What is it ting fire risk? Hold on ting plug  Hold on. I I'm terrible ting fire. It's fire safety  Yes  So this little doohickey you've been looking a lot into here. Let me turn off the audio. So you don't  This is the ting video  This is the out  This is an outlet that detects weird behavior in your electrical  Electrical and it tells you hey  You have a risk of fire. So I'm gonna show you the app if you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's not a fire alarm, but it protects you because of problems in your wiring

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So here's what it looks like most of the time getting this. Oh, I love this idea. Yeah, sure it you were doing it, right?  Yeah, all right  So this is showing the voltage coming in and around my house and it  When things get weird  It is $50 this says $349  Oh, no, that's the service Leo that the actual device itself should only be oh so you don't have to get the service  Oh, do they only do it as a service now, I think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I mean $349 look

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Electrical fires are nasty and this you plug this into the wall and then it has a sensor and they monitor it too, apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I like they must have just changed this because it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Man let me go to Amazon see if I can buy a ting fire sensor

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't think so they must have just changed it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So state farm you may if you have state farmers you're insured they offer this they should they should subsidize it you bet

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I was really excited to get this and the reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why is because I have a I do a lot of wiring on my house and I  Do a lot of wiring on my house and I live in fear that I'm going to like  much copper exposed  It's gonna mark in  Something's gonna. What are you you're doing wiring?  Yeah for all the light switches and things. Oh, I guess you are aren't you of course this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but that's of course, you know  I think about we have all of this solar we have batteries  The wiring is a little janky because our house is a grow house before we bought it so I think this I  Think this would be a I'm gonna buy even at 349 that includes the monitoring. I'm gonna buy it. That's a great thing  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dave here man Dave's not here man. No, man Dave. I'm Dave Dave's not here man  No, man, I'm Dave all the time  I got these stuff man  He's not here man  all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, go ahead. No, that's okay. So I was really excited because it  It's like two minutes to set up you download the app you connect it to you plug this thing in you connect it the two  things together in boom and  It is already worked  Like if power like I was turning off a circuit in another part of my house and it was like hey  By the way something your power was mildly. Oh, that's good. You know, so it it notice it notices that  Yeah, and you have to plug it directly into an outlet that's the only thing you can't stick it into like  That's why I can find an outlet, but you know, there's no particular. I'll just any outlet right any outlet in your home. Yeah, I  So for me, I mean it was kind of a no-brainer because it only cost 49.99 at the time  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then the sense the app would do the monitoring and just let you know that there was an issue  But now they want you to buy a year from 349  You get a year of ting monitoring the sensor service activation and a thousand dollar credit for hazard repair  Sounds like they've not they've changed it. Yeah, they've changed their business model. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For Stacy, well, they launched this in 2018. So it's possible that I  Just came in at the tail end of that which lucky me but  Bummer for y'all that changes things a little  Because I've had this now for almost a month and I'm really like I mean, I don't actually notice it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unless it's always about timing. This is a great idea  So somehow it's monitoring the circuit and notices if there's a change in voltage or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's change in voltage throughout your home. Right?  Basically, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that is my thing and I'm sorry that my thing is ting not check it beforehand ting fire

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  dot-com  And the chain apparently there is a coupon here safe 2021 safe dash  What does that bring the price down to same?  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You just get priority customers yes, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's see. Let's just see if I apply the coupon. What am I gonna do?  Jalapeno  And it cuts the price by 50 bucks, so there you go 299. All right, that's good  Jeff Jarvis, do you have a that was my number? Do you have a number? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do indeed I do indeed and funny thing happened. So I saw this story in the FT a couple days ago  I printed it out because I don't know if I'm gonna be able to get back to it since I was was rather the FT and  By a guy named will page and then I saw as we were coming on the show today  He tried to friend me on LinkedIn and said I enjoyed what you said on  The BBC about Australia and all that so I friended it back. It's a great story  He has a book coming out called Tarzan economics and he's the former Spotify chief economist  So in this is a treasure trove of amazing numbers about change. I'm gonna go through it quickly  In 84  6000 music albums were released in the UK total today streaming services make available a similar volume  55,000 new songs every day. Whoa  Whoa, if I launched 2009 the number of British songwriters has increased 115 percent to 140,000  UK recording auditors 145 percent to 115,000  20 years ago, there were five major UK labels and at most two dozen independent distributors today Spotify host music from  751 suppliers  There was there were a dozen and a half genres now Spotify's every noise acoustic maps  tracks  5224 genres including Coptic hymns Russian romanticism and of course the new lockdown hint  shanties  not all  books books  No, no, I'm sorry. It was on flutter new books more than 3.5 million titles only a fifth of them were new  But here's the one that's gonna depress you my sir my friend my boss. I'm looking at that paragraph right now  885,000 new episodes of podcasts almost two podcasts every minute. Hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The good news is half of those don't make it past week one  No, sir. I'm serious  Significant pod fade in that in that number actually the number I was looking at  There have been seven acquisitions of podcasting companies for more than a hundred million dollars each in the past two years  But that has not translated into newfound wealth for many creators. Thank you very much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In streaming most artists receive 20 to 25 percent of royalty  Because earnings go back first to pay in advance  That means an artist who receives an advance of a hundred thousand pounds must sell  500,000 pounds worth of music before receiving any more cash  Patreon so a lot of what it's saying is a lot of people just go independent and say screw it  Yeah, because you have to end up giving 75 percent of your royalties to the record company. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So as lockdown took hold major labels released 1.2 million songs in 2020 DIY artists

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  released a staggering  9.5 million that's an eight to one ratio of artists doing it themselves to labels  finally patreon  Took seven years from inception to the distribution of two billion dollars to  Creators the global music industry took 12 years to do the same for streaming revenue  I thought was just this is a really good story  So so plug to will page author of the upcoming book Tarzan economics do out in April hate principles for pivoting  through disruption

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is the point of that book? There's a great great bunch of numbers. Yeah
