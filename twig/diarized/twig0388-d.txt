He's in Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  World Economic Forum. Here's my official badge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That makes you a big shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does. The white badge is the thing that gets you in everywhere, including God's living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many Davos for World Economic Forum is this for you?  Eleven.  Yeah, seems like as long as you've been doing the show, you've been there this time of year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess so. Yeah.  So I'm in the press center where there's one, two, three, four diligent journalists working and I'm disturbing them by talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're diligent. This is diligent journalism. Welcome to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm responsive and responsible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Also with us, Kevin Marks. He's in a typhoon in his backyard.  Hello there.  The wind is starting to pick up.  Yes, it is raining rather heavily here.  What is it about inside?  You see things fly past my face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it about inside you don't like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What have you ever done inside, Eddie?  There are four dogs in there that will join in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ah.  That's what I came outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Stacey Hagenbotham is also here from Austin, Texas. Stacey on IoT and she has a couple of dogs.  No, just one.  I have a neighbor's dog.  Sounds like two.  You can hear it. Yeah.  Wait a minute. Your neighbor's dog is... Do you have play dates? Is he over right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no. I have like five feet from my neighbor. So their backyard is like closer to me than my actual dog is right now.  Nice.  And he's a Bernese Mountain dog. So he's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's the biggest... That's huge. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's so sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If he would carry a barrel of brandy around his neck, it'd be okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, he might. I wouldn't put it past him.  Do they still do that in Davos?  Have you seen any, Jeff?  No. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, the Premier of China spoke at Davos yesterday. That was a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He did indeed. He's taken over the world. He's now the unfree leader of the free world.  That's kind of where we are now. It's amazing here that the Trump heartburn is felt throughout.  Joe Biden... I went to see Joe Biden speak today and he gave basically a benediction to liberal democracy.  Oh, it's not that bad.  No, to the liberal world order of being open and free trade and globalism and all that. Liberal in that definition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Xi Jinping, who's the president, not premier, but president of China.  Oh, yes.  One of the things he said, no one will emerge as a winner in a trade war.  And that's specifically aimed at President-elect Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He quoted Dickens. It was an amazing speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His contention is that globalization is a good thing. It's powered growth worldwide.  Obviously, it's a good thing for China. Is it a good thing for the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The view here... there's a lot of people just to summarize the entire view of the elites and Davos.  The elites say...  But the views here, or the elites say, that globalization is an unalloyed good thing that maybe could have been done better.  Could have been done to have more concern about people's jobs and lives.  Now, what does that mean in practice? I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know how you protect jobs in a country without tariffs, without all sorts of artificial restrictions, without a trade war in effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't calculate the added value of world trade. I never see calculations of that, number one.  And number two, it does not calculate, very importantly, the job impact of technology, which is the real story that nobody acknowledges here.  However, I'll talk about this in the number much later, but the Edelman PR company released its Edelman Trust Barometer for the 17th year.  And relevant to us at Twig and Twit is that there's an outright fear of innovation and thus technology now.  There's a backlash coming to us, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I almost would prefer the globalization backlash to the technology backlash.  It's going to be... it's not going to be pretty. I know.  And there's a bloodite coming to smash the looms.  One of the things President Xi said is, no one would emerge as a winner in a global trade war.  Pursuing protectionism is like locking oneself in a dark room.  And this, you'll appreciate this, Kevin Marx, wind and rain might be kept outside, but so are light and air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And dogs. The dogs of war are at the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really... I mean, the reason this is a tech subject is because almost all the products we use in technology are made outside the United States.  And I think one of the agendas for President Xi is to keep that, whether it's jobs or jobs for robots, to keep the cash flowing into China from Americans and other countries from the manufacturer there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And to the worst, he filled a vacuum. There's a vacuum here.  Obviously, this has been inauguration week. Nobody here except for Anthony Scaramucci, who is the only person from Trump's world here.  Biden is here. But basically, Americans are much less represented than ever.  And it's symbolic of how Xi filled a vacuum.  Merkel's not here. Trudeau's not here. May is not here. So Xi is the biggest leader here by far. And he's reveling in it.  Sorry, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, that's okay. That's more perspective than I was going to offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, offer your perspective anyway.  The view from my porch in Austin, Texas is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well, so I was actually going to talk about protectionism and tariffs. And what I think the nuance that gets lost is most of the time when we're talking about that, it's negotiated trade agreements.  So there's going to be a tariff. I'm going to tax this and you can tax that. And the way we're talking about all of this is just silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it is interesting because technology fans have been a little upset with TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  And frankly, a lot of the treaties that go on, because very often American content company's interests, the copyright holder's interests, are in some's opinion overrepresented in these treaties, that a lot of what these treaties are generated by WIPO, the World Intellectual Property Organization out of the UN, which is basically driven by Hollywood.  And so I think it's funny because the techno left has been against TPP for other reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, other reasons, yeah. Copyright over extension of copyright primarily, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But also some of the nation states can sue government stuff that that's off-putting. I mean, governments, sorry, corporations, corporations can sue governments. That's the piece that's a bit weird about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, you can do anything you want, but ultimately this is not going to, globalization as a trend is not going to go away. The automation of jobs is not going to go away.  And I think what she is saying, well, I'll paraphrase what she is saying, is it's not merely trade wars that could put us in that dark room. It's turning our back on the future, somehow artificially holding back on the future.  So what we really ought to do is plan for it, train for it, consider it. And instead of saying, oh, we're going to go back to the manufacturing might of 1950s America, say, how do we deal with this inevitable freight train that's coming straight at us? Right? Or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it shouldn't our leaders be the ones saying that. Instead, it's Bill Fowles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our leaders have, we have seen so many train wrecks coming and historically we have decided not to deal with them until it's either too late or it's just inevitable. And then we stick a bandaid on it. I mean, in some ways that's why Trump is in office now is because our government has become so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right? We let it get to this point. I bet you could, but you could force Apple. I mean, and I'm sure he'll attempt to force Apple. That'd probably be the tit for tat to repay trading apples. 200 plus billion dollars that's held overseas would be. And by the way, let's get some manufacturer back in the United States. But I don't know if those are going to be jobs that will make much of difference in the long run, or maybe they will. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, when I talked to companies than tech that are trying to do manufacturing in the US, one of the challenges is we just don't have the cluster of needed manufacturing. So like if I'm going to make, let's say I'm going to make a tech toy, for example, I'm going to have the electronics assembled somewhere.  Some of the electronics, then I have to ship them someplace else to get like the screens put in. Then I'm going to have to have the plastics done elsewhere and I have to ship it to that place. Whereas in China, you can go like down the street and get all that done. And that's not merely because you pay less. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although that's part of it. But a lot of it is that that that it's just logistically easier to make it in China and then bring it all over here and boats and planes. Well, I don't Yeah, we'll see. I mean, it's gonna be it's interesting times ahead. What else have you seen at Davos sets of interest to the tech?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we mentioned this from Germany. I was in Germany beforehand at the DLD conference. And while I was there, the German government, the EU or other released a report arguing that robots and thus AI algorithms should have personhood and the potential to own intellectual property and be legal entities that you can sue.  How's that? So companies are people, robots are people algorithms are people who pays if a robot gets sued.  Because if the robot if the AI invents something new, the argument in this European report is that the software should own the rights to that and license it and then gets assets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's silly, because the robot in that case would be an employee of whatever company it works for. And that the same rule. I mean, people have those same rules already when you go to work for a tech company or any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacy, Stacy, you know, can you can you be a tough negotiator and get the robot to sign that contract? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll not sign will not sign. Where's my robot union?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's one thing. The other thing I saw both in Munich and here at Davos is a great guy. I'm telling you at some point you got to get him on triangulation named Jurgen Schmidhuber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just want to get him on for his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Schmidhuber I'm telling you, look him up. He is he is one of the fathers. I didn't know this of AI. He has a big Swiss thing in AI.  He is a geeks geek. He's just wonderful. And he starts when he starts riffing on the potential for AI and the speed that will come in the next 20 to 50 years.  Now, basically what he says is that there will be colonization of the universe by AI, by hardware and that we're getting this guy on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're getting this guy on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Intelligence will travel then indeed at the speed of light through radio waves from AI installation to AI installation.  And the whole thing about science fiction, he started reading science fiction when he was 10 years old. He got so fascinated with it. He had to do it.  He's a huge AI expert and he's one of the inventors with the students of the what is it called long term short term memory thing that enables so much of AI today.  And yeah, so he's really quite amazing. He's just well, I got to get I got to get a video interview with this guy. He is wonderful.  That was a huge discovery of this trip as Jurgen Schmidhuber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First line on his website says since the age of 15 or so, the main goal of Professor Jurgen Schmidhuber has been to build a self improving artificial intelligence smarter than himself and then retire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds good to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. He's a neural network geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This guy has no problem with Skynet at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, God, no, God, no.  You know, so I went to a panel discussion when he was on today for a German newspaper, Dezite, and he was on with David Kenny, who's the head of Watson at IBM and a guy who runs another key company in AI technology whose business card I can't I will find.  No, I won't find.  But, yeah, he gleefully talks about how we're going to have this universe of AI entries and that within 50 years, I think it's 50 years, a small cheap device will have more computing power than every brain in humanity.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The key to this, and I'm certainly not one to argue with Professor Schmidhuber, but the key to this is there's a difference between how a computer thinks and how a human thinks.  There's a significant difference between the von Neumann architecture.  Well, and that's what Kurzweil always said is if you can't tell the difference, it doesn't matter.  And yet, it's because of the apples and oranges meaningless to say a computer that has all the intelligence of every human brain in existence since they just don't work the same way.  Or am I wrong, Kevin Marks?  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's I mean, part of the reason people are excited about recurrent neural networks is they do work more like brains or at least parts of brains.  Certainly, they work like the sort of vision and audio processing parts of the brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what this is the guy who developed recurrent neural networks, by the way.  So he's to be.  Yeah, not not you, Kevin Schmidhuber.  Yes.  Not me.  Yeah.  I don't remember doing that.  Yeah.  Well, good job.  Well done.  We blame you, Kevin.  DeepMind was created by his lab's former students.  Two of the first four members of DeepMind got their PhDs under Schmidhuber.  So he's definitely I would love to get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if there's any video of this guy, but I'm telling you, he is a goldmine.  I've discovered the geek god.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He he did ask me anything on a year ago on Reddit.  And by the way, his name is pronounced you again, Schmidhuber.  According to him.  Interesting.  It varies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other interesting thing from here is a lot of fake news discussion, which we can get to in a minute, but also the Edelman Trust biometer, Edelman PR company.  For 17 years now has done a and you can look it up and get the graphics has done a survey of trust across the world, across institutions.  Media's trust has fallen hugely, but worse than anything else.  All trust levels of all institutions have fallen.  Media is now down as low as government trust.  Trust is what we're seeing is here in Davos is that it truly is the populism war against the elite.  The elites here, but the the world out there is angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the inversion of influence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Authorities actually argue with one because they talk about how it's authority that comes to the bottom of the pyramid, but at the top of the pyramid.  But they still talk about a mass.  And of course, I argue with that.  What is the mass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The trust gap widened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So otherwise, I've been all kinds of fake news sessions talking about that.  That's pretty much my office report thus far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love I'm looking at you again.  You again.  AMA.  Somebody asked him what what is something that's true, but nobody agrees with you on and Schmidhuber says many think intelligence to our point to our conversation a minute ago is is this awesome infinitely complex thing.  I think it's just the product of a few principles that will be considered very simple in hindsight, so simple that even kids will be able to understand and build intelligent, continually learning more and more general problem solvers.  Partial justification of this belief there already exists blueprints of universal problem solvers developed in my lab and the principles of our less universal but still rather general very practical program learning the kind we have right now recurrent neural networks can also be described by just a few lines of pseudo code.  He also says general purpose quantum computation won't work.  So far he's been proven right.  Interesting.  I will.  Let's let's I maybe it'll be an impossible get Karsten but we'll work on getting him.  I think that would be very, very interesting.  It's what I find interesting is the diversity of opinion about artificial intelligence among experts.  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No one seems to agree what they can or can't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well we don't even know what human consciousness really is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's part problem number one we don't know how we can I think that's the wrong decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What you know can can can whether it's Watson today is helping doctors do a better job of diagnosing tumors and recommending treatments.  It's not a gut feeling like the human brain has but it tries to do a better job of making a predictive calculation.  That's all.  That's all it is.  So it's a predictive calculation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is interesting because MIT actually MIT Tech Review had a story.  I can't remember his MIT scientists but an AI defeated someone at poker.  And again poker is one of those games where people feel like they're interacting with someone based on gut feelings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah we would have a huge advantage in poker one would expect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But really our gut feelings in a lot of cases are just us assessing subconsciously a lot of minute tells and right information.  So if a computer you could easily train a computer to see those things like micro expressions or I don't know my hair is blowing this direction in the wind.  Thus this must be true.  I mean that's that's actually probably easier to program than other things like emotions or true intelligence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin has sent us a link to Kathy O'Neill site.  Kevin may not know that both Stacey and I are big Kathy O'Neill fans.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And which which she debunks this whole idea right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well she debunks a chunk of it which is to say there was a problem where people over rely on this.  And you say oh we can solve this with a with an algorithm or with a big data or whichever.  And that or AI is that is what we call it now.  It's been called a lot of things over the years.  And the point is that if you're not actually checking what these models are doing then you've just replaced one opaque process with another opaque process.  And you may be encoding in your people's biases into the system.  And if you don't explicitly check for that you're very likely to be because it depends a lot on what you give it as training data as well.  So it's the herb I very much recommend her weapons of math destruction as because it's got lots of concrete examples of where people have done this.  And it's something to think about as they start applying these these tools because the challenge the challenge is you're basically teaching computers to sort of do things through hunches and got instinct.  And you can't always introspect what they've done.  We try and look inside these neural networks and you know you find stuff like deep dream and things like that.  And it's it's harder it's hard to know exactly what's what's going on and how it reached that conclusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the but the but Kevin David Kenny from IBM Watson said today that there's a necessity of transparency in these systems.  So when Watson says to doctors here is why we think this tumor is X it will say here's the five reasons why we why we say that based on the percentage guess.  Here's the treatment that we recommend.  Here's why.  So he believes that the transparency is a principle of AI systems otherwise you can't manage them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's actually Watson giving the probability of how confident he is in certain examples.  Yes.  What what I think is the other issue that people are thinking about isn't it's how does Watson get to that probability.  So it's not it's not just it's the showing your work as opposed to showing the results of your work.  Does that make sense.  Yeah it does.  So OK.  Yeah I mean I don't know if I'm putting words in Kevin's mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's right.  But the other thing that's slightly worrisome about this is that we people can't necessarily do this either.  We can't always give you reasons for how we choose things.  And what we what we are good at is making up narratives that are plausible.  So we choose something and then we'll come up with a justification for that.  And there's there's lots of research this confabulation of if you ask somebody why they did something they'll tell you why.  And they've done experiments with showing different things to the two different halves of the brain and having the left brain narrate the reason why the right brain is something even though it couldn't actually see that there's this.  And your body will make up your brain will make up something plausible to justify what you just did.  And my worry is that we're going to instead of actually getting the AIs to give us a you know an actual explanation for what's going on we're going to start training them to make up plausible seeming ones like we do as well.  And that's and that that that's you know that's more worrisome.  That is the real sort of post truth problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about Jorgens contention that really all this comes down to us not really understanding how the mind works and that once we really understand it it comes down to a few simple principles that any even a child could understand.  If that were the case it would explain the situation we're in right now but it also would kind of imply that will fit that soon this conundrum will be solved and we will be able to create true artificial intelligence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the thing is that a lot of our artificial intelligence is sort of postdoc justification.  You know we make up a narrative that's humans convincing for others.  And yes that's that's the bit that the machines are going to be people are starting to teach the machines to do that too.  There are you know new story writing robots and but that's that is a human feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean Kahneman talks about that we had Jonathan Heid on talking about that which is what we think of as reason.  Heid uses analogy that that reason is the driver of an elephant called intuition and reason only thinks it's telling the elephant where to go.  But much more often the elephant decides and then reason comes up with post talk as you say postdoc justifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I should say makes two arguments.  One is that science fiction which he loved and read as a child had to invent wormholes and because of the limitations of the human body and so on.  But he says when artificial intelligence becomes the being that is transmitted by radio waves across all these instances the limitations of the human body are meaningless.  The second is when he goes to Osama's laws said you fail at the first law because it gets good enough that you can't tell what's the robot versus what's the human.  And when it comes to say that you can't harm the human you don't know what the human is.  What does that even mean?  Yeah.  Right. And so as it goes back to this notion that we I started off with earlier about the EU and personhood for robots.  It dilutes humanity.  Right. It says oh yeah OK.  We're we're also rams.  We're also there.  But the intelligence is not human intelligence.  We had this argument with the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well even Schmidterhuber is kind of saying this.  I can't wait to retire.  He's essentially saying I can't wait to retire as a human and let the machines take over.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a grim future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not necessarily.  At least for humans.  I don't know.  I mean.  What if you look at it as humans do what we do best.  Presumably those things will make us happy and do what they do best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That area of expertise is rapidly shrinking.  Yeah.  Do we do best besides you know drink Slurpees and watch TV kill ourselves and kill and create technological means of self destruction.  Exactly.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like there's room for both.  Maybe maybe I'm a was a transhumanist post humanist.  I don't even know.  I mean I've read I've read thousands of science fiction stories.  Sure.  There we go.  Where humans and robots you know they're interchangeable almost.  And it's it's there's a lot of parallels there between rights for robots and rights for disenfranchised people.  Right.  I don't know.  I'm in since we haven't really met any self aware robots.  I'm kind of like yeah.  This is a debate that we can have then.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what's this Amazon Amazon prize that went out I think yesterday I did this on the rundown.  You see this.  Let's talk about offer a prize for being able to come up with a 20 minute it's it's it's touring test but it's the Jeff test.  I'm not here.  Bezos the Bezos test for conversations clearly taking echo to its next generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was this was this the two point five million dollar prize from a while back or is this someone do a lot of prizes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't know.  This must be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just saw coverage of it yesterday.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I just saw it going to the class scene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I keep on thinking that that that that the rational that the that that the test isn't necessarily human brain because the human brain will be exceeded.  It depends on what the task is.  If the task is to colonize the universe and not be limited by human bodies to what end I don't know.  But Professor Schmidt Schmidhuber proposes this then using our intelligence becomes rather meaningless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what is what is the role of human beings in the post AI future.  What do we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that's that's you.  Think about that is what are you good at.  What would you like to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like a cockroach saying you know thank God the humans one because now I could just skittle around and eat eat snacks because I mean really I guess you're right though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We won't care right.  We won't care.  We'll just we'll the robots will tell us what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't know why you guys have it like it doesn't have to be this negative.  Why don't you why don't you think of robots as something that I mean they could be programmed to be nurturing and help us.  And I mean like it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well here's the reason it's first of all the that we only program them initially at some point and this is what Schmidhuber is saying they take over both the manufacturer and the programming of themselves because they do it so much better and so much faster.  At which point we are now completely superfluous to the cycle.  I mean this is really sci-fi their children.  Well that's in fact it's funny you say that because Ray Kurzweil asked Ray Kurzweil that he said you don't have to worry about the machines because we're their parents so they will honor and revere us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well it depends on how you look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He must have had a nice dad is all I can say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well I've seen his daughter interview and that was interesting.  So did you see Maciej's talk stroke essay thing about this about super intelligence.  Maciej Cziklowski who runs Pinboard.  I just put the link in the chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love him.  I just really do.  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did see a link to it but I haven't read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I don't do it just by reading it here or playing the whole thing.  But his basic I said read it go and go and watch that after the show or watch the video because the video works too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's addressing a guy we interviewed on the triangulation Nick Bostrom and his book Super Intelligence and Bostrom is very afraid very afraid.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Maciej now has some an answer to that I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Carson I just emailed you a link to a Schmidt Huber video that I haven't watched yet but it looked enticing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So he has a series of different arguments about why AI isn't a threat to humanity.  And there's one that I like is the argument from my roommate and he says my roommate was the smartest person I ever met in my life.  He was incredibly brilliant and all he did was lie around and play World of Warcraft between bong rips.  The assumption that any intelligent agent will want to recursively self-improve let alone conquer the galaxy to better achieve its goals makes unwarranted assumptions about the nature of motivation.  So he's basically saying if we build human like intelligence we'll probably end up with a bunch of layabout computers that are trying to skywalk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is perfectly possible and AI won't do much of anything except use its powers of hyper persuasion to get us to bring it brownies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is this is this is it's well worth reading this or watching this.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maciej is brilliant guy.  That's really neat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So he made a video out of this.  He did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is originally a talk.  He has this way of presenting his talks that there's like a slide in a transcript like this.  So there's a link to the video at the top of the top of that page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  He did a webcam Zagreb.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you all read we talked we talked about the the Google AI Google Translate AI New York Times article about three weeks ago.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah this is where the Google Translate had created a kind of what an intermediate language that only it spoke.  It created it for the effect a new language that it could translate but we didn't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And part of what Schmidt-Huber said is basically that's like 10 year old technology.  It's just changing the translate right now.  But it took getting the speed and scale of computers to be able to handle the technology from 10 years ago.  So God knows what's happening in the labs now.  What's possible now.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's still hitting up actual like there's actual hardware.  We're still developing hardware that's going to be fast enough and good enough for real AI.  So you know don't worry just yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Part of the what's the so we as you guys was building your chips wasn't it.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact isn't that what Jeff Hawkins is up to at Numento.  We've also interviewed him.  He's an interesting fellow.  He was a creator of palm and graffiti and is took his billions and finally did what he wanted to do because he's a trained neuroscientist which is to create a chip company Numento that was designing chips that worked like the human mind massively parallel chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are lots of efforts right now to create the best chip for AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Google this has this tensor processing units that they've built into their data centers and they'll they'll rent you those as part of Google Cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one of the most amazing things.  Amazon's doing this too.  You can you can just use their research and their intelligence for your own stuff.  Yep.  That's that's where it's you know there the next generation of garage.  You know inventors aren't going to are going to be working with AI clearly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And there's all kinds of new tools and mechanisms.  We went through that video a few weeks ago from what Google enables you to do just using their their AI and they give it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They give you the TensorFlow and say your voice recognition and all that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Google has that with the TPUs plus GPUs.  Amazon has it with they have.  Oh what are they.  They didn't open source.  They.  I cannot remember.  Anyway they've got the elective back up for Alexa right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they also they have something else that I'm blanking on and then Intel bought a company called Nirvana that also offers everybody's doing everybody's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you heard of Mesosphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  MESO sphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes but that's a that's a distributed operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that what it is.  OK.  A guy named Florian Leibert I saw today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know Florian.  Sorry.  You know for a great guy.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love this gosh darn show because we get the smartest people on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so Mesosphere is part of you know how you've got big data.  Yeah.  And like rapid analytics they have something called the smack stack.  And Mesosphere is the M and the smack stack.  And I'm trying to remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cloud native tech hybrid cloud freedom.  Power Modem and applications cloud native data services.  But they have an AI thing as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are getting into that direction because you kind of have to.  But but it was essentially an operating system to manage highly distributed multiple data centers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how long Kevin before I have I've got a nice analogy.  How long before I have something the size of that box in my house that is my own personal AI.  Will that is that in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well the thing is I mean you need the big chips and the stuff to train that network.  So what are you doing in the cloud.  Once you've trained it you can have it.  Oh I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So training happens in the cloud but then you can you could put it in your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you see which is if you look at how the Google Translate stuff works it'll download it'll translate things to run locally that will run your phone and do trans offline translation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's classic machine intelligence where you have big data data sets you throw them in neural networks and over time it learns.  But you're saying once those once those patterns are learned you can then put them in a smaller device.  You don't need to continue to throw data at it.  And those are models.  Models.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love this.  I want this.  And even if we are going to end up being cockroaches in the general scheme of things I would love to have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The next thing you need is data.  Right.  You need you need large.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what's going on right now.  That's what Google's doing.  What do you think Google gives you free photo storage.  What do you think.  I mean this is Facebook Google Microsoft Apple.  All we're all doing this.  These it turns out these these phones that we have in our pockets are marvelous data collection entities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We argue didn't you argue once that data becomes the commoditized element as the analysis that because the value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  The insights become the value.  And the reason I say that is because you can do you can take the exact same data like let's say your Facebook.  You can take the exact same training data and the way you run that through how you tweak your algorithm is going to dictate.  So if you're if you're tweaking for recognition you're going to get one algorithm.  If you're tweaking for I don't know likes you'll get another Facebook's a terrible example.  So it's what people don't seem to realize is it's important to have data.  But the harder part is figuring out how to tweak the algorithm to get what you want from that data.  If that makes sense.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's so you need the data but you also need often you need it to be labeled as well that they're doing some networks that will also extract things.  But a lot of these things you often need to have either part of the language translation in parallel texts for image recognition you need labeled images that you know which ones have dogs in or whatever.  And you could you could they're starting to do more where it will automatically extract features and common things it sees.  But so that's what those are mapping those something else is still more work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that's not quite true.  So I mean one of the big breakthroughs with you know CNN's convolutional neural nets or whatever is that they can actually find they can actually start to decipher things without having labeled data.  That's like really exciting.  That's that's the oh what's the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do they do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They look for.  They look for higher order structures.  There's a good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they still need data to do that though right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  A bunch of just not as much data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well in the same way that children learn to see by looking at the world a lot and realizing that there are some things that are there persistently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought that I thought that was how these neural networks work as well.  Isn't that the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to optimize for a feature that you want it and when you see it doing something that you you reward it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I the other day I was just kind of blown away.  I use Google Photos.  It's easy and it's it would seem not so difficult if I typed in Paris to figure out which photos are of Paris because landmarks etc.  And it wouldn't be so hard if I typed in Burmese Mountain Dog to find a Burmese Mountain Dog.  But but I thought about this.  I can type in dogs and Google Photos will see dogs of a variety of breeds that I mean if you think about it a Burmese Mountain Dog is completely different than the choice.  How does Google Photos know that they're both dogs.  That's pretty I mean maybe I'm missing something but that's pretty darn impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not that the high order and say a dog has these characteristics but then go to the lower order of saying this is a Dachshund.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well notice there are some cat pictures in amongst my dog pictures.  But look here's even a metal dog a dog statue that's in there it clearly knows here's dogs.  Here's a bulldog.  Here's my my papillon.  Here's a cat but it's predominantly dog.  Well here's a llama but it's but it's predominantly dogs.  Here's a gorilla.  I don't know how that got in there but so some.  So but it's doing a surprisingly good job.  I guess that's my point in figuring out what makes a dog a dog.  It's more than four legs and you know ears eyes and the nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And key to all of this is forgiving imperfection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How does it know how did it know for instance that this was a picture of a dog.  I mean that is as undoggy as I mean it's he's looking over his shoulder.  It's not the whole body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I've to say that's your way.  That's that's the I mean that's the out.  They've they've trained the model and tweaked for in the computer in this case picks what it focuses on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So or in some models but it got these by there's my sweet doggy Ozzy.  They got these.  I know I know he fought a long hard battle but we decided that it should come to the its conclusion last week.  He's a sweetheart.  That's why I was searching for dogs.  I want to pictures of Ozzy.  It doesn't know yet to search by dog name.  That was that would scare me.  Here's here's I think the final this was the final blow for Ozzy was when we forced him to wear the Santa suit.  That was that was he said I'm not this I'm leaving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Goodbye Ozzy was the get along dog of get along.  He was a get along dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh I miss him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway I didn't want to bring that up but sorry.  No no no no.  I'm you know I just try I try not to cry.  So anyway that's so that's an example of the kind of apps level of abstraction Google's already doing and doing it thanks to the fact that we're all giving it so much data.  And I think that's so here's my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the cost of training.  Nobody ever talks about that.  How much manual and human effort you have to have to train that system to know all those dogs.  Is that a high cost or low cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's computing power like like your man Juergen said this has been research that's been available for a while.  Like image recognition for example they came up like Jeff Hinton came up with the algorithms like I want to say like over a decade ago but it wasn't told or even longer actually 20 years ago.  But it wasn't until like 2012 that he had the compute power to actually make it powerful enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Same thing with self driving cars and a whole bunch of stuff right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If I search for cat I get a lot of my dogs as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah cats and dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look I didn't say it was perfect.  But I'm just impressed that it could be a variety of dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No you have that you're not so you're you're you're finding you don't get as many false positives.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's gotten better and better too by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah but so much of this is acceptance of of of approximation.  So I last week I was at an event at Lufthansa speaking before the CEO Karsten Spohr and he got up and talked about how he's very happy that computers on airplanes are 20 years old because they work because the phone is too unreliable.  20 years is good for some things.  He sounds like Steve Gibson.  Yeah.  But for for finding out whether it's a dog or a cat there's no mission critical issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We used to say that about voice.  Remember how we like cell phones used to a suck but be we're like oh I could never talk to someone on a cell phone.  It's too unreliable where my five nines but everything gets more reliable over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  This is a good conversation a conversation.  I suspect we will be having over and over again in a more refined fashion over the next decade until finally we can retire and let the machines take over the show.  And and you know by then they'll have enough.  How many hours of footage Patrick Delahannay figured it out.  Many tens of thousands of hours of footage of of of all of me particularly but of all of you too now.  Congratulations.  We'll make it possible for us to do this show without our intervention.  We could sit back make brownies for the robots.  Because they will be wanting those brownies.  Our show today.  Taking a break.  Our show today brought to you by Casper mattresses an online retailer of premium mattresses made in the US of a for a fraction of the price because you're buying directly from the factory.  Casper is revolutionizing the mattress industry cutting out the middleman the resellers the showrooms and that means you save your effectively you're buying at the same price the showroom does which is a lot less than you've been paying for.  Now you may say but I need the showroom Leo I need to lie on a mattress before I buy it.  Well how about if you lie on it for 100 nights first.  Yes you can return your Casper mattress anytime in the first hundred nights and you'll get every penny back.  Come and get the mattress you don't have to pack it back up and whisk it away and they will return you every cent.  You're not going to want to return it though.  You're going to love this obsessively engineered mattress.  Supportive memory foams for a sleep surface with precisely the right sink just the right bounce and it's breathable so it sleeps cool fresh.  So it one of the things you don't get too hot or too cold throughout the night.  It's it's it's really these are the it's interesting I love this page on the Casper site.  These are the six things they did hundreds of prototypes to test firmness density rebound speed airflow transition temperature and the ability to do that.  So transition temperatures odor too because you want a mattress to smell clean and fresh the Casper mattress straight out of the box.  I was waiting because I thought you know maybe.  No doesn't smell like the factory smells like fresh air.  So free delivery to US and Canada and a surprisingly compact box which is also good.  We sent this to my son when he was a freshman he's a senior now.  Actually I think he was a sophomore and because he gets tired of the mattress at the dorm and we sent him a Casper mattress and he was able to because it's a box to just to bring it upstairs.  He's on the third floor cut open the box.  The mattress is there.  He loves it.  Statistically lying on a bed in a showroom has no correlation to whether the bed is right for you.  Why don't you try it in your house in your own environment using it the way you would use it.  Free shipping and returns at the Casper mattress.  And by the way you could save an additional $50 toward off the really low price already towards any mattress purchase when you go to Casper C A S P E R dot com slash twig use the promo code twig.  We thank you so much for giving me a good night's sleep and my son and our guest room and our nephew.  But we never I never I maybe I feel bad I never did get Ozzy that Casper dog bed they have dog beds too.  I never did get him that maybe.  I'm sorry we did this to you.  Why did you bring that up.  No it's OK.  You know what this is what happens sometimes I was talking to our neighbor had a very similar situation and now our good friend FN done Jason Clancy's he just had to put his dog down same very similar situation you know.  That's the problem when you when you get a pet they you outlive them in the best case anyway.  You don't want them to outlive you.  You know I knew a brilliant brilliant blind man who had went through two CNN dogs and he said I couldn't I can't do it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't I can't I can't give up this relationship I have so he gave up his dog.  It's hard.  You really do fall in love with your pet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you do did you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh let's see lots of little things here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I only have a little can I ask what is on your desk it looks like a raccoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh that's my new little friend.  It is a raccoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been looking at that and like what is what is under Leo's computer there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah there's a little a little raccoon he there's a long story about this raccoon which goes back to Kevin Rose and the famous raccoon throwing incident of 1987.  Now when was that was 2007 probably 2008.  No maybe even soon.  More recently and then ever since Patrick Delahanty has managed to sneak this this little raccoon into many of the shots on our show.  And I noted the raccoon was back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK yeah I have never seen the raccoon before.  Don't you like it.  I do I love it.  I think raccoons are great.  He's a little chill.  He's very chill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doesn't do much just relaxing on the surface studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You keep that Windows Windows screen longer than most things you keep.  Oh I can't give this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to see this on my desk for a long time.  This is just great.  It's a very limited.  You know I don't think everybody would benefit from this.  It shouldn't be.  It's not a general purpose computer for most people.  It could turn into an all in one right.  But but really for me the great use is the at 20 degrees using this for our show.  It's out of my way.  It doesn't block my shot.  And I have this nice big thing and you probably noticed I'll tell a straight.  I'll zoom in on a story and all of that like this story which I'm very excited about.  I'm wearing my my Moto 360 which has been discontinued.  I love my Moto 360 but Google is doing Android Wear 2.0.  And according to Evan Blass, EvLeaks, it's coming soon.  February 9th.  It will include a digital crown.  Now this is a mock up.  So don't look at this picture.  This is from Android police the mock up.  But venture beat has also a story that says that at the same time as Android Wear 2.0 comes out.  February 9th Google will announce a or launch a new smartwatch which I will be quick to get.  I've been very happy with the pixel.  It really is a great.  It's a phone that really grows on you.  And when I wear the Android watch it's a nice pair.  Blass says the pixel branded watches will be made by LG.  Oh they're not going to be pixel.  I'm sorry.  They will be granted the LG watch sport and the LG watch style.  LG has been making Android Wear 1.0 watches.  In fact I have one of their watches.  It's a little big.  Blass says that the Android police render is very close.  The larger sport watch 14.2 millimeters thick.  480 by 40 circular P OLED display.  768 megs of RAM.  Four gigs of storage.  420 milliamp hour battery.  And a waterproof rating of IP68.  Plus heart rate sensor.  Wi-Fi. Bluetooth.  This is the one that's interesting.  3G and LTE data.  So it will have its own data.  It won't have to be tied to the phone.  GPS will be built in.  And NFC which confirms kind of the other rumor that Android Pay would come to the watch.  Just as Apple Watch has Apple Pay using NFC.  Smaller watch will be a little thinner, a little lighter, a little smaller.  Smaller battery.  Worse IP67 rating.  And will lack the cellular GPS, NFC and heart rate monitor.  So you can get a thin small watch or a big watch with all the features.  Both will have a digital crown.  So right now there is a crown on the Android Wear watch but it's just a button.  A crown implies that you could twirl it.  And that's what you can do on the Apple Watch.  And apparently that's what Android Wear 2.0 is going to have.  A crown that you can turn to navigate.  And there isn't really any navigation in Android Wear.  They're just swiping right now.  All you can do is swipe.  So navigation would give you more capability.  I have to say that's at your peril.  One of the flaws with the Apple Watch is that it is very confusing.  It's got a button.  It's got a crown that you could twirl.  And a crown you can push.  Plus it's got force touch.  Plus it's got swiping.  So it's kind of overloaded with capabilities.  And I have to say I like the Android Wear watch because it's a lot simpler.  In fact you don't even need to touch it to do most of the functions.  Because you can flick your wrist to get the notifications to pop up.  But it's not as capable.  So, February 9th.  And Ron Amadio who wrote this article for Ars Technica says,  I expect Google to have an event around it.  I will buy one immediately.  I like it.  I'm not a big...  Is there a price?  No.  It hasn't launched yet.  If you...  The Apple Watch Series 1 is now down to 250 bucks.  350 for the Series 2 is the least expensive.  And of course you could spend a lot more.  I would guess that Google, anything like that, would be in the...  I would guess the $300 range.  But I might be wrong.  It would be nice to see it down below 200.  They'd sell a lot of them at that price.  I don't think they can make them at that price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, they said the big one had GPS and 3G.  Yeah, and LTE.  Yeah, that's 300.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much is Samsung?  Samsung has a watch with similar capability.  Actually, pretty nice watch, those two watches.  Those are around that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were giving them away free with your return.  Your Note 7?  Note 7.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way...  Hey, Stacey, did your parents ever return theirs?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's a good thing because Verizon is now turning off the ability to make calls  with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, they're being slowly...  They realized that they were hanging on too long.  But they did manage to get quite a few tweaks and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're at 97%, 98% now returned.  I think the rest of them are in drawers somewhere.  People forgot they bought them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or they're sold from Tunisia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, also, FAA has now stopped requiring airlines to make announcements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, it's getting a little annoying.  This is the Samsung Gear S3, the latest one from Samsung.  I think that's a pretty good looking watch.  No longer requires having a Samsung phone either.  It works with other Android devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't know that.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they use the crown as a UI thing.  I feel like people...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you just...  Bezel, I mean.  You got to pick what you want to do on your wrist.  You know, it's kind of like...  People are like, I need this functionality and this and this and this.  And I'm like, God, guys, it's a watch.  It's not a smartphone.  And I just feel like people just want too much, I guess.  I'm constantly amazed at complaints I see about different smartwatches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some of this is also the companies trying to figure out what works.  I mean, this category has not taken off.  And they're just experimenting at this point to try to figure out what is it people want on their wrists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've kind of sort of absorbed adjacent categories.  So the Apple one is basically mostly health tracking, and they've been amplifying that a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Apple decided this is the sweet spot for them is health.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that basically means they've gone after Fitbit and all the other ones that were like that.  And basically eaten the high end of that market as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a list of phones that will work with the S3.  And it's quite long.  HTC, Huawei, Lenovo, LG, Motorola, Oppo, Pantech, Sharp, Sony, Vivo, Xiaomi, Shikir, Serenity, Asus.  No Google phones on that list, though.  No way.  Wow.  Yeah, I'm disappointed that the Pixel's not on that list.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How long has the watch, has the Google watch been out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Feels like two years.  When did Android wear it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a $350 device that basically is completely obsolete now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and we know it wasn't a big seller because Motorola, which made the best one, the Moto 360.  That's what I'm wearing has gotten out of the business.  They say we're not going to make any more of those.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When did Android wear a watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I broke, I stopped wearing a watch, which most young hip people just carry their phones.  I still miss my watch.  So I'm waiting to get a new one.  I'll get this.  It's a Mr. Schmuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should get a different one from Leo, so that way we can talk about the differences, the pros and cons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fight over it.  OK.  So it's coming out for three years.  It was 2014.  Is it that long?  Oh, thanks.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Apparently, we are preparing for payments through Google Assistant as well.  So your watch will be able to pay things.  But according to 9to5, Google, Ben Schoon, an APK actually comes from an APK teardown by XDA developers.  The latest version of the Google app contains strings of code, which hint at payments coming to the service soon.  So you might be able to say, hey, Google, send Stacey a hundred dollars.  That would be great.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can do that with Venmo.  You could Venmo be linked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I talk to Venmo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, because that would be really like if my friend came over, they'd be like, hey, Google, send this on, you know, send me a hundred bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the risk, isn't it, of giving you voice activated payments?  Indeed.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd want some more authentication there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know what Apple does that solves the problem is you have to authenticate the watch through the phone or use a code.  And then if you take the watch off, if it breaks its connection with your wrist, it stops.  The authentication is undone and you have to re-authenticate while it's on your wrist again, which is a very smart way to do that, I think.  The watch itself has to be on your wrist and authenticated while it's on your wrist for it to be used for payments.  Google is about to buy fabric.  They've got weave.  This is actually a Twitter.  They have thread and weave.  Now they have fabric.  I think Google's turning into a textile manufacturer.  This is a Twitter tool for developers to make mobile apps.  Obviously Twitter doesn't need that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They also get Crashlytics and the rest of those tool sets as well.  Interesting.  And they're going to fit that into the Google Develop platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Twitter's really stripping down for speed.  Really, at some point, I think you just delete all the accounts except real Donald Trump and you're golden.  Just make it a megaphone for...  By the way, at noon Eastern on Friday, AtPOTUS will be renamed AtPOTUS 44 and locked and will be handed over.  The keys to the account will be handed over to President Trump.  Trump says he's going to continue to prefer real Donald Trump.  He's already got what 22 million people following him there.  But I imagine POTUS will be used for something.  The official president of the United States Twitter account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe that'll be the one his staff tweet on.  It'll be the staff tweet.  Whether it's Android or Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Since the election, there have been a couple of staff tweets, but almost all the tweets have been Donald Trump tweets, right?  That's become his own personal bully pulpit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he said he said that he dictates a lot of them in any case.  He also said that he doesn't like tweeting, which I don't believe for a second.  He just does it because the lying media is after him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, every president, starting with FDR and the fireside chats, has looked for a way to disintermediate, to go directly to the voter.  That's a valuable tool for him.  It also, I think, fits his style because it's brief.  Although Trump, for some reason, thought there was a 280 word limit.  Obviously, it's 140 words, but he said in an interview, characters.  He said in an interview, I have 280 characters.  So maybe that does kind of argue that he does dictate it, that he doesn't know how long.  In fact, lately, his tweets have been spanning, haven't they?  Instead of being a single tweet.  But it also fits his style.  It's a short, sweet to the point.  I mean, if ever there was anybody made for Twitter or never a service made for a guy, it's Trump and Twitter.  They go together like soup and sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No comment.  Wow.  I am too press, too mechanized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, let's go somewhere else.  I can't do it.  Even I can't do it.  Can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Plus is back, baby.  I am so glad to say to report that Google is pouring energy and effort.  Engineers are working on Google Plus.  Comment filters.  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Events are back.  Is it bizarro, Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what's going on.  Comment filters needed to be there.  Now you have, besides reporting abuse, you can, by default, low quality, whatever that is, low quality comments are hidden by default.  But you can, as the poster, see what was hidden and unhide.  That's a good thing if they do it well.  That would help with spam, right?  Comment spam has become just a real bane of Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Events are back.  Because nobody's there.  I was going to say, in the vacuum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's now a ghost home.  It's not a ghost town.  I visit it all the time.  And the few last remained, okay, is a ghost town.  But there are a few people still wandering among the facades and the muddy streets posting.  And those few people, some of them are quite good.  The tumbleweeds.  Lauren Weinstein still posts, right?  He's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love his stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say it's been going on for about a year that Google Plus has for some reason surfaced as, and I wish I could turn this off and tell me if I can, you know,  recommended for you a lot of arch right wing, you know, racist hate speech posts, which don't have a lot of likes or comments.  So I'm not sure how the algorithm is working.  But, you know, maybe you're recommending those to me because you think I'm so much of a lefty.  I should read more of those.  I don't know.  But it could stop doing that now.  But see, look, look, there's some good posters.  Casey McKinnon, Alex Steen.  There's some humor.  I don't know what's humorous about Two Found Dead.  But, oh, I get it.  I get it.  Two Dead.  You'll like this.  You can add this to your standup gallery.  Jeff Jarvis.  Two Dead.  Found Dead.  Thank God.  That's a relief.  Also, if you liked the old way of doing things on Google Plus, you know, the classic, say bye bye to your little friend that's going away as well.  So they're doing I want them to keep this alive.  This may be the last place that Donald Trump hasn't discovered.  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no.  He can't figure out Snapchat, I guarantee you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'd love to see some snaps from the Oval Office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oval Office or one of Trump's gilded palaces?  Either would be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  St. Petersburg Palace, yeah.  What did Putin say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have better prostitutes in the West.  What did he say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What did he say?  He did.  It was the strangest thing ever.  Putin denying the dossier and saying, but we do have the best prostitutes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  What is going on?  Am I?  Maybe I'm in my dotage and I just don't know it.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, then I'm there too, because yeah, I was like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but see, but you're a figment of my imagination, Stacey.  So that doesn't help.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to point us to the story about a new wake word for the Amazon Echo.  Oh, please.  I haven't seen this on mine and I'm actually curious if any of you guys have seen it.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is the new wake word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The story is that Amazon Echo and Amazon Dot added computer as a wake word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good wake word.  Hey, computer.  Let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're saying that.  Can I get it in my?  I'm looking in my Echo app, which is not called the Echo app, as you know, but we're not supposed to use the A word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, don't use the A word.  So it's under settings.  Click your particular device and you'll be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I would.  I would do that because then it'd be like Star Trek.  That's exactly what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When does the wearable Echo shaped like a knee knee come?  Like a what?  That's what that's what would shape like the thing on your communicator that you tap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I heard it.  I heard it.  I heard a shape like a weenie come in.  I'm like, what?  What is wrong with you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My wake words are still the two A words in Echo, not not computer.  But that would be nice.  Computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I would be excited.  I've ever listened to shows nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Computer would not be a good trigger word in this context.  You probably should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Los Angeles has a an Echo skill.  Speaking of one of the first major cities with its own skill, the city of Los Angeles  Echo skill launched last month with basic information about holiday events around L.A.  Next month, it will include information about reading times at local libraries.  Hey, Echo, is the local library open for reading information about city council members?  Hey, Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know I'm not going to go on with that one.  And upcoming council sessions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it would be needed.  What if you could do so they're talking about 311 services.  It'd be awesome if I if you could say, hey, Echo, I'd like to report a pothole.  Yes.  You could have a conversational interface.  Yes.  Whenever I want to report a pothole or figure something out, it's not a recording thing.  It's basically like you have to wait online forever on the phone forever.  That'd be terrible.  That's a phone like thing because then you can actually be where the pothole is and have the GPS coordinates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whereas the next thing you have to say, it's somewhere down the street on the corner of this street.  Well, Waze is very good at that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, if you're if you're a serious Wazer.  Yeah, you know what drives me nuts, the Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  Is that five by it's in the middle of winter in New Jersey.  So five miles from now, there's a pothole.  No poop.  Of course, there is.  It's New Jersey in the winter.  Yeah, yeah.  Try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you narrow it down a little driven on some roads where some some bozo no life has gone through and reported every single bottle.  So it's telling me every damn bottle.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why is it that the only the and it was a one brief shining moment, the Motorola, the Moto X allowed you to have any wake phrase you wanted.  And nobody else has done that since then.  It can't be that hard if the Moto X did it.  Why do we have to be stuck with those three?  Can't we just I mean, there's enough horsepower in that thing that it could record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Charlie Kindle came on actually my podcast and we talked about that because it's like probably the third most common question I get about the invent the Kindle.  Sorry.  No, he did not.  His name is spelled, quote, the wrong way for Amazon is Kindle.  So he said he tried to get Jeff to change it.  But no, he says that it's actually very hard to get it to you have to train the computer to only hear that word.  They're looking for a certain combination of things that don't occur naturally or as naturally.  They apparently also looked at like how often people's how common a name the name is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that is that if they could let you customize it, they wouldn't have to worry about that because I know what's common in my life.  And if I have a kid named Ale X, a that's a very poor choice.  And if I happen to have kids named Ale X, a echo and Amazon, I'd be in deep trouble.  I wouldn't have it. But on my Moto X, I used to my trigger was I swear to God and it worked great.  Help me Obi Wan Kenobi.  That is not a phrase that came up a lot in my life.  And it was a perfect trigger phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me give you have you heard about the Watson Conference Call app on GitHub?  No.  So I heard about this the first time.  So somebody used the API and they wrote an app so that you put it on for your conference call and it listens for your name.  Yeah.  Jeff Jeff.  And it wakes you up.  And then what it does.  Yeah. Then it sends you a text to say you got and then what it does is it waits.  It's sort of about time. Then it comes back in and says, oh, sorry, was on mute.  And you have 32 seconds to respond.  It gives you and it gives you the prior two sentences to your name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This guy works for Splunk.  He lives in Shanghai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your name as a trigger.  Josh Nulin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The software is called.  Say what?  It's a Python script that runs when the meeting begins and the computer microphone listens in the background and the OMG.  Now, why?  Why he admits this?  Well, he works for Splunk, which is an AI company.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that?  That.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Splunk.  What about this?  I'm going to talk.  Let's get some conspiracy theories going because, you know, there's a podcast isn't a podcast without a few good conspiracy theories.  Amazon has sought permission from the state of Washington to run mystery wireless tests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yes, I was going to look at see in rural Washington and Seattle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't say what the test would be before, but the filing hints a new type of technology or wireless service.  The project would involve prototypes designed to support, quote, innovative communications capabilities and functionalities.  Maybe the woods will be listening.  You'll be able to say, hey, echo in the woods.  The test could involve maybe some kind of communication system to control delivery drones.  It is the same.  It's the Amazon listed Neil Woodward is the main contact and he's a retired astronaut who joined Amazon in 2008 and a senior manager for Prime Air.  The team in charge of the wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's so cool.  But Bezos hired an astronaut.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Tell me the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell me the frequencies again, because I'm on the spectrum.  OK.  I used to have frequencies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot in the 700 megahertz band and the 800 then 1800 and 90 downlink, 1900 and 2100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's sprint.  That's mobile phones.  OK, so that's it's for mobile phones, fixed wireless or broadcast.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boy, you're good.  Boy, you're good.  And I'm glad we hired this woman.  She's just.  What an asset you are.  You even like just know things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you.  I mean, that's that's so that's what the U.S.  government says you can do in those bands.  Let's look at 1900.  You said 1900.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's for OK.  So there's two bands.  There's the bass and downlink band.  That'll be 1930 to 1990.  And then the mobile uplink band 1920 to 1980.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, those are again fixed in mobile.  I think I feel like it's a lot of that.  Yeah.  So that's what this isn't.  But it's not something like there's some for satellite bands, for example, which then you  might be like, oh, look, they're going to use satellite broadband.  So this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is under the FCC's experimental authority, and that's why those frequencies, low power  temporary fixed base transmitters and associated mobile units indoors at and near its company  facilities in Seattle.  Those facilities, by the way, are in the back of a retail mall featuring a hobby lobby store  and a walk king restaurant.  If you really want to start a conspiracy theory, I think the hobby lobby has is up to something.  No, I'm just kidding.  Obviously.  Hmm.  You know, this is probably a non story, but I just like it.  I just like it.  I like to imply that Amazon is up to secret interesting stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they I mean, you could do some cool stuff with this.  The spectrum, especially at the lower end, is actually really good spectrum.  Yeah, no, it's yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the stuff that goes through walls.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it goes through walls.  So it doesn't feel like like I would be like, oh, maybe they're doing something crazy in their warehouses.  But this feels like something that could be.  I think it's.  Oh, it's for that floating drone.  It's drone control warehouse sky.  And remember how they had the patent for the warehouse in the sky?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would make sense if they were testing drone delivery, but in the woods, I guess.  But I mean, it would make sense that you would have to have something that would go from the warehouse to the drone.  Anyway, who is it that's test is a grub hub.  One of the food delivery services is testing a little robots that go around street on the street delivering food.  Yeah.  How long before somebody says, oh, there's food in those things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So my friend Bill Gross is here with me.  Did you see? So he said he saw a UPS kind of truck was shown at I think CES where the truck drives to a neighborhood.  And then in the truck is all a bunch of drones and the drones go out from there.  And then the truck goes to the next stop in the neighborhood.  So it's kind of Postmates.  Last mile by drone.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is Bill there? Say hi to Bill.  Love Bill.  He is here.  We were just talking about X1 the other day with Jordan Rittner.  Love Bill.  Yep.  Bill is the greatest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely greatest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fleet of delivery robots roll out in D.C.  This is a partnership with the Postmates and Starship Technologies.  The food at this point, a Postmates employee walks behind the drone.  The drones are like little vans controlled by a remote pilot.  They travel on sidewalks to within a two mile radius at about four miles an hour, which is kind of fast, can carry up to a 40 pound delivery.  You would not want to get hit in the shins by a four mile an hour robot carrying 40 pounds of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I imagine it's got sensors that would make it stop.  I hope so.  But you could have so much fun messing with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could be like, well, you push a button on the back and opens up and there's your food.  I mean, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This I mean, this may something like this seems really cool for you somewhere, but this is probably not the right city.  Not in a city.  I feel like Wired did a story like a year ago about those similar types of drones wandering through hospitals.  I think it was dispensing.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's that's actually being used right now.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  And there's a hotel in San Francisco.  There's a couple of hotels that use robots to like you forget your toothbrush, you call down and a robot comes to your door with a toothbrush.  That's awesome.  Those are but those environments are much more constrained.  The robot knows how to go up and down the elevator and go down a hall and stuff like that.  And then you can get greeted by a robot at the W in San Francisco.  But he but it doesn't move.  Well, you saw that at CES.  You were talking about that, right?  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wasn't talking about that, but I have seen it.  I was going to say it's not as cool as the Japanese robot with the dinosaur wearing the fez because that thing is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why don't all robots look like dinosaurs wearing fez?  I don't know.  What is the plural of fez?  Is it fez?  Fez?  Fez?  Fez?  Fez?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin's like, I'll just tell you, dumb Americans.  I'm Americans don't know a thing, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know what is in the original Arabic, but definitely is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  When we come back, Samsung says that the problem with the battery in the Note 7 was the battery.  So that's very informative.  Actually, on the 23rd, they will release their detailed findings.  But they are saying now the battery was the main cause of the Note 7 battery fire.  Don't blame anybody else.  And what's going on with Samsung?  Isn't the CEO now wanted?  A wanted man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The heir apparent?  I think it's the heir apparent.  Oh, it's the son?  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the court, I think, blocked it for now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think, last I saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jay Y. Lee and the Samsung court has rejected arrest of the Samsung heir for bribery, perjury,  and embezzlement.  So he can continue.  He's the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics.  And they say the Bloomberg says the de facto head of Samsung Group.  His grandfather founded it.  Let us take a break and talk about something that you know very well, Stacey.  You use it all the time.  Food, glorious food, hot cupcakes and mustard.  It is no, it is the euro.  And I've got.  Oh, yeah, here it is.  I got three of them right here in my hands.  The euro is a better Wi-Fi.  It's not just a Wi-Fi router.  It's a Wi-Fi system that blankets your whole home in fast, reliable Wi-Fi.  No buffering, no dead zones.  Wi-Fi that works.  And it's enterprise grade Wi-Fi.  Now with the next generation of mesh technology, they've updated.  One of the things I love about euro that you can't say about most routers out there is it's getting firmware  updates on a regular basis.  You don't even have to do anything.  They push the firmware updates.  I just got two point one on my euro, which adds true mesh, which makes it possible for euro to use the fastest,  most reliable path for Wi-Fi automatically.  You don't have to do anything.  It adapts to network demand, your home's layout.  So the way it works, you put the euro app on your phone.  You install the first euro.  It's got two ethernet ports, one to connect to your cable modem or your DSL modem or the internet.  The other one you can use to and I do on a 24 port switch.  You can you can use you don't have to have 24 points, but I have a lot of stuff you could connect to a switch for  wired connections.  It is a really cool device.  Then once you got that up and running, you go to the where are you having bad Wi-Fi?  You go and you go and you place the second or third euro where you're having bad Wi-Fi and the app will help you  place it properly.  And you're just slowly spreading the Wi-Fi throughout the house.  This new true mesh makes the system even more expandable.  So you can go well beyond three.  I have five cover the largest homes, the most complex layouts and two times the land speed between euros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now they want you want a pro tip.  Yeah, pro tip even better.  Euro pro tip.  Euro pro tip.  They have an echo skill and you can actually tell the echo to turn off the light, the LED light on certain.  I love your routers.  Turn off the light.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can also they also know this is really interesting.  Your phone pairs to a particular euro or your device.  So you can you can ask Echo where's my phone and it'll say well it's paired to the dining room.  So you can kind of know.  Oh good.  Well at least I know it's in that area.  And the thing we use all the time with the euro euro is actually kind of cool that you can reserve IP addresses.  You can do port forwarding but you can also see all the connected devices wired and unwired and assign them to a household  member.  So we went through and assigned our 14 year old's iPad iPhone computer Xbox.  We said these are all Michael's.  And now I can tell Echo Echo pause Michael's Internet and his and all of a sudden he's offline and has to go to bed or come to  dinner.  And by the way no he can't say echo unpause Michael's Internet.  You have to do that in the app which is password protected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I this is such a great solution and so much better than the old school Wi Fi router.  If you're suffering with bad Wi Fi go to E E R O dot com and get free shipping if you're in a hurry which you ought to be if  you're suffering get this end the suffering faster with free overnight shipping when you use the offer code twig.  So go to euro dot com order euro you get one you can get two you can get three you can get more.  In fact I would start with three probably in most homes and then expand beyond that if you have if you know you're spread out  more and and when you use the offer code twig after ordering select overnight shipping it use the offer code twig and they'll  that'll be zero cost to you.  I said I told you before I set it up at my mom's house because she couldn't she has a studio out back where she weaves and does  art and she stopped using it because she couldn't get her iPad wouldn't work out there was too far away.  So when I went out there after Christmas I brought a set of euros put one next to the router which is in her office one in the  kitchen and then one in the studio actually put another one in the back room I think I added one more and man it's great.  She's she's loving it.  I also gave her an echo out in the studio so she's super happy now she can listen to classical music and knit.  That's wonderful. E E R O dot com.  Don't forget the offer code twig for free overnight shipping.  January 23rd.  Samsung just announced just moments ago.  It will we will find out that we'll see the full report on what went wrong with the Note 7.  They do say something was with the battery.  We have a lot of theories we've talked a lot about this what it could be.  And of course the Note 7 has been fully recalled.  Samsung will probably host a conference call.  I doubt they'll do a live event.  Of course there will be an apology and the main thing they've got to do at this point is explain why they how they know it's happening and why it's  never going to happen again.  We shall see lots of theories about why it happened.  Generally thought that the company tried to put too much battery in too small a case that the pressure exerted on the battery caused it to leak.  And the leaks got plated and eventually short circuited.  And caused the fire and that would make sense.  But you know only Samsung really knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Just leaving.  I got my hat on.  You're Davos I've got to get out of here hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Jeff Jarvis from Davos.  Been great having you.  You led a panel.  I got to catch my bus.  Go catch the go catch the bus.  I catch the bus.  Just so I know is Bono there this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No Will I am.  OK.  And Shakir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shakir is the new Bono.  Yeah.  Hips don't lie.  Have a great day.  Great night.  Sarah Gay for the first time in years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh nice.  So how much longer.  Till Friday night and then I fly back Saturday.  And then I go to Tokyo and I'll call in early next whatever it is Thursday morning or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.  You are crazy.  So you're going to be there during the inauguration.  Are they going to have a big screen and everybody's going to gather around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm glad to be out of the country and you know I went to the mall and I'm going to take this off.  Hold on.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's very hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I went to the mall and I should have brought it today for proper purposes but it'll piss  off your audience.  I got a hat made a black hat that just says resist.  Oh I saw that.  I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  What is the general tenor there?  I mean is it concern is it.  Is it.  I mean what's what is the general gap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's it's it's a lot of concern and I would say that that that that you know I can make  Trump jokes in any room here because these are not Trump fans.  So the lower they're very quiet about it.  So this is the elite versus the populace the populace ain't here.  But somewhere there's a populace problems.  Yeah.  But it ain't here.  No no.  If one of the great lines when Edelman did his trust barometer they had a panel discussion  and a banker from Deutsche Bank set up there to the whole assembled room of executives  from all over.  He said you're all bankers now which is to say nobody trusts any of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very interesting because I mean it could be very good for especially for the Davos  crowd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No because this is a crowd that believes strongly in free trade and globalization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah that's probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's a crowd that believes strongly in things like NATO and the United Nations.  Oh yeah that.  Never mind.  And this is a crowd that believes strongly in technology.  Yeah.  So no no.  Yeah well they make some more money and be able to hand it off to their kids easier.  Yeah.  But I think beyond that no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I'm thrilled about that.  My my tax rates going to plummet.  So I couldn't be happier.  You just disappoint.  And I got my and I think and I got my health care locked in so screw you guys.  Anyway have have fun on Friday and for the rest of the weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We really were glad to leave you early but I'm going to go and get the bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thanks.  The bikes.  I can only imagine that Jeff is in the lower tier where the dorms are way out in the outskirts

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of the world.  There's another.  I am in the farthest reach of Davos but there's another town called Closters which is far  away.  I'm very lucky very grateful not to be there.  So no it's an easy bus ride for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Closters is where all the hot shots stay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If they have cars that drive them in some some of the people yes have cars that they  have on call all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't.  Those black cars all kind of clusters.  Thank you Jeff.  Have a good night.  All right.  Thanks for being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We really appreciate it.  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nope.  Good.  That Mike.  That's why we sent you that Mike.  That Mike is amazing rejection of background noise.  Aha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought it was.  Mine is more of an omni Mike which is where you get such.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what we should really send Kevin except this Mike does not do well in the in the elements.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin we need to get you a studio.  That's what we need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  A dog free studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh you know I put a story on the list.  I should have brought it up when Jeff was here but Kevin is here because this feels like a Jeff and Kevin trifecta kind of story which is why I put it on there.  And for those of you guys who feel like there's not enough Google angle it involves the Android Play Store.  So it's all the way down at the bottom.  It's from the New York Times.  It's Farhad Manju's column about the new censorship thanks to tech which is rejecting app stores.  So China shutting down Apple or forcing Apple to take the New York Times app off of its app stores and basically not just the way not just the New York Times but Pokemon Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yes yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm like oh the freedom of information but more people are probably like I want to play Pokemon Go.  Weird.  The article does go into the idea of how we've stopped with like a decentralized web and I actually got into a conversation with someone today related to IOT and how we're kind of replicating the thin client brain in the cloud model with IOT.  And we really need to move towards a distributed decentralized model for all kinds of reasons resiliency being one of them.  So I was like that's a good topic for you guys.  Yeah.  I don't know.  So Kevin this is this is your thing.  So I'm very curious like how do we make the open web a viable business model and attractive to other people.  I know that's relevant to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a class action lawsuit just to prove to go forward against Apple for restricting apps to the Apple App Store on the Apple platform.  Now the lawyers for the class action lawsuit want to make money.  So they're asking for damages because they say Apple is price fixing which is clearly not the App Store in fact has had the effect of lowering the value of applications across the board you know.  But I think you could make a better case well not as lucrative but a better case that the App Store is a form of censorship right.  Apple won't allow politically controversial apps in of course wanted to allow adult apps in and will not allow competitive apps in many cases to protect their monopoly.  So I think that's another issue with App Stores.  App Stores is censored can be censored easily by governments but already are censoring these companies are already well less so Google is Google Google.  Google doesn't do any of that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is less of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the nice thing on Android is you don't have to buy it from the App Store.  Yeah.  The bad thing about iOS is you do.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So which gives Apple veto power over everything and therefore gives governments veto power.  Yes.  But I mean but the other half of this is that the number of apps people install is going going down.  I think that people are in many ways over apps and the average the average number of apps installed per month is under one now.  So now our skills.  Wow.  What.  Yeah.  So basically the web is is is is coming back for this which is good because it means that you and with with the sort of advent progressive web apps and the ability to have notifications and persistent stuff and work offline and so on means that you can do a lot of the things that you had to put  an app for before with Webster.  So that is an advantage.  That means that you just use your old to rather than have to make something for the App Store.  And that's not all those features that they're on iOS yet but they are there on Android and they are there on Firefox and Chrome on desktop as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well you have the great firewall of China to which blocks the web stuff.  Yeah.  So China certainly has a you know a better way to block all of this stuff.  The app store gives it a nice convenient way to prevent you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah the firewalls a lot harder.  Right.  And difficult.  I mean you can sneak stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  But it's the stuff that signal does where they do web fronting where they they root messages through other other domains so that to try and block signal you basically have to try and block Google as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good.  Let's do that.  Yeah you do this at your apparel of course that you know this is how a first world country can quickly become a third world country by blocking things like Google signals a really good example because of course that's the message of the known secure messaging app widely accepted as secure messaging app that is used by dissidents and others to protect their privacy from overarching governments.  There was a story that WhatsApp was insecure we talked a lot about that on security now yesterday I refer you to that piece.  Bottom line is there's some implementation decisions and WhatsApp made that do increase your risk but they're easily fixed in the settings of WhatsApp.  And you should probably use signal.  That's you know it just works right.  I love it that Farhad brought dragged out the 1996 Declaration of Independence of cyberspace space that John Perry Barlow wrote and has since by the way somewhat disavowed hours is a Jeff's been trying to get me to get John Perry Barlow to read do a dramatic reading of that for a long time.  One of the lines ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere.  And as a result world's governments will never be able to limit or lasso the digital realm, but they're going to try.  And then he quotes john Gilmore cyberpunk john Gilmore from 1993 and founder of sun. The net interpret censorship is damage and roots around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, everyone was so naive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, those were the days weren't they.  What?  Yeah, well, I think that it's, you still, I think you still can make the case in fact I would make strongly the case that I made this case.  15 years ago in a documentary that some that Kevin Spacey was making about hackers that hackers are going to be the freedom fighters of the future that the people who know how to use the internet and route around government intervention are going to be the ones who help us preserve our freedoms and I think you're seeing that already with people like Moxie Marlin spike and signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, but also the value that the signal rises is actually usable, unlike PGP and right, a lot of the previous tools, where it takes, it takes about a week's worth to get the damn thing set up and then you have to read it that every year signal basically just works it.  But in order to do that, they made it dependent on phone numbers which has it has other issues which means you've got to have a you've got to have a phone number, and be if you, if you change phones, then you have to re invite everyone and redo that, but that was their way of getting around the public.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Sometimes there is a balance between security and convenience, and you give up, the more you have one, the less you have the other.  Unfortunately, but sophisticated users will know the difference.  The most common passwords of 2016.  From Dan here. Yeah.  So, Lauren, good.  She only who is that can keep her which is one of the one of the well known password very good password vault keeper security.  They went through 10 million passwords that became public through data breaches in 2016, and came up with a list.  Are you ready.  The 25 most common passwords of 2016. They haven't really changed much number one 123456.  It's, it's three better.  Number three, QWERTY.  Number four 12345678.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Number five 111111.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had a, I had a chief engineer who used that as a password as I remember.  In fact, I think at tech TV that was the default password is 111111.  Number six 123456789.  Number eight, password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like that's sinking.  It's going down.  People are learning to be like number one was number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think 123456 has always been number number 91123123 clever.  And number 10 obfuscated by doing it backwards 987654321.  Why is my noob a password number 12 on the list.  Number 21, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's your Google password.  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Anyway, oh, I'm trying to I was trying to figure out the one q2 w3 and then I'm looking at your keyboard right. Yeah, I'm like, so what's 1880 CSK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's that? Oh, that's it. Number 15 is eight.  This is a good. This would be a great test.  Right for people to like, okay, you have five seconds to figure out why number 15.  What is one eight 80 CSK D2 W.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  T C 18.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't seem like it's related to the keyboard layout, does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm I was typing it in. I'm like, I don't see it.  What is what? But if this is I mean, apparently this is multiple people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of people doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of people doing it. What does it mean? Come on, chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's stuck right between 666666 and 7777777.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's got to be pretty obvious.  What could it be?  This is the only one you're right, Stacy.  This is the only one that's not immediately. I feel like once we know it's going to be.  Got three smart people here.  Three are J.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, some of these are weird. Like, look at the look at 20. That's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure they all have some meaning somewhere.  Number 20 is three are J.S.  One L.A. seven Q.E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it backwards? Is it anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would be a terrible hacker. I'm looking at here for like I feel like I'm reading license plates.  You know, where you're trying to figure out what are they trying to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These are obviously used at on sites where it requires a letter and a number. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is shift is shift helpful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no one. Oh, ASCII. No. No. OK. So.  Oh, wait a minute. Here's a link to the hard coded password for bots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this is a bot. Yes.  It's spam bots use it.  So it's not his mother is saying.  This is Graham Cluey, aptly named writing a tripwire dot com.  The reason is bots.  Huh.  People are not choosing those passwords. Same with three are J.S.  One L.A. seven Q.E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I spotted the bot passwords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are an anti-bot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're a human. You're a human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. That's really interesting.  It must be hard coded in some malware or something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's pretty cool. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. We've all learned something here today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  History solved. Thanks, Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're so smart, Internet.  How do people survive without the Internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh. I remember being a reporter in my early, early, early, early days.  The first year. Yeah. You had to use like microfiche and your paper had a thing called the morrigan.  You had to go look up stuff like I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember. Yeah. You'd go to the microfiche reader and then have like a little spinner and you'd go going through the oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those were the days. And it's it took you like all day to write one story.  It was crazy. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's crazier that or having to write 50 stories a day because because that's expected of you.  Because, hey, well, it doesn't take any time to research this.  HTC has a new series of phone, the U series.  No more headphone jacks for seeing.  And I called it Android companies would copy Apple slavishly even though there's no reason to do so and eliminate Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Samsung's going to have the eight. Is it the eight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the eight won't have headphone jacks.  No, I thought they said it would because they were the ones who said that with the Note 7 announcement.  And look, it comes with a headphone jack.  But I think the rumors been that the eight won't courage the courage to include the headphone jack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate them. I hate all of them if they take away my headphone jack, too, especially without something.  I mean, apparently people really like their ear pods.  So I don't have them. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I do like the you mean the air pods, the wireless.  I'm sorry. Air pod. Yeah, I like the air.  I do like the air pods. But are you an iPhone user?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Me? Yeah. No, not usually. I have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It makes no sense to have air pods unless you have an iPhone.  You can pair them to your I paired it in my pixel, but they're no better than any other Bluetooth headset in that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. So if you take a good microphone with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a good microphone. But Apple's doing all this stuff with them that the third parties don't do.  Like it's it's it's figuring out which microphone to use, for instance.  But I've been told when I'm on calls with it, it sounds very good.  So and it goes down a little bit lower than the you know, the ones that are at least has a little bit of a thing there.  Is that the technical term? Yeah.  The thing, the drip, the little icicle that comes off your comes off your ear.  The wedge. The wedge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's I mean, the microphones. That's what it is.  Basically, that's where the microphone is. Yeah.  That's where the microphone lives. And they can do noise canceling.  I mean, it can do it too. It can position it. Yes.  Work out where your mouth is and correlate that out. Exactly what it does.  You're so smart. There's the the other security thing that happened this week was Google key transparency.  Did you see that? No.  So this is talking about PGP. It's a key transparency to all which I think is takes you to the open source thing.  And then they take you to the there's a there's a blog post about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what do we what does that mean? Key transparency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the goal of this is to come up with a way of doing public key mapping.  So that you can map from your accounts to public keys and check that they do actually belong to you.  So it's trying to solve the how do I find somebody's public key thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What we've done in the past, of course, is use key servers. MIT runs one PGP runs one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're supposed to upload your public key there and searchable by where they've got a mapping and you can verify it.  OK, so it can be. It can be. Well, this is what Keybase.io does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I really like Keybase.io, but it's a private. I think I just lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you don't hear me. Hello. So I think I just had a drop out briefly. Sorry. OK.  So I didn't quite hear what you said. I was just saying Keybase does this.  Yes. So the point of this is it's it's an open source thing.  It's it's secured by Merkle hashes so you can call it a block chain if you really want to.  The idea is it's a verifiable mapping between email address and public key.  And that's that's the idea behind it.  But so far it's it's a bunch of code and they're still working on integrating it as UI, but they wanted to publish it as code and get a code review on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is the idea that at some point Google will run a server that you can use that you can log into or upload a key to or upload your email address to and see what's going on?  Is that the idea or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The idea is, is that it shouldn't just be one one server.  It should be multiple servers and they can basically you can attach things to this sort of chain of signed keys to say that.  And look at this one as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use PGP keys when I download open install open source software to verify that the software belongs is a is a legitimate keys are routinely used or other ways of doing it.  But PGP is routinely used in open source for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's perhaps stores and things like that.  And they are we use key signing there.  But there's an and effectively when you're using signal you're you're doing that signal that signal has a different name for that and call it a key.  They call it a magic number or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, in fact, open whisper systems is one of the teams working on this as well as teams at Yahoo and Google.  Here's what they say in their blog post at Google.  Our goal is to evolve key transparency into an open source, generic, scalable and interoperable directory of public keys with an ecosystem and mutually auditing directors directories rather.  So this is kind of I guess to replace the PGP key server.  Yes. Yeah, that's that's that's the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's that they already have certificate transparency, which is where they they keep track of the certificates for every year for every website and put them in a database that's kind of like this.  So they're trying to extend this from what they do for that, which is a very useful service they provide.  And obviously, it's easy for them to do so crawling the web so they can they can make this difference all the time.  And they're trying to do this for to do PKI.  So it's interesting. But as I say, it's early days and I'm it's not I'm not sure it's baked into any usable products yet.  We'll watch with interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like what Keybase has done, but it's of course a private attempt by some very well known crypto folk.  Keybase.io. I keep a key there.  That's actually where I keep my public key.  And you can use it to track.  I like I'll track Kevin Marks public key.  And if it changes, I'll be notified.  Things like that. Those are all that's that's what we need because PGP's key key key server infrastructure is kind of primitive.  We didn't mention it, but Chelsea Manning's sentence will be commuted.  President Obama commuted the bulk of her 35 year sentence, which was really kind of disproportionate.  People accused of similar or convicted of similar crimes typically would receive seven or eight years.  She has served seven. It'll be commuted.  She'll be released on May 17th.  I think mostly hailed by people.  There was a there was a petition circulating which got more than 100,000 signatures urging the president to do that.  So I think most of the most of the tech community thinks this is a good idea.  She's committed attempted to commit suicide twice, has gone on a hunger strike.  Seems like a good idea to commute this sentence.  There are those who say she's a traitor and she should serve all 35 years.  But I think for humanitarian reasons, her sentence she's not been pardoned by the way, she's been sentences commuted,  which tells me that it's a highly unlikely in the next couple of days.  Edward Snowden will receive a pardon.  He, of course, never turned himself in was never tried and never received a sentence.  There's no commutation possible.  And if Chelsea Manning hasn't been pardoned, it seems unlikely that Edward Snowden would be pardoned.  Mark Zuckerberg testified in a suit yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, wait, no, no, no. Mark Zuckerberg visited one of the 50 states he wants to visit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He has now visited one of the 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which which state was it? Where was the trial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Texas.  Oh, it's one of them East Texas.  No, it was in Dallas.  No, it wasn't.  It was Dallas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is, of course, the Oculus Rift trial.  A small company claims that Oculus stole all of its technology from ZeniMax.  And Zuckerberg says, I never even heard of ZeniMax before this lawsuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK.  What else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm like, do you want more insights?  I don't think we need.  He actually, he, it's like he appeared to be a good adult.  What if you want some?  Well, he's going to run for president in three years.  I was going to say, if you want conspiracy theories, he's totally running for president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, mark my words, we are going to see the techno, the crowd, the techno elite suddenly gain a great interest in government.  And Peter Thiel is going to run for governor of California.  I think Jeff Bezos has ambitions.  He's moved to Washington, D.C.  And not just because the Washington Post, he's got a big house.  Did he move? Did he move there?  Well, he just bought the most expensive house in the most prestigious district of Washington, D.C., where the Obamas will be his neighbors and many others.  I think there's a, you don't buy a house in D.C., a 23-bedroom house in D.C. for fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you don't buy.  I mean, if you're going to run for office, you wouldn't run in D.C. though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but you but you may end up living there.  Who knows? I guess they give you a house, though.  Right. They do give you a house.  Wait, I think Zuckerberg is totally.  Look, he's did we talk about this last week?  Is he going to be old enough?  Yes, just barely.  OK. His birthday is like the month before the filing deadline, like August.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you only have to be 35, right?  Thirty five.  OK, I thought you had to be 40 and I was like there is no way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Constitutionally, he has to be 35. He'll be 35.  I think it's August.  What is it? 2018, something like 2019.  So he will make it.  He also has now proclaimed that he has some religious feeling.  At least he's not an atheist anymore.  I don't know.  He's going to visit all 50 states this year, maybe have a town hall.  And most I think the most important factoid or fact, I guess it's kind of a factoid is that when they restructured Facebook's stocks so that he and Priscilla could give away the bulk of it to the foundation among the change in bylaws was a change that said he could continue to run Facebook even if he held government office.  Now, why do you do that unless you intend to hold government office?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To be president, you can't run a company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why they're watching with great interest to see if Trump skirts that.  No, he can't skirt that.  Gosh, gosh.  No, there is no there is no confident interest.  He's the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, I think from a emotional perspective, from an ethical perspective, that's the case.  But from a purely legal perspective, it may not be the case.  Right.  He may be exempt.  The president's exempt.  In any event, clearly, Zuck is watching with interest.  And I think that this most recent election was a cattle prod to these already massively ambitious people to perhaps seek public office, not because being president United States is in any way better than being chairman and president of Facebook or Amazon, but because they want to change the world.  Right.  I don't know.  And it looks good on the resume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, there is there is the question of like, hey, once you've been president, what do you do next?  And once you've been the CEO of a massive company that you've grown from scratch, what do you do?  What is next?  You go to space.  That's been the historic route.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's kind of you know, it turns out space, not I really fully believe that we are going to see Silicon Valley.  In many ways, attempt to get involved in politics.  I don't know why, but I just feel like that's that seems the technocrats are you know, this is exactly the mindset, though, they're going to hate it.  But the mindset of a technocrat is these idiots don't know how to run anything.  We're the smartest people in the room.  We know how to do it right.  Get out of the way and let us just take over.  That's their.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then they're going to encounter.  Remember when Zuckerberg donated so much money to the schools was it New Jersey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  New Jersey wasted money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're going to run into the real world.  They're not well equipped to deal with it because nothing works in the real world, especially in politics that way.  And what is it when you meet an immovable force?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like there's an irresistible force meets an immovable object.  Oh, is that what I want to say?  And then you have what they call a Mexican standoff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's not going to be good.  I would like you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I take it you would not vote for Mark Zuckerberg for president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, the man doesn't have a platform yet.  I want people to run for office who are tech savvy.  But who genuinely care about fixing our problems and also genuinely care about people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Mark cares about fixing our problems.  I don't know how it feels about people, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think he feels because you can't look at the problems we have.  Devoy a divorce from the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's I think Silicon Valley buys into that of late expressed notion that empathy is not useful.  In politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good luck to them, then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Some of them do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a New Yorker New Yorker article that I thought was really interesting.  I can't remember.  I've referred to it before.  Empathy, in fact, can get in the way, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It can. And that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  University University psychologist Paul Bloom says that empathy is an overrated trait for a leader.  It can inspire altruism, but it can also be contribute to bias.  And it does not necessarily translate to moral decision making.  And they did a lot of research to indicate this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That there is that and you shouldn't have the type of like right now our politics is run very much on knee jerk reactions to moral outrages.  Right. So you get highly that that's not the way to govern.  But you can't I don't know if you can be an effective president, especially because it's such.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bloom talks about the child in the well.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember that baby, Jessica, baby Jessica fell in Texas, of course, where else if she fell into a well and the whole nation focused on that.  And because it's easier for us to care about one person and to help one person than to sympathize with a large group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you're not going to get elected if you don't know how to connect with people.  It's I mean, Donald Trump has zero policy efforts, it seems.  But he connects with people, certain people very well.  He's empathetic. He's not empathetic. He just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. How do you know?  How do you know people who meet with him report that he's quite a nice guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not saying he's mean. I just he's not empathetic.  He doesn't know. Seek to feel other people's pain or do we know that I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I mean, Bill Clinton always said, I feel your pain. I feel your pain.  He was the king of empathy. Right. I feel I look he'd look in the eyes.  He'd feel your pain and then he'd go around and screw you.  So I don't I don't know. I'm not convinced that I don't know.  Maybe I'm cynical. Our show today brought to you by the best audio bookstore in the world.  Audible. I'm such a huge fan.  As you know, I became an audible customer 16 years ago now.  And I have hundreds of books in my audible library.  That's one of the things I like about audible is that unlike the you know, my previous books on tape,  I get to keep these books and I can download them and listen to them again at any time.  Oh, look, Neil Gaiman has a new book on Norse mythology.  Oh, that would be great.  Of course, he you know, he wrote American Gods, which is kind of based on North Norse mythology.  This is not out yet. It won't be until February.  But so you can get this is what I like about audible is that they you get they get all the bestsellers when they come out  or day and date as the hardcover.  So you can listen to anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They got Charlie stress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they got a ton of Charlie. So what do you like about his stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, he's he writes what he writes.  It's a good satisfaction stuff, but he's also he's a techie.  So he writes the tech, right? I look for that.  Yeah, it does a lot of interesting.  He's got multiple different parallel series.  I mean, he but the Empire Games is the new one in the merchant merchant series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they have up to book six, the Trade of Queens.  So I guess book seven is due.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, he just re just reissued them as three large books rather than six more books.  The previous series.  And then this is the first the second trilogy, which is so twice as long as those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's a six ology.  Look, here's the thing.  No matter what you're into, especially science fiction, when I first joined audible in 2000,  they didn't have a lot of science fiction, but they really made a concerted effort to beef up the sci fi effect.  They created an audible frontiers imprint that rerecord some of the classics from Heinlein and Asimov.  So really, this is a great place.  Oh, Carrie Fisher's diary narrated by Carrie Fisher.  Yeah, the Princess Diarist and Billy Lord is is available in audible.  I would love to listen to that.  I've heard her do the make the rounds, heard many interviews with her cut to 2013 about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Much the same kinds of things were happening only faster and more intensely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This this, of course, is the diary that she took.  She kept while she was making the original Star Wars movie in 1977 and reveals.  Well, I don't want to know spoilers, but reveals this kind of shocking secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, it was so not shocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You knew really you could tell.  Oh, OK.  I didn't know I was shocked.  I didn't know Michael Lewis is newest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I read every if you haven't read a Michael Lewis book, he wrote the big short.  He wrote Moneyball.  He is one of our best, most insightful writers of nonfiction.  His latest The Undoing Project is about Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky and their articles and studies on how humans make decisions.  Actually, Kahneman's book is one of my favorites on audible.  Let me see if I can find that.  That's another one I would recommend.  Daniel Kahneman wrote Thinking Fast and Slow.  And it's it's about how we were just talking about the elephant and the guy riding the elephant and all that stuff.  He says we have two systems that drive the way we think.  System one is fast.  It's intuitive.  It's emotional.  System two is slower, more deliberate, more logical.  And he's really done the studies on how we think.  I'll tell you what audible is such a great resource.  Let me get you a book free.  How about that?  Here's the new one.  An audible original Ponzi Supernova.  Bernie Madoff on the world's largest con.  Hmm.  This is called.  This is interesting.  I didn't know.  This is something maybe audible is doing now a little different.  They're doing originals.  So here's the deal.  Go to audible dot com slash twig.  That'll bring you to the gold sign up.  That's the book a month account, which you also get the Daily Digest of the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.  You pick any book, you get a credit toward a book.  Keep the book no matter what happens.  But if you're not happy, you can cancel anytime in the first 30 days and pay zip.  But I don't think you'll cancel.  It's been for me one of the great pleasures of my life.  I listen all the time at work.  If I had a commute, I would listen.  That's how I started.  I listen when I'm on the treadmill, when I'm washing dishes.  Audible dot com slash twig for your first book free.  And we thank Audible for their support.  Here's another Audible original.  They must be doing a bunch more genius dialogues.  Oh, with MacArthur Fellows.  Wow.  Amy Smith of MIT's D Lab.  Oh, this sounds great.  They're doing a bunch of original stuff now.  This is new.  All right.  Moving on.  Google says it's verified apps feature, you know, where it scans those apps as identified.  Get this.  Twenty five thousand potentially dangerous apps and kept them out of the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  Thanks, Google.  Thanks, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Google.  And that's actually on your Android device.  Make sure it's turned on.  Google will warn you.  And here, I love this.  This is Google for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the formula.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Z score.  That way you can have a Python script do this.  Where N is the number of devices downloaded the app.  X is the number of retained devices that downloaded the app.  And P is the probability of device downloading any app that will be retained.  And there you go.  If an app has an extremely poor Z score, Google immediately classifies it as a PHA.  And then we'll kill installs.  So there.  What is a PHA?  I don't know, but I'm sure it's a bad thing.  Potentially harmful potentially harmful app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seriously, they did that.  Of course they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Data driven, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's data driven.  Maybe they will work out.  The technocrats will work out in government.  But I mean, that's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that the mindset that says, well, it's all can be solved with a formula is exactly the mindset that says, get out of the way.  Let us take over.  We know how to do these.  We know how to do the math.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I totally understand.  For a while, I used to be that way.  But now I feel.  You become empathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I dealt with the real world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  No, the thing is.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The scientific method is a powerful thing.  I love this.  I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You will never convince me the scientific method is not the most important thing humans have come up with.  Ever.  Right.  So there is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it does rely on you actually modeling what you think you're modeling.  Yeah.  And if you.  If you.  There's a lot of human failings like confirmation bias and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there's also a lot of, you know, there's like two entire fields of scientific papers that are now being questioned because they basically spent too long gaming the statistics rather than actually doing productive reduced experiments.  So the challenge is you've got to use the scientific method, but you've also got to make sure that you haven't got models with gaps in it, which was really the challenge.  And the tech industry has incredible gaps.  Yes.  Incredible.  And has a blind spot as to where its gaps are.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to point you to.  Let me see if I can find the link.  There was this great article.  And it was on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was about.  It was the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The.  The.  The.  The.  The.  The.  The.  The.  It was the 69th African American woman to graduate with a PhD in physics in the United States ever.  I think it was Gizmodo interviewed her about hidden figures, the movie.  Oh, yeah.  And the story, which I'm desperately searching for the link because it was a great interview.  Did you find it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From Huffpo.  Oh, was it Huffpo?  A year ago.  No.  Dr. Chanda Prescott Weinstein.  The 63rd black woman in American history with a physics PhD.  That's kind of hard to believe that in all this time, there've only been 63.  But remember, women weren't allowed to go to school, to college a hundred years ago.  So, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yes.  So this is I think it's a more recent article because it's tied to the release of the movie.  I wish I could find it.  I'll find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have the means.  What you do.  So let me show you a little tip here.  You go to tools in your Google search and you say, let's find the results to this search from the last month or week.  Which should we do? Month?  Look at that.  Karsten already did it.  Oh, Karsten.  This is from Gizmodo, Australia.  A black female astrophysicist explains why hidden figures isn't just about history.  That sounds like a very good article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Read that article.  It made me cry because I have been in places where I am one of the only women in the room.  I can't imagine being one of only women and black being a black woman.  Can you imagine?  And in the things people said to her that wasn't even like a jerky.  It may not have even been meant as a jerk thing.  Like the assumption that she couldn't handle the coursework.  Actually, I think that is kind of a jerky thing.  But I know at the time that people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's not forget Larry Summers.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who was president of Harvard when he said, well, women just can't do physics a couple of years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, my mom was a geophysicist because she was convinced she couldn't be a physicist.  And she was one of seven women in her program at like Rensselaer Polytech back in the 70s.  I like it that your mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I didn't realize you came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they are so disappointed that I'm a writer.  They're like my dad's a double E, my mom's a geophysicist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's where all this brains come from.  Now I get it.  Larry Summers implied there was an innate difference between men and women that made women bad at science.  You jerk.  By the way, he then went on to a prominent role in.  Who was it?  It was was it was I think it was the Obama administration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He got sanitized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So read that article because it's it's a great example of how tech and science has these gaps and putting them in charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want to get really depressed.  I just finished the chapter in the People's History of the United States by Howard Zinn on women's role in American history.  It is so depressing.  So it's like, oh, my God, you know, and yeah, I on behalf of men everywhere, I apologize.  And it's just it's like, well, we can do better. Let's do better.  Why don't we do better? And while we're doing better, let's get your pick of the week.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's time of the show towards the end here where we get to do the picks of the week.  Normally, Jeff would do a number, but he's gone.  He's gone. So I'll search for a number while Stacey does her thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like your. Yes, my thing is a thing because did I freeze?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no. Me might have frozen, but you're still moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, I my Skype just went someplace else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It knew you were going to do this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. So my app of the week is Stringify.  And this is a way to connect.  It's like if this than that.  But instead of just doing one end statement, you can do many.  Oh, I've been wanting this. Yes.  So the iOS app is much better.  I've got to tell you this right now. The Android app is out and beta.  Just came out like a week and a half ago, maybe two weeks ago.  And so if you have the option, iOS is the way to go.  So what you do is you manually add all your devices.  They support an astonishing number of things.  So Hue lights are low cameras, Netatmo, Nest, the Wink, TechCrunch,  New York Times, Automatic, our sponsor.  Oh, yeah. So lots of physical and digital things.  Yay. The Echo. I should put that in there because people love talking to that.  So it lets you build these flows in your best bet.  Actually, if you can, it even supports if this than that.  Yes, it also supports if this and that, which is really cool.  You could chain these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly what you're going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you go to the site, it'll show you a flow.  I don't want to show you my flows because they're kind of messy.  It's hard to I will say it is it is tough to navigate the first time around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is programming at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is. So click on a flow. Pick one that you like.  30 minute timer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the most popular current popular flow.  So you see what you do.  Here's a better one. Party time light cascade.  Oh, do that one.  Yeah, because this requires Insteon and Hue lights and Alexa.  I mean, Echo.  So what you do is you ask Amazon Echo to tell Stringify it's party time.  It turns on your Insteon keyboard, starts your timer for seven seconds,  then turns on Hue bulb A-19 to purple.  Yes, that's something you can't do with if this than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And some of them are even better.  Like like you can have multiple triggers.  So if this is happening and this is happening, here's an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your pivot power genius.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When the Nest Cam detects motion and when you're away,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it sends an email.  Then it turns on your Wink Pivot Power Genius and sends you an email.  So you've got and statements in here.  Then sets a timer for 10 minutes, then turns off your pivot power,  pivot genius. Huh?  So it's just a power strip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, yeah, it's a smart power strip.  So, yeah, you can see how this could be a really powerful tool.  Yeah, it is tough.  It is tough.  Like my recommendation, if you if you download this, it's not tough.  I shouldn't say that.  Watch the video as to how to do it, because otherwise if you should like start  playing around, you're kind of like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you know Boolean logic, you should be able to figure this out, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The logic is it's how they have things wrapped on their stuck on their canvas.  It's purely a mechanical thing. It's not a logical thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, OK. I like it that you could do Boolean logic.  So there's one that it will turn on your spotlights when your Nest Cam detects  motion, but only if it's night. Yeah.  Nice stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So have fun, you guys. Stringify. Is it free?  It is free. They pay for this based on.  Hold on. Oh, enterprises pay for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, somebody's got to get someone's paid for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought they might get referral fees for you by new gadgets as well.  Yeah, they should. They should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I didn't ask them about that, but no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice. Very good. Fine. Thank you, Stacey.  Kevin, you've got a few things you want to give a plug to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So these are my IndieWeb things.  The usual thing is if you go to IndieWeb.org, we've got our regular homebrew website club next week  in model cities, San Francisco, London, Brighton, and some others.  The other IndieWeb thing is that WebMention is now a W3C recommendation.  I saw that. Congratulations. That's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's actually been finalized and we've been working through this for a while now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and it's been fully published. So at this point, go out and implement this.  It's official and it's stable now.  So WebMention, we discussed before, it's basically a very simple protocol  that when one website links to another, it can send a WebMention to say they've done that.  And then the receiving site can interpret that as a different thing,  depending on what kind of thing has been done.  My cat is desperate to get permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, oh. No cats were harmed in the making of this tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I said the dogs are in the house. Obviously the cat is in the size of the dog.  So you can use it to do likes and reposts and RSVPs and threaded conversations  and other things like that.  So that's out there and implementations are growing all the time.  And then the other thing I wanted to mention was Micro.blog,  which is planning to be a new microblogging tool and reader.  Oh, good. We need one of those.  And this is Manton Reese is doing this. Yes, Manton Reese is doing this.  And there's a Kickstarter for it. Show my screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go. Yes.  So what's it going to look like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You host it? He's going to host stuff himself or let you redirect your domain to it.  But yeah, this is what he says about it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, we'll turn on his voice. I turned off his voice.  Go ahead, Manton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They'll be federated, I presume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like it. This is what we need.  So how is this different from, say, GNU Social?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's trying to make it so that it will integrate things.  So in some ways it's more like FriendFeed was where it will bring stuff in from outside.  And then you can reply there.  And he said he was going to adopt the WebMention and MicroPub stuff so that it can plug into the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Manton's big into IndieWeb, right?  So he expects to be fully IndieWeb compliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that looks promising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's raised $45,000. His goal was 10. And there's still two weeks.  So everybody go to Kickstarter and search for...  What should you search for? Micro.blog, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll go to Micro.blog and there's a link there.  Nice.  That's the domain. He bought the domain, obviously, from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he's in Austin, so if you want to go over and say hi, Stacey.  Oh, what's up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's up?  I'm like an IndieMedia publication, although I'm not on actual IndieWeb platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to give him some money.  You can make your platforms your own Indie, more Indie.  We've seen so many attempts to do an open, federated replacement  for these siloed solutions like Twitter, and they never succeed.  In fact, App.net just...  App.net shut down this week.  ...pulled the plug.  What is it going to take to make one of these work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the thing is that...  My sense of it is they have to go with the web.  They have to be part of the web and behave in that way.  And a lot of them, they said, OK, we're going to make our own Twitter  and it'll be our own special thing.  That was a problem with the aspirants, a problem with App.net to some extent,  in that they're trying to replicate the whole thing in one place.  Whereas what we've been trying to do with IndieWeb is build it as a set of protocols  so that you can wire lots of pieces together and have it still work.  And that's why I'm encouraged by MicroBlog, because he's taking that idea on board.  And I'm hoping what we're trying to do with IndieWeb is encourage other places to drop that too.  So working with NewSocial and other implementations like that to implement this stuff as well,  so that you're able to knock...  The problem is there's a lot of monoculture.  There's only one piece of software that you'll have to be running.  If you're running that, then it federates, and if you're not, it doesn't.  And we're trying to make it more like protocols so that it doesn't matter what software you're running.  If you've got a simple protocol like we've mentioned,  you can implement that and wire different things together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Someday everyone will have a web server in their house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You already have lots of web servers in your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the problem.  Oh, yeah, we didn't, for example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We didn't, for example, talk about the new Raspberry Pi that's out that is super powered.  That could have been someone's pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Mine is a very happy pick, because I think we all need some cheering up.  I found three interesting websites this week.  I'm going to open an incognito tab because I don't want it to be polluted by my choices.  It's the happy...  I'm sorry, the nicest place on the inter.net.  And what it does, it just picks a few seconds from a bunch of YouTube videos that have zero views.  And you just...  It's kind of like ChatRoulette with nice...  Wait a minute, this is the hug...  I'm sorry, this is a different one.  This is the hug one.  So what you do is you give a hug.  I'm sorry, I have another one that's what I was just saying.  And so they invite you to record a video and you give it a hug.  And then...  And then your hug will be on the Internet and you will get a hug if you want to go to the nicest place on the inter.net.  So that's nice.  That's actually not the one I wanted.  And it looks like the one that I wanted, astronaut.io, has gone down.  And I'm going to be sad about that.  I'll create a new incognito tab and try it once more.  Astronaut.io.  S-T-R-O-N-A-U-T.I-O.  The idea was this is the one where the guy wrote a script to find unviewed videos on YouTube and just fire them up a few seconds at a time.  Is it gone?  Oh crap.  I guess it's gone.  It was really cool.  It was like Chatroulette, only like fun stuff.  What does it say, Carson?  Can you make that bigger?  I can't read the little print.  And you got to the site.  I can't get to the site.  Today you are an astronaut.  You are floating in inner space 100 miles above the surface of the Earth.  You peer through your window and this is what you see.  You are people watching.  These are fleeting moments.  So go ahead, press go.  You can't.  I don't know if the site is down or if it's DDoSed.  I saw it on Hacker News.  It's probably down.  It's not loading for me.  Yeah, me neither.  Well, you probably just made it worse by pressing go.  I didn't help.  I did not help.  It was actually really interesting because you'd see very strange, disjointed, unrelated clips.  But it really was like you were seeing the universe of people in all their varied forms.  And there are clips from all over the world.  And it's YouTube, so there was nothing, mostly not inappropriate.  I didn't see anything inappropriate.  Anyway, I guess you can't see it now.  Keep it around.  Astronaut.  Astro.  Not dot net.  Right.  What was it?  I still have I.O. I.O.  It was I'm coming up with more of these like the planet radio things were more of these  like interesting uses of the Web.  They're back.  Kids were we're done for the day.  I want to thank you so much for joining us.  Kevin Marks from the Indie Web, the Web camp.  Everybody or Kevin Marks dot com.  Always a pleasure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. This is this is a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a really weird word.  You can have piebald anything.  Oh, I did not.  A piebald or pied animals, one that has a pattern of pigmented spots on an unpigmented white background of hair, feathers or scales.  So you can apparently have a piebald snake.  I mean, I think that cat qualifies as piebald.  The spots are pigmented in shades of black and or yellow as determined by the genotype controlling the color of the animal.  Same as calico. I don't know.  Stacey Higginbotham covers IOT as an independent and highly talented journalist.  Stacey on IOT.com and IOT podcast.com, the podcast she does with Kevin Toffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am OK with the web being ephemeral.  I never I'm not a hoarder.  I know.
