Transcript:  Yeah, it was really a bummer because I really loved going in there and like playing with stuff and seeing all this kind of crazy stuff  But did you ever buy anything there?

He gives it two sample  Questions to make sure that that it knows what it's supposed to do  It didn't do the ones in order because the first two were a and a is the answer so he didn't do that  Then he puts in um  A question the next question is it gets it right and does it informat it does it right? I went on and played with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, did we just do that on air that's hysterical

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, they always told me you never when you're crossing into a country uh, say on your passport that you're a journalist  That's just you know, you're gonna get arrested  Silicon valley, which is another country is a different gulag, I guess but it's the same thing  Well, that was fun, uh, probably better than the top story of the week, which is  Elon, elon, elon, elon  Let's talk about instead of elon. We'll get to elon later. Let's talk about vidcon, which is wednesday  Information article right? Yeah starts today in beautiful southern california anaheim  Jeff you're the one who turned me on to vidcon. This is where uh, you discovered the new media is going  gun great guns  Created by the greens, uh  Really for youtube creators initially. It's now really a tiktok  Shows sold to viacom in the meantime, too. Yeah, and I noticed jim latterback is no longer running it. He's a consultant  He left in april  Uh tiktokers tiktokers everywhere writes the information germs germs everywhere is my  Although youtube's still there and you know, uh, although susan wajiski is not  Uh that they sent a couple of other people the lower down  Yeah, uh head of talent development at snap youtube. Oh, yeah  Yeah, oh, yeah, she's done great longevity. They're thrilled with her. Are you kidding? She's done. Oh, yeah  um, but  It is no longer youtube's rodeo and  There are considerable warnings that the recession is going to cause a little bit of a shrinkage  for creators  And I think that that's probably the case although they say  You know, it's interesting. Uh the uh, they quoted ezra cooperstein who is president of mr  beasts talent management company  Uh, he says buckle up  because uh  Tough times are ahead for content creators. The ad business is gonna go down. Why?  Yeah, because advertisers are taking longer than usual to ink sponsorship deals brands are thinking twice and some are canceling  sponsorship deals and  They're pointing out the recessions. We're gonna put a lot of people out of work who will then turn to content creation  Competition, so there'll be a lot more competition. Some people are going to try to pursue content creation  Says jenny lu a partner at early stage fund mac venture capital. This could be a vital new channel for them to grow a career  Uh, so expect a little bit of a squeeze in the creator economy going forward  Rechette recession is not good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I have the rundown go ahead. I see

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, I was gonna say I feel like we dodged a bullet with covet  So we got a few extra years in there because really I thought like everything was gonna go  To hell once the pandemic started two years. This is just long covet. That's all  I'm like, so, you know, we got a little bit of a break

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We we suffered considerably from covet, uh initially and it came back around started to come back around fourth quarter of last year  Uh, but I think that it's you know, uh with a very high inflation  Uh collapsing stock market and recession looming  Uh, you know, I think that it's probable that it'll get tough again

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, this drives me nuts these days. We've got clear causes for all of that, right? We've been through a pandemic  We miraculously did well employment is phenomenal  uh  Supply chain is messy for all kinds of reasons including consumption  And there's a war defending democracy  and  Rather than talking about the necessary sacrifices we need to make for that and the and the blessing we have of having survived  so far  with a million people lost  Survived so I use that with with caution  A pandemic that the economy is still working and so on instead. No, it's wine wine wine all gases a little more  It's just driving me nuts. There's a lack of generosity

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  World War II people were  You know metal drives they were planting victory gardens buying war bonds. We had ration books  They knew that this was a sacrifice that this was tough  But but there was this feeling in the country of this is what you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You hold you hold together you hang tight in the 73 oil embargo, which I covered as a cub reporter  My first big story in the business. Uh, we had uh rationing and and price controls  You could only get three dollars worth of gas for time. There were huge lines. Everything's better  The gas price was decided it is now everything's better than then

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People uh did people in the gas you're getting into old man territory. I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Remember when the gas was  dollar a gallon  Actually, I remember when gas was 33 cents a gallon that's how old I am  Holy cow, and you could make a phone call for a nickel nickel  elon musk says  He wants twitter to become the wechat of the western world elon met last week with employees of twitter  incredibly rude  Because he called in on his phone  Uh, it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was just so rude. Give me my 40 hours in office. Oh my gosh. That's what you're gonna do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he did say  He phoned it in  He phoned it in and uh, let me see. I had an image  This is not the image of him on his phone, although  It's kind of like that  Uh somewhere somebody because I imagine this was a closed meeting but you know, you have 8 000 employees on it. They're gonna  Maybe it was casey newton on platformer that had it but uh,  He said, you know, if you're an excellent employee, maybe we can think about you not working, uh on prem  If you're an excellent employee  He wants he has plans uh to be as big as wechat wechat as a billion monthly active users  He says twitter should have a billion monthly active users don't know exactly how he plans to get those extra 750  million  But uh, that's that's his goal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, wechat is in a country with a lot more people too. It's a platform for so many other things  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he said that  He said you live on wechat in china because it's so helpful so useful daily life  I think if we achieve that or come even close to that with twitter, it would be a success  So does he is he gonna add wechat like features that would be interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if I would pay for things via twitter or want to buy things on twitter. I mean you sort of see  That happening like you can buy things through tik tok or instagram and  There are people who buy things through instagram

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everything  everything  I don't even like instagram anymore  You know, it's become a video platform there so so they're suffering so badly from tik tok envy  That they're trying to turn into tik tok and they're just kind of a bad tik tok  Yeah, be what you are. Don't don't try to it's disappointing to me because I really liked uh,  Wechat here's the image of of how elon phoned it in  He's like, what is he in a hotel room

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is somebody behind him you could have been there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just so like he's in the breakfast room in a day's end and and the general reaction

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe you see that actually is where he is. Wait a minute. He's not in a day's end. Y'all that guy's getting his eggs

I want to say sub stack his platformer newsletter. Uh casey who got a lot of inside stuff  Said that the basic reaction  From twitter employees was that was just disjointed and  And you know, here's the three words. He says if I were to make a word cloud of employee responses some bigger ones would be  incoherent  rambling  uninspiring  At one point musk mentioned he has seen no evidence of alien life  And no one knew what to make of that  Out of nowhere  That's fair  I have seen no evidence  Of alien life just in case you want to know  Uh, I think he's still gonna buy it. I mean, you know meeting with the staff kind of implies that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Someone was pushing for the the the purchase to go ahead and follow through was it a shareholder or well everybody is quitters suing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or shareholders suing rather, but I think twitter's insisting they're saying no  You you said you were gonna buy it. There's a leak. There's legal  recourse for them, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You break it you buy it. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's the motto right there  Hey, why did there's a poem there somewhere, you know, like pretty to have pretty to look at  Something to hold  But if you break it, it's sold. There's a poem in there somewhere  Uh twitter's losing money says elon and that's not a great situation. Oh  Uh analysts think he's gonna cut as much as 20% of the workforce  Uh, he you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But he didn't he wouldn't say he's got a lot of debt to pay off of this thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah  So cut 20% of the workforce yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Work them like crazy to add more features and uh and grow to a billion grow quadruple the size  Uh, I love casey dune casey writes  About that musk offered bong rip platitudes about the future civilization  Quote I want twitter to contribute to a better long-lasting civilization where we better understand the nature of reality, man

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean I was gonna ask a minute ago  What is stopping twitter for from becoming the next wechat?  I mean, yes where it's here in the u.s  But if they put these features in and get the  Masses interested in it. It seems like it could totally take off, right?  But then he said 20% of the staff. I don't know about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do a lot in china with qr codes  So you can use wechat to open and pay for things via qr codes like everywhere in china

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not hard to imagine how you could add all those features to twitter  But the challenge is if you do that will the existing user base stick around?  Let alone will you gain?  770 million new users this is the problem always with twitter to adopt you as a standard for transactions

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You gotta make the deals although elon. I mean if anybody could make the deals it would be elon

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I mean really? Yeah, really who would trust elon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's a good point. I mean if you had like square if you had the jack dorsey square angle with twitter  Then you could do kind of you could do something like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So maybe yeah because as boz and our chat room points out quite accurately we chat's a payment platform. That's the real  You know secret. I mean apple messages or facebook messages could is more likely going to be a wechat  Than twitter twitter is not something you you know, you have on your you keep on your watch or your phone ready at  at any time  um twitter is so and historically twitter has been slow to add features because  There if you get too complicated part of the part of the success or at least early on in twitter was its simplicity, right?  180 characters  It was all messages. It was simple  And it's gotten more and more complicated over time  And there's a risk like the like, you know instagram  I think is is is really running that risk by adding all this stuff  And crapping itself up instead of being what it is natively twitter did add a feature today  Which is interesting  twitter notes  Remember twitter bought a newsletter company  Uh, I think just the second in size to substack. I can't remember its name now  But review  Yeah review r e v u e. That's right  Yeah, uh, they are to have somebody young here who has a memory you can remember stuff stacey. I like that about you  Uh  You can now write or will be it's rolling out to some people initially eventually to everybody  a note not just a 280 character

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh tweet but a note which will then a note they show it on the web interface not the mobile interface, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They'll have a link on the mobile interface  So this is their way. I think this is actually pretty smart of becoming a newsletter platform, right?  People are already doing this with tweet threads, which is ridiculous

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because we pay to watch we have the option because we we spend money on twitter blue to see our tweet threads  certified  Uh, okay, you're just in that kind of mood today. I know I'm always i've always no no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, i'm consistent on this. I've always said if you're gonna write a blog post write a blog post  Don't divide it up into 20 separate tweets

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's ridiculous. It's an art form of its own sort

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It well, I I think it's great for like I love tweet threads for like events like if you're at an event and you're like  Oh, that's different. It's kind of like a more fun life. That's different because you're live blogging it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But but but why would somebody take a medium post? I also like shop it up

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then go one slash two slash three. Yeah, just put that in medium that I agree with you on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do it for literally silly stories

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Yeah, there's suspense you can build up  Uh, and and and I can link to or like just one idea in the thread  I often do that. I often say oh, this is the essence of it. This is what I want to point out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't do that. It's like this is your lead right here baby journalist  Nutgraph oh my god, did we jinx each other a nutgraph? Oh no. Oh no  No  So jeff and I might be on the same wavelength do you think that this will

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Eliminate tweet storms and threads or no. No people still do the threads because you could really do a thread as a as a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Note a twitter note, but you can add a thought later. I mean do that all the time where you know sometime later  Oh, I found the answer to that or somebody you can respond. No, that's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody says that if your thread is a conversation  Yeah, that's okay  That's a good point each each item in the thread then people can respond to and now you've got a conversation starter and  But that makes it even more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know this use notes for apologies. That's when you want to say something like oh  Yesterday I said something on a podcast that wasn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Clear or I didn't realize what do you think of this idea though this twitter right idea that it's like a blight basically  Turns twitter into a blog kind of right you could you could make your blog be on twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No  No one's i don't like it. Dave Weiner is very happy about this. He's he says he's been waiting for this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently I like that you have so many platforms to communicate on like I feel like like I've got you know  I am on twitter a lot. I'm I'm do news letters. I do blog posts  I do threads and every now and then I write an actual article for a magazine  And they're all very different like I  I instinctively know which platform to go to for different  things, so I feel like  I feel like all of these are useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess yeah as long as you and then you're you're saying there's a kind of a native  There's a place for each of these there's a native way of writing to each of them  You wouldn't you don't do what a lot of people do which is unfortunate  Which is write a blog post and then kind of copy it to 18 other  Places or write a tweet. I can't even copy my blog post to like that was the that was all the rage for a while  In fact hoot suite and a bunch of apps were created so that you could write one  Message and then have it go to everywhere and I always felt like that was kind of cheating, right?  Well, I cheat

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you do that? Yeah, I was like I actually I use it to publish like I get everyone  I mean I publish something that says stacey published

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tweet my stories via an automated thing. Well, yeah, no, that's fair. That's a public that's publicity  What i'm saying is you write  One message and and use hoot suite or something like that to post it to fit there's you know  Fewer platforms now but first, I mean probably you aunt you do it to instagram facebook and twitter, right?  But it used to be a lot more places typically

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will I will share to twitter in link fin  Depending on what the message is just through one service buffer and it does it automatically throughout the day  Yeah, and and like I said, yeah, that's cheating but it also helps me from a promotional marketing standpoint  And frees up about two hours in a day

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's probably what I don't like about it is it really is just a market is people who use it are marketers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to be a marketing message basically. Yep. Well, but some people are on twitter just like plenty of people  Like linkedin, especially I would say  I check there  Once a day maybe just to see what's filtering up in like the people are talking about in my thread, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want it to be I actually think is what I want. I want to be you and your sandwich or whatever. Yeah, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's still authentic. I still wrote some and basically like minor just like hey, I wrote this thing. It's about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and to be honest, I mean that's the only way I use twitter  I don't put anything authentic on there  But for instance as an example, I wouldn't I would say if you post something on mastodon on twit.social  You should post something different on twitter, but most people don't do that, by the way  Like no to me. That's different audience  It should be a different thing  Right, you should write and I do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do that with some of my content too  Some things don't go to linkedin right goes to twitter in my automation all content should and I also agree with you with  with um  Authenticity because there are times where I will  Directly go to twitter to post something. Yeah, you know and not have it all scheduled out because yeah  There has to be an authentic version of me out there too. Not just the autopilot version, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I mean I would never like not  I mean y'all if you follow me on twitter  You know that I am like most of my stuff is me and not my content or it's me opining about weird stuff like  smart pants  In case so then case so delicious case

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh  All right. So is so now are we thinking positively about elon's?  Interest in twitter or no. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we're still not we're not thinking positive. I mean if it happens, it's gonna happen  I don't think his plans for wechat with the wechatification of twitter  Are going to be  I don't think that's the right way to go necessarily. I also don't know how he could achieve it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, I think the way elon works and this is a perfect example is he just says stuff  I don't think he has a like a plan  At the moment that seemed like a good idea and tomorrow it'll be something else  Which is part of the problem if you wanted to turn it into wechat you would actually have to do a lot of stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He couldn't just a lot say it you won't but do it again to his credit  He's got a history of putting the right people in the right place at the right time. Sure  Although I can't count him out even though he sounds like he's talking out the side of his neck a lot of times  I can't count this guy out. You did see the open

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  letter from space x employees who said  Elon was an embarrassment and a distraction  And  And oh right. Yeah frequent source of distraction and embarrassment through his public actions  They also said the spaceflight firm wasn't living up to either its no asshole mantra or a zero tolerance policy  on sexual misconduct  uh  Elon fired, uh, I think at least four people  Well, he didn't yeah his head of his ceo at space x fired at least four people for  Creating the letter but apparently hundreds of employees signed on to it  Uh, not all of them were fired

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So isn't there some sort of labor law regarding retaliation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I guess it varies from state. No. Yeah, you know, there's some question about whether that was legal and we'll see but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, you can't fire people but if you're just complaining right? Yeah, I think you probably can but again

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've seen that question ant raised by a number of people. Uh  Who apparently know what they're talking about?  um  The document claims that employees this the verge got a hold of it. It was not an I apologize was not an open letter. It was a  private letter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think not on the company slack or something. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in the internal chat system  Employees are being encouraged to sign onto the letters suggestions either publicly or anonymously with the signed version of the letter  To be delivered to the desk of space x president gwen shot. Well  Uh, the document claims that employees across a specter across the spectra  Of gender ethnicity seniority and technical roles have collaborated on writing the letter  um  They say it's not known who wrote the letter the verge says although I believe there were at least four people fired  Probably after the verge wrote this article. This is uh, june 16th  Uh, you know, so I think it's unfortunate because um  If elon just shut up for a little while  Impossible just a smidge just a smidge

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, sure. We wouldn't be talking about him master and he will he will be a chess master good advice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Be a chess master  If you're magnus carlson the champion of the world, you don't go around saying here's what i'm gonna do in my next game  You just do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You just move the pieces just move the pieces

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft meta and others are founding a metaverse open standards group  Apple and google notably not yet members  They will focus on pragmatic action-based actions like hackathons  You couldn't even get through it like  Hackathons well now you're talking and prototyping tools for supporting common standards  They also want to develop a consistent terminology for the metaverse

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, who wants to trademark it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right  uh  Yeah, worldwide web consortium is involved  I don't know though. It sounds a little it doesn't sound like a standards body kind of thing if you're saying well  We just have to agree on the words  It's not like you're saying  Let's let's be interoperable, which is really what I would expect  You don't want to be oh you're going to join a metaverse, but you got to decide which one is it  Is it metas is it apples is it google's is it microsoft's?  Who's metaverse you're going to be in because oh, that's what I thought it's messaging all over again, right?  Where right you've got these silos, but it doesn't look like that's what they're going to be working on  Uh, oh you might be uh excited about this  Also joining nvidia qualcomm the makers of the chips the hardware sony  unity the software used widely by metaverse creations and  lamina one  Which is a blockchain payment startup co-founded by neil stevenson

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yay  Just don't have them right about it  This will be  Forever and ever to get the conclusion i'm a little disappointed in neil I have to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, it'll take it'll take months to clear. Uh, transaction. Well, the good news is no transactions will ever finish. So you  Snow crash author neil stevenson and by the way termination shock author neil stevenson is building a free metaverse called lamina one  He actually was I think I think he's one of the main reasons all these  People are want to want to make a metaverse because snow crash described such an incredibly interesting metaverse  He was really the very first to do it. I think  And uh, and a lot of people were inspired by that  Um, that's great. Yeah, he certainly uh in kryptonoma. He talks about cryptography. So it's not surprising that he might be interested in  Cryptography the project describes itself as a free metaverse aimed at helping get artists and other value creators  Paid properly for their work. So we like that helping the environment  It'll be provably carbon negative. That's one of the big issues people have with cryptocurrency is so how do you how do you do that?  I don't know and  You're asking me  I I host a podcast. I don't know this stuff and and seeing a truly open metaverse gets built  See, this is exactly what i was talking about  Instead of seeing the metaverse vision co-opted by monopolies  Uh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that takes us back to silos then right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it takes us away from silos a truly open metaverse getting built instead of seeing it co-opted by monopolies instead of having meta  as web five  It's what okay web five web five. That's the jack dorsey jack dorsey. Yeah, I think we should we tried to show you the powerpoint  But we we got hopelessly lost somewhere in the middle

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh  So this is not facebook's vision. Well, like let's let's think about this, right if you're going to do a metaverse  There's so many layers you could be open out right? You could have all your hardware work together  You could have like one or two operating systems on which you build things. Do you want to have the same?  vector kind of models for things so you could interchange like  Uh art from that would be good place to another right so that's us  But then if you think about that, they don't want that you make money, right?  So I mean in in somewheres  Wait 10 we used to like build all the way up and it was super cool  Right on the web and then we got kind of too aggressive and built too far down and then we had no  Interoperability, so I think we'll probably move a little bit kind of in the middle here  And maybe that's what  This will be but I have my doubts. I think everyone just joined it for publicity the other thing that uh, lamina

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the lamina one stevenson's thing is  Saying is a not merely a kind of a standard format for stuff  By the way, those formats exist. There's you know, apple's usdz. There's which is an open format  There are a lot of formats for 3d objects. So that's not so hard but payments  There can't be a meta buck and a and a google buck and a microsoft buck  There should be one common payment platform and that's why he's saying you need blockchain because there needs to be one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Decentralized way of accounting so that you don't need a decentralized payment platform for the metaverse

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The credit card processor works just fine. Well, that's what corrie doctorow said isn't it when he was on twitter  He said we're solving all these things that we already have solutions for that are perfectly  sane and sensible and work  Anyway, you can if you're interested in lamina one you can join their discord every time you say that  I think you're saying homo. No homo. No homo. No homo. No one. Hey, why don't you and I start?  A cryptocurrency called homo. No homo. No homo. No. Yeah, it's going to the moon

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to the moon

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  all right, i'm gonna join lamina one because uh  Why not? There's only 3 000 members. So  This is getting added to your mastodon you're getting an early i'll add it to my mastodon  um  Let's see, let's see. So anyway that you know, I don't know we'll have to watch and see what this, you know metaverse open standards  Group is is up to the w3c is involved, which is a good sign the world wide web

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So to stacy's point if I buy my designer clothes on the facebook metaverse, can you wear them? Can I wear them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the microsoft metaverse good question right now if this is no one knows because it's all made up  Well, no, so that's what people think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right people think that's a standard right? But you would have to standardize on so many different like that's all the way up  Sorry application layer, right?  Like even beyond the normal application. So like part of this that gets so  It's like marketing bs is like oh we'll create a standard and they may  but  The the tech standard and the consumer understanding of a standard are very different

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And also, yeah. Oh, yeah the standard especially as like somebody like the world wide web consortium w3c  Who sets the standards for html 5 and all sorts of web standards that we all use  I mean, that's a very complicated technical thing. You want everybody you want all the stakeholders involved in the conversation  It's not clear to me that this is exactly what they're  Are they're trying to do by the way?  Apple's not a member as I mentioned google's not a member niantic  I mean it which is doing, you know, the probably the most aggressive right now ar stuff pokemon go  Uh and roblox the other one that's huge  None of them are members. Maybe they'll join you need unicode fashion unicode luxury fashion. That's what you need

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly for the metaverse exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ikea is part of it here that you can buy now designer fake clothes  This is consumerism gone to its extreme

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, are they fake if balanciaga says they're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  I mean that's just art if you think of fashion as art then they're just doing art in two or  3d for the metaverse. I mean, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this is gonna this is gonna happen it happened, uh  On second life as you said the words linden dollars it happened in second life

The entire internet went down  Thanks to cloud flare and I bet you a lot of the companies that you know  The guy was getting a call in the middle of the night  It's down and you don't know what's going on because you don't have observability implemented in your network  so you've got to try a bunch of different tools and  You know, you're just your heart is pounding the boss is calling you got your team members scrambling  You need new relic you need it  New relic did a study only half of all organizations have implemented observability for their networks and systems  That means half of all the companies out there are getting up in the middle of the night  Heart pounding not knowing what's gone wrong the other half  Fix the problem go back to bed  With new relic  Isn't that that worst feeling what's going on? Is the back end? Is it the front end?  Is the global is it the server is it the network? Is it the cloud provider? Is it our cdn?  Do we have slow running queries? Here's the worst one  Did I introduce a bug in my last deploy?  If you've got new relic you can know exactly what's wrong right down to the line of code  Which means you can fix it fast  Push the fix and go back to bed new relic combines 16 different monitoring products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you remember I certainly do back in the 1900s when the phone company said if it keeps up  We're going to have to hire every woman in the world  to work as operators  Because at the time it was a manual process, right?  And uh, you know number please and you had the person had a patch bay and they would connect the two numbers and you could talk but  That was not scalable. Eventually they came up with  Automated switching equipment and eventually we went digital and solved it entirely. So there are amazon  Oh today they did launch their first autonomous robot. There you go for the warehouse. What do you think the rescue?  There's the answer so in this report which was leaked  Recently was written in mid 2021  They talked about six levers  Amazon could pull to to delay the labor crisis by a few years raising wages was one of them. Oh what a thought  Imagine that they did

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could argue that amazon  Is a major factor in inflation because of wage inflation because they raised their salaries to 15 dollars and forced others to do so, too  But 15 dollars trickle down so low. I know I know  Imagine what it was before. Yeah apple raised their

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  25 starting wage at the apple stores from 20 to 22 dollars and that was to discourage unionization  But the first apple store was unionized this week in tausend maryland maryland. It's happening. Yeah  Uh the other way one of the other levers increasing warehouse automation. So there you go stacey.

Another guy says it'd be good for archery practice  I'm not sure what the guy's name is  Some lockford residents said it could make sense for them. I've got a lot of room. Why not said tracy clark a local amazon customer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm excited and I think you will be too  The npr smart audio report came out. So every year  Npr teams up with edison research to talk to people who own smart speakers and people who don't  Um, and I thought the most interesting bit of this report which I should put in the rundown for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I can I can google it. That's all right. I'll find it. Okay. That's true google that the smart audio report here it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  About my favorite thing to talk about which we don't talk about enough is amazon and google devices talking back  so  there's there's a lot in here like ownership and blah blah blah, but  I don't know about y'all, but I get a lot of  Like pushback from alexa lately and it's like by the way, i'll be like what's the weather and it'll tell me the weather  And it's like by the way  Such and such, you know toilet paper is 50% off  Would you like to add it to your shopping list and i'm like, I hate you go away and I hate it  And it turns out that there are people who don't mind that  And I that was to be the most wasn't that the whole plan of madame a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In amazon is to be able to give you that one little extra in to make you hit buy now or at the cart

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um  No, it was supposed to be a voice interface for for doing things. It was just a new computing program  I mean, I figured i'm sorry. I was just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because that was the first thing that came to my mind years ago when I saw that it was amazon, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, I don't I don't think people like listening to  Their smart speaker that way because you're trying to do something quickly in stopping that process with an ad seems really rude  but  when smart speakers were offering like  When they offered you more information than you requested  40 of people were not bothered at all 42 were bothered a little  When it recommended a feature without your prompting like hey, by the way, if you'd like to learn about your commute  You can ask me blah blah blah  It that didn't bother 39 of people at all and it only bothered 37 a little  And suggesting you purchase something without your prompting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  33 percent of people were bothered a lot by it. Yeah, I don't want to give him telling me to buy stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But 40 percent of people were like, yes, it's not so bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It only bothered you saying that what you said 33 percent were were bothered that it was suggesting the shopping just 33 percent

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just 33 only a third of people were pissed when it suggested that you purchased something without their prompting

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was like that should be like two-thirds. Yeah. Yeah, I hate it. Like you're like  like this happens to us like once a week i'll be like  madam a set an alarm for seven in the morning and it's like  Alarm set for seven p.m. Or seven a.m. Tomorrow. Did you know I could do something else that you don't want me to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hate that and I swear at it every single time. I that probably doesn't help  I don't yeah, I don't want to chatty chatty kathy on my speaker  I this jeez it bother you that the this is from npr and they spent so much time talking about advertising on smart speakers  A significant portion of this was about advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, only like I mean a significant I thought this report was actually hilarious  Because it really shows how stagnant the speaker market is and then it had these hilarious  How it started how it's going memes in there that it's not that stagnant. I mean it's growing a 35 percent of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Americans own a smart speaker. That's pretty good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but if you look at the increase so in part of this is you know increasing from a small number but in 2017  To 2018 they saw 13 increase 2018 to 19 was 16 19 to 20 was 29 percent. I have that graph here  I have that graph here. Yeah, and then but in the last year 21 to 22, it was only a 9 percent  So we've we've stopped increasing growth is slowing. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but what doesn't that make sense considering? It's not like a  smartphone which even with smartphones people aren't buying  Those as often because they send they tend to last up to a certain extent with the speaker  How often do you expect to buy new speakers that um?  That are assistant capable because they're just yeah, I think a lot of the growth happened early on is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People tested one they bought one and tested and then they were like, okay  I'll put three of these interesting or four. Yeah, I'll buy some more

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I I guess this is one of the things you're laughing at the reasons people got a smart speaker in 2017 are identical to the reasons  They got it in 2022. That has not changed number one. Listen to music number two ask questions without needing to type  Number three seems like a fun new gadget

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How often in a day each of you use your smart speaker every day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, many times every day

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and  What did they say? I never really never just saw the need for it. Oh, you're not worried about privacy then it's not a privacy issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  okay, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because  uh, you know, you know about solar spots and you know about sun storms and all of that stuff and  How they can cause problems, but this is one more thing to worry about if you're worried about a giant comet hitting us  This is just one more thing like that  uh every once in a while the sun will  Send out a blast of plasma  Oh, you know almost always doesn't go towards the earth  It's a yes a cme a coronal mass ejection  But if it did hit the earth and it oh, yeah jammer b's all over this and it didn't  Uh, it didn't get bounced away by the earth's magnetic magnetic field because they could be opposite polarity  So it's a lot of ifs  But it would basically blow out all the electronics in the world  There's also a super volcano under yellowstone. Oh, wow. Is that what old faithful is? It's just the tip of the super volcano

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Old faithful is not the tip of the super volcano, but there is a potential super volcano under yellowstone. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there is a deep space  climate observatory  Which is a satellite about a million miles from the earth that analyzes the speed and polarity of incoming solar particles  and  If the clouds magnetic orientation is dangerous and heading towards the earth  We could get an hour of warning before impact

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do we do unplug everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That won't help  Wrap in tin foil, I don't know it is possible to shield stuff  Most stuff is not shielded  The biggest issue is it could knock out the electrical grid  We have a lot of transformers, especially old transformers that would be very susceptible to this and they would blow  and  It could in effect  Render us without power for months in the united states. Imagine how that would be how much fun  That would be  In the summer of 2012 during the historically quiet cycle 24 two mammoth coronal mass ejections  narrowly missed the earth  So  Just something more to sort of cheery. Thank you wired. I particularly like the headline here comes the sun to end civilization  Matt ribo writing in wired magazine this week, but the sun the sun gives life  Yeah  It does  And it takes it away. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, we did it again stacey  What's that? Oh, what'd you do? We're jinxing again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, same thing you said the same thing  Yeah  I don't know man. All right. Now, I think I better do a little break here  um, although yeah stacey, I actually like this smart audio report I feel like we didn't even really  62 percent of adult americans use a voice assistant

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My favorite stat was that the number of people like the number of tasks people complete  We actually went through like you were doing kevin and I we talked about this on my show  We went through and figured out what we talked to our voice assistants to do and surprisingly  we had a hard time getting above 10 we made it but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We actually only do a few things with these that's I think that's really common. I mean, I think  Playing music and setting timers, you know, it's like kind of for most people  Mostly what they do  We ask we ask about the weather, you know before we're you know  Before we're going out before getting deciding what to wear lisa or I will say what's what's the weather going to be in petaloma?  And because I have samuel l jackson on my amazon echo as well as melissa mccarthy  Depending on my mood. I might say hey melissa. What's the weather going to be or hey samuel?  What's the weather going to be and he swears by the way when he tells you what the way he's really good. It's really funny  um  And then uh, we can set alarms. Oh, we'll uh, you know frequently we say hey siri  Play ocean sounds when we go to bed and there's a nice pleasant ocean sounds  Coming, you know, we have serious  Apple's little speakers by the bed and we listen to music and stuff. We use it quite a bit  And unfortunately  They are constantly beeping and booping at us. They're triggered accidentally all the time  so right  That's a you know, I mean then and they mentioned that in this in this study a surprisingly large number of people even those  Who uh have smart speakers are worried that they're they're listening in  so  Yeah, but that's everybody worries about yeah, we're just always worried about that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, we always think we're so important and people want to talk to us

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  47 percent of smart speaker owners worry that our smart speaker is always listening  Uh, wow 43 percent worried that the smart speaker could allow the government to listen into our private conversations  But 58 agree that the companies are going to keep your information secure

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I never really had much success with the  Assistant stuff, uh, maybe it's because i'm on android and it's not as great as  The mademais and siri, but I just never really had the desire to do anything other than ask for the weather or  Maybe play a song but most of the time when I ask it to play a song it struggles to find a song that i'm  Looking for so I don't I hardly even use it and I just pick up my phone and type in what I want to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google actually was the worst when it came so i've got spotify integrated and google spotify api was terrible in the beginning  It's much better now. Okay, I used to always put the karaoke version of things

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was a big problem. Wasn't it? There's a lot of gamification on spotify  Where people put stuff because you're going to get money for the play so they'll put stuff hoping to get you  And uh, and and there's a lot of crap on spotify taking advantage of that. Maybe spotify's fixed that  I think there must be spotify, right?  I think the more you use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was google working with it was the api the way they had set up their api is what I heard interesting i'll be right back

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh the number of speaker owners who listen to a podcast  On their smart speaker by the way something else I do in a typical week increased 22 over the past five years  So it's now 39  Of smart speaker owners listen to podcasts. I do that all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But see I wonder what that number is that says from 2017 to 2022 what is it from like  2020 to 2022 I bet it's more significant then right maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It increased over the past five years, but yeah, I don't know  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean you could ask npr because I bet most of it happened during 2020 to 2022

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would assume that when we were stuck in the house. Oh, you're right because you were listening to the car mostly. Yeah  It's certainly something we're aware of  You know we do after every show we do a flash briefing  Snippet from the show and make that available to echo users and we definitely think that for podcasting  One of the always one of the issues of podcasting at the early days was how hard it was  Like you had to jump through hoops to listen  So I've I've always said if as soon as it's as easy to listen to a podcast as a radio show  We will do better than radio and I think that that's come true  And a lot of that is due to smart speakers, you know, just the ease of listening  You can by the way cars and cars, but you can do yeah  It's easier in cars too now because your smartphone is already connected to your car. So you can easily listen to a podcast  But uh just for people listen you can ask for twig, you know  You can say play the latest play the latest this week in google podcast and almost all of them will do that correctly  You can listen to twit live our live stream  Amazon echo used to call it twit live. I don't know if they fixed that or not  I'm good with that man. I'm good with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe i'll try this assistant stuff a little more over the next week or so  But I just never really had any interest the only thing that I can say I use regularly is if I have those  pixel buds in and the little notification chime goes right and so then i'll just tap and hold and listen to the notification but  That's about it because when I try to respond to say a text message  it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Crap show. Oh, I do that all the time. Do you have any smart stuff in your home ant?  Do you have any smart light bulbs or anything like that?  so that that might be like  Probably half of my things are instructed in my oven to preheat or my thermostat to go or my lights to turn on or doors to lock  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just I every night when I go to bed. I say hey gook turn the lights out  And the hue lights that I have that are hooked up and connected to the google  Those are it's about nine lights turn off  That's a nice. That's a very nice thing, you know, it's a nice feature. You should have a good night routine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, why don't you advance yourself a little bit add in your door locks be like, I don't have automated door locks. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yet, I don't think so. I thought about it or make sure it's closed it could because I have  A smart garage door so it could do that  I actually have a routine where I walk around the house make sure all the windows and doors are closed  I check the garage and then I'll lock the door and as i'm going by the  The last stage I say hey gook turn out the lights and that's the last stage before I go to bed

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's I mean, so that's the last thing you don't do a vocal warm-up to go to bed or no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you only do that once a day  After you work out when you do your push-ups  I want you to go mommy made me match my m&m's  Here's one reason I think there's some growth in this  small kids  In fact, this was the number one reason for wanting a smart speaker was to entertain children and that's increased 36  Actually, it's not the number one reason the number one reason is discover new songs  But the fastest growing reason is entertain children and that makes by the way podcast is number three. So thank you  But that makes a lot of sense everybody knows the young kids complains  Because their young kids will say, you know play uh baby shark over and over and over  Yeah kids love it though because they've got something that they can boss around authority over. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well and like if your parents don't let you have access to a smartphone. I mean if you think about it kids  It's greater variety than like those toys used to punch for like, you know  You'd punch something in to play a little song and you'd have like three options, right a busy box  You can tell it to do whatever. Yeah. Yeah, I mean  I liked it because it did give my daughter when we got the it gave her the ability when she was about six or seven  to control things in the house that she  And play her music in a way that she couldn't because everything was digital by then  Because if you think about it  I mean I had a radio  Right. I had a record player  So but she had none of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No when my son, uh got out of college  You know, you would give him a stereo maybe or you know, something like that. I gave him the google home max  That's his music  It's a great little speaker. He can it does everything. It's a great choice. I think  And now he carries out, you know, he doesn't carry it around  But he every time he moves he brings his uh, his home max. That's a stare. That's his stereo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I still play your sodas

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're just so stupid

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Told you so  They're so smart speakers. I'm just disappointed. I think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Honestly, the google hub max is a better choice. I put madame on my sonos  But for some reason it stops playing after 15 minutes or not even that long. Maybe 10 minutes. It'll just stop  Oh, that's another thing. I did that for a while. Yeah, did you ever figure out why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nope, I just threw it madame away

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I put her in the storage closet put her in the closet. That's all madame deserves

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't play a whole symphony. All I can ever get is one of those stupid movement. Yeah movement for people who don't like classical music  I don't know how to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to ask for the album  Uh  So you want deutscher gramophone opus number 37 the mozart

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Albums they never mention movements and I think about it. Yeah, you asked for the album. I think it'll play the whole thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, okay. Yeah  What was I gonna say about uh  Sonos, do you have you have sonos stacy or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got rid of most of my sonoses, but I still have I still have one  I don't have the I was going to get with the one with the voice assistant just to test it out  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have the moves or the more most modern ones  And so those are they charge it on a charger but you carry around and those do madame or google or sonos is a voice assistant  but um  And they sound good. I mean they're good speakers if I can if I could get it so it didn't stop  That's another thing by the way listening to audio books as well as podcasts  So if you have a madame and you use audible  You can you can just say literally read to me and it will pick up wherever you lift off  That's most of how I listen to neil stevenson  You know moving around the house and stuff  All right  Now I really do have to take a break because otherwise this show is going to be eight hours long and stacy's gonna kill me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's gonna kill me. I'll just leave it. I'll be like, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought you did actually when you said I have to go I thought you would never come back to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh good, and it's uh the guy from breaking bad  Somebody told me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, and what's interesting they actually didn't they had a couple of him recording things  But they had him record a whole bunch and then they actually computer generated  90 or five percent only like the that's how google does it too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah breaking giancarlo esposito's voice. They synthesized it. They call it esposito ai  He just has to do enough he has the prosody records the prosody  And then uh, then they can uh, they can modify it I now that I know that  I'm definitely turn that on  Uh, that's pretty cool  Esposito's voice may eventually converse in more languages than english his english and spanish  In fact, they just added ukrainian  Uh, which is really cool. So as long as they have the prosody  I guess they can apply it to other languages. You might be speaking it kind of in a non-native  way  I would be speaking in a non-native way anyway, though. Well, but you should get somebody who's a native speaker, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're not gonna have a person  They're gonna have an ai. Yeah, they're gonna essentially have a deep fake using the prosody of a native speaker

Transcript:  But so that so that so when rupert goes which may happen never because he's a vampire  um  Lachlan is now going to take over but there are rumors that james would  Manage a palace coup given the structure at that point right and could change fox news  You know my I want to add this it was my father my 96 year old father who I loved dearly used to be a fox news  watcher and  Everything that came along with that then in the pandemic his hearing aid basically broke  Uh, which we didn't really fix until we do that and got him up here  And so he didn't really watch fox news for two years  It it it cured him  He has said joe biden's doing a good job.

Transcript:  But wait in 1986  In 1986 which is if i'm correct like 40 years ago  He left boeing to pursue comedy  Writing and performing for the local sketch television show almost live where he regularly conducted wacky science experiments  so  That he was serious, I guess yeah, he's an engineer. He has an engineer mechanical engineering background  I don't know is mechanical engineering a science or yes. Yes applied science. It's close enough. It's more than I have  I have a chinese. I don't even have a degree. I studied chinese. So nothing  I've got nothing  uh  Anyway, so I apologize bill nye for besmirching you  He is a science guy

Transcript:  There's not much they could do to you if they hack your jacuzzi, but they they can't apparently  You know get your name address and phone number that's about it  Yeah, it's not the worst. Yeah, it's not the worst. Well, what story were you avoiding leo?  I was going to be talking about the one where it turns out that aviation fuel for small planes is still leaded it has been

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah for years, which is incredibly depressing, uh, especially my iq is like seven points lower because i'm a child of the leaded gasoline area

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my god. Well, that's a relief because if you are any smarter  Yeah, we'd be terrified you would be alexa  You would be lamb jobs a lot of a lot of small airports though are near residential neighborhoods  and this lead is very much a reason why  Children have lower iqs health problems. It's not a good thing  And of course leaded gasoline was eliminated years ago, but apparently not  There's a flying over a 192 million. Is this a jet or is this just small? No, it's small planes  192 million gallon a year loophole. This is quartz  which uh kind of discovered this if you're a  Piston engine airplane. There's 170 000 of them  You are because you need the compression ratio of lead  Uh, in fact, they really haven't found a solution for it. They're still trying to make a gasoline that would work in these small planes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  600 tiny hamsters

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  Quartz just published a six-month investigation about how aviation fuel is poisoning a generation of americans  And after decades of delays and resistance by oil companies aircraft manufacturers even federal agencies  There may be a solution in aida, oklahoma  So thank you quartz and of course they have video of small planes flying over playgrounds because what is the solution?  Uh a new kind of uh, I guess gasoline  Oh, okay, it's like the hamsters  Yeah  No, it's not hamsters

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you fly in a electric powered plane?  Yeah, does that sound freakier or no? No, no, no i'd no i'd do it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem is uh is uh distance, of course  Yeah, uh, because the batteries are very heavy and they you know, you can't carry enough batteries to go a long way  I think actually there are uh, i'm not a fan of hydrogen fuel cells for personal vehicles  Although mike elkinson loves his toyota mariah because he lives next door to a hydrogen fueling station

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's a hydrogen plane in termination shock. Remember it shed the right land every 100 something miles. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it does fuel cells make more sense for long distance trucking for things that needed a lot of energy in a small space  And airplanes, uh, but yeah, but you don't we don't have the infrastructure yet. She had to land  All the time. It was very frustrating  Uh  Let's see. You ready for the top 50 most popular websites for news in the world?

Transcript:  T-mobile already does they both have 5g based and I have to say I bought verizon for my daughter. I've mentioned this before  Their their home-based 5g.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they want people to do her. Yeah martin nissenholz who was the first vp of of news at the times  People went after him and said it's original sin you gave away the content  He said if we hadn't done that we would never be as big as we are to convert  2 to paid right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the key is you got to convert a certain percentage. Is it only 2? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's roughly two to three percent  Of paid news out of the total audience. The total audience is huge  But that's a lot better than any other news site if you go to the you know, the podunk daily disgrace in any metro area  conversion is  You know point three percent and the audience is lots of

Transcript:  He's uh, he's kind of an independent investigative reporter it's only you know five bucks a month  He kind of backs up his conspiracies. He's got a million almost a million subscribers though. So that's a lot of money  Wow, is it is it a is it a conspiracy thing? No, no, it's he he's on the edge of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo you did a horrible disservice on this spacex  Dish

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's do it 5g story spacex. No, no, I did I was just that was called a hot take from reading the headline

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no. Okay. So here's the deal  They're fighting over 12 gigahertz spectrum  So both of them well dish is like we can share and spacex is like, uh, no we can't because our satellite dishes  Currently the way they're designed there will be interference with the 12 gigahertz spectrum. So basically so this is just dishes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  5g not anybody else's 5g. This is dishes 5g

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a dish doing a spectrum grab or rather trying to do one  Um, so in dish has done this before I should never have said that because charlie ergan will come after me  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  God but dish says the opening the 12 gigahertz  Range to 5g represents a win-win for all involved

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, yeah, so this is this is straight up we had this with like remember the dtv transition back in 2008  I mean, this is this is very common. So what's going to happen is the fcc is actually going to have to do its job  Which it's actually really good at it has the technical expertise  To to assess this there is probably interference. It's probably an issue of like hey spacex  You're going to have to put more shielding on your dishes. It might narrow the capabilities of spacex to do this  In addition, we'll have to do something with like probably  Guard bands to help reduce that interference, but this is actually an interesting and meaty story

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you. Okay, go on. Thank you. No, i'm glad you looked it up. I mean literally I didn't even know about it  Till I look at it. I read the article  In its analysis spacex claims and again the fcc will be the ultimate arbiter here spacex claims some amount of harmful interference from terrestrial mobile service  Within the 12.2 to 12.7 gigabits  Uh giga gigabyte hertz gigahertz. Yeah, there's an extra b in there and this this might be a typo  The 12.2 to 12.7 g hz it should be not gb hz spectrum would occur about 77 percent of the time  Which could result in full starlink outages three quarters of the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is an issue of like is this real interference or did you just design your equipment bad?  Right, like remember all the well, that's the altimeter altimeter problem, right? Exactly. It's altimeter problem  It's the wireless mic problem and to be fair you design for the cheapest constraints  You have to work with right?  And so if there's nothing in that band and then what always happens is when you start using that band for everything else  You're like, oh crap. Yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, so um, yeah, all right, so that's it I just I sorry no no no no  I count on you for that. No, thank you. I appreciate it  really important  Uh, I don't want to misrepresent it. I just you know, I could see why  They might not like verizon doing it, but dish doesn't even have a product yet. This was part of the t-mobile  sprint merger  T-mobile promised that oh, no, no, don't worry. You're not going to lose a carrier  You're going to gain dish as a 5g carrier dish had no infrastructure hadn't set it up at all  Now they're rushing to set it up, which is good. I guess  Except that sounds like they're doing so in a way that is potentially bad for others

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dishes only 5g phones right now  Costs nine hundred dollars. Yeah, the motor allege plus that's crazy. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That I think this was a bill of goods that t-mobile sold the uh sold the uh ftc  To allow them to merge with sprint  And and I think it was a it was a bogus. I don't think dish really was ready to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dish is always  Okay, charlie ergan

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who is the chairman of dish? I know well i've been on i've been on charlie's show  He has a show charlie chat  Yeah  I was a guest on charlie chat. I flew out to denver and everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, i've done something for dish, but I did I meet charlie? I don't know. I can't remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was many years ago. This was when dish was just getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Started so dish is trying to cover 20 percent of the u.s and they're gonna do that they think  um people um, but this additional stuff charlie is very famous for  Just

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's a tough guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's he's ballsy he goes through the fcc. Yeah, does it yeah, so he's he's one of those folk  Um, so this does not surprise me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They were actually in a fight with t-mobile because t-mobile wants to shut down the 3g uh network  and uh and  And dish was fighting with him and I was just in has  Hasn't it been shut down by now? Yes, uh, they shut it down on march 31st. It's like fairly recently. Yeah  Uh this uh recently uh, this story came out today. I think oh no in february  Uh dish appears to be mending fences with t-mobile ergen also said  Uh in february at and t will still remain our primary vendor and the one we work with on a day-to-day basis  Dish had struck a 10-year five billion dollar wholesale deal. Oh, they're gonna be an mvno for at and t  Dish owns boost mobile ting mobile  And republic wireless that I didn't know  They've been buying up. They they ting used to be two cows  They've been buying them up. They own boost mobile ting mobile and republic wireless  Wow  Okay, wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh ting was sold in august of 2020. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they were an advertiser for a while. Yeah  In fact, we still use ting for my father-in-law

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dish confirmed it sunk about 250 million dollars into costs related to the cdma shutdown fiasco  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, sorry, I just had to circle back on that because I was like wait a second, okay much respect  If there's one thing I know it's spectrum

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  T-mobile was supposed to help dish create a competitive replacement for sprint  But they've been fighting ever since to sell regulators in their 26 billion dollar mega merger t-mobile and sprint executives told  Anyone who'd listen the deal would provide near miraculous benefits economists were warned that you know, us telecom mergers are  problematic and promises are historically meaningless  And that the reduction in overall competitors was sooner or later result in higher prices and job cuts  So the US antitrust enforcers concocted an elaborate workaround. This is from the verge  They would erect dish network as the nation's new  Fourth major wireless carrier under the plan dish received some t-mobile spectrum  That's how they got boost mobile and the insurance that t-mobile would help dish run a mobile virtual network operator  But then they got in a fight and now they're replacing t-mobile with at&t  What a mess  You don't want to be a telecom reporter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was a telecom. I know it was super fun. Was it gosh it seems like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are such characters their characters. Yeah, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know the other it's way more fun than being like a social media reporter. Yeah, I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I know and it's it's chewier

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's more and there's physics and you can't argue with physics and I love that because  People will be like we're gonna do this and i'm like, how would you do that? That doesn't make sense, right? Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's not chrome it's um  There is a password go to settings privacy auto fill service from google passwords click the gear add a shortcut

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No google password manager is what they're storing your stuff in chrome in  Okay, so this is google pet it's the same thing  So if you store something in chrome you end up storing it in your google password manager

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's giving you the link to that you can go to passwords.google.com and see them. They have on-device encryption  Which just got added don't do it though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I guess if there's on-device encryption  I mean they do make you add like before you can see any of your passwords you do have to verify right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, put your it used to be you could see it in the clear in the browser  And google's answer to that. Yes  Really?  This was not too long ago google's answer to that is well, you you know, you're on the device. Of course you can  Like well, you must be authenticated  Yeah, that was not a good answer. So obviously they've taken it more seriously because yeah, it used to be in the clear  Which was really a good reason not to use it  uh, oh  Here's the answer to your question chrome 103 replaces built-in password list with android's default manager  So android does in fact have a password manager separate from chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's only on android

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This explains why i'm always and I switched to last pass but god everywhere i'm at i'm just constantly entering passwords

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like that's my whole life. I'm praying pass keys just takes over the world  Although yesterday on the security now steve gibson once again raised issues  Uh with pass keys the chief of which is  And and the final alliance says yeah, we haven't really figured out how to do this. It's non-portable  So if you set up pass keys with your apple device, you're stuck. You can't move to an android device and vice versa  uh, and they and and  The the final alliance says yeah, it would be insecure to allow export of passport passwords. So we're not gonna

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Go

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But every password manager does allow exported passwords for this very reason I think it's a very important feature  So here I am. I went to passwords.google.com  And these are passwords saved in my google account and they are to apps as well as to web pages  So that's good  There's only you're not supposed to use those. I mean, oh, I don't this is from old. This is old

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is like you can do it for things like your jacuzzi because that's insecure anyway, but don't do it for like your banking

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, it's already insecure. You're fried anyway, so that's in chrome 103  Google password manager. Wow, this whole show is about it  The whole changelog google password manager starts offering on-device encryption. I just mentioned that on android  Ios and chrome so it is cross-platform  Maybe this isn't a bad choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the issue is when things are stored in the browser

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they're not this is this is that's a new thing. This is not chrome's password manager. This is a new  thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. Yeah, and it's done on a device. Well, yeah, because it's it's not just in chrome is the point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, because what is it the emoted net or something what virus emoted net?  browser

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The encryption key used to access your passwords is safely stored in your google account  So google has access to it and google then uses this key to decrypt your passwords  On-device encryption cannot be removed once set up and can be enabled on multiple devices  I you know, we got I have to investigate this more but it sounds like  Google has  Kind of beefed up its its password manager beyond chrome  It's now, you know device wide  It has on-device encryption  Sounds pretty good  At least it's a free choice. It's better. Let's put it that way  I mean, I think you're right to use last pass or bitwarden our sponsor or some third party, but  Google tv profiles are here  I signed in my google tv this morning and it said hey profiles are here. Who are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we got really worried about it and that's why we we started to see equipment manufacturing go overseas we freaked out we created some attack  And that was in the what?  late 80s early 90s

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That dominance is shifting away writes the author of this sub stack  peace dylan patel  Uh to the two countries that pose as geopolitical risks  Us share of chip manufacturing is at all time low thanks to tsmc and samsung and others  The us will lose the semiconductor industry unless immediate action is taken. This is a national security crisis

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the reason we lost it is because it is so freaking expensive and wall street punishes companies for investing in these long-term  I mean this is like basically saying yeah  Capitalism is dumb when it comes to rnd and that's going to cost us in the long term  Capitalism is bad for long-term investments

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, you know what? I played I I knew  That that could but the problem is I don't like the chilling effect of this content id  and so i'm not gonna play that game and the good news is we're fortunate because  We don't the bulk of our revenue comes from sources other than youtube  Uh, I mean we take a financial hit but it's not it's not a huge one  And I you know, it's a few thousand bucks and I don't  For me, uh, I far prefer not to not to kowtow to the chilling effects. We do and all of our producers yell at me  You know everybody yells at me. They say don't play that you're gonna get us taken down comment  but that's  I'm not gonna bow to that kind of bs. It's we have a fair use right to play it  It's news coverage. We're covering that story  And uh, it's fair use but you know, that's not how content is the time the appeal works  Most of the time it does and if somebody like this  Uh, you know a studio canal if they said nope  Take it down. Don't we take it down? I don't know. Did we get a strike?  I don't think we got a strike, but I think they did. No, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to show you something really awesome. That's saving the planet  Saving my wallet and giving me a great product  I love and i'm talking about blue land. Did you know that an estimated five billion?  Plastic hand soap and cleaning bottles are thrown away every year and they live in the landfill forever  They don't they don't biodegrade. You can't recycle them  Wouldn't it be cool if you could order beautiful high quality?  bottles for your cleaning products  and  Refill them time after time so you don't throw them out. Well, that's what blue land does  Furthermore blue land helps the planet because in almost every case  These cleaning products are 90 percent water. So we're trucking around water  For no reason at all wasting energy wasting resources  All blue land does is you know, you buy the beautiful Instagramable bottles  This is the multi-surface cleaner nice lightweight plastic bottle good cleaner bottle, right?  Or for the hand soap, they're beautiful heavy glass because you don't want them to fall over when you pump them  You you buy the bottles you use them forever. And when you run out they send you this is the active ingredients a little tablet  You fill the bottle with warm water you put in the active ingredients it fizzes it dissolves now  This is exactly the same  It is a high quality cleaning product  But you didn't ship all that water all around the country and you're not throwing out these beautiful bottles blue land  Was founded on the belief and I i'm 100 but with them that a cleaner planet starts by eliminating plastic waste  We're trying to do that throughout our lifestyle  And by creating powerful effective cleaners for the entire home, there's really no reason to do it  They have toilet bowl tablets you put in there. They're so good. We use their laundry detergent their little tablets for that. No plastic  we use their  Their uh hand soap in every sink of the house  And it smells great. By the way, there's some wonderful scents iris agave lavender eucalyptus  Uh, they have special scents for seasonal holidays and so forth. They smell so good  They do the job. They have scent free by the way, we use their scent free laundry soap. They have dishwasher soap. They have  dishwashing detergent  all of this  without the waste  These beautiful high quality forever bottles start at ten dollars when you buy a kit  They're meant to be reused forever. The refills are two dollars and less  That's all for a whole fresh new bottle compare that to what you pay in the store  It saves you all the only thing you're going to throw away is your your outdated notion that earth friendly stuff  Doesn't work. It works  It works and it works great. It saves you money. I love this.

Transcript:  This i'm not editing  Uh, mr. Ant pruett your pick of the week

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, I um  If you're looking at my camera right now  I have what's called a pro mist filter on the lens and what that does is basically  Soften my image because yes, we want a lot of pretty pixels and the image to be crispy and so forth  But some of these cameras they they have you a little too sharp. Yeah, this filter  Will just soften it a little bit and it'll also help the lights bloom such as that one  Makes it bloom a little bit and it'll look a little bit better  And you can get this one from tiffin. That's the one that I use  And yeah, they're not cheap. I recommend the 1 8th if you go with 1 4th or  Or bigger it starts to get a little too sort of hazy looking  And for those that said hey that thing is too expensive  Moment as recommended by one of our club tit twit members. He recommended the moment centibloom  Which looks like it does the same thing when it's and it's just a couple bucks cheaper. So well moments are made for  Camera phones. Well, they have some um, they have a dslr bar. Oh they do. Oh, all right  Oh, yeah, look at that. So it gets the lights to bloom more

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I find if I just breathe on my lens a little bit. It's gonna look like that  Rub a little sometimes that helps but when it's 100 degrees outside, yeah  Sometimes that helps but when it's 100 degrees outside, yeah  Nice. Yeah, I think too sharp is not we're getting used to the too sharp though. I mean that's kind of the style now everything's  Looks like this camera that I got. Yeah, I was just you go really high on sharp. Yeah, it's too sharp. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I demoed it was one of the canon cameras last year and  It hurt me pulling the the video up into the editor. I was like man, that's just way too crispy  Isn't that funny? It's because I didn't have any type of filter on the front of it to you know, cut it back some  So get a mist next  Yeah mist filters. They're highly underrated in my opinion  Next is the folks at adobe had their um summer premiere pro update  um  They basically tried to make it  Easier to do um workspaces and and create vertical video  In your workspace like right now I had a preset built in because I know i'm going to work on something  That's a square video versus something that's a a real I just have little presets already built them and there's like, you know  What this is the future?  Let's just go ahead and put these presets in there for everybody  So that's one thing and they had us some performance updates and whatnot, but I thought that was cool  And lastly capture one is an adobe lightroom alternative in the photography space. They had some updates  Including wireless tether tethering an ipad app and um  A tandem app that allows you to share your live shoot  With a client that's on set or even online so they can see some of the shots and make uh suggestions to your  Frame in and stuff like that
