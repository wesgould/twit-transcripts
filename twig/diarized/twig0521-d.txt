Transcript:  How you doing Stacey? I'm doing well. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's good to see you again, and then and I have this sheet that John gave me to introduce  our other esteemed  Jeff Jarvis  Yeah, I don't have this memorized the Leonard Tao professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University  Of New York and the director of the town night center for entrepreneurial journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism  at the City University of New York  That happens every time right every time you do the show with the oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what he wants to make fun of me. Oh, he calls me a full TV guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is impressive whatever I just read I don't understand a word of it whatever it is that's impressive it's it's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's nice people give us money to do things. It's great right on good to see you guys again

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see here and of course we have we have Karsten on the ones and twos  Back there hello. He's on the turntables  Zeros and ones I guess would would be more  Technologically appropriate, but the ones and twos like if you're going out to the club you got turntable number one and turntable number two  They're the ones that the twos that's Karsten

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, maybe not two turntables and a microphone yes  Basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something like that seven million buttons and a microphone seven million glowing buttons  Where do we begin as relates to Google this year? Did you guys read the?  The what is it's on wired the piece about three years of misery  Inside of Google the happiest company in technology  Natasha Tiku wrote this feature for wired she spoke with  47 Google employees past and present  to kind of get a sense of the temperature and you know the  everything that's happened over the last three years all the changes that Google's gone through and  I know I thought it was just a fascinating kind of look  insider look at how Google has maneuvered some of the fires and and  Everything that I think you know initially Google's been a very ideological  Company very open to sharing perspectives and keeping the company is open and and welcoming as possible  And the last three years have have forced Google into many different corners where it's really challenged  That ethos and the article does a great job walking through it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does and it also it does a good job of pointing out  What I imagine is kind of a microcosm of many things and what's happening at many companies  Since for sure the Trump presidency with kind of the polarization of society and  you know Google is just getting it worse because probably its role it plays as a platform the  The culture it has about being yourself and speaking out that a lot of tech kind of companies have  So I I don't know and and also that whole don't be evil thing that I know it's abandoned but still is  Associated with Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, whether whether Google  Wants to shake it or not whether they think they're moving on from that or not that will always follow them around  and  You know and maybe it should maybe it maybe it helps to kind of keep them honest  as far as that's concerned, but  Anyways, if you haven't read the read the article, it's a it's a long piece  It's a feature piece for wired so it's gonna take some time to get through but  it really kind of focuses on you know, James deMore and  The kind of shift that that forced or rather I think what that did is that kind of  Illustrated the voices inside Google weren't as you know as as all on the same side of the page  As maybe even Google imagined it was and you know all of the internal  Kind of message boards and the activity happening there and and that you know  Finally there were eventually people from the inside who are willing to kind of go to war  against Google from the inside and make all that stuff public and how that's forced Google to kind of change its ways and  I don't know. It's not not an easy problem for Google. I think I don't think it's an easy problem for the country

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we're gonna be real. I think this is it  Yeah  This is happening everywhere. But yes, they get it worse because well  You kind of see the same thing if they could figure this out internally they probably could apply it  Across they could use those insights to you know help  I don't know deal with YouTube results and filter various other services so we get less like reactive and  content designed to I don't know  engage people in things like white supremacy and  Less reflective thought I'm kind of babbling. I'm gonna stop

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's move on  From this this story. It's probably a better read than anything. So go ahead and and check it out  Let's see here any competitive stuff like when I was going through the rundown for this  I was like, what is like the major Google News right now?  And I feel like I'm having a really hard time pointing my finger on like what major has happened with Google this last week  So I feel like it's a bunch of little little random pieces here and there it's August

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what happens in August and I would say like I would love I don't know if Jeff's really excited to do this  But I wanted to talk about the the search engine auction mostly because they don't understand it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, let's do that. I don't fully understand it either because there's there's an angle in here  There's a weird twist in here, which is that the regulators came after them and said you just can't you know?  Become do it on your own or decide what to do on your own. So you have to do something and it has value  It's not like they should give it away  Right. It has wait big value

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We should start with what's actually happening because I think we talked about it a little last week and this is over in the EU  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so they announced last week Google announced last week in response to the whole five billion dollar fine  By the EU was part of the antitrust violation ruling that it would hold closed auctions for search engines  That want to be included in this new like search provider  Pop-up or whatever happens in Android phones when this is very similar

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very similar to if people remember the Microsoft's browser ballot, right?  You basically you get a list when you first oh when you like very first download an open Chrome you get a list of  Which who do you want to be your search provider?  Do you want Google? Do you want duck duck go and?  so Google is  Google has decided to have an auction for like the top however many slots on this thing and  strangely enough it's  Come the its competitors are somewhat averse to paying them to be on this list

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah  Ecosia is is one of the browsers and they are calling it unethical and a competitive in itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Duck duck go is also duck duck goes also the first one you just listed. I'm amused. They're they're so European

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They use a bunch of their profits to plant trees, right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're they're mad. So when you first open when you first open Chrome this this pop-up will show up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They could pay in carbon credits  What has value yeah carbon credits help value, okay keep going I'm sorry kidding

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's true  Yeah, so that would that would appear  And Google said when it announced this news, it would take the top three bidders in any given market  and  You know basically those top three bidders would end up in that menu by default ordered at random  Google thinks that's a fair solution  Because as you know as you mentioned  This sort of selection has some sort of value  Browsers like a coja and duck to go and definitely is some of the smaller players in the field are saying that this just kind  Of pushes them out of contention, right the bigger search engines  With the with the money that they're making can't compete with a browser like a coja. That is like an alternative  That focuses on privacy and special causes especially like you said planting trees in the case of a coja

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they can't explain this to me too Karsten  This is so so Google can't be the default search anymore the user every time has to pick a default search engine  Wait, yeah, this is only if you opt out of Google. This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you first download Chrome in the EU  Right, you're setting up your and you're setting up your or you're setting up your Android phone exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'll get this and so so Google just de facto is not the default choice exactly  That's kind of I think that's kind of ridiculous on its face, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The EU disagrees with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's that's a fairly major, you know restraint of trade for an American company on its own  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they did it they did the same thing to Microsoft in the in the early 2000s with the browser ballot, so  This is yeah, that's it all the times are good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know, this is what happens when you close the door after what is it?  You close the barred after the horses go for gone. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Horse of the rear end. Yeah  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know. I I wish I mean I do I do like using alternative browsers, but sometimes  You know my default is always to try to use a different browser and then to go back  But you know most people don't have time for that. You really shouldn't make them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To be clear. This is not about browsers. This is not search engines. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's what I mean  I keep saying browsers and I'm envisioning a lot of people make say make that mistake, but it's not yeah  It's it's very specifically  if you're using  Google or duck duck go or Bing or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the search engines. I'm curious to know how this interplays into Android  Like into the home screen and stuff like you know, you can't choose on the home screen different

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was I was futzing around with my settings at some point in time and I realized I can turn my search bar  into a different search engine in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On my you mean the Google search bar on the home screen  Uh-huh. Oh, okay. No, you can probably do that in settings. Yeah, actually references

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm like, you know how sometimes you're just messing around on your phone and you get something you're like, whoa

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, yeah, there's a reminder. No, you're absolutely right now that I now that I think about it search  Bar. Yeah, I'm not really quite sure what that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Search G board now your way of ahead of me. I'm like, where is the settings icon?  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pull down the shade  Also my my search foo of  Settings is not working for me right now  So I'm not able to get to it, but I think you're absolutely right there  There is a way to go in there and change that now do does each  search engine have to provide something in order to appear there or is it just I  Don't know. I don't I mean like does

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ran across like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean just yeah, I'm just kind of curious like a kosha, you know  If they're a lower like if they have far less money than most other search engines  Let's say to develop these features is this a feature that they actually need to develop in order to be compatible with it  Or is it just we have a search engine therefore it can surface there  I'm not really quite sure but that could be another another obstacle for them. I suppose I do not know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe it was in Google Assistant or the Google there are so many freaking Google things  Anyway, do not get me started on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  indeed  So many Google things  But also antitrust related 23 job finding search sites in Europe are calling  For an order by the EU to stop Google from anti-competitive behavior on that front

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're charged their specific. Yeah, what's their specific allegation of anti-competitive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say that Google's job search widget something that appears at the top of search results for relevant job search terms  Is unfair?  When compared to the marketing investment that competitors have to spend to do the same thing  And also, you know that it it only surfaces  Certain job sites within that tool others get pushed down further

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That sort of thing. Now, of course the consumer argument here is  that  Google is making it  easier to  Find jobs directly and did not have to go through 40 different places and they have the data and they do it  So this is this is a you know, there's commerce involved here, but whether you're looking for  You know, when was Michael Jackson born or you're looking for a job?  There's data at the ready and Google's philosophy is to try to get it to you more more than not, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think part of their complaint is at least the the sites that are calling for this order  Are saying that the tool requires the sites to follow a specific format in order to be involved in this tool  And some of them, you know might not have the capacity to build out that format or don't want to follow Google specific format  so as a result there was their  Site ends up lower on the results and they don't feel that they've already spent all their money on SEO optimization

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't want to spend  This is something I've noticed about Google that is beginning to frustrate me if I and I think I noticed it looking for hotels  the other night  It is or maybe it was restaurants  I don't know it's becoming more difficult to search for things like a restaurant near me or a hotel near this and get to  the actual website of the  entity I'm looking for  Instead I get sent to all of the sponsors coming in various different boxes on my and usually this is on my phone  but it happens on the  Computer I was like, what is this computer thing? I'm working looking at it happens on the web too  And and that is getting frustrating. So I know Google needs to monetize but  I'm kind of to the point where I'm like I  Just want to get to what I'm looking for man, you know, and I want the actual source. I don't want you know  Want to go to American Airlines website. I don't want to go to Expedia's website. You know what I'm saying? So I  Don't know. This is just Stacy complaints about Google today. I'm gonna like it to find something else. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like it. No, I like it. Keep up the complaints. There's probably plenty of ammo in here to complain about  How do you feel about this Stacey?  incognito used to make it possible for you to go to  Publication sites and get free articles because you aren't identified or you shouldn't be identified if you're running an incognito mode  And then this became like a cat-and-mouse game where the sites figured out how to identify you  Even when you're in an incognito mode that you are in fact in incognito mode  So they would turn it off so you couldn't get the free free article Google published a change to Chrome  I think this was like a couple of weeks ago  That would allow for it again. Google says hey  We've made it, you know more more private so and that just came out in that's our 76. Yeah  Oh exactly our overall goal is to make incognito mode a private mode  And as such we pass the whole our goal is not to make you know to give you the ability to get free articles  But that is the byproduct of being totally private in incognito change your business  Well now New York Times is one one example of finding another way to identify users who are using incognito  So this really is just kind of like a ping-pong match back and forth is that a  What is there is there a New York Times violation of privacy in some way there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so this it I don't know if it's a violation of privacy, but what it does do is it shows you how

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Identifiable your digital footprint can be yeah, and I think people are just so blase about this  But the metadata associated with your devices the programs running on your devices  All of that comes through when even if you're even if they strip your IP address, for example  They get this information. So  Maybe they can't identify Jeff Jarvis, but they can identify  computer blah blah blah blah blah has shown up before and so  And this is super common and this is  This is totally to be expected. I actually took from this that dang  This is totally to be expected I actually took from this that dang  Subscription business is super important to the times that apparently they're doing I guess a good job of converting people at the paywall  So if you have an effective paywall and you've got it's one of the two national publications, you're probably doing alright. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I'm not sure that what what the New York Times is able to do through this is to identify specifically  X  User is using it  I think what they're able to identify is the fact that when you're running incognito mode  It changes the way the file system API is used in in in this case  How much space the file system is set aside for the file system API and so the New York Times can  Identify that based on the visitor they can see what space has been set aside for this and given that  They know that user is using incognito and therefore block them from from the article from what I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the same as not answering the door to someone who shows up at your house in a ski mask  Sure. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the New York Times does identify an IP address and incognito mode and  I don't I'm trying to think of circumstances in which that's that can be  subpoenaed and  Danger, I don't know right nothing comes to mind

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if it's just saying that this is a browser using incognito mode then it that's that's the ski mask as opposed to  That's that same guy wearing the purple polka dotted ski mask, which and holding balloons  I'm just gonna say if you're wearing a ski mask, I am NOT opening the door. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Safe to say maybe not even on Halloween  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Know I don't know man, that might just be a bridge too far. You just ruined Halloween for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, sorry  Now I know what not to dress up as if I'm coming over and trick-or-treating at your place  Definitely not a student and my name is Jason by the way, so my history with Friday the 13th. It goes goes way back  Let's see here

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was excited by this story. Yeah, Mario. Are we talking? Oh, yeah Mario. It's it's a him Mario

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how to pronounce his last name is it  Keros Mario Keros Keros Keros  Met him and I don't Keros. Mr. Mario as his friends call him  VP and GM of pixel smartphone business is apparently moving on though staying at Google and in fact  Not just staying at Google moving into a position working in Sundar Pichai's office. So  Moving on up for sure  Rick Osterloh is gonna take over  the pixel smartphone business for now  But Mario he's got a long legacy as far as Google's hardware is concerned pretty much to the very beginning. He started in 2005  He was involved with Google's phone hardware since the beginning. So he started on the Nexus one  And then one of those, you know good I know wasn't it nice Google TV  Yeah, it had the little rolly ball down at the bottom which  Happy that didn't that that didn't stick around as a way of controlling our smartphones, but at the time it was neat  but yeah, he was involved to Google TV Chromecast Google Wi-Fi Google Home Stadia and  Yeah, so you were excited about this wife

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I was excited one because I think it helps push hardware which always has felt like an afterthought for Google  Um, it makes it feel like their hardware ventures might become more prominent and important  which I I'm excited about because I think  well part of music excited about it and part of me is kind of sad because it could be that they're following an Apple strategy of  locking people in with hardware to services and apples is very much a  By our services are locked to our hardware. So by our hardware whereas Google's I think will be hey  Our really cool assistant offerings and other things are all going to tie together in hardware  So, you know for an optimal service experience, you're gonna want to have the hardware but regardless  I think that's an important thing  I think having your hardware and software tied together is probably going to get more important over time and with like IOT and  ambient computing as they like to call it  And then you know Rick Osterloh seeing overseeing the pixel business  I'd be curious if they brought someone else in for that. I don't really know what they're gonna do with pixel. I always feel like  It's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't do don't do what you did to the Nexus 7 don't do it I like my pixels  I don't think the pixels going anywhere. I don't think they're going anywhere. I don't think they're going anywhere  I don't think they're going anywhere. I don't really we just I just worry about any shift. I don't like change

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and this would be a big change right like the the expectations for the pixel for a pretty high

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google's helped with that because they've come they've confirmed was already that's already set in stone. Whatever that's gonna be it is right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, whatever it is it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So does this just potentially show a different strategic view or somebody want to control a bit or yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They keep Rick in there and so they're saying at least for now  But if they make Rick in charge of all of hardware and then they have this overarching view  You could see things and oh, let's let's have fun and go on the conspiracy train  All right, remember how they're building the fuchsia OS which is supposed to be a browser for everything  Yeah, you could maybe start seeing the tie-ins  Across devices that Google makes that could be more fun  Like your phone being able to talk directly to your assistant somehow  I know it talks to your sister over Wi-Fi if you want, but maybe it would be more automatic  and I know some people will hate this but  It could it could start to kind of create these cool context clues and have things that you need follow you from device to device  Or pop up on the device where it matters at that moment in time  Yeah, and that that requires a lot of integration that I don't think I mean God look right look at what's happening  Right now with like G suite and assistant and you're just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  All of their different units not not quite on the same page  Which is the long-standing story of Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and you see that coming together. I mean actually at the end of this month  We're gonna see the end of works with nest because they've decided to tie all that in and give themselves a little bit more control  So I mean is this gonna be awesome for every single end user out there?  No, but is it gonna make Google's life easier and also create this more unified like vision and product strategy?  Probably one hopes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think Rick Rick does a great job. He did a great job with Motorola  I feel like I've liked what I've heard about you know  How he's how he's working with the hardware division and and I like the general direction of Google's hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know when you think about it, I guess to be fair  If  You're if you're Microsoft  Things take years because everybody's got a coordinate with everybody else. We gotta make all those work together  No, no, no, we actually doesn't have to work in together, but there's a show of it at Google  That's okay. You're doing that you're doing that. We'll figure out the integration later  That's a little unfair, but not fully

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they do they totally have different teams working on different things and they put them out and then they're like, oh people like this  We're gonna keep it, you know  Let's build it let's build a bridge people like this we're gonna kill it which is the other thing to  Right. I feel like when more people like it, they don't kill it  They don't call it does Jeff Jarvis like it kill it a lot people like to feed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'd always come back around I want my new pixel book

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With reader yes and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  LT

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not too much. I'm not gonna be greedy  Just give me it cuz this one's hitting is starting to get a little wonky  And I don't want to buy a machine and then two weeks later find out the new machines coming out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well don't buy a machine until the beginning of November

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  Only a couple of more months to wait for that. We're already talking about pixels. So let's talk about the other pixel things here  Somebody just posted in chat and I had missed this  That it was scooter X posted this if you have the original pixel  apparently you can get up to  $500 over a microphone issue that was happening with the original pixel the  The claims are now open. So if you're having  Some flaws with that microphone. Meanwhile, this phone is three years old so  Not bad to get that money back and actually it's even better than that you can if

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're Mike if you had one of the very first  pixel or pixel excel excel  Phones you and and you had microphone problems  You can get up to $500 if you merely owned the phone and had no problems whatsoever  You can still get 20 bucks  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your labor is worth $30 an hour

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going back through my old  If if I had actually bought my my original pixel  Yeah, there's that and and it hadn't been given to me by Leo. I would be going back going through my

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Receipts and getting that 20 bucks apparently Leo tells me Carson that you were looking back trying to remember whether you had bought it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, the hopes of the 20 bucks. I was trying because I did actually physically buy it but then  But it was with the twit company card. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Lisa would tell you to fill out the thing for the 20 bucks. Okay, then I'll do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just trying to trying to get I guess I'll probably have to give the 20 bucks to at least though

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yes, that's what she would say. Okay fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, you'll pay for pay for twit lunches on Wednesday with that  That's right, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pizza for 12 bucks 20

Transcript:  Not the fancy coal-fired  Buffalo mozzarella place  Where it's like 18 bucks for a small one. I could get a I could get a big pie

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  12 bucks. I don't think you're getting a big pie here for $12 unless you're going to like Little Caesars or Domino's or something

Transcript:  This is this is Jersey where it's a crime for restaurants not to have pasta on the menu  Well, we have officially subsidized pizza in New Jersey obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You well, yeah, but then I cancelled it cuz I got my husband was like we can't give her a cracked screen  So then I was like, oh  My children proudly have cracked cracked screens. Well, that's what I was like and she wanted the case on mine, too  Yeah, so it was a done deal and then I cancelled it cuz I saw so your your husband is basically the representative of OSHA in the family  Actually, that's a really good point he's always the way are those wires live did you double-check?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see you see you see you crazy mom is putting wires all over she's putting chips under a kid's skin  She's she's putting things just all over the house. She's putting wires under the bed and in the bathtub  Yeah, I get the picture now your husband's responsible one. Well, that is no one would deny that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey curse you I want the 3a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I have a 3a I was just I was just saying it's a good phone I like I love my  Everyone to have one. I just I  evangelizing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Headphone jacks is what I'm doing. Oh, yeah, you know what Carson? We'll see what the four has but  No exactly or or a thumbprint thing which may irritate me to four and the pixel book  I hope come out the same time my priority is clear. I'm getting a pixel book and  This phone can last me, you know quite some time  I'm trying to imagine what the feature is on the four that would make me say oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, do I do think yeah exactly I want to be that  Oh, yeah, yeah, I want to be that guy on the subway going. Ooh  Look at me. I'm not even touching my phone. Yeah, I did that magically

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is what I want  Yes, we have to only do it one-handed. Yes  And I'm like, I think I want all of my windows to come open and show me what's on there  But it's not like it's satisfying because it's a small screen so yeah, it goes plank

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, tell me  You had a new that's that that that plays over my problem. Oh, you're you're ooh is a higher priority than my fetch  So I don't this true of you those damned faucets that you don't touch

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't work for me now  We know that there's a racial bias that doesn't work people of color, but it doesn't also work with people with no color like me  and  And so I can't I have to go through four or five faucets to get them operated  My fear is the phone will be the same problem. It won't know that I'm there  I'll be doing this all I want right and it won't  I'm there  I'm there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Undead detecting thing no hold on is ultra sonic I believe let me let me see what I think it's 60 gigahertz  Wireless is what it uses which means it's using wireless. It's not a photon. It's not based on color. It's not infrared  It's a radar gesture. Okay, you're gonna be fine. How does the faucet work?  Well, there there's probably a multitude of different types of faucets, but maybe it's IR. Yeah  How do you touch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't do my faucet homework for this show

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Failed to look that up  So they are tiny IR lights so it Carson was right. Yep. You're right tiny IR

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, if it's IR then yeah, it won't work for you because you're a vampire

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But so are we saying the faucets need solely radar is yes. Is this where we're headed right now?  Yes, this is the obvious like no-brainer application for solely is to put it into a faucet  I think you might be onto something

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I will say the same frequency and radar concept is actually being put on ships  Not just in solely but in industrial automation for robots to quote unquote see people so  It is a way to give computers an understanding of the world around them  I would say it's kind of vision II but not actually vision  So you're not far off actually  And if we get it in more places, then yeah, it would be super cheap right now the radar for a while  The chips were way too big  Others

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the if it's constantly looking for if it's costly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's actually you can do it with Wi-Fi anytime there's RF signals  So my hand or it's it's imagine the signal going through the air whenever it's your swimming. That's yours

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, let me see me. Yes, that's your Stacy swimming to the shores message. No, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this is this is my frequency attenuation wave. See here's oh, that's your free  Okay, yeah, well mine's a shorter way

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When it hits something  It it disrupts that wave and so it sends that information back and then the ship performs all this math and it says boop  There's a thing here and this is it's exactly how time of flights time of light time of flight  Sensors work using optics, but it uses RF  Does that make sense? Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So but there's another there's another signal being constantly set out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it sends it out  Yes, usually with the way these work if it's not always on which I don't know about the power constraints there  So sometimes you have something like IR or some sort of quick vision sensors  So there's a couple of companies that make quick like I recognize there's a person in front of me turn on  So there there are it works in conjunction sometimes with other sensors. Mm-hmm  Which actually happens on your phone believe it or not with face. Could it be a powered ring or you think not? Yes  It could be I mean it all depends like power it all depends. How do you implement it?  How far do you want it to detect something?  You know, I don't know all kinds of things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, like, you know, is there some sort of like a lower energy chip?  Inside the phone that that talks to or that works in tangent with or in tandem with the project solely  Radar that can maybe lower the battery footprint on that. I don't know. I haven't heard anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Again something like this think about it also depends on how far out you want it to measure, right?  So like if you're only gonna measure something that's really close to you  You don't need your signal to to travel as far and you don't have to care about it  If it doesn't hits like say like I'm gonna send it out two feet and if it hits nothing just don't send anything back, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, but it probably does have like an ultrasonic maybe a little vision sensor  There's there's a lot of things out. I mean, it's kind of cool. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I know that so so obviously the solely radar coming on the pixel for like there's some sort of integration where  That will be used in combination with the facial recognition there's two different facial recognition cameras  So that I think the solely tells the phone that you're that you're pulling the phone up to your face  And so at that point it springs in action and fires off the facial recognition that lets you in  From what I understand about the technology that we've heard so far. That's how it happens. I don't know what the battery  Impact strangely. I've not even thought about the battery impact would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Slowly says it uses very little energy on the Google homepage. Okay, but what is that? You know, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who the heck knows what that is? Let me let here. I'll look at TIs radio specs  And something else so so the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What were you geeky now searching up on last week? I don't I don't  Chip searches last week. Are you doing it again?  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You you're asking me I mean like I don't keep specs for all of the chips in the universe in my brain

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm gonna send your daughter a message and say if you ever want to distract mommy  Just have her just ask some questions about a chip then she's gonna go into the deep end looking things up  Yeah, yeah that'll that'll distract her

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. All right you guys  My my battery my power consumption

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could you have ready access to that is also in and of itself amazing. It's just a Google search

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh man, this doesn't give I'm gonna have to go deep access to the world's information at our fingertips

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Technical docs not if you're in Europe, you're gonna have to use some off-brand search engine. That's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But maybe you might plant a tree in the process  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's from it's super low power because they don't require a lot of amplification  So that's actually really good that's not a that's way less than I thought yeah, I'm still looking for watts but I  Haven't gotten there yet. Okay. Okay keep going

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm gonna take a break because I just realized that it's we're closing in on 50 minutes and I have not thanked a sponsor  And then we'll come back and we'll finish finish up with a pixel because there are some interesting things there outside of the solely radar  So let's take a quick break and thank the sponsor of this week in Google's this episode is brought to you by Express  VPN if you believe that you're not being snooped on  Or that maybe nobody cares about your online data  You're wrong  Because you have listened to this show, you know  I hope you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's like the call is coming from inside the studio

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who is I really want to know who's on the other side of the phone, but we won't we won't go there  How about instead we finish up with pixel 4 the news this week was that there was gonna be 90 Hertz refresh rate on the display  Something what they have they have a name for it smooth display  so  Smooth smooth is butter  90 Hertz we're seeing this more and more on some phones one plus 7 Pro comes to mind  These higher refresh rates. We're seeing it on some Android phones that are more like tailored for gamers  Wanting higher refresh rate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does that mean as a normal person who's like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why do I care about this? Why do we why do we care about 90 Hertz refresh?  It just means that the image is is  Refreshing at a faster rate. So therefore things like animations movement that sort of stuff  Instead of instead of like if you were really slow it down, you'd see like these little frames of movement  It becomes a nice smooth kind of movement in animation  Movement in animations and stuff. So so that is it just gives it gives a feel that things are moving smoothly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess smooth. Okay. So how does it differ from frame rate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is frame. Basically the same thing. It is it is frame rate. It is exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, well then but don't humans have like don't we have a limit of like 60 frames per second that we can know we don't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, our limit is much higher than that, okay great  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we haven't discovered our limit because we still aren't quite sure whether we're living in a simulation or not sure somebody right  Once we know for a fact we're living in a simulation  then maybe we can find the exact refresh rate that we operate at and  It's gonna break the system and our universe is gonna explode. That's basically how it works

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I thought I was gonna be able to spend bend a spoon with my mind

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's way less exciting. Maybe once we know for certain that we're living in the simulation somebody  Somebody with more power than us is gonna shut the simulation off. So we better not ever figure it out. That's what I'm saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. Well, this makes me feel better. So basically I'm gonna have a fancier screen that I look smoother and better

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Supposedly, I mean it depends on how they implement it  I think on the one plus seven Pro it has a higher refresh rate, but it's not active on all content  So you kind of have to turn it on from what I understand you have to turn it on on certain content in order even  See the benefits of it. So I don't know if on the pixel it's going to be an all or nothing  So, you know all or sometimes sort of thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that gonna affect the battery life? Is that why they do it that way? Well, it certainly could yeah, absolutely  It would affect. Okay. Yeah, I'm like if you're refreshing that fast if you're refreshing more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, your battery is gonna get impacted  They are going for a larger battery on these phones than they have in the past from what we know so  And I can't remember exactly how much that is that may have been the last leak, you know  I feel like we're getting these leaks like every other day now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe we won't have to do a live reveal of the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll have to do that too  And what else oh and also new assistant features that'll be exclusive to the pixel 4  I think that's interesting because we kind of heard hints of that at Google I O  How they were talking about more on device stuff and how those on device features would be expected on the pixel 4  So we're hearing a little bit more about that  Not very much  But I'm really curious to find out what that actually translates into and kind of the hardware requirements for have moving that all on on device  Like assistant that works offline. That would be a pretty cool sell. It's coming. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There I mean they're building it I don't know if they're gonna release it or what but yes, you bet they're working on something like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah more things to look forward to in the pixel 4 you're you're definitely waiting for that Stacey is that kind of you're next

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Six and so they said no, we're not gonna update that so I'm like  Today's phone versus do you do we have a release date on any of this yet?  Do we know when this is coming out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't have an exact date, but we know from previous events that it's sometime in October probably for Christmas before Christmas  Guaranteed almost guaranteed  Probably it's already almost September Stacey. Yeah, yeah, but her birthday is next Wednesday

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I could like present I could present my cracked old phone to here you go  Here you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And here's some band-aids for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Give her a cracked phone, but also a screen protector for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it's it's at the very bottom. No one touches this just bezel. Okay, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it so far at the very bottom that you can put a case on and it would be hidden the broken part would be hidden

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's right below the yeah, it's right below the speaker. Yeah. Yeah, hold it up  Let's see it. Okay here see that crack

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See can you see it?  Yeah, I think I can see it okay, so  All right, so it's not in a place be a little over cautious. Yeah. Yeah  it's not in a place that a case would necessarily cover it up because sometimes you get lucky like that and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microphone uncovered. Yeah, it's cuz my beloved live case cracked on the bottom  Although it saved it many other times so and I can't get her replacement live case and she's like I really want the case  That goes with it like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Live cases are no more  All right, no more  Bill Nye fans of Bill Nye apparently the science guy  Sorry, sorry his name. Sorry. No, the science guy is apparently hocking  Chromebooks now as a three-minute commercial for for Chromebooks where he focuses on fear  Fear of the unknown fear of switching to a Chromebook fear of switching away from what you know windows or whatever the heck it is  Yeah, it's kind of a I guess a cute commercial  If if Bill Nye the science guy is your thing  Not a lot to say there  I did think it was kind of interesting that that Google is leaning into the fear aspect of switching going  Hey, nobody say we want more people to move over. Let's uh, let's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you watch the video?  The commercial yeah, can we talk about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Bill Nye commercial yeah. Yeah, I did watch that earlier today

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did we what I'm sorry folks? I had to split out for a call. So I don't know you watch on this show

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, we didn't watch on this show. No, we haven't watched it on this show. Okay, good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we won't watch it on this show because we know videos on shows anymore  No, that's it doesn't know when we watch other people's videos. Oh, you're kidding me  I don't know if Leo were here. We probably would watch it and then  Cut it out and then cut it out or get it taken down off of YouTube and then Lisa would come yell at me  Because our YouTube numbers are down because people are cutting people people keep  All right, so I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna dramatize the video for you. Yes, please. I'm gonna dramatize. Okay, good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi, I'm geeky Bill Nye and you trust me because I know science  I'm gonna have a dorky coat on and things are gonna move behind me regularly and I'm gonna talk about what's the topic here?  Oh windows and how slow windows is and I'm gonna go to this car  There's really beat-up car which has a funny windows license plate on it and I'm gonna say but I love this car  I don't want to leave this car even though the car is out of date  It's a mess and it's got tape all over it up. There goes the part of it falls off  I put the tape back on I get in the car it explodes  This is why you shouldn't be on old things like windows. You should get a nice Chromebook  Gee, look how long it takes a Windows machine to boot the Chromebook is already booted now  I'm gonna pull on a Hawaiian shirt and there's gonna be a scene from Hawaii behind me and I can't remember why because there was  Some kind of logical fallacy I was trying to teach you but it doesn't matter  All I'm gonna do is take three minutes till you buy a Chromebook and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, I want Jeff to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely, I will almost feel like we need to get someone talented in deep fakes to put Bill Nye onto your face

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For that entire Jeff Jeff's face on Bill Nye

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff puppets  That was good  Where does a three-minute commercial play I guess is just my internet ad right? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Windows we need to the beginning of who those people are cranky about this  They were they were cranky about this earlier today on Windows weekly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Windows machine good god, I had to boot up my husband's computer and I was I think I made popcorn. I mean  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thought the whole bumper falling off putting it back on and affixing more duct tape to hold the bumper back up as a as like  You know a reference to patches and stuff. I thought that was smart. I thought it was cute. Yeah, I thought it worked

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was effective. Yeah, they actually had to they actually had to go back and and and talk about how angry they were  At the old like I'm a Mac. I'm a PC  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, cuz Chromebooks are superior

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean one day they'll realize that too. They're just not yeah, they're not ready. I don't have to work

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He made another joke about viruses  I can't remember what it was now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I'd known I was gonna do this I would have rehearsed you didn't need to rehearse man you had it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't want to see the whole three minutes. I think it shortened. Yes the abridged version from Jeff  Jeff abridged audiobook was much better. Absolutely preferred agreed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see here the final beta for Android Q released last week just some minor changes and stuff, but Google had a  Shared some information about gestures which gestures have become kind of the big to do around  you know Android Q and whether  People are gonna actually enjoy their their gestural navigation approach  And Google did you know, of course Google is a data driven company  So they've tested multiple scenarios just to be sure that they're going in the right direction  They said Google said that they found that their users actually prefer that go away Google  Oh, wow, it's been transcribing me for a while now  Google said  That they've been that users in the test actually prefer the three button method for ergonomics  however  Google also found that the gesture system works the fastest in terms of navigating home and navigating back and  People and and so I am assuming that means well if it's the fastest then it's the best even though people prefer the  Ergonomics of the three button thing. We're gonna go gesture instead  I don't know if it's the right choice, but it's it's the direction that they're going people fear

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People have a choice on which they can use  well, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Know that I know that it's going to ship with gestures out of the box  However, they have to keep the three button navigation around for accessibility  Reasons because there are some people that would have a hard time that have a hard time with the movement  Yeah, so having the three button

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean no at all in all seriousness not support yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I mean, I think it's I think it's good that they're that they're not just getting rid of it entirely  Right and realizing that they can keep it around it kind of splinters their plan a little bit to keep  Multiple navigation methods, but personally I'd like I don't feel like it hurts anything  Maybe it hurts them longer term. They don't have into design

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What happens if you're an aspect of the OS for both but no one's gonna rewrite an app for gesture. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think I think people are  Yeah, really I think they have to because yeah, because one of the things about gestures on Android Q  Is I don't know if you have my overhead shot. I didn't ask you to set it up  It doesn't matter I can explain it if I can act out a whole commercial yeah  So basically an Android Q the navigation for back is swiping in hold up your phone where you want it to be  This is comfortable  My  Yeah, okay, okay the other one I think is probably set up for last night's all about Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's still not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's perfect. Okay. This is perfect enough for me to show so if I go into Chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so for anyone listening  Yes, thank you  His arms stretched all the way out he's like leaning way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's what I got yes exactly green space my tripod arms we can make this work  So in order to go back you have to swipe in from the sides  You have to swipe in from the sides like that you can do it on either side  But that is your back button essentially going forward there is no pill down at the bottom  You don't see even a navigation pill when you're on the home screen right now. There's nothing there  It appears when you're in apps so if I'm in Chrome I get that little pill down the bottom so that you know  That could be how I go to multitasking. There's my multitasking could be go, you know, it's also

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Problem actually for me. So guys do not laugh at me. But right now I have an RSI entry in my thumb  Okay, it's cuz I've been reading a lot on my Kindle and so I have my I hold it like  In one hand and then I mushed my thumb over to like turn the page. Yeah, so I've given myself  RSI entry so now I've got to be really conscious when I'm on my phone to hold it with one hand and then like  Use the other finger to do everything  So accessibility matters for you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I can see like if you have like arthritis or anything like  It's it's far easier to swipe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Injury I get see if I get little finger as prop for phone injury  I'm just holding the phone this well. No, I don't want that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'll change your life it will although then you get the RSI cuz like I hold it with my  And then I'm like and that that is another careful Stacey. I don't want to injure your thumb again. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Totally do the the little pinky end of the phone thing too, it's it's habit and it hurts after a while I guess  Yeah, it's a reflex. Yeah, it's total reflex for me  But to answer your question from earlier. Yes developers are gonna have to develop around it because  if there  And there are Google apps that that break this rule right now  There are Google apps that if you want to pull out the sidebar you swipe in from the left side  Well now in the new gesture  Parodyme that is a back button  so and  wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very important question. Yeah, what does this do to tinder?  Important to you, I guess no no not at all not at all important  You're asking for a friend are you all important to me?  Kimmy doesn't watch this show anyways, okay  I will say what most people say when they're on podcasts. I've never used tinder

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Most people say when they're on podcasts, I've never used tinder but  Do when Karsten when you use tinder do you swipe in the middle of the image?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but this is no this is in in general this this is gonna be a huge problem for  For a lot of our hoops  Because if you're swiping right  In  Your app to do something and then you move your finger ever so slightly to the edge of the screen then  You're out of the app

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean it's the back button  Right the only way that the back button  Registers is is if you're at the extreme edge of the screen when you swipe in if that makes sense, right?  So certain UI paradigms like like and I'm assuming tinder is like this when you've got an image and you're swiping it  You're not like putting your finger at the very edge of the screen and swiping over. Maybe you are no, you know  Well, I wouldn't know but a passion or something but you know because you're swiping fast or something like that  Maybe it happens, but I would imagine you're probably swiping from inside slightly and in that case  I think you're outside of the touch zones for back. However in this new version of Android Q  They do have a back button sensitivity  Option that's meant to allow for dialing in a better  Response on back versus like app intentions that where those swipes come in handy. I haven't I haven't messed around with that  I've heard that it only makes a marginal difference  but no matter what developers are gonna have to work around it because it just  interferes with the ways that a lot of apps actually operate and they've had time to do that, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this is gonna be a UI nightmare because  It's how far from the edge is too far, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Back button and I mean I'm spelling Newton jokes to come  Newton jokes Newton jokes  Yeah, where I meant to do this but that happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not old enough to get this joke. Oh, that was cruel. That was cruel

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is this is perfect for my mood today, so I'm happy with it. Let's take a break  Thank the sponsor then we'll get back into more  of that trumpets  Steps of this weekend.

We actually have more  Google II things that we can talk about  Actually a number of a few things in here about YouTube  Apparently a youtubers union which formed two years ago now has  21,000 members is picking up steam Bloomberg says this could be a blueprint for labor organization of digital platforms  Organizer and YouTube  George Sprave I hope I'm pronouncing that right teamed up with IG metal which is Europe's largest trade union  To do this and basically it's all in response to sudden demonetization of videos  and and specifically the demonetization of videos with little to no explanation as to what led to it so the union is  Requesting more transparency with the creator community  What does this strike look like if it happens within as relates to YouTube is it that creators stop producing  Walking back and forth

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Didn't we talk about this last week?  Well, we did  I'm not I'm not trying to poop on your story and like is there news that's related to this because this was something we talked

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  About we're like, okay. I'm sorry. I didn't I didn't see it in there. You do not have to be sorry. That's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, we did talk about it. Okay. Yeah, it's still it. I mean, it's still a good topic. I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, what to say? Yeah. Well, I just I just think there'll be it'll be video videos of a big inflatable rat  Do you do you guys know that reference or not? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, rats are there to people stick it up when I lived in New York, though  I was like that's the first time I'd ever seen it cuz I live in I had grown up in Texas  So I was like, why is there a giant rat in front of the Loma?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, all right. Well, okay, so then we might we might see a union

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some sort of response we might not. Oh, that's how we got the unboxing Jimmy Hoffa joke. Yeah, that was it  Right. Yes. Okay. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's even a joke that's how  Oh  Thank you, okay  Well, maybe this ties into it. Meanwhile, some YouTube stars can apparently break all the rules and still make all the money  Elizabeth Dorskin from the Washington Post  Spoke with 11 YouTube mods all those mods believe that popular creators people like Logan Paul are getting special treatment  Looser restrictions they can get away with things like demeaning speech graphic content bullying, etc  Where others are being you know, or are being held responsible for that stuff mods are saying they regularly  Recommended stripping ads from infringing videos and were often overruled by higher-ups with the creators  With the creators that had a higher profile  YouTube mods said YouTube stances that nothing is really an issue until there is a headline about it, which is kind of troubling  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have the world works  I mean  I'm gonna say should and this is kind of a way that like online  forms give people the power to complain and be heard but I mean even even in classrooms you will have you know  Kids who are maybe more popular and well-liked can treat other kids like crap and get away with things  Not every kid gets away with so I mean privilege has many flavors. Yes. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just life  So I'm now I'm listening to thinking fast thinking slow Daniel Kahneman's book about  how the brain operates in neuroscience, which I thought was gonna be just one of those kind of  No ridiculous books was it's scientific and is interesting. So they had one study that he mentions  where judges in  Think who was Israel could be wrong  They tracked on their decisions on parole. They have like seven minutes to make parole decisions, right?  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom and the closer you are to lunch and they're hungry  it's like 90% don't get it as soon as they're back from lunch like 90% get parole and  So there are odd things that can cause unjust decisions in the world  Including privilege and making money but all kinds of things. So you're right. Stacy. It's unfortunately the way the world operates. Yeah and lunch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and so the solution would be to be more data-driven, right?  But then you're like, how do you I mean making the correlation and  Did they also do a good job of showing causation with that correlation or not?  because that's the other thing you have to then take all that data that you have derive the you know,  The correlation there and then make sure that the method by which you're using to derive that correlation is actually as unbiased as possible

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is hard, right? Which is hard Kahneman also talks about how he tried to unbiased his grading of two  test the  Questions and he was upset that he realized all the bias that he brought to it and and didn't know what to do about it  We all have bias decisions. Sure. I'm not doesn't just  But you gotta build systems that recognize that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in thinking about how you can do it in ways that makes sense for  You know what you're doing. All right, so like in this case  Demonetize it demonetizing YouTube creators. I mean cuz like think about like when  Orchestras were like, oh, we don't have any women. Why is that and they started doing blind tryouts for like to work  You got more women and things like not putting a name on a resume is sometimes very helpful or you know  We see people like women don't get jobs as often as men do we see women or people with names that are perceived to be of  Color don't get jobs as often or job offers. So what is a what is a method that might help?  Moderate things more fairly and would Google really want to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically, you got to recognize the unfairness and then you've got to build that in you got to build in the compensation. Hmm  you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should the YouTube mods be  be driven more towards  Kind of appealing to advertisers, which is one of the one of the things that you know  Kind of pointed out or to harm reduction because we're hearing a lot about about that as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is important, which is also an algorithmic issue. So let me let me tie this if I may to Facebook last week  I when I was out there I was at a  Oversight board meeting they brought in about 25 people who've written about the oversight board and took them through kind of the last  Round of their thinking about it and full disclosure. They paid for the hotel room and I have raised money for my school from Facebook  I've been dependent of Facebook  And so it goes just to what you're saying  Is what they try to do they try desperately to do is to say we have a set of rules and we are going to  Enforce those rules and that's what makes this fair  but  It doesn't really work, right?  And so now they recognize they need this kind of higher body to figure out whether the rules are fair being enforced fairly and my  Argument about that was well, okay. What what's there? What's the higher bodies North Star?  Who were they responsible for are they responsible to the users to the public to government to the company to God and ethics  And they didn't really have that North Star built in. So, of course, I obnoxiously went and wrote one for them on medium  But but it's it's  None of this is as simple as saying there is a rule and and an algorithm or a bunch of  Lowly paid people can enforce that at some level you've got to make judgments and you got to stand by those judgments  and you've got to say why you made them and  Transparency matters too. And that means humanity and these companies I think I think YouTube now has I forgot the number like  9,000 people 7,000 people they've hired to work on this stuff  Facebook has 30,000 people they've fired to work on this stuff at that scale. It's really hard  This is they're not dealing with technology. They're dealing with humanity and humanity is difficult

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well as we do we are particularly especially at scale at that scale

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The more of us there are the more difficult we become

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, indeed. And by the way, Jeff, I loved your your piece  Last week. I I ran across your your piece. Oh, thank you. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought you can't say it out loud because you get in trouble

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was about to and I was like, yeah, maybe I shouldn't say that but but yes, it was it was awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm happy it was responding to Beto's complaint about journalism and it's fascinating that Beto O'Rourke and  Ocasio-Cortez and  Castro have all made I think very good  Criticism of journalism which we're hearing from them not from journalists. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm happy your post got as much attention as it did because thank you. Yeah, it was really really fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was on MSNBC on Sunday about it and they shocked me because they put I just have a quick list and I turn around  And there's my basically the ten headlines my post on this huge wall screen  Something different there  Okay, what was the headline on the post you got to help us

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Beto to journalism what the f

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I spelled it out because my last rule was you're not a protector spare us your asterisks  I just asterisked. Yeah  You're welcome Lisa  Isn't that well, that's for iTunes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that's our ship by the platform  Yes  Did you hear that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did you hear that Facebook wants to get in on the the news train again apparently Washington  The Wall Street Journal, sorry our reports of Facebook once is approaching big name news publications about a dedicated news section  That is a C has a an evil grin on her face

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can go against it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Publications are gonna have control over how their articles appear on Facebook and Facebook has confirmed that this is a feature that is coming  sometime in the fall

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've talked about I mentioned it briefly on the show after it was mentioned that news guys Europe  They're calling it a new news surface, which is a hard to say and very geeky because they talk about surfaces  It's a tab and  News will not leave the newsfeed it'll still be there but but one executive said to me at the company  I can't control your uncle on newsfeed. I need a space where I can control the environment for news and  They recognize that not everybody's gonna go there that is for us freaky people who actually read the news and  They're gonna pay publishers it looks like according the journal and what I've heard they're gonna make a multi-year commitment to do that  It's gonna be a limited small number of publishers  It's gonna be I think somewhat  Curated and somewhat algorithmic and they're gonna try for personalization. That's pretty much what I know about it  And it's gonna launch as soon as this fall. So kind of imminently. Yeah. Yeah right around the corner should should publishers be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Be rushing to to get involved this time around. Do they learn I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Always follow the example of the Washington Post and Marty Baron  I don't know whether they've signed up or not, but generally the post has said we'll try anything and if it's if it's awful  Then we'll leave it and and I think that that my view here is that no matter what you think of Facebook  The public we serve is there and the one hand journalists have been screaming and yelling  These platforms stole our money as if God gave it to them and God didn't but fine  They stole our money they should come with some money and so then Facebook comes along and says okay  We're gonna use some money then the plug then you're gonna corrupt us with your money. Don't do that. You can't win  I think it's a worthy I was a little dubious at first  But I think that the way they're talking about is just to have a space on Facebook for news  I think makes sense. I think it's worth trying to do but let's be clear here news hounds. There is no Messiah  Nothing's going to save us except our own  Innovation and our own change in our own business so  You know if anybody thinks this is gonna be a huge bucket of money that's gonna solve all your money problems  It's not but what the heck more money get some money from Facebook sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I have been waiting for my bucket of money and it still hasn't shown up I'm very upset

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's at the end of the rainbow Stacy. Just gotta find the rate. Just keep waiting. I just gotta keep going keep on waiting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There with my lucky charms all right  So what should what should a publisher ask themselves so I was looking at that and I'm like, you know  Like the drawbacks to amp if you you amplify your website  Then you've got all these links that you know, you can't unamp  That they kind of don't belong to you anymore. Is there any sort of concern about that here? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't know how they're gonna format it I don't know whether there was one report that I don't believe that said it wasn't going to be  Content it was just gonna be links and they were paying for links. I don't think that's that's true  I think it's European wishful thinking I could be wrong  I  Would imagine this is duplicative of  your own website

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so then it's not I don't know I would just bet that they already have its an artifice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I would imagine it just uses that and it says you have to meet a speed limit about how fast this is  You know the other thing they're working on  You know they like Google been working on trying to own subscriptions they're trying to own membership there they're trying  I've had people call me and try to get you know  How else can we try to get revenue for publishers? They the companies really do want to do that  The problem is the basic model of the publishers still worked

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really is and it's tough and it's frustrating because like I  Want to support publications given my career, but by God I can't afford everything and  You know the advertiser model was awesome. So how do we bring something?  What else subsidizes good journalism and the answer?  I saw Williams last week, you know when he's changed his mind a couple times as we know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he believes that he can make something work with consumer payments and splitting it up  On medium the the weird thing for me is they try to put my stuff beyond the paywall medium  And I say I don't want that. I want I want to brainwash people. That's why I'm there. I want more readers  Exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hypnotize the public

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But  But  Ev thinks he started making gold he started to hire some journalists again, you know  Full disclosure is he's laid them off in the past, but I think that he's trying  Again, there's just no Messiah. That's all. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't have we had any trumpets playing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we have well, you know, I was about to ask  Are there any stories that you want to get in before the trumpets or the eyes before they sound?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's say got the ego of my piece in oh, I think we should mention briefly if I may yes  There's been some horrendous coverage in the last week or so of section 230  the New York Times did a big package with three stories and they had to put out a  Correction that basically pulled the the rug out from the entire story  They thought the section to the was the protection of free speech online. It's not in the United States. It's the First Amendment  the coverage of  Then somebody else complained about business week's coverage the coverage of tech policy is getting worse and worse and worse and I really see  A danger to 230 here that can be done out of just plain ignorance  And and there's some better coverage coming out now  I think this one got got better reviews you just showed from wired, but I just want to mention that  You have pros like Stacy really understand the beat and really understand the implications and really know their stuff and then you have  tech coverage now which has gone from ignorant and  Trying to look for some some wonderful rainbow end of the rainbow with a gold pot of gold and then now is  turned to ignorant and dystopian and  The truth is somewhere in between and it's too uninformed and it's really a the quality of tech coverage is bothering me a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's a  Lack of experience that I will say I don't I don't I'm not covering this but I will say tech policy is hard  Because it incorporates  Tech which is always hard and there are things you have to understand like when I cover the FCC  It's really important for me to understand like spectral efficiency, even though it doesn't feel like you should have to understand that  and then you have to understand the laws and what words are gonna matter inside the like the laws that people  Propose and where the ambiguities are and that requires a journalist who's been on the beat for a really long time  and I don't know how many like  30 or 40 or 50 and above-year-old journalists there are still  You know, especially at a tech publication which usually get because the model is so churn churn churn churn churn your burnt out  Yes, I think there's there's very few Cecilia Kang's in the world and there's a lot more  Oh, he also works that do your times. I was gonna say Brian Chen a man  He does not always know what he's talking about  But that's I mean that's why there's not a lot of informed tech policy and so then you the publications turn to people with an  agenda to write about it. Yes  and they do that because they need someone who has the policy experience if they're a tech firm or if they're a  Policy firm then they just usually turn to lobbyists or lawyers. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not helpful. Yep, small true. So thank you. I just wanted to get that little mini screen in absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Well without further ado then I think I think it's time to sound the horns  Holy cow a lot has changed this week. There are many changes starting with Google Maps bringing its AR navigation to  I think all Android phones and iPhone  Devices after you guys used this in the wild that was gonna be my question for you. I have used it  I used it once  once while I was out and about and I wasn't quite sure which direction I needed to be facing and  Yeah, it was I mean it was neat. It was neat and it was actually useful in that moment  It's not something I use every day, but they see definitely me too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although I will say my GPS and compass on my phone are just freaking terrible  Which impacts the quality of this like this this is always my issue. It's like you're going the right  Oh, no, you were really going the wrong way. I'm sorry  And then it's like do the figure eight to make your compass better and I'm like, I've done the figure eight  But yeah, I've seen it and it sent me off in the purported right direction only to change its mind later

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that wasn't my complaint with it because I want to have a complaint  I've been dying for this and I used it. I think it was in Paris last I was ever humble break and  I haven't tried the latest latest release. So maybe it's better but this was about six weeks ago and  What to try to keep you from getting killed?  You you know, you're holding like this looking where you're going literally because it's telling you follow the arrow, right and then  It'll say don't don't do that because that's gonna get killed you idiot. I put the phone down, right?  So you put the phone down you walk five steps and you still say I don't know where I'm going  You get the thing back up again now it makes you take pictures all around you looking like an absolute idiot as you turn  around taking pictures all around then you find it again, then you repeat rinse and repeat and  So it so I've been dying to have this the walking in BAPS has always been bad I'll try the new version but  This is the case where probably the old like watch  motif where it buzzes at you and knows where you are and tells you to turn or  Tells you to put the watch up the weird thing to me is the phone never has a compass that if you  Hold the same in the car if I hold it this way can't that know which way I'm pointing it  but it doesn't I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think well, yeah, that's it. I guess that's  Quite right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's never perfect  I would I will fully agree with that my experience with this was actually actually pretty effective it for the most part  Kept it locked in I did  Get the you know the the message that you're talking about where you're gonna  Too long and it's like nope  You got to put your hand down like focus on the road while you're walking and look at this  You know every once in a while instead of like just walking like this and when I pulled it back up  I didn't have to rescan it just kind of like picked up from where I was I left off  Let's go see it. So that's probably how it's supposed to work  And for whatever reason, you know is requiring you to rescan that would be really annoying. It worked pretty well for me though  So I'm positive on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See and I I know I try to once I start my directions  I actually don't want to pull out my phone because it makes me feel like  One of the one of the first things I you know taught my daughter and I learned  I don't know if guys learn this too, but don't look at your phone. It makes you a possible victim, right?  You look distracted and people might like mug you or something  So I always keep my like I set it up and I go and I put my phone in my pocket and I wait for it  To like vibrate to tell me or tell me to turn right?

This is first appearing in in Chrome for Android  if you visit passwords google.com on the phone  You may be prompted to authenticate using your fingerprint sensor and this is all based on the Fido to framework that was introduced at  Android 7.0  and it's just you know kind of part of Google's ultimate effort to  peel away from password from requiring passwords which can be faulty in and of themselves and  Instead, you know opt for something on the device that they don't have access to that can still authenticate you effectively

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I wanted to do I know that I showed this off. This is the Amazon echo auto device  After three weeks of hardcore testing and I thought I was gonna have a story ready, but I didn't finish it in time  So my bad  I'm gonna tell you guys do not buy this it is glitchy and  It shows the weaknesses of Bluetooth beyond all possible  This is a $25 device that gives you  Amazon's echo device so madam a in your car it transit it works over your phone  It connects to your phone via Bluetooth it connects over your car speakers via Bluetooth or the auxiliary cable depending on your car  There's a list if you scroll down in this and the page  It's a list of the cars that it will work with it will not work with cars that like when you're using  Carplay or Amazon?  Sorry Carplay by Apple or Google's what is Google's car thing Android right auto. Yeah. Yeah  Like just make it up names now  I'm Android auto  So if those are already enabled like not just like on your phone it will work then you can't have Alexa to basically so  Getting it connected was easy the challenge is if you have a shared vehicle. It's horrible because to disconnect  Your to like disconnect your phone you have to say madam a  Disconnect and then it will connect to the other phone, but only if your phone's not in the vicinity  Which is hard if your phones within Bluetooth range of the car which happens more often than you might think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Both drivers are together on the car at the same time in other words, right? Yes, but then that's less bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it's gonna be connected to one of your phones and it doesn't really matter which one it's gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see you can you can either one of you can talk right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  But it is frustrating when you're like in the garage and you're trying to get things going as you're pulling out  And it's still not sure who's trying to connect to the other thing is I noticed when I was  Playing with it in my car anytime I got it was very random  But I would hear and I had my Jabra Bluetooth headphones in  My car would talk to me over my headphones while I was on calls with people  They couldn't hear it  But every now I'd get a message for my car is saying if you would like to run this over your car speakers  Please press mute and then turn off the volume on your car. I was like what is happening and then I remembered so that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My sister who is my sister the reverend Cynthia Jarvis is retiring next month as a minister  In Chesapeake, Pennsylvania. I thought I just plug her for a second there. So she has hearing aids now and their Bluetooth hearing  And  So it's yeah, it's very wacky that suddenly she'll you know, she's hearing something the rest of us aren't hearing  Or or use the phone. I'm I don't need hearing aids yet, but they're kind of jealous. They're kind of cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My mom has some and she loves hers  But it was hilarious because she wanted she was sitting in the living room with my dad while talking to me and she's like  Oh, let me put you on speaker so your dad can hear you  But she could not get it off of her headphones  So like she's basically yelling at me. My dad can't hear me. It was it was really great  it took a little bit and so yeah, and then my husband when he we pulled it out of my car, which is the Tesla and  he put it in his BMW and  He really wants this to work and it really does not like him. So I  I'm gonna say  Amazon sending out invites for this thing. It's not expensive, but it doesn't work

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty inexpensive. It's like looked like it was on sale 25 like half off normally 50, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've only see I've only seen it for 25. Okay, so I bought it for 25  It's cheap. Yeah, I mean but I  Think if you had your own car that you only drove  It might be okay, although in my car it was okay in my husband's car it was not okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I again don't recommend this makes me feel much better  They they sent me an email that that said I could use it. I was very excited about it  they sent me an email it went to my like  Email that I never read  Except for like once a month and a week later. They said no you can't have it anymore  So I had to do it again and I was very you can have mine if you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not fun it's I was and I would be like I really wanted this to work so I'm really sad. Hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right thumbs down on the echo auto

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff what is your number? I like the decisiveness of that Stacy. I appreciate that  Couple couple things  I can't avoid this one which was up on the rundown that  Marissa Meyer bought tumblr for more than a billion dollars and Matt Mullenweg just bought it for about  Reports have it three million dollars, but tumblr lives no porn folks ain't coming back there Sam, but that's cool  That's one two is  Tom Steyer spent two point nine million dollars in Facebook ads to get his hundred thirty thousand small donors  Which has people saying see you still buy elections no matter what all this rule about getting a bunch of small donors  You buy them, but the number I really want to mention is  1619 this is 400 years since the first slaves were sold in this country. It's an important anniversary and the New York Times  Under the vision of Nicole Hannah Jones was a brilliant journalist there has put together a magnificent package for this weekend  And it's all out today  And I suggest you start with Nicole Hannah Jones essay and keep going it's a really impressive package and an important thing  to note and learn from

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been hearing a lot about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a really good package. I have not finished it, but I have yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wearable yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who I belongs to the Marines, but that's true. Yeah  That belongs to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My thing is  Something that I actually just got  Yesterday and I'm gonna be giving it a review  I don't have it in here because it's large and I took it home and the thought of like  Unplugging it and bringing it back just seemed like too much this morning, but the JBL link bar you may remember  Hearing about this not this year at Google I oh but last year at Google I oh they announced it during the keynote  It was a collaboration between JBL and Google to create a link bar with Android TV and a Google assistant baked into it  So essentially it is a link bar  Google home  And you know when the TV is off it's still just a  Google home active speaker so it's like all the other Google homes in your you know throughout your home  it just happens to be in in the link bar format and  So I'm curious to play around with it you because it has assistant  Along with Android TV and you know connected to your TV  There's a lot of like possible integrations, you know between using your voice to control inputs on your TV and and  Basically control all of your media that way which you can do  With other devices you could do that with a shield TV if you wanted to get a separate shield shield TV  For your TV set and and stuff  It's not like this is a first but having it all baked into one single devices is a little bit different from what we've seen before  One downside though that I know going in as four gigs of onboard storage with absolutely no  expandable storage option  So no USB port for expanding storage no micro SD card slot  And if this is like a media, you know  If you're running Android TV and you want to install apps on there and everything like that  Want to put media onto it like you could a shield TV?  You're gonna run out of space super fast and I feel like that's a really big downside on this thing one Marvel movie  Yeah, I mean that's nothing  You know don't install any apps if you you know, I don't know what you do with four gigs  And I don't know what they were thinking having it just before gigs  It's also pretty expensive by itself. It's 399 and that doesn't include a subwoofer, which is an additional  $300 so it's a pricey  link  Pricey soundbar as far as those are concerned  So I don't know if it's necessarily the best  But we've been waiting for a while and I'm curious to put it through its paces  So so that's my thing you can get it now if you really want to buy it before the review  But maybe wait until after the review  Maybe I'll inform you on some things that might change your mind or or make you decide to pull the trigger

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So or you can buy one of twits three Newtons

So you would wait for the marshmallow then oh  For sure cuz I am on top of my game. Yeah  So everybody can send their marshmallows to Stacey

So this shape  Hey  Austin do not judge  That's true. I don't have a point s'mores.
