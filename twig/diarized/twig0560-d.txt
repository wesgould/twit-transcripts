Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Graduate School of Journalism.  At the City University of New York, Mr. Jeffrey T. Jarvis.  Well done.  And there's, can you see it?  There's our neighborhood fox.  Oh, the fox.  What does the fox say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Would you ask real quickly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We missed it.  We missed him.  Sorry.  I saw some red in the bush.  I have a neighborhood fox.  Yes.  A family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A whole family of foxes.  Oh, I'm so jealous.  Have you heard them at night though?  They're very annoying.  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They go over to another neighbor's house where they sleep, where the little foxes are.  But here I see them talking to each other.  The foxes are.  But here I see them carrying away their catches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Baby foxes are called kits.  Kits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that cute?  It belies their vicious nature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Foxes are vicious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, how else do they kill their things?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we're, it's the middle of the night and we're hearing call and response from the front  of the house to the back of the house.  That sounds a little like turn off my, on my sound, Jeff.  Well, so you can't hear it.  It was a very quiet night.  Turn on my sound, can you?  Do you know what's going on?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is your sound on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you turn it up?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.  Is it going to sound like it's got helium?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you hear that?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you ever heard that?  That sounds like me screaming moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what, this is what, that's what red fox screams sound like.  And we heard this and I thought something, I don't know, something horrible was happening  because we are not of the nature, one with nature.  We are two with nature.  But I, but I, but I had an instinct because I'd seen these red foxes around.  So I, I Googled it and thanks to YouTube, I know what the sound is.  And that's what we were hearing front and back.  They were mating, I think.  So now we know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I now think I've heard that.  I think I've heard that.  Yeah.  That's how you get little foxes.  Little baby foxes.  Little kids.  Also in the backyard, yesterday there was a fawn nursing.  Oh baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it kind of nice that nature's coming back?  It just shows you, I mean it's only been two months.  If in 20 years, everything would be like the planet of the apes.  Statue of Liberty would be buried in his eye and sand, it'd be ivy all over the, you know,  tower of Eiffel.  It'd be, uh.  The ice will come back.  The ice is coming.  Turkeys everywhere too, right?  Wild turkeys.  What puzzles means?  What were we doing that was scaring them off?  It's not like, not like.  Driving.  Driving.  I must be cars.  Terrify them.  Well, they're pretty deadly.  Yeah.  You don't want to walk in front of one.  I've learned that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tell that to a deer.  Stupidest animals on earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Turkeys are way dumber.  Tell me about your event.  Cause Stacey did a COVID-19 event today.  Where, first work we can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You will be able to find it on staceyaniot.com slash COVID.  And I'm actually putting it in my podcast stream, not at this moment, but in a day or  two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is the first online conference you've ever done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  And it went so well.  I had.  It's so great.  I had Inder Singh, who is the CEO of Kinza.  I had a woman from a company called Electrolabs that does validation of consumer wearables  for clinical studies.  And then I had someone from Scripps Translational Institute, an epidemiologist from that.  And they all got together and the topic was, hey, why didn't IOT see COVID-19 coming?  And what can we do?  So we talked about.  Actually it did see it coming.  We talked about how we can make things better.  We talked about privacy.  That was really delightful.  We had a little disagreement.  We talked about what kind of devices you need.  It was really good.  I mean, it was.  Say more about privacy disagreement.  It broke down exactly how you would think of it.  Dina, who used to work for Consumers Union, which publishes consumer reports, was calling  for if we want to use this, she thinks that we should have a governmental rule around  privacy and data protection.  I kind of like what you call for, Jeff, which is against malicious or problematic use of  the data.  Inder was like, no, I think everybody should kind of opt into it.  But if we have too much regulation, it's going to stifle innovation.  You know, that old chestnut.  And so, yeah, it was really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so nobody had to fly in.  Yeah, you didn't have to make lunch for anybody.  You didn't have to read at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what I would really like to do?  I think this would be amazing and I'm not sure how to do it, but I would love if people  paid and registered for an event.  I would love to actually arrange something with like an Uber Eats or something to deliver  lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be cool.  That would be very cool.  Your box lunch will be arriving shortly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Seriously, I just I think like or do something with FedEx so everybody opens up the same  bag that day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft did that for Build.  You know, they're doing their developers conference.  Google skipped it last week.  Microsoft Build is going on right now.  And to at least to the press, Paul and Mary Jo were talking about this.  They sent you got a packet that had like a Starbucks certificate in it and a few things  to make up for the fact that it isn't an in-person event anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you should do it in the evening, Stacey, with a little recommended Stacey Jinn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  Excellent.  There we go.  They also, Microsoft also did digital swag.  So they had a page where you could download wallpapers and stuff.  So it's just I think this is, you know, honestly, the Build conference has been 10 times better  because it was all online.  Everything went faster, was more interesting, was more natural, was more human.  So let me ask you, Stacey, why didn't or how did IoT predict it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Inder's, Inder's, his thermometers predicted it.  His thermometers predicted it.  He's like, we saw the spikes in temperature coming.  We let people or the spikes in atypical temperatures coming.  We let health officials know.  And, you know, from there, things sort of happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have a map online, healthweather.us, that you can see atypical illness.  Their thermometers have been handed out for a long time for flu, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For flu and cold. So they had a program going as far back as, I think, 2014.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's funny, I bought a Kinza thermometer and I've been using it.  And then I was going through the drawers a couple of days ago and I found an old Kinza  thermometer that I've had for years.  So I guess somehow that we participated in that somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they gave it out to elementary age school children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we talked about how do you get good population data, right?  And their next effort is going to be sending thermometers out to underserved  populations who don't have sixty dollars or even twenty dollars to spend on a  connected thermometer.  We also talked about the need for how to send more money to local areas.  So we really need more of a local response for public health.  So we talked about how to make that possible.  And the other challenge is and one of the reasons why, you know, I know Kinza  says they saw it coming, but a lot of this isn't validated research yet.  So we think that we know what disease looks like on a Fitbit, for example, but  we don't have validated research and we're still getting that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really a good question, Stacey.  Did you use Zoom or StreamYard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we use Zoom for this one.  My next one, I'm doing one June 11th on machine learning at the edge and I'm  using a platform called Hopin for that.  And that's going to be new and different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One P or two.  One P.  Hop in or hop in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, so it's hop in dot to.  So hop into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I like it.  Oh, OK, got it.  StreamYard. Have you seen StreamYard?  No, I haven't. I'm looking at it right now.  Yeah, so it's very it's very good.  It lets you put in lower thirds and other messages and things.  It's more for, you know, auditorium events like this.  Oh, cool.  And you can stream live to, I think, two platforms at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, which is neat.  Streaming multiple platforms simultaneously.  Also Periscope, Twitch and Custom RTMP.  So have you used this, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I was a friend of mine used it and we're going to use it at the school  for an event, I think next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really interesting how many choices there are.  The nice thing about Zoom is you don't have to teach anybody how to use it.  Everybody just kind of knows, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Zoom was pretty darn amazing.  You said Washington Post did a  awards for all the platforms today and everybody got an award.  Zoom was the best in show.  The other one I used recently is the  we're going to find it.  It's a audio podcasting tool.  Oh, where I record.  I'm here. You're there.  The on the web, it  records me separately and then sends that up to the other one and then merges the two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, does it allow you to?  That's one of the things like I hate is I can't on Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Zencast.  Zencaster, I was going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Zencaster is not great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, really? Oh, OK.  Well, a lot of podcasters use it because it's double ended automatically.  Exactly. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's and you have to leave your browser open while it still processes it at the end.  So if you're that it's just if someone shuts their browser before it's done,  you lose the audio.  Oh, that sucks.  So so it is it is like you're like, I was born.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember, even open, even open, even.  Oh, that's just they told me when I could get rid of it.  Then the other Europeans like whereby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that spelled W each H E R E B Y  whereby whereby video meetings, video conferencing the free.  So there are a lot of choices out there.  There are tons now.  Yeah.  Brelin, there's many, many can.  OK, we don't have to list them all, Jeff.  All right. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, people like geeky things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are a lot of them.  I mean, you can go on quite a while.  Google has its its own.  And now I want Microsoft has its own and Apple has its own and on and on and on and on and on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I was looking at all this as I was going.  I was so desperate to not be pink anymore.  That I was looking at cameras, I was trying to figure it out.  And then I finally I before the show, I mentioned I uploaded eye glasses,  which is just a different adjustment for the camera.  And even though I don't look spectacular right now here,  it's a lot better than I've been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this is from E cam.  They do good stuff.  They do. I like you, Kim, a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I use E cam for recording my podcast.  Yes. The best option I have.  Yeah. They know I do not.  I do not do weird screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They know. Yeah. Don't do the twirly screen.  No, no, no, no, no. Don't be a frog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Stacey, you had two other people.  Did you have how did you handle questions and that kind of stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I assume they could drop it in the chat or they could drop it in the Q&A.  I made everyone go to the Q&A.  So it was a little weird.  I guess it's no weirder than this, but hosting.  And this is weird.  Well, this is it was just here.  At least I have the chat.  Like, I know that there are actually people out there for this.  I was like, hello, everybody.  Welcome. And I'm like, I feel like I'm shouting into the void.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So it was a it takes some getting used to, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And I'm doing another.  I'm doing a speech this week that's prerecorded for June 9th, I think.  And that's going to be super weird because it's a 40 minute keynote that I'm giving.  And I have to do it sitting down  just to like my daughter stuffed animals.  I that's going to be strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I have no trouble doing this, but I've been doing it for my whole life.  Yeah, because that's all radio is, is you close your eyes and you talk  and you imagine that there's somebody listening.  I must have a very vivid imagination. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got to start recording my classes, my lectures for orientation.  Yeah. And normally I have an audience.  Normally I have people react.  I can get some laughs if I'm doing a good job.  And the worst part is recording.  Then I screw up something, start over again.  So I have to edit a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I have found when I'm when I wrote my speech, I actually pulled in  because I think people are going to be doing other things.  Maybe while this maybe I'm maybe they're going to be so focused on me.  But I kind of doubt it.  They'll be doing so I'm like, yeah, setting aside little interludes  where I'm like, OK, hey, everybody, take a minute.  If you're checking your email, come back to me for a second,  because this is a really important point.  So I'm going to do that. But we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I constantly imagine what people are doing while they're listening.  I don't know why. Just somehow I'm able to do it partly because I'm a monologist in life.  Like I talk to myself all the time.  So it just might just be, you know, it doesn't matter if somebody's listening to me.  I don't know. Well, good luck on that.  Yeah, that's great, Stacey. Yeah, that's great.  I'm really glad. By the way, just a little point of order for people  who are looking at eyeglasses.  Eyeglasses is not compatible with FaceTime,  Photo Booth or the latest versions of Skype or Zoom.  We've seen this a lot because they don't like virtual.  Right now, and it's working.  I know they don't like. Well, you may not be using the latest version.  They don't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't like Zoom.  Zoom, they got rid of all those other cameras.  They don't like virtual cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't want you to use virtual cameras.  So there's a virtual camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a way to do it on the web.  So be careful when you upload. What is a virtual camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Upgrade Skype.  It's a software that pretends it's a camera.  That's how these work.  So they capture the camera, but they try to look like a camera.  You're going through them.  So they try to look like a camera to Skype or Zoom.  And I guess it's tricking your Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's how you do snap.  That's how you have an animal in your head on snap.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ah, OK, I got you now.  I'm like, what are you talking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't get that.  I understand.  Speaking of COVID, you're taking the chance because you saw that Google  kicked Podcast Addict, a nine year old podcast app out  because it let users play podcasts that reference COVID-19.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For a little bit, they did.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hiroshi Lockhammer actually was very chagrined,  personally apologized.  This is a constant problem, though, on all platforms,  where they're simultaneously too generous and too locked down.  And it's very hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they get crap either way.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Freedom of speech. Kill it.  And they're caught in the middle.  So I put a post up on Twitter that went crazy.  I put the same post up on Facebook.  And what it was was a church in Georgia had opened on April 26th.  And then families got sick, sadly.  And so it's closed again.  So I tweeted that.  Then I looked at the sermon the minister gave that day and I quoted it.  And he said, my Lord is not named Corona.  My God is not named COVID-19.  So I put that quote and the video into Facebook.  No reaction.  I have 4000 retweets on Twitter.  No reaction.  Zero on Facebook.  So I've got to believe that those are the C words you can't use now.  Oh, interesting.  OK, I don't know.  I could be wrong. I could be wrong.  I don't know.  I'm just betting.  It is.  And so how do you get the difficulty we've talked about for years now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  on censoring fake news, because the whole thing, this is all coming from a desire  not to show, you know, not to recommend chloroquine or drinking bleach or whatever it is that  people are doing.  So they want to protect people.  And that's reasonable.  But any attempt to stop fake news inevitably seems like it goes south in some ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is why I think that our main job is to amplify expertise now.  And the effort to stop fake news is quixotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it quixotic or futile?  Both.  OK.  Both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, while we're on COVID, I want to show off.  It's tilting at windmills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I want to get one of those.  Where did you get that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I got one.  Can you hear me still?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's so the advantage of doing it is people can read your lips.  They can see your expressions.  It's a clear plastic visor.  I don't know if it works quite as well as a mask does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, so under my...  Oops, I screwed up the holes on this one.  Under my number, I have a paper there from a scientist I follow in my COVID Twitter list,  which you can see on the other side.  This is what I just bought, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You didn't really.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You didn't really.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha ha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's only 22 bucks.  I have a feeling it says it's replacement.  That's what worries me.  I don't know what it's a replacement for.  I'm wondering if I have the actual...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, aren't you supposed to have a tube that goes up into that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you're probably...  Yes.  I did.  You're just suffocating me.  I have taken...  I made a mask that I put quilting material in, so it's like a little mini quilt.  It's like a quilt square.  And it really filters so well so that I've almost passed out, because I didn't realize  I wasn't getting any oxygen.  So you have to be careful with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You really do.  Eli Parasevich is an epidemiologist at the University of Iowa.  I think he is.  So there's a paper, Journal of American Medical Association, I put up at the very bottom of  the rundown.  And I've been following him on Twitter.  And this protects me from...  Spit.  Incoming.  Yeah, people spitting in your eye.  Far better than a mask.  Yeah.  And your eyes and your mouth.  Now, it's unclear as to how much outgoing my spit is.  Well, it's going down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if I sneeze right now, it's going to make a hell of a mess.  I've been wearing safety glasses with my mask.  I feel like...  Because the problem with a mask alone is your eyes are...  That's the third entry point is eyes, mouth and nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dr. Fair on NBC thinks that's how he got it on a plane.  Yes, because he was wearing a mask.  Is better for me than a mask.  Unclear the other way.  And so I can imagine teaching this as awkward and ridiculous as it is, but you can see me,  we can talk.  It's not quite so wacky, but I'll get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it so interesting how we're all kind of just figuring it out together.  It's like there's nobody...  And it's not a US issue.  It seems like nobody in the world really kind of understands it.  We're all just trying stuff to see what works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I watched the scientists on my list and it's so fascinating to see science  in action.  This is how it works.  This is how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was going to say it's science in action, real time science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They still have not decided aerosolization.  They still don't know.  And so six feet is almost random.  They don't know whether six feet is the right distance.  It might be 13 feet.  It might be time.  We don't know.  I just tweeted a list that one epidemiologist raised of everything she could find in the  news.  There's a German journalist named Kai Kupferschmitt.  He wrote about this.  What do we know about super spreaders?  And there's this fascinating list.  If you look at my Twitter feed, it's high up, where it goes school, workplace, dormitory,  ship and one by one by one church, one by one by one, where people are getting it.  And they're learning more day by day about how it spreads.  And they think there are super spreaders who for some reason spread more.  There was the guy in the clubs in Seoul where there's a hundred cases now because of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, would you do me a favor?  They're asking put on your your clear shield and well, you may already know you may not  have to put it on.  Does Face ID work?  Oh, you don't have an Apple phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't have Face ID.  You think I am a cultist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you just wear the blue ring without the mask, you kind of look like a cultist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of like that is true.  The wild hair.  And I bet if you start screaming moral panic, we'll be like, oh, it's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Jennifer, my ex-wife found was driving around and there was a podium on the street  thrown out.  We have there's a little Hermann Sons Hall over here is a little auditorium and actually  used to be the home of the German-American Bund during World War II.  The Nazis would gather there.  That's the Hermann Sons Hall.  And there's beautiful handmade.  It looks like heavy wood podium.  She sent me a picture, said, do you want this?  I said, hell yeah.  So now I can't show you.  I wish I could.  Is there a camera over there?  Now we have a giant podium.  And I was thinking, if only I could get this to you, Stacey, it might help you to deliver  your talk instead of sitting down if you're standing at a podium.  And I've seen some professors do that, right?  Make kind of fake podiums.  I wish everybody I have no real use for this, but I kind of wish everybody had a podium.  So Jeff is our Jeff is going to he's setting up a camera so you can you can see this thing  is it's gorgeous.  I don't know what I'm going to do with it, but I figured, you know, I ought to have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  podium. It's better than a soapbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's a podium that comes with its own soapbox, by the way.  You get up on a little stand.  Oh, nice.  So I can't for short Germans.  For sure. I could bring this to Hyde Park and give a speech.  Preach to the match.  Yeah. I don't see if we get a shot here of this.  Jeff's. I'm sorry.  How heavy is it?  It's really, really heavy.  Jeff, go stand at it.  You got to pull it back because it's hard to tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you already it's already got a tweet logo on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Because, you know, so ladies and gentlemen, I come to you.  The great state of California casts all three hundred and seventy two ballots for Jeff  Jarvis, former TV guide critic.  What do you think? Pretty good, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a pretty thing. It feels like the proportions might be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's just the way the angle.  It's if you saw it front on, it's pretty.  Yeah, it's made out of like looks like it looks like some Nazi hammered it together  in the 30s and donated it to Herman Sonsall.  Mr. Speaker, I paid for this microphone.  OK, anyway, moving on.  Yeah, who said that? Who said that?  That's a good one.  I don't. It resonates.  I'm sure we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's there must be Ronald Reagan's testy moment in the 1980 GOP debate.  That's right. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am paying for this microphone.  I am paying for this microphone.  Oh, now he's playing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry, I didn't mean to.  I mute on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, since we're talking about podcasts with the podcast  big story in my world, probably not in anybody else's world.  But Joe Rogan, who is widely considered to be kind of far and away,  the most successful podcaster of all time, he claims one hundred  ninety million downloads a month. Good Lord.  We might get that in three years, literally.  So that's that's an awful lot.  If I do my math correctly, yeah, that would take us three years.  So he says every month he has made a deal with Spotify,  which, of course, looks like it's trying to corner the podcast market.  They've spent they said they would spend half a billion dollars.  They bought Gimlet Media, a big podcast maker.  They bought Anchor.  They bought the Ringer.  They've been buying a podcast networks and they must have paid.  I have to think that they paid Joe Rogan a significant amount of money.  Hundred million.  That would be that was my guess.  Is that the actual number?  That's what Wall Street Journal says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, my God.  I mean, Joe Rogan is the PewDiePie of podcasting.  Yes, that's a perfect example.  Controversial bit of a jerk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a former wrestler.  He you know, the most successful podcasters both were on  the Man Show.  He and Adam Carolla, both and Jimmy Kimmel,  all three of them came from the Man Show.  So I should have been on the Man Show instead of Tech TV.  I made a mistake.  So all 11 years of the Joe Rogan podcast will be on the Spotify  service September 1st.  And at some point before the end of the year, and this is the deal,  this is the big deal. They will be exclusive to it.  And that's what I think is going to be very telling.  This is like Howard Stern going to XM.  Yes, yes.  And except Howard made five times more money, but still 100 million ain't bad.  I'd say Howard wouldn't sneeze at that.  Yeah. Yeah.  Nor would you.  It's a multi-year licensing agreement.  The amount of time cannot be learned according to the journal.  They're saying it will likely be worth more than 100 million.  So they're making it up.  But that was actually the number that came to mind as well.  It's certainly worth that. And here's why.  And this was my concern from day one with Spotify getting into podcasting.  I was worried that they said, oh, no, no, we're not going to make an exclusive.  But as soon as it's exclusive,  then they know more about every single Joe Rogan listener because you have to be,  you don't have to pay for it, but you have to be a subscriber,  which means they probably have a credit card. They certainly know who you are.  They have your email address. And more importantly, you have to listen in the app,  which means they'll know exactly how often you listen.  We'll know if that 190 million a month is real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For what they can tell their advertisers, be it any other podcast,  or tell their advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we, I know this is a problem for all digital media because everybody who's  not Facebook and Google lives in the world where Facebook and Google can tell  advertisers everything they ever want to know about the people who are seeing  the ads. And advertisers love that. They gobble it up,  whether that's valuable or not. We've just debated many times,  but it's going to hurt.  I think it's going to hurt RSS podcasting real traditional podcasting because  RSS does, there's no way we can gather information on you.  We're on a million different platforms.  It's just a stream. Same thing with your podcast, Stacy, you know that,  you can't really tell about who's listening.  All you could, the best you could do is see the download and know that somebody  downloaded it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple has stats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but those are only good if you listen in iTunes in an Apple device,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  right? And most of my audience, well, a good chunk of my audience does not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Almost half of ours does not.  Yeah. And that's, I want to keep it that way. In fact,  I was mad when Apple did this. Now what it'll,  what it really is going to be is Spotify is going to kill the ad market,  or it's going to hurt anyway, the ad market for RSS podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, what you need to do is establish a newsletter and a virtual event  business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you are so smart. I should have thought of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, what are you doing in your spare time? Come on, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So, so Stacy, the way you just said that you were planning real  events. Now having done this virtual event,  do you think you would try to plan real events again or screw it?  Virtual is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would like to have real events because I think there's a lot of value in having  people be face to face, but I don't think that's realistic until 2022.  Yep. I agree.  So, and right now, I mean, just as an open, open into my business,  part of the event strategy was I happened to be planning one,  but also this is a good way to offer people who might be on the fence about  advertising additional value.  So you can sponsor an event and you also get a discount on a podcast  slot too. And that way you feel like you're getting more bang for your buck.  You are.  And that's keeping my revenue stable through COVID, hopefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good. Thank you.  You are a deep thinker.  And a good entrepreneur.  Yeah. That's smart, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I try. And my partner does most of the deep, deep thinking.  Cause I'm worried about the internet of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Honestly, I think that's a good division of labor. I do the same thing.  Lisa worries about the business and I try not to because,  yeah, I want to focus on the content.  On the media front, since we're talking about media and Jeff is here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you see the New York times building their own ad network? Finally, Jeff.  And what does that mean? I saw that and I'm not sure they were,  they were using a third party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it on the rundown? I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, maybe not. I saw it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And maybe I neglected to get it on the rundown. So it's not really a,  let me find a Google story.  They said that they're going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're dropping third party ad networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's next year. Why can't I find the story? Where did I see this?  All right. Well, I'll keep looking.  We can remember way better.  The New York times can get away with that most anyone else.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I mean, I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember way better.  The New York times can get away with that. Most anyone else could not.  I remember when Google adsense came out.  I was at the event where Google and New York times announced it.  And Martin is the VP of New York times.  And I'm Mr. Google fan.  Hey, cool. Google doesn't let's play along.  But even though I said at the time, why are you putting this up on your site?  Why? I don't get it.  And Martin said, it's going to expose us to all kinds of other advertisers.  We're going to get revenue we couldn't otherwise get.  Yes, the danger is people will go around our own buying, but we have the stricture so that won't happen.  But then, of course, as time moves on, oh, my God, Google stole everything.  Well, Google actually sends billions of dollars to publishers through this network.  And the New York Times could back off because it has all the data because everybody's a subscriber.  But I don't think it's going to work for most anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't find it.  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, that's we just talked about it. We're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're done. That's all we need to know is just a little stone skipping the water.  You know, next story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the red fox screams when it howls.  I got one for you today.  Apple pushed an update to iOS.  Google will push an update to Android.  The API is on your phone.  How do I know? How do I find it?  That's an interesting question.  Check on your. Let me see.  Let me see. I have my pixel. Where's my pixels in the other room?  But I would presume it would be come with with the with the contact tracing.  Yes, it's the API, not an app.  So I presume it would come with that's why you wouldn't necessarily know.  You wouldn't know. I'm going to guess, though, it would come with an update.  It does with Apple. It comes to the thirteen point five update right now.  Alabama is working on an app.  South Carolina is working on an app in North Dakota.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm doing this to me.  So if you live on the border of North Carolina and South Carolina and they have different apps,  how do they know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  And then North Dakota is planning to incorporate the API into its Care 19 app,  which apparently, according to the Verge, drew significant criticism from users in its early version.  Utah is due or is it Idaho?  I don't know. We talked about it yesterday in security.  Now, I can't remember if it's Utah or Idaho has its own app, which has nothing to do with these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These are the ones that cost millions and only 40,000 people are using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You probably. But, you know, which state is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't I don't know. Utah is going to come to Google Play system or is it going to come with the version unknown?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. That's what I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The API is accessible to people in the public health community that want to build the apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But the question he's asking is how would he know if he's got it yet?  Supposed to come out today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I don't know. I always forget how to find my version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You go OK. God, you pull it down. You hit the gear.  Yeah, I go to the very bottom about phone will tell you the version.  But I don't I don't have my Pixel 4 with me. I mean, I do. It's just in the other room.  I don't want to get up and run over exposure notifications available on Android 6 plus.  Marshmallow and later it's powered by Google Play services.  So you would have an app, an update to Google Play services.  So you can from your phone's settings update.  We see. Yeah, there you go. That's it.  And from your phone's setting app, you can visit the Google menu to control it.  So you could go into the Google menu and then control it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'll let you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, just a just a point.  You know, we're going to contact tracing, it seems in this kind of, you know, catches, catch, can.  Let's try it and see if it works. World seems to be widely agreed to be one of the things we'd need to do to be able to get back to it's going to be incredibly imperfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if every case you reduce is a reduction from the are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So, yep. And, you know, I mean, you just it's it's completely empirical.  We just try it. See what happens. I don't know. What are they doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I forget. I don't know the Google menu to get to the Google menu.  You actually just go to the app called Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. You pull down your notifications, you hit the gear and then there is a Google entry in the settings.  And it's supposedly in there. I, you know, like I said, I don't have it.  I mean, I don't have my phone.  And it doesn't matter if the APIs on there because until you have an app that takes advantage of it, nothing's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's that's what I was curious about. I was like, why do we care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I wonder whether it's under security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right. What do we want? What are we trying to look up again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In your version on your Pixel 4 in the settings, there is a Google setting.  Oh, OK. In there, supposedly there will be settings for this API, which to turn it off or on.  Actually, I'm very curious to see if the default is off.  I may be my guess the default is off. Google account services, ads, backup data, messaging, device connections, on-device sharing, security, stuff in that.  But is under security, you said? No, no, it's just under Google. No, I was guessing.  Oh, it's just under Google. So, oh, that's not there yet. Yeah. Mine is not there yet.  And I don't know what the settings will say. So.  Just keep going. I'm pretty sure it's going to be off by default.  Now, my iPhone is now updating, so I don't let's see.  I don't know. Let's see if Apple says how you can control it on the iPhone.  Just security updates. They're not saying a whole lot about it.  So I don't know. But that is supposedly the API is now in the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Meanwhile, for us old people. Yes. Hello, Gertrude. OK, Gertrude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently not that old. No. What was the joke when old people trying to use OKG?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it was a joke about Google. There was Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then there was the one that was silver, the Echo Silver, where they'd say, Andrea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google is now working on a simplified version of the what was it?  Home Hub Max Duo, whatever the hell that thing is.  Retirement homes. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't I don't know. They'll be what can you do cards?  So that'll tell people what they can do, which is good.  It's good. I like this idea. You know, every time I come in my kitchen,  my Nest Hub Max makes a little tone because it recognized me.  And what's really interesting is it recognizes me  if it just glimpses me out of the corner of its camera.  It can recognize me now from the back of my head.  Hi, Leo. Sneaking in for a little late night peanut butter cup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hi, Leo. Hi, Leo. So mine doesn't recognize me when I wear glasses, which is hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems to be getting better. I think it's training.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, OK. I'll have to I'll have to keep working.  I just I pop by and it's like I I feel like, oh, you know, I kind of like it goes blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then it says, hi, Leo. And then it says it's your morning.  Here's what you have on tap today. I really like it.  I know many will find it highly creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I think it's great because when it works, it's awesome.  And when I tell it to call mom, it's like calling my mom on duo.  And if my husband says call mom, it calls his mom.  It knows the difference. Isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, that's pretty cool.  It seems though maybe this is just me.  But tell me if this is the case, Stacey, that capabilities come and go.  Like one used to announce who was at the door and it doesn't do that anymore.  But now when my daughter calls me on duo, it makes a hell of a ruckus.  It just seems to be doing different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did it did you switch your Nest account over?  No. OK, that's the only thing I don't have any devices like Google Nest devices attached to mine.  I have them all pumped into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to be able to say, show me the front door, show me the backyard.  It used to say somebody's at the door.  Well, I haven't tried.  I mean, just noticed that people are at the door and used to ring the Nest Hub Max.  Anyway, I think this is a good thing.  I think seniors, speaking as somebody who... am I a senior or not?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you're a senior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you get the discount of Taco Bell?  That's the only question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, there's a discount at Taco Bell for old people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How old do you have to be to get the discount?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it an ARP thing or is it just I'm this old?  You're just not this old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can get the senior discount at the grocery store because I think that's 62 or 60 or something.  Anything with a six in the age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can get into Whole Foods Senior Hour now at 60.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I guess I'm a senior.  So it's okay for me to say that these devices are good for seniors.  I've talked to a number of people on the radio show who are thrilled.  You know, they have their Echo or they have their Hub and they can talk to it and it plays music for them.  We gave an Amazon Echo to Lisa's parents.  They love it.  Play a lot of Elvis.  A lot of Elvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My  Amazon Echo and they love it too.  They play music and their grandkids love it because the grandkids come in and they're like Echo play this.  And I think they I think they regret it when that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody's saying that the Taco Bell discount is Medicare Plan T.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You're eligible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Congratulations.  I still have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't had Taco Bell now since the first week of March.  Why not?  Because we have we have done no takeout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you care about the future of your restaurateurs?  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do indeed.  But no, my wife doesn't say think it's safe.  I think maybe maybe she doesn't like eating that.  No, I don't think we have not done take out once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We do it probably once a week.  In fact, it once a week.  Yeah.  It's nice because you don't have to cook that day.  It's a nice thing.

Transcript:  And, you know, you get variety because I got to say, I'm I'm totally burnt out on thinking of new things to eat.  OK, we're not.  I made meatloaf the other night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would like somebody to compete with Amazon.  So can I buy the same things on Facebook that I can get?  That I can't tell.

So the question is, how do we beer of course?  I don't know.  They've delivered 80 pairs of shoes and shoes.

Transcript:  Oh, I would do that.  Yeah, I would do that.  Thanks to you.  Together, we'll deliver.  I am very grateful to my Amazon.  Oh, so am I.

Transcript:  Jet's done. OK, there's a couple of things.  They killed it and they did buy it for that much.  But basically, they spent a lot of money hiring the head of Jet, the founder of Jet,  and built out their e-commerce, built like three point three billion dollar acquire is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  pretty expensive. OK.  But it doesn't mean it doesn't mean I agree with you, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't mean they're shutting it down.  They just shutting the name down. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're shutting in the vision behind Jet didn't work really well, but didn't work  initially. People that came over helped build out Walmart's e-commerce platform in a way,  not just the the guy who not just the founder, Lour, I can't think of his first name,  Michael. No. Anyway, it's not just him.  It was also a bunch of data nerds, a bunch of technology know how.  So I know the brand is getting killed, but Walmart actually is pretty good at fulfilling.  I've ordered online at Walmart, whereas I don't usually go to the Walmart store and  people can call me elitist. But my local Walmart has a terrible, terrible UI as it as it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it smells funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mine does not smell funny. They just it just takes forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It scares me. Walmart scares me just not the people, just the size of it.  Mark Lour, Mark Lour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Chamlee in the chat room.  So, yeah, they're shutting it down.  It never you know, from day one, Jet, how many companies have have gone on the rocks  trying to beat Jeff Bezos at his own game?  A lot of them. Mark Lour was aiming straight at Amazon, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's that's the idea.  That was the rumor at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You'd think now today would be the day the Jet the Jet division of Walmart would  be doing so well, but maybe not.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Jet had this idea about like just in time pricing and personalization that never

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  came around. Yeah, it was too complicated for people.  People just want to people just want to in their head say this is the lowest price.  I know it is. I'll take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Also, as Amazon has showed us, that might get them some antitrust attention otherwise.  So, right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then meanwhile, this is rumors.  Normally, I don't put rumors in the in the rundown, but this one amazed me.  The rumor hot and heavy is that Amazon might buy JCPenney out of bankruptcy.  Oh, yeah, just went bankrupt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the question I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They wouldn't. Why would they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do they need physical storefronts in malls?  No, malls are dying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our JCPenney went away years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't either.  That's hot and heavy.  And Amazon stock went up, went up as a result.  You think it would go down?  Like, why would you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the idea is, yeah, that this is a place where people could go visit.  There's the other idea is that it is a more local extension of their delivery warehousing.  But again, I feel like Amazon would be better off if they want to show people things.  Buying a store, a brand like Beta that is designed solely to show people things, right?  Right.  As opposed to like you showroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Trigger warning, I'm going to show you a really disgusting bug.  OK, it is named Troglomyces Twitteri, named after Twitter  because the entomologist who discovered it first saw a picture of it on Twitter.  And what does it do to the bug, Leo?  Because this is the fascinating part.  It devours the genitals of millipedes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And no, it's not an insult to Twitter.  It's a tribute to Twitter.  It's a parasite.  It's a parasite after Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, an entomologist, the Natural History Museum of Denmark at the University of Copenhagen.  The parasite first came to her attention when she saw a colleague share a photo of a North American  millipede on Twitter with two strange white dots flicking the millipede's exoskeleton.  She immediately, this is how good she is, Anna Sofia Rebellera, immediately pegged it as a parasite.  Did a little research and yep, the Troglomyces Twitteri.  This, by the way, is not the Troglomyces Twitteri.  This is the millipede.  The little white dots circled in red.  That's what she saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And she said, this is the original photo that she saw and thought, yep, that's a parasite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.  Dang.  Dang.  These scientists are so amazing.  So amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you consider finding a new millipede parasite, amazing and naming it after Twitter,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a genital eating millipede parasite.  Now, come on, bonus points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bonus points.  Hey, here's an interesting thing that Twitter is doing that I really like.  And it's only a rumor.  It's on tech meme.  But apparently Twitter is considering, let me find the story here, a feature that lets  a tweets author limit who can reply to the tweet.  Yes, it's actually people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it out?  Hunter Walk was testing it today.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, some people are already testing it.  This is great.  I love this because I would not have to listen to people who I don't care to listen to tell  me what they think about my thoughts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would, you know, pretty much everybody who adds me, I don't want to hear from.  So you could just say, I have added you.  I include you in that list, Ms. Higginbotham.  Probably some grammar.  No, no, no.  But you can choose everyone, which is the default, people you follow, or only people  you mention in the original tweet.  So what happens is a small glove icon, glove, in the corner of your tweet, tapping it.  Should I try it?  Every time I tweet, I get in trouble with you guys because the last time I swore at  Jeff.  Yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People are like, what's the matter?  What did he do?  Oh, no.  You guys haven't fallen out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I make a tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you go to Hunter Walk, at Hunter Walk, you'll see him using it.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead and you do it.  Okay.  No, no.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's probably safer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He has a tweet that says this is a test of the new Twitter feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this Hunter Walk, the theater of magic, the pinball Hunter Walk?  Yes, that's Hunter Walk.  Yes, that's him.  Oh, look.  People they mentioned can reply.  People they follow can reply.  Oh, that is nice.  That is nice.  This pisses me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Eliteism.  Plus, the other thing it's going to encourage is people are going to do the thing we don't  want, which is screenshots of tweets so they can reply to that.  But of course, I could retweet his tweet and put smartass remarks in there, which is what  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh.  Okay.  I see your point.  But as someone who like, it's trying to target some of the abuse that people get on the platform.  Yes.  Like women and people of color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just thinking of myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I typed, hello, Jeff Jarvis.  And then where's the glove?  I don't know what the glove is.  If I press tweet and it just goes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you may not already have it.  I don't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you've got to set the standard to say no.  No one can do it.  Oh, it's in the settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So go to settings and privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okey dokey.  Let's see if I can make it that way.  No, don't show it because it's going to show all my private stuff.  Privacy and safety content.  Content preferences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's see.  Notifications.  Okay.  It's in advanced filters and then notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where's advanced filters?  I don't have that.  Under settings and privacy.  Under notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Under notifications.  Mute notifications for people you don't.  No, this is not the same thing.  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mute notifications for people you don't follow.  Oh, you're right.  You're right.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can limit who can at reply you your tweet, which is a different thing.  So I guess I don't have it yet, but that's cool.  I think that would help.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry, I would unmute so my dog would stop yelling at me.  I don't mind your dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like your dog.  So anyway, look for that.  I'll take her.  What kind of dog is she?  She's a mutt.  I'll take her.  I like dogs.  I told Lisa, if we're still in quarantine at the end of the year, can we get a dog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't get dogs in New York now.  Yeah, everybody should have a dog.  No, I mean that they're gone.  They're all taken.  Gone.  No, they are.  All the adopted dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Take two will make more.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  They just need to go to the deep south.  There's lots of dogs there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're all pit bulls.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why there's so many dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I decided, by the way, I'm only going to do happy stories from now on.  This is going to be the happy show for all of our shows.  Happy show?  Hey, you want to talk about Google's touch sensitive headphone wires?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, perfect.  Because I am super stoked about those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Perfect.  See, I put that one in there for you, Stacey.  That was mine.  I put that in there thinking of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is it?  You know your audience, Jeff.  So this is Google.  I feel like this is an ATAP project, but it's not an ATAP project, I don't believe.  This is the IO Braid.  It's a textile user interface that lets you swipe or touch or tap a fabric cord.  They've woven fiber optic strings into fiber optic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So by touching the cord, I'm sending a light signal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It says the yarns are capacitive and conductive.  So that doesn't...  Oh, the fiber optics are for visual feedback.  Oh, it's just so you can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's cool.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I guess I had to tell you it was fiber optic as opposed to fiber because most cords  are fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, fiber is just textile.  So it's a fabric braided headphone cord with fiber optic weaved into it.  You can twist, flick, slide, pinch, grab or pat, which sounds like...  Most of which sounds illegal, yes.  It sounds like the sexual harassment complaint.  So continuous twist or flick or slide is a discrete motion or pinch, grab or pat, which  are discrete grabs.  Only Google would classify.  I'm going to screw this up, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Those are really important to classify those things though.  That's...  I mean, someone had to come up with pinch to zoom.  I mean, that's what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's watch this interactive video and you can play along.  So here we go.  The following clip will show live interaction with a music player using pinch.  And it started playing jazz.  You turn it up by twisting it.  Oh my God, that's awesome.  Isn't that fun?  You pinch it to do what?  Pause it.  Slide it.  Pat it.  Fast forward.  Twist it.  Oh, so you change the mode by patting it and then twisting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This would be fun in like a DJ setting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So people at home are listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Micro-interactions advance chord-based interfaces by enabling the simultaneous combination of  precise continuous control.  Oh, this is fun for like scrolling.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they could do this to my hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And your hair will light up too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That'd be great.  Really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ... studies and experiments, which help us design suitable interactions and a real-time  gesture recognition pipeline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So think about like, imagine this in a home setting, right?  Yeah, put it on your blinds or something.  And instead of actually pulling on the blinds, it controls a motor that does something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But here's the thing.  Everything is going cordless.  I know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We don't have headphone jacks anymore.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is a slight problem.  Maybe you add a cord for things like this.  Oh, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, oh, we took away the headphone jack, but we're going to give you the new pinch

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  swipe slide.  Which actually connects to nothing.  It's just a new UI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there are still cords everywhere.  I mean, like imagine that as a lamp controller, for example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So the blinds is a really good example because you're going to have the cord there, but instead  of physically twisting it, you could just, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You just slide your finger down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, I'm returning my second pair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The next, the new Google buds, same thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did not work.  Did not work.  Worse, lemon.  It's your ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you have a metal plate in your head?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's not.  Hey, hey, hey.  No, I'm not.  No, because they have to communicate through your ear hole.  The hole in your head that connects your ears?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's sporadic, but it's there.  So I got the, I got your recommendation guys.  I got the Jabra's.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do they work for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which are okay, but I'm unhappy.  I actually prefer the Pixel Buds.  They're better designed.  They're nicer, nicer UI, nicer sound.  I was much happier with them, but they just do not work, Google.  And it's the problem of the early product, right?  Eventually, I'll probably figure it out.  Meanwhile, I've spent $199 on these.  I'm not happy.  So forget your happy stories, fella.  Here's a happy story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you probably saw the story that because...  Wait, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to, your job is if you want to, they have an app and you may hate it, but if you  download the app...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's dark mode for sound.  Is this what it is going to be?  No, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  It's it just it helps you tune it so it sounds better for your ears.  That's all.  Oh, okay.  That's all.  Thank you.  I just wanted you to know that.  Did you get the 65s or 75s?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  75s.  Fancy.  Yeah, I figured I might as well do it.  I mean, I'm...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you replace your ear thing?  Did you adjust your ear size thingy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The little...  Oh, I've done it so much.  Yeah, I've done every permutation and computation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it comes with a ton of them.  It even has like some memory foam.  Oh, it didn't.  Oh, because mine came like with a lot of different tips.  Oh, no, it's just three.  Just three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  The job was fine, but I prefer everything about the Pixel Buds.  I like the Google Buds.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow, Jeff, you're all in on the Google cult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it.  I am.  I am.  How about the Samsung Buds?  Those are good.  The Galaxy Buds.  Those are good.  Those are 99 bucks.  At least you won't have spent so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, you're going to get the Microsoft Buds out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, they are.  But they look so good.  Yeah, the Microsoft Surface Buds.  They're not going to work with them.  Oh, they have a positive touch.  Yeah, don't they look good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They look pretty.  Oh, hey, hey, they're only $200 right now.  Oh, on sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Go get them.  These cost me $1.99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, and $179.99 for eligible students, parents, teachers, and military.  You're a teacher, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They won't stay in my ear.  Well, no, that's the outside.  No way that will stay in my ear.  That's the outside.  No, I need the rubber thing.  The rubber thing's on the outside.  No, look at it.  Oh, you know, it's kind of like the AirPod.  It's like the AirPod.  That'll never.  I have wacko.  Yeah, no, they won't stay.  You got wacko ears.  He's got wacko ears.  Well, it looks like it's a really bad piercing job.  I know, it looks like a gauge.  Yeah, you're right.  This is not, I like soft plastic.  Yeah, I don't know.  I like soft plastic.  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's not going to stay in my ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is exactly like the AirPods.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's AirPods on a big pedestal.  AirPods on a pedestal.  Yeah.  So Google got some heat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The presumption was they didn't have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Google was done.  It was done.  They had canceled the diversity programs.  The presumption was they did it because of criticism from political conservatives.  Sunder Pichai has a response.  He says, Google is investing more resources in diversity than ever.  We did not cut them.  This was on the verge cast.  What we are doing in the company is constantly at our scale.  We look at that first.  We see what works, what we can scale up better.  All I can say is we probably have more resources invested in diversity now than at any other  point in our history as a company.  Now, NBC had reported that they had canceled the Sojourn program as well as two other programs,  DEI for managers and Allyship 101.  But that doesn't necessarily mean that they didn't replace them.  Pichai said, we have definitely made efforts to make sure the company can accommodate viewpoints  and no one feels they're not a part of the company regardless of their political viewpoints.  There are people inside Google who are unhappy, who are feeding people like NBC stories saying,  oh yeah, they canceled it because they don't believe in diversity anymore.  It's pretty hard to know why they might have canceled one program or another especially.  Or another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you heard anything about, so Daymore's suit was dropped.  It was obviously a settlement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was settled obviously.  They can't talk about it when you settle a lawsuit.  I wonder who settled for what.  We'll never know, will we?  It's in the clause in the contract.  It says, if anybody asks you, you say everybody was satisfied.  Everybody got what they wanted.  No, you can't say that.  You have to say everybody, it was mutually satisfactory solution.  Right.  It's a mutually satisfactory solution.  I thought you weren't supposed to say anything.  Well, if they ask and you have to say something, you could say, you could say I can't say,  but I think the best thing is to say, oh no, it was a mutually satisfactory solution.  It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's fine.  It's like when your wife says, it's fine.  It's fine, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's one of those, oh, it's fine.  I'm fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm fine.  I think that's just a general passive aggressive trait.  It's not just, it's not only wives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do it all the time.  Do you use fine, Stacey?  You say you lose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm the most aggressive, aggressive person that you would ever meet.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I prefer that.  Oh, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My daughters are very passive aggressive.  I cannot deal with passive aggressive people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get aggressive about passive aggressive people.  Yeah, no, I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want, tell me the truth.  I can take it.  I think, but I'm fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Excellent.  Okay.  Let's move on.  Hey, you guys, this is so exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's exciting.  They are going to do it.  They're going to have a real live in-person conference in Berlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's a little weird.  So IFA, which is a huge trade show.  I mean, like, yeah, and it's, it's crazy.  And it's usually, it's, is it, what's that place in Germany?  It's not usually in Berlin.  It's in Hamburg.  No, it's in Hanover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I thought it was, it's in Berlin this fall.  IFA is in Berlin.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  Hannover Bessey is in Hannover Bessey.  Yeah.  Okay.  So IFA, they've moved it to September.  They're going to only allow 5,000 people because the German government says you can only have  5,000 people.  So they're going to have, it's going to be invite only.  They're doing four smaller events and you know, more than a thousand attendees can be  at each of the smaller events each day.  The press conference is only going to have 800 journalists.  So that's pretty, pretty big.  I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now they say they're going to enforce social distancing.  So will they set these three chairs apart, that kind of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  Because think about how aggressive journalists can be in terms of like cutting in line and  things like that.  I mean, it's kind of part of your nature to be a jerk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Watch Cuomo's press conferences.  IFA's tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What happens at Cuomo's press conferences?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cuomo's, they're sitting six feet apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  That's the Hooke press conference.  And they, you know, they're at a round UN table, but they're very far apart.  IFA will offer you, this is the tweet, a real life experience and the human connections  we all crave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm giving it 50-50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The German government could just say, Ian, no, you're not.  Or people could not attend.  It sounds like a recipe for disaster.  I don't want to be in a room with a thousand people at any time.  No way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and this will be, I mean, there's also virtual events.  A lot of shows.  I enjoyed Microsoft Build.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I miss being in person.  I miss that a lot.  I don't like people.  I don't even like people, but I do like to go to shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm fine.  Not just fine.  I'm fine.  Fine.  Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I, you know, I agree with you, Stacey.  Like if we were, if you, the three of us were at Google I would be so thrilled to see you  and it would be fun and we'd say hi and all that stuff.  But I don't know if you have to, do you have to have that?  It's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  So I miss, I miss, there is an element of focus at these things where you can see in  real time, you can see what they're putting all their wood behind in terms of who's getting  keynote time and stage and how elaborate it is.  So that's part of it.  The other thing is you can see how people are reacting, where people are going, like  where they're, what sessions they're attending.  So where the zeitgeist is moving, judging by stuff like that.  And I don't, there's not a, there's not a, the same kind of thing that you can see in  a virtual setting all the time.  And then there's also just the nice like meetings.  Like one of the reasons we chose the platform that we chose for our next event is because  there's virtual networking and you can go in there and just click and you'll be randomly  allowed to talk to someone for three minutes.  And that's just, yeah.  Yeah, but, and you can leave early if you don't like the person you're paired up with,  but it's just really random.  And it's, it's kind of like this idea of like when you're in line waiting for something  and someone turns around and it's like, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I love that.  But as I said, it's enjoyable.  Is it necessary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's necessary for me.  That's how I do my job.  That's how I find people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.  So you do, you make connections that you need doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's also like, it's part of talking to real people.  Like Jeff, I'm sure you tell your students, you got to go out.  You can't just trust what executives at a company tell you.  You got to talk to users and normals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, we've got your t-shirt, Jeff.  This is from the chat room.  Thank you, Zephyr.  It says I'm fine.  And it looks like you were hit by a large caliber shell.  That's terrible.  Terrible.  Only going to good news.  So I'm not going to mention that a trade war could break out because the president has  extended a ban on Huawei and ZTE, two Chinese companies, and according to Nine to Five Mac,  now China is considering retaliating, calling Apple an unreliable entity as revenge.  I don't think that'll happen.  I would hope.  China is said to be ready to label Apple an unreliable entity.  Apple makes a lot of money in China.  Witness, it was the first stores to reopen.  While the rest of the world's Apple stores are closed, the Chinese stores were wide open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I found a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank God, because I got nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a good one.  Hold on.  Please.  I'm serious.  It was in protocol on the beta store because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like I'm almost forced to do a changelog here.  There's just nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I can't do that.  I'm trying to find it.  I'm so sorry.  It's in protocol.  It's all about the beta store and I keep trying to spell the beta store correctly and it's  not helping me find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the beta store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The beta store is a store that lets you try things.  Oh, here it is.  Okay.  Finally, Stacey.  You'd think I'd be a better Googler than this.  I'm putting it in the chat room.  So this is a store where you can go and test out different devices.  So drones, VR goggles, smart home stuff, all kinds of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, V8TA.  I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  So they actually opened in Texas and in, well, in Texas.  So they have stores in Houston and Austin and protocol talked to Vibhu Norbi, who's the  CEO of VETA, about what they're doing to open up safely and sanitize.  And it was really interesting, his comments about, because they're relatively small, each  employee is going to guide each customer group through the store.  And as people touch things, the staff member's dropping a token behind each person as they  touch.  And he's also, he also created a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have one way aisles.  You can only go one way.  I'm starting to see that in grocery stores too.  So you don't...  We have that in our grocery stores.  Yeah, you don't, your breath doesn't encounter somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So my wife was in the store today and a woman, an old woman got halfway down and then turned  around.  I've had enough.  Just turn around.  Oh, well shop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they created something called Shop Safely.  Now this is by them.  So, but this is, this is their, basically they've created a shop safely score for retailers  around the country, including like Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot.  And I just thought this was a really interesting, it's shop safely.co.  Yanko wrote this.  Yeah, Yanko.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My buddy.  Your buddy, formerly, former GigaOM colleague.  For a long time, doing great job reporting in variety on technology and entertainment.  I guess he's a protocol now.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Three former GigaOMers are protocol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should start looking at their stuff.  I'm going to start reading protocol.  It's a pretty nice publication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's an excellent publication.  I really like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The underwhelming reality of a virtual build.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this Tom?  I bet this is my former editor.  Tom Crazit.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Crazit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Crazit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He doesn't like that.  He's a cranky person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He is a cranky person.  He and I got in lots of screaming matches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's got a cranky attitude on all this stuff.  So how do they make money protocol?  I don't know.  They have funding.  Is it a subscription?  It looks free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's no paywall.  It's free.  I assume advertising, probably events eventually.  It's also just starting out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And to get back to that beta story, that's really the crisis for them.  They started up and then COVID hit.  So they never had a chance.  Well, they've been around for a couple of years.  Oh, they have.  Okay.  They've been around for a while.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're in my mall.  Oh, they are?  They're in Macy's too in New York.  What was the old store that had the wacky stuff?  The chair massaging?  Sharper Image?  Yeah, it was better than Sharper Image because it was actual brand stuff that was good, but  it had the same appeal of, oh, I want that silly thing that I don't really need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the model is they actually charge companies to put their stuff in their stores.  Right.  It's a marketing model.  Yeah.  And then they demo it for people.  And it's for like June actually did an oven demo in San Francisco stores.  The idea is products today are more complicated.  So you want to spend time with them.  They don't actually, beta's goal is not actually to sell these things.  It's just to show them to you.  If you buy it, great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sundar Pichai also on the Vergecast says they're going to go slow reopening Google, 10 to 15  percent of the employees at first.  It feels like they were, I mean, the fact that they didn't do Google I.O. at all sounds  like they were extremely cautious, more so than Apple, which apparently is already asking  people to come back to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course, Apple being the control freak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's really hard for Apple to do what they do.  It is.  I get that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Jack, both of his companies, I love it.  Rest of your life.  Don't ever come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't ever come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm thinking about I'm curious about this one.  Uses of useless real estate.  Right.  There's a lot of we works.  There's a lot of we works available.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I wonder whether we work could have a reinvention.  So I'm not going to my office.  I'm here at home.  My wife is fed up with me.  We know we can move to Kansas.  We move was cheap.  Right.  But I still I don't want to have to put the space in my home.  Do I go to a we work?  I live in Manhattan.  There's no room in my apartment.  I go to a we work.  I wonder whether there is a Starbucks alternative home office future for we work smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's like executive suites.  So it's been around forever.  We work as an upgrade on that.  I think people I think there's value in bringing small teams together to collaborate.  And that might be interesting there.  You might also see it as like a quarantine station for someone before they go into a  main office.  But I think most people if you can work from home I think the home market is going to change  a little bit.  We're going to see more real estate space dedicated to offices in the home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you're right.  So I have New York friends obviously who now who who look down their noses at me for the  being a bridge and tunnel guy who are now saying I think I'm moving out to Jersey.  They get more space.  They don't come in as often.  It changes your calculus of where you want to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My calculus was really changed when I could just park in front of my house and it really  changed when we moved in at the downtown Petaluma which is turning into a giant metropolis to  our East Side Studios here and I could park and I didn't get any tickets.  I have to say after a while as you get older living in the country ain't so bad.  Bridge and Tunnel guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean and you're living on an island.  Well I've never had to work.  When I left New York I had to live in New York to work at the publication there.  And then I went to my next job where I had to work in an office.  But after that I never did.  My husband's never had to work in an office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to be well motivated though.  You right.  I mean you you you don't need you don't need to say you don't need somebody to say OK you're  on a deadline.  Let's get going or anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well that's I mean that's the beauty of a journalism job is I have a deadline all the  time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you know I used to do the radio show from my house.  I used to do my radio show from the house and it was terrible because it was too easy  to get up and kind of slide in your slippers.  And because it's radio you have to put you slide on pants sit down and the energy level  was awful.  So I ended up renting a studio out of the house just because it didn't work.  Wasn't good.  My energy was was not very good.  So I think I need to come to work.  Notice I'm the only host at Twit that comes into the studio.  Right.  I could.  It's my luxury because I can say well I'm going to be here.  But then and that you can't be here.  I don't I don't know.  Actually I should ask them if they mind working at home.  They all seem to be doing great jobs doing their shows from the house.  And you guys are all working at home.  I'm the only one who's in here with me and me and Jeff.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't reiterate Jeff there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not that Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other Jeff.  No the other Jeff.  Jeff one Jeff two will let you guess which one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to figure out how to do this.  I'm going to call you Jarvis from now on.  I kind of like so it sounds like you're so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jarvis Jarvis.  What do you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's my first day.  Hey, I'm all from in Jarvis.  That's what we should call this show.  Well, I like that. It sounds like a tea brand.  Yes, I drink only I drink only a fine Formosa from Higginbotham and Jarvis.  That is fancy.  OK, I accept.  That is I like that.  Higginbotham, are you excited about Microsoft's 285,000 processor  supercomputer in the cloud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, that's not what I was excited about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, yes, it's using Azure Azure.  What were you excited about by build fluid?  Were you excited about fluid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I was excited about the digital twin stuff and Microsoft Artas or Azure Artas.  But that's just me.  But let's talk about that is you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even OK, our test real time operating system as you're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's let's talk about normal people stuff.  It's just because I was excited about the Internet of Things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're so amazing.  I just love that.  I like people who have oddball and enthusiasm.  No, it's always the best people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'm reading about the supercomputer really fast.  No, you know, I can trust the author.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm moving on. Yeah, you trust him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's it. Stone skipped on the water.  That's it. It's now sun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fine. The fluid framework sounds to me kind of interesting.  And we've been talking about it on Windows Weekly without much understanding  of what they're trying to do.  It is it is something that for a long time, computer companies have wanted to do.  Microsoft, too, where a document isn't just a document.  It's you know what it sounds like fluid framework.  It's way. Little talks.  It sounds like way.  We way. Yeah, it sounds like wave.  You embed different bits and pieces.  It's very web focused.  They're changeable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're from wherever they are.  That's why you're right. It's wave.  It is wave. It is.  It is the vision of wave.  And what's sad is wave was really cool.  It was poor Gina.  Tripani wrote her book and book and it died so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's because Google sucks at marketing and explaining its cool tech to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, maybe the fluid frame will be, you know, the wavy thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Microsoft will overcomplicate it.  You'll have to have talking paperclips tell you how to use it.  But other than that, it looks like you're trying to make it was like 20 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've got to let it go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Never let it go.  Never, never, never, never, never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that brings me to the.  Google change log.  Oh, wow.  Jeffy, Jeff, Jeffy did it.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Now, I am not a tab maven, but maybe and as you know, I don't use Chrome,  but maybe you guys are tab mavens.  They are now in Google Chrome in what is it?  Eighty three. They're putting they're rolling out groups, tabs, cluster,  cluster tabs. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm giving it a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I like pinning tabs.  You can see here in Firefox. In fact, I've pinned some tabs.  They have a little button and then they're persistent.  So that when you close the window and reopen them, the tabs,  these little pin tabs are there.  And Google's Chrome's got that, too, right?  You can pin a tab.  So what is how does this relate to that?  What is what is what is the group tab feature?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just thought you could group your tabs together.  So they all stayed.  They're persistent groups.  Yeah, I only so I'll confess,  Kevin actually showed me pin tabs probably like two months ago.  And I was like, that's the best.  Yeah. So so I don't know how they would differ because I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I know. So for instance, I have a folder right now called study.  So it's the you know, it's my it's my online study class  and the various documentation and things I need is and I can open them all.  It's a folder, but I can just if I open it all, all the tabs will open.  But like that, but I'm not sure.  So this is similar.  It looks like because here's Google showing a tab called reading.  It's highlighted and special and inside reading.  I would presume are a bunch of other tabs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So basically nobody ever figured out bookmarks. Right.  What was the great song of forgetting?  What was the great service, the bookmark service that we all used?  Oh, I love it.  It had a horrible you are delicious.  You are delicious. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, I use Pinboard because Pinboard took the delicious API  and Maciej Ceglowski said, you know, he missed it.  He said, I'm just going to write something that uses the API.  And that's why I've used Pinboard ever since.  But delicious. We all used it. Oh, it was wonderful. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was delightful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was delicious. So people do know how to use bookmarks.  Is that why you use a bookmark?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got I've got my bookmark.  The people they're going to clean up their bookmarks.  Like, oh, I have a weekend. I'll clean up my bookmarks.  I'll do the taxes. Right.  Nobody ever cleans up the bookmarks. Oh, no, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I use Google keep. Oh, I actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, what? I have very tidy bookmarks.  He's talking about obnoxious.  You probably have email box zero to he's talking about me  because I have organized folders, subfolders.  And because I use Firefox, my bookmarks sync to every everywhere I go.  So I have it's a muscle memory.  I know exactly where all my bookmarks are.  I love bookmarks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't really like I have a bookmark bar with my essential things.  But there's only 10 bookmarks that I have at all times.  And I don't add to bookmarks because usually when you bookmark something.  Well, this is probably our job.  But like, I want to save articles for a relatively short amount of time.  And so then I stick them in. Keep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Bookmarks are not for their for pages, not for their for sites, not for pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but there's only like, I mean, for a page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you start bookmarking pages, you're going to have a lot of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think you're going to have a lot of bookmarks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I had a recipe folder where I took my bookmarks,  like I bookmark recipes and stuck them in the recipe folder.  But I moved all that to keep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. See, OK, I get I get where the problem was.  Yeah, because so, for instance, I have a news folder of news bookmarks.  It's not individual news stories.  It's it's that's what I use delicious or or pin board for.  So these are all sources.  So tech meme, Nuzle, Reddit, Pinboard, popular bookmarks, H Hacker News.  So these are all sources.  But then if I go to Hacker News and I say, oh, this is good,  then this I will I will I will put on pin board.  So that's what pin board is, because it's too big.  It's too it would be too ungamely to bookmark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And from pin board, it goes with that's the one where this then that's  Zapier into the rundown with Zapier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it goes into the rundown in all sorts of places.  Yeah. So my pin board is actually doing that individual page thing.  And that's what delicious was.  So and the pin boards organized to do that.  You can look if I look at my pin board, these are all the news stories we're covering.  And then I use tags to organize them.  So these are all that these are all the stories we've ever done for Twig.  So these are this if you wanted to go back in history to every story  I've ever done on Twig, it's it would be there, which would be ridiculous.  It's exhausted.  Yeah, but if you just go to the top, these are the most they're in chronological order.  And that, yeah, I think this works really well.  So that so those are the ones you put on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But when I put something on the rundown, it doesn't show up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no. The run and the rundown is kind of the final arbiter that we put together.  That we put together.  You can show this. It's OK.  This is the final arbiter that we put together for each show.  Carson does this. You can see each.  The this is a Google sheet that has tabs for every show.  And that has all the stories.  And so when you give us something, that's that's where that goes.  Right. So I think it's using the right tool for the right job.  I don't I don't use browser bookmarks for for pages so much.  Although you see, here's my programming folder with every language I'm interested in.  And in many cases, these are individual pages.  But they're kind of the pages that I want to keep forever.  You know, like I'm always going to want sometimes their sites.  But most of the time, there are there are things I'm going to want for a long time.  Not just like ephemera like news stories.  Yeah, that shouldn't go in your bookmarks here.  You'll just end up having too many. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and I don't need them forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Keep is a good idea.  You should try pinboard, Stacey, if you haven't tried it.  I really it's perfect for that because the tags will give you a taxonomy,  making it very easy to find what you're looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But what about my ontologies?  Will it give me an ontology?  I'm so sorry. You are being very helpful.  And I will try out. I'm a huge fan of pinboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then there's a lot of additional stuff you can do.  For instance, this there's a I use a bookmark as I'm going through pages.  You could use pocket for that.  You ever use pocket for that or insta?  I did use pocket for a while. Yeah.  Pocket's a good way to do that.  But pinboard to me is a little bit better.  It has pocket like features.  But see, I just these little summaries, I put those in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I just use keep because it's on my phone.  It's on my.  Thinking I'm talking to you right now, computer, computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's say here's this article, by the way, which we should talk about door,  dash and pizza arbitrage, which is that was a great article.  Yeah. So great article.  And the and the funniest one is.  So the guy's making money because he charges twenty four dollars for pizza,  but door dashes lists it for 16.  So he was buying pizzas from door, dash and reselling them,  thereby making eight dollars a pizza.  So what I'll do is I will I will highlight that that salient point.  Go to pinboard.  See, pinboard now has the link, the title and that paragraph.  And then I can tag it twig, for instance,  and it suggests tags and then add the bookmark.  And now when I go to pinboard, it's it's already there with that little highlight.  I think this is a really good way to work.  I love pinboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's got the Zapier link or Zapier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it there was a kind of Zapier program now.  Zapier does I do it via RSS.  So I just have the RSS feed for this.  And when something new enters the RSS feed, Zapier automatically puts that in Google  Sheets. And they also tweeted I have a Twitter account called Links for Twitter  that it goes to. So I've talked about that before.  But, you know, I think pinboard is really a good solution.  And Macha had a good idea because he saw Delicious go by the wayside  then get sold to Yahoo, where it was neglected and blah, blah, blah.  So what he said is I'm going to charge.  But he did something clever.  He said it was cheaper.  The sooner you bought it, the less it cost.  And I have a life I paid like twenty dollars for a lifetime membership.  I don't know how much it costs now.  But as he got more members, he charged more money.  It was a very interesting plan.  But he's basically set it up to self-supporting.  I have twelve thousand four hundred ninety four bookmarks on pinboard.  I joined in 2010.  Oh, and by the way, people can subscribe to your bookmarks.  One hundred sixty five people follow my bookmarks.  I even know that. Which is wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They might not even know it either.  They may not be one of those whimsical decisions you make in your life.  Why is this happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My email is filled with this crap from Leo.  And you can use this. This works with pocket.  They also have a pocket like feature that will save a whole page for later reading.  They have a read it later feature, which I don't pay for.  That's additional cost.  I think there's a lot of nice features.  It has as an API is anyway.  We're in the middle of the change.  I don't know. I'm so sorry.  This is the question.  This is the kind of service, by the way, Google could really have offered.  Yahoo should have done a better job.  Asus announces hardware dedicated to Google Meet.  This is an advantage Cisco had early on.  They had dedicated hardware.  Asus, a Taiwanese computer manufacturer, is is going to make specific hardware,  including a camera, a screen, a computer and a switch for video conferencing with Google Meet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is a meat quality in the midst of the pandemic has been really bad for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.  Maybe this will work better.  It's an I7 processor.  It's a hundred twenty eight gig SSD.  It has a magnetic chassis so you can knock it just to the included stand or mount it out of sight,  which I think is really clever.  This is pretty nice.  I think it's a nice idea. It's not cheap.  It'll be about two thousand dollars for the starter kit.  The medium room, small medium room kit, twenty four hundred dollars.  The large room kit, which doesn't include a camera, two thousand dollars.  You provide your own camera.  I thought that was kind of interesting.  That's really more of a of a Asus thing.  We mentioned already that the exposure notification API is out.  Actually, what we didn't do, though, is go to the Google blog post where they announced this.  So this is the joint statement by Apple and Google.  If you want to if you want to learn more, they don't they don't talk too much about how it works.  Or but someday you'll get it.  Today's the day.  And someday today you'll get it.  Chrome has been updated quite a bit with more privacy tools, easier to manage cookies and site settings.  They've reorganized the controls to make it easy to find the most sensitive website permissions like camera access,  microphone access, location access.  If you if you if you just got the new Chrome, which you probably did,  you might want to take a look in the privacy and security section of the settings because there's some new settings in there.  You may want to manage Chrome is playing catch up there.  You know, there's Brave Firefox.  There are a lot of browsers out there, even Microsoft's Edge, that have somewhat better security controls built in.  There's new controls in Google Photos for how you share albums.  I you know, they keep talking about this sharing stuff and I keep trying to use it.  You can still do it via a link, which you can embed, of course, in an email or text or blog.  But but but.  You have the option to turn link sharing on or off any time you can decide if you want to let other collaborators add photos to an album.  I like the shared album. I think that's really cool where you could say you go to a wedding and say everybody share your pictures into this shared album.  I've done that. So take a look at the sharing features.  I'm not sure how this has changed. Rolling out this week when sharing an album,  the default option will be to share it with a specific person via their Google account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, and then when when they when you remove stuff, it will pull the stuff from the album that they may have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. OK. So it gives you more long term control over that.  That's one of the problems. If you share it with just a link, you can potentially lose control.  And I think we all want to celebrate the Aloha spirit with Israel.  Come on, come on. Hoa hoa.  You're so great. His sixty first birthday.  Yeah, wasn't he so beautiful? This.  The story of the recording of this is amazing.  He was it was many years ago. He's pretty young.  And the producer tells the story of I shouldn't play this whole thing, right, because Israel's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  people will come after us. And yeah, Carson started to run out and get this car and run over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He called the producer in like two in the morning and said, I just I have to come over.  I just have to did it in one take. She's that it was just it's amazing.  It's amazing story. So we all we all have the Aloha spirit now, especially with Hawaii in our minds.  And that's the Google Doodle celebrating.  Here it is. If you go to Google dot com, there's Israel.  I'm sorry, I'm going to ruin his name. Come on, call we all a call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I cannot help you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could ask Google how to pronounce his name, if then you pronounce his name to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come on, call we all a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, if you if you just press the button, it'll play, which is cool.  They put the video right in there. So how could I get in trouble for playing this?  I'm just playing the Google front page.  Brother Izzy, I'll just call him brother is.  Oh, man, that is such a good song. I never tire that song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that and hallelujah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Which version?  Hallelujah. Well, it's the most recorded song ever.  What was your favorite version? Was it the of course?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Katie Lange's is good. OK.

Transcript:  So Twitter says to NASA, you up?  Yeah, NASA say a conversation between Twitter and people.  They mentioned the tweets are only NASA can answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And NASA says, yeah, tweeting from Earth.  What's up with you? Nice.  We love Earth. Just look at it.  How's the Wi-Fi there? And what's your favorite space snack?  Is this actually somebody in the space station?  Wi-Fi is pretty decent.  Some of our NASA astronauts can tweet up from up there.  What's your favorite snack?  Launch meat.  So Mars V are NASA.  NASA Persever Rover is launching there in July.  Watch with us.  It's a date.  Oh, how do they do that?  That's so cool.  So so no one else can.  This is why you do that.  No one else can get in on this.  No. And you know what?  That's my biggest problem with Twitter is you're having a nice conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're not going to be able to get that message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Stacey noted the question is Stacey, does that solve any of any of your

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  raised issues about Harris, but she doesn't have a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People, she knows Twitter.  I don't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People are people on Twitter and they send smart stuff.  I even have my DMS open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, don't show this on the screen, but six people replied to my hello,  Jeff Jarvis. But see, this is why I don't know.  I don't want to open that.  Who knows what's in there? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm one of them. I replied to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm not going to look at it because I don't know.  It's a package.  Every time I get a package of a certain shape.  I worry about what's in it.  You know what I'm saying?  It's that package.  Let's take a break and then we'll.  I don't know.  Too much of my psyche is bleeding out now.  This is not good.  I'm going to put a lid on it, Leo.  Be the show host you were meant to be.  Don't let any of your personality come out.  OK, we're going to take a break.  When we come back, picks, numbers  and final thoughts from Stacey Higginbotham and Jeff Jarvis.  The fabulous tea company Higginbotham and Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Higginbotham and Jarvis.  Higginbotham and Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like them.  They make a great cup of our show today.  Brought to you by ExpressVPN.  Boy, now more than ever, now that we know that the Patriot Act  has passed, we can talk.  Yeah, we can talk when we come back.  And that without a warrant, law enforcement can go to your Internet  service provider, say, I'd like to see everything Leo looked at for the last 20 years.  And you know who knows that?  Your Internet service provider, because you go through them every time.  Right.  That's one of the many reasons people love ExpressVPN.  A virtual private network protects your security.  We all know that if you're, you know, on an open Wi-Fi network.  But nowadays, we're not doing that as much.  But you also protect your privacy because whatever the whoever the carrier,  whether it's at the coffee shop, your phone company or your Internet service  provider at home, they see everything you do and they record it.  You can. I know people say, well, it's all right.  I use incognito.  No, incognito mode doesn't hide from your Internet service provider.  Even if you clear your browsing history, your Internet service  providers, a record of every single website you've ever visited.  And now law enforcement can get it without a warrant.  Just ask for it.  That's why when I'm home, I never go online without ExpressVPN.  First of all, I know some people say, well, I don't want to do that  because it's going to slow me down.  ExpressVPN is the fastest VPN you've ever used.  It is indistinguishable from not using a VPN.  So you're really moving fast.  Several times I've accidentally left the VPN on and not even noticed.  It's that fast.  And they make sure your ISP can't see a thing.  Your Internet connection is rerouted through their secure servers.  Now, it's very important to understand that.  Yeah, sure.  You're private for the ISP, but the VPN now in effect sees all of that.  So it's really important that you use a VPN that is not logging, is not  tracking what you're doing, and that's ExpressVPN.  Their trusted server technology means they spin up a new server.  The minute you log in, it cannot write to the hard drive.  It's sandboxed.  And the minute you leave, it shuts down with absolutely no trace,  no footprints left in the sand.  ExpressVPN cannot and will not log your data.  And that's been valid validated and verified by an independent third party audit.  I really love ExpressVPN.  And because when you emerge in the Internet, you're coming from their servers.  No one knows that's you.  Thousands of other people use that same IP address.  So you're anonymized.  Also, your data is encrypted with 100% of the best in class encryption.  So your information's safe and it works on every device you've got.  Even your smart TV ExpressVPN is on your phone.  It's on your computer.  It's on your laptop.  Just tap one button and you're protected.  Rated number one by CNET Wired, the Verge Countless More.  It's the one I use the fastest and the most trusted VPN on the market.  And now more than ever, we really need it.  ExpressVPN.com slash twig.  You'll get an extra three months free and a one year package.  That's the best deal.  ExpressVPN.com slash twig.  Please use that address so they know you saw it here.  It's great to have them as a sponsor and it's even better to have them know that  you saw it and bought it because of us.  ExpressVPN.com slash twig.  Thank you, ExpressVPN.  Yeah, I wasn't going to do bad news, so I didn't want to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I forgot about the bad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't want to mention the in the reauthorization of the Patriot Act.  Ron Wyden tried, but the by one vote, one vote, the Senate did not enforce  a amendment that would have prevented law enforcement from  getting your search history.  I love the petition that said, Mitch McConnell, if you believe this so much,  why don't you show us your search history?  Yeah.  Why don't you show us your search history?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Has it gone through the House?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I was about to say, isn't this a...  It's not done yet because they can still...  Can they still rescind this?  Is it a done deal?  Is it going to the president's desk to be signed or what?  Let me check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a good question.  If it originated in the Senate, which I think it did, then it would  have to go to the House, right?  Yeah.  It would have to go to the House.  So, or in reconciliation, if the House has already passed it, they could add it,  but it seems unlikely, right?  This was something proposed by the ACLU.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't think it's the law of the land yet, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, they're going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does the House have its own Patriot Act?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's going to ask...  They're going to ask the president to veto the legislation.  Or is this the FISA-related legislation?  There's three amendments.  I'm like, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Ron Paul had a FISA amendment.  I don't know.  They've postponed, it looks like maybe, to postpone the vote.  I don't know.  They can't postpone it too long because if it doesn't get reauthorized,  it expires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Hold on.  Well, it already expired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have brought this up cold.  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  These were amendments that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just shows you, this is why privacy advocates are so concerned about the  contact tracing, because this stuff never dies.  You know, this was...  Patriot Act was in response to 9-11 almost 20 years ago, and it just never dies.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me look at this.  This is the 9-5 MAC.  It says the FBI...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That does not...  It does not answer the question.  It doesn't answer it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just read that.  I'm like, God, Politico?  No.  There's some clear reporting on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We need a song about how a bill is passed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I know how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If the Senate...  I know, I know, which we need to be...  They need to say this is the second verse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And if the Senate passes it and the House passes something different, then it  goes into reconciliation, which at some point somebody negotiates it.  And then they come out with a joint bill, which then goes to the president.  And that's why I'm a bill on Capitol Hill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have to vote on their reconciliation bill.  Do they?  Before they send it to the president, I thought.  It's not just made up?  I think you...  Reconciling committee, it has to get out of the committee and then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They need to do probably a quick voice vote.  Like, what do you think?  Okay.  Go ahead.  Democrats are also trying to ban internet shutoffs until the  pandemic's over.  That'll go well.  I think we're done.  I don't want to...  I don't want to...  This is bad news.  I'm sorry.  Let's only have some good news.  Okay.  Group tabs on Chrome.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yay.  Helical touch cords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fungus eating bug genitalia.  Eating fungus.  Yay.  Kastrati millipedes.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Let us...  Do you have a thing for us, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I went and I did my demo on the level lock.  And so I'm coming back.  That was so good.  It's actually really cool.  So I learned a little bit more about it for the people who were  inquiring, and it is really just a replacement bolt.  The bolt is, I cannot say, ANSIA.  ANSI?  ANSI.  ANSI-grade security.  So you can't saw through it.  The innovation there, and it's a former Apple person, is that you  take off your lock face, you replace the internal deadbolt, basically.  And what they've done is they've made it very easy.  Traditional deadbolts, and it's battery powered.  Traditional deadbolts, they're designed for a physical movement, right?  For me to twist the lock.  So there's a pretty hefty spring in there.  This lock isn't.  So it's very lightweight.  It slides back and forth if you're playing with it.  So that's how they got a lot of the battery savings.  Because I was like, that's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a little concerning though.  Does it seem like it's a little loose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, because you can't push it back if it's open and you can't saw through it.  So I'm trying to think of the use case where it would be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it just might wear out a little bit because it sounds like it's kind of loosey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, we'll find out.  You're using it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am not using it because I am moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you took it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that was the August lock I showed you last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you use it?  I would use it in my house.  On the new house?  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would.  Good.  And the benefit is no one actually sees any of the hardware.  So like the August I showed you last week, you could tell that that was there.  With the level lock, you replace the front plate and the back plate of your lock.  So no one has to know that it's a smart lock, which is kind of nice for a lot of people, I think.  Very cool.  That's that.  So that's the update there.  And I felt like someone had a question about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go to Stacey on iot.com because her COVID panel will be there soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that will be there soon.  Oh, and I can tell you sign up at stacey on iot.com slash edge.  And I have a half day event on machine learning at the edge.  And it's awesome.  I've got people from John Deere.  They're going to talk about machine learning on tractors.  I've got Shell.  They're going to talk about why machine learning cannot scale yet.  I've got just super awesome people.  This is great.  It's going to be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is coming up Thursday, June 11th.  Thursday, June 11th.  Nine Pacific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cool.  She's putting machine learning.  She's basically doing vision recognition on firefighters and their gear to see through smoke.  It's I mean, lots of good use cases, lots of good explainers on what edge is.  It's going to be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, this is so you're doing this.  Jeff's interviewing epidemiologists.  My friend, Johnny, don't forget the Stacom's guy and the Stacom's guy, which was great.  And my friend, Johnny Jed, is a travel guru.  And obviously, there's not much to talk about with travel.  He's been interviewing all the other travel gurus about their travels and stuff.  I think this is an interesting development that a lot of people that we now the technology to make this.  This was hard to do even a few years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's what the net really is, which is conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I think that's that's pretty darn cool.  I look forward to this June 11th.  Machine learning at the edge.  Stacey on IOT dot com slash edge.  Jeff, do you have a number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, let's see.  I'll go simple one.  So we talked about we work earlier.  The valuation has dropped from forty seven billion to three billion dollars.  Oh, probably.  Oh, how?  SoftBank sunk a lot into we work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they lost a ton of money, didn't they?  Well, have they lost it?  I mean, are they going to take a write off or are they going to hold on?  Oh, I think that's what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the write up.  Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. So it's not we were talking earlier.  I mean, I wonder about dead malls becoming schools with social distance.  Oh, interesting.  That's a good, you know, what happens to to office buildings?  My friend Bill Gross has a company that moves cement blocks up a tower  as a means of storing energy.  I even thought it was well, now maybe you could use an old office tower.  666 Fifth and move cement blocks up and put  one time square is nothing but the ball and billboards.  Maybe you put  solar panels on the outside of buildings.  What happens to these buildings?  The big box, turn them all into the malls that go away.  They go to what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You turn them into I-Bytes.  Well, data centers.  Some malls are becoming data centers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, are they? Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good thing.  That's what Rackspace did.  Rackspace was in a mall.  That is, you know, yeah, they were there years ago.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the roof is painted white for energy saving purposes.  Brilliant. Brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's in Texas, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep. San Antonio.  I've been there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a slide.  Another thing you could do with the mall, turn it into an amusement park.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what I said.  Well, that's what's happening in New Jersey with the  it's going to be it's already gone bankrupt.  I think two or three times it'll go bankrupt again.  There's a huge mall formerly called Xanadu  that wasn't even opening now.  Along comes COVID. It's doomed.  Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yikes.  I worry about Las Vegas.  You know, there's a lot of there.  There's a massive development.  Was it Show World or something that's going on in Vegas  that's going to be stopped completely?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they have really good filtering technology from the cigarette smoke.  So I'm curious to see if like they optimize the heck out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're dumb enough to go gamble, you're dumb enough to go there and get COVID.  You know, you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, they'll gamble because it's an addiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can't help it. They can't stop it. Yeah.  I don't know. I mean, I just yeah, I'm glad we didn't move there.  Has it turned out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You were thinking of moving there?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's hard core.  It's fun.  Sad.  I thought it'd be fun to retire there because there's lots of great restaurants  and entertainment and there was a giant there's the Madison Square Garden  guys building a giant planet sized theater, dedicated theater there.  That's also in trouble.  And they just finished Allegiant Stadium for the Oakland Raiders,  who are moving to Las Vegas for major so much for that football, so much for that.  But on the bright side, those condos we were looking at are really going to be cheap soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Meanwhile, I think my suburban real estate is going to go up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it might be. Oh, yeah, that would be nice if if our suburban real estate  got more valuable, then we can move to the big city.  As everybody just as everybody moves out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then you'll have plenty of room to park.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Yes, that too.  So I don't know if this is an appropriate pick or not.  It's kind of a cookie pick.  I've been playing with websites.  I always wanted a website that would be wouldn't have any thing,  and, you know, trackers running on it or anything.  It would just be content driven and really fast because I wanted to use  what's called a static website generator instead of a content management system.  So medium is a content management system.  I'm sure, Stacey, what do you use for your website?  Wordpress, WordPress.  I have a WordPress site, too.  So that's a content management system.  It's basically a big PHP program that's running all the time.  When you go to my site, the PHP program says, oh, quick, get a page ready.  It pulls from my SQL database.  It pulls content.  It pulls style sheets from another database, puts them together  and then throws this it's what we call dynamically generated each visit.  And that is very costly and slow.  So I thought, what if I have a website?  Because it's my stuff simple, if that would be statically generated.  And so I created Leo dot FM.  It's running on this on a kind of server just over here.  And I don't know, this would be a good test to see if it breaks down here.  Let me show it to you. Leo dot FM.  Go ahead, you can show it. It's OK.  Oh, and you'll like this, Jeff.  You see that hideous dark mode that you hate so much?  There's a button right here that makes it bright.  Just for you, Jeff, just just for you.  But the but the reason sunshine in my life, I'm not sharing the blog particularly.  The reason I'm I'm sharing it.  And in fact, there's nothing really interesting on it yet  because I'm just kind of playing with it.  But it's kind of kind of cool because I can  I can generate it.  I'm using SSH into my server and use EMAX to write a markdown file.  And then I run the generator.  And this doesn't have to be generated.  This is this is static.  It's just HTML pages that are loading when when you visit it.  So it's a lot faster.  And it's using a program to do that called Hugo.  And that's what that's what my pick of the week is.  It's a very if you're interested in doing a website  and you could put this anywhere that anywhere you could have it.  I'm using NGINX and HTTP server, you know, Digital Ocean.  You could put it up in there if you have a box lying around.  And then you run Hugo, you can either run it locally  on your computer and then just copy the files over.  I run it actually on the server because then I can SSH into the server  and write the write the content there.  It's a very quick and easy way to write the content.  Hugo's free. It's written in Go.  So it's very fast.  GitHub has its own system called Jekyll.  It's also very popular for static site generation.  But but I really like the power of this.  There's a lot of themes.  It's very capable.  And it makes it easy for me to write blog posts anywhere very quickly.  And in a build, literally, they're right.  It takes milliseconds.  So when I put up a new post and Hugo generates the site,  it's literally like 30 milliseconds, 30 thousandths of a second  to create the static HTML page.  So you don't you don't need to run a very you can run this on Wasabi.  You could run this anywhere.  You don't need a very fancy server to do it because all the work is done,  you know, once.  And then anybody visits the site is just loading those existing pages.  I've been playing with it. I really like it.  It's pretty cool. Hugo at Go Hugo dot I.O.  And no, it's not a sponsor hosting it.  It's just it's a box.  It's a black box over there.  It's it's actually my Minecraft server, which I realized nobody's at work.  So I might as well use the bandwidth here.  We got a lot of bandwidth.  No one's using it.  And that's true. Right.  So I've been running a Minecraft server at home.  And I also that's it's the same server I'm running my Jitsi server on twit.team.  And what else is in this mystery box box?  Well, it's nice to have it.  So it's a it's a got a lot of storage and it's got a lot of RAM and it's fast.  It's a zion.  So it's a nice thing to have just a box that you can ssh into and put stuff on.  So whenever I want to play with a new  a device or thing, I can create a server.  So Jitsi is running on it.  I think I have five Minecraft worlds running on it.  And now I have my website on it.  So it's kind of cool. It's kind of fun.  Oh, next Wednesday, SpaceX launch says John G.  We know you like space.  Have you tried the SpaceX simulator?  That's another pick I meant to tell you about.  You could you can you can  you can do a docking.  So you see if you can see if you can dock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I failed at when I was a kid.  And we went and did our NASA field trip.  I was a navigator and had to like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now you can try again.  This is the actual interface used by NASA astronauts  to manually pilot the SpaceX Dragon 2 to dock with the International Space Station.  You can download it and run it, but you can also run it on the web.  And see. So, oh, my gosh, we're drifting off.  Oh, I got a I got a I don't know how it works, but  I've never been able to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The one that's going to have astronauts on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this Dragon launch? No.  Is it still an unmanned? Maybe it isn't.  Maybe I don't know. It is a manned launch.  Yeah. Astronauts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
