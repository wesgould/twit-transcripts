That's Jeff Jarvis the president. I  Just made you the president of the townite Center  You're the director of the townite Center for entrepreneurial journalism at the Craig Newmark  graduate school of journalism  New York  Craig Newmark

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How you doing Jeff? I'm doing well. Well, I got big big news big news  I don't we were saying I got a haircut first. I got a haircut. How'd you do that?  Itches I went to we're open officially I went asks

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah, I got my haircut too, but I did it do it on my back deck  I I like being outside  And masks and there you go here and got a haircut too. Look at him and prude  No, that's not Stacy Higginbotham. Stacy. You changed she shaped her head  That's aunt Pruitt of tech news weekly. You got to fix that lower third there. Mr. J. B  Rockman

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Come on, mr. Brockman

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacy is taking the day off. She's not feeling well, but we are really glad that aunt could be here  Yes, actually we kind of were planning on having you here anyway, I think so  We just glad to be here. I just threw one of the monitors off the set and that's all it's very  It's an easy thing to either now. Normally we talk about Facebook. We talk about Google Twitter  We kind of talk about internet in  policy issues

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Journalism that kind of thing do you know sir last time I was on we taught Google the last time I was on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Grief for not always doing well or all Google but this show is really about  The world Google is in right? It's not Larry Page Island here. This is everything  So if we were on Larry Page Island, we wouldn't be talking about Apple in any way  But do you did you are you at all? And it's funny because Windows Weekly ended up being half about Apple. Oh  Apple made  The most significant announcement it's made in years on  Monday it's worldwide developer conference. They announced that they were going to abandon  Intel chips and over the next two years transition to chips. They make themselves out they called it Apple  silicon and  It's it's a big deal in the tech world  I don't know if it's a really a big deal in this space that we cover but it is gonna change I  Think I think potentially here's here's here's why I think it's a big deal in  2007 Apple announced the iPhone a lot of people laughed Steve Ballmer Microsoft famously said that'll never sell  Of course they surprised a lot of people and I think the iPhone completely changed the face of technology  And this to me seems like the second act of that transition  So the iPhone began the transition to mobile a space where Intel could not play they tried  But no phone runs on Intel microprocessors. There's some maybe Intel radios in there, but only because  Apple was mad at Qualcomm  Intel really missed the mobile revolution and I think  This is the continued this is the next step where Apple says, you know  Are we might as well build on this very successful base of iPhone and iPad that we've got and make and transition our hardware  Everything in our hardware to Apple just let's make everything. There's a certain benefit to that, but it's also a monoculture  It's always risky and a computing monoculture might be risky  I think it's less risky right now than it's ever been because and and this is what we were talking about on Windows weekly from  Microsoft's point of view  It doesn't really matter because ever since their new CEO such an Adela took over five years ago  He's been saying it's not about the processor or the computer you're using. It's all about the cloud  Services, yeah, that's why Chromebooks can work exactly right Google understands that Google is a cloud first company  Microsoft's there isn't is becoming a cloud first company, right? Is there any

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Development in chips kind of waiting out there  I remember even even when I started on the show was the you know, whatever the the new version of the 8088 is out  I'm obviously that's not it. But you know, we would talk about about new chips and things and say oh look  It's new and haven't for a long time  Is there anything that's kind of we're waiting for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we're in an interesting time because I don't in the first  40 years of personal computing that was very exciting and innovative and there was lots of innovation  We've really settled down. It's like saying is there another Google waiting in the wings?  Is there another Facebook waiting in the wings? Is it I think I think there are

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There are I think if there are I don't know if I see it happening within the next  Five years anything like that. It's just so much of a foothold by all the existing companies right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's even worse with microprocessors because you have to create a platform that people develop on for you to succeed. So  It's hard to say well, I got a platform. I got Larry's platform. What do you think?  Or no, it's like no you got a pass pass. Are we already you know, and  So that for a long time that was Windows and Mac by the way never got anywhere. It never got to double-digit  Market share ever  Mac  Windows was always 90% or more market share  But that's but what's but that's rugs been pulled right out from under them because it doesn't matter anymore because there's a billion  iPhones out there all of a sudden

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Windows 90% Oh, yeah, always has back in a days. No still is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Linux is one or two percent Apple is four or five percent  Chrome what  Chrome is less than that even Windows is when there are more than two billion people using Microsoft Windows right now. Wow, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Haven't used Microsoft products in years

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not good not because I'm trying not to it's just I don't have a need to well that really that's part of the point is you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't need to no one needs to and the transition  I think we're seeing is you know these old days of operating system wars  Operating system wars don't make a whole lot of sense anymore than browser wars make a sense any sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're but I do think there are there are step changes out there  I mean, I've been I've been fond of saying that the internet is made for speaking and it's not yet made for listening and  And I think I think all the who had you screaming on about Facebook is is not snakes is  Meanness frankly, but I do think that there's a step change waiting in social  I think that there are step changes waiting, especially in the kovat era in how we connect with each other in new ways  I think there are step changes in product search and who wins that and and that's not fully  Amazon isn't isn't the be all and end all there they are in the in the infrastructure  But they're not necessarily in the search. I think there may be things to come well

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, let's let's look at that point about social about someone else stepping in  Several people have tried within the last five five years and probably within the last five to ten years and have failed  Clearly failed. What's the difference? What is the seat sauce? That's gonna put them over the the current  Social leaders right now Twitter and Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's it's the right question. I I think that the problem is all of those places try to replicate Facebook  And so they all fight last year by the last war

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like regulators regulate Microsoft want but that's the thing people clearly goes away Facebook, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think it goes away. Yeah, we have seen  Instagram and tick-tock, you know, we have seen seen that as a as a not a big step change, but you know little baby step  Okay  Please  Well  Bad connections right now as we're talking over each other without me  Very not hearing each other very famously

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why Facebook bought Instagram because Instagram like yeah talk now at the time  posed a threat to Facebook so Facebook acquired them remember though Facebook was very worried about snapchat and  For a while it looked like maybe snapchat would be the new  You know Facebook until Facebook added snap like features Instagram and clobbered them and  I I think that's why the network effectiveness is so important in this  You can be a better service and come along but everybody's on Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So right. It's a tough thing about the fact that how many times  People say okay. I want to try Twitter, but I don't get it because it's not Facebook  It's not like Facebook or even go way back since this is this we can Google with Google plus  They go into these different platforms

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Social network requires  Everybody, you know to be there. It's no good  So how many people I mean Google with all its resources couldn't beat Facebook  Snapchat Facebook tried to buy them they said no so Facebook said okay  Although snapchat's not dead. It's interesting. They've kind of  Hung in there. I don't think the problem is face that is fast  Facebook can do anything that you can do Facebook can do and so  Because everybody's on Facebook if they do it even half as well as you do  They can they can say people say well, you know, I can kind of get that on Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know why people aren't duplicating tick-tock. What about what about the Chinese the other Chinese services though that that do every bit of  Trend, you know, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wants to do but I it wants to be but they're not I don't know why that must be hard to do  I don't know what's go

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've turned blue blue blue blue

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So sorry we were both distracted by ants picture which we shouldn't I don't  It's a it's a hard thing to say, you know, it's very easy  You know, you know to say in Oh DOS will never be replaced  We're dominant. We own the world  And CPM you mean right? Yeah, see pia. So it's very easy to say that in history. You says well, yeah  Oh my beer, but on the other hand it is we are at the scale now where you know Facebook has everybody pretty much  And Google has everybody for search  There are competitor competing services, but there's a con there's  There's this network effect. That's hard to beat. I don't know as for it to answer your question chipmakers. Sure  There are lots of them out there  But most of them are gonna end up doing either arm or x86 the two major

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just doesn't were dying to wait for them. There's no third architecture coming along saying hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm as good as x86 and arm  I'm better you'd have to be a lot better because there's all this there's this all this installed base using one of the other of  That's why it's really interesting to watch what Apple's doing because desktop has been owned by Intel even AMD which makes  Chips makes Intel compatible chips. Otherwise, they couldn't possibly succeed  So so there's so and I know you're an AMD fan  But but you wouldn't be using it and if it couldn't run Windows and all the software that you use. Yes, correct consider it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's correct. So, you know, but Apple has a lot of clout though. That's why they do it with their history of  Of running those eight chips on those on the micro side of things and continuing to be the leader in  Checking out what people are doing now  Far as their competitors checking out what their competitors are doing now and then coming back and saying you know what we can do that  too, and we're gonna be able to do it better because we've been watching all of the mistakes that you've made and  Hey kudos to them it I think it's gonna work because it's still Apple and people are still gonna want to go to Apple and  They just have the I think they just got all the money in the right spot for us. The R&D goes  I hate what they've done to the professional creators out there that spent, you know, Tim Grant on a workstation. That's  Pretty much gonna be a faster workstation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That so you're you just built your our AMD machine, but if when it's time to consider the next one  If Apple offered something faster less expensive  That ran all the software you wanted to run you'd consider it wouldn't you oh heck yeah, I'd like OS X or Mac OS

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Whatever now Mac OS 11 now they went to a little you know, I like the Mac operating system  I just and I and I've  Respected the hardware is just the price. I could never justify the cost of the Apple products, but their hardware is beautiful  The operating system runs so dag gone. Well, you don't have all the hiccups and  jumping through hoops and things like that, but I  Couldn't justify the dollar

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, although I have to point out. I mean you couldn't put together a Mac Pro  running windows of  That hardware level at a lower price. It's not  You know, I mean and the difference is gonna be  You won't impart of the benefit to the Apple  I don't think it's the reason they're doing this is you won't be able to make a head-to-head comparison anymore  Right you won't it's not using it's been using off-the-shelf parts to some great degree. That's not gonna be the case

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kevin told me going back to the roots of Apple, right? Wasn't that the roots of Apple from?  Way back in the 80s is we want to control the hardware and do it our way. Yeah, they never were big enough to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do it entirely  So they've always had Intel chips or before that they had Motorola chips or chips from Power PC  They are now big enough there there are one and a half trillion dollar company with 200 billion dollars plus in cash  They have a billion products out there. They have a secret weapon too. And they was just one line in the keynote  Oh, and by the way, all your iOS apps will run unmodified on your mat on your new max  So suddenly and you know this and you know that there's some really good iPad photography apps out there  Increasingly, I'm able to use the iPad for my workflow  I you know, not just Adobe products. There's right. There's there's a five dollar  Pixelmator photo program which in some respects good kicks Adobe's butt  It's really a photo. There's all these great iPad  So that will all be able to use it for video  Yes, and you'll be able to put that on your new Mac. So that's another secret weapon  Kevin Toffle wrote a very interesting article on his about Chromebooks  Apple's own chips inside arm power and by the way Apple's never using the arm word. We have to stop doing that Apple's silicon powered MacBooks  Show why Google needs to make custom silicon for Chromebooks  I don't know about that Mr. Toffle  It makes a strong argument  I think one of the reasons Apple is doing is because Intel has just not been able to live up to its promise  And so Apple just got tired of waiting  And Google has been able to live up to its hardware promises. Well, no, but they're but they're but being tried to Qualcomm or Intel  Isn't necessarily ideal you these are general-purpose chips  Ideal you these are general-purpose chips  One of the advantages Apple gets is it can design chips for its own operating systems and hardware right system so that they're perfectly tuned  Google has the resources. They're big enough. They could design  Chrome OS chips. I don't think they will  Because they have a pretty brisk ecosystem of third-party hardware manufacturers. That's something Apple doesn't have to worry about

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's see. I hear that and I think about  The pixel line of phones and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mistakes that Google has made there. I don't even think you could say that the pixel book is the best Chromebook. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the old one was really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The pixel book is no I  Ready to buy a new one. I know I'm  13 yeah, so 713 is the first one I've seen it starts, but I think it has fans

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, it will if it if you get the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  10th generation Intel processor fans are a killer for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want fans 16 gig up to 16 gigs of RAM up to 256 gigs storage  10 hours  And it's a 3 by 2 which I think is that's what pixel book is is I think that's a good aspect ratio for Chrome OS  $629 that's the starting price when it launches in July. There'll be an enterprise version  Which show will be a started?  That has like like services to yeah, it is the Chrome Enterprise security solution is the big yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So let me ask you a question. Oh chip gurus chip jockeys actually stay on the chip jockey

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Will will make do I'll make do with you two  Ignorant question I  Have a sense that Moore's law  Affected obviously affected mainframes and all that stuff that it affected  Computers in your in your lap and then apart from ant building, you know turbocharged mundo machine  It seems like that Moore's law has less effect now. It's more about the features every year  And it's not doubling and B this he had speeds fine, but it doesn't you know, how much does it matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's what Apple's saying is Intel can't get it together  To give them the improvements and processor performance that they expect  Apple thinks that it thinks that they can  What there were a couple things happened x86, which is the architecture we've been using since the 70s  Still works. Yeah, not very well. It's a real it's an ugly ugly architecture  But it's dominant because again because it's got you know  All the software works on it  Intel even wanted to abandon it you remember itanium they were moving on to a new technology and they and it was too hot and  They actually it flopped the itanium was horrible  Thankfully, they had a little skunk works in Israel  working on  Different models of x86 chips using new technologies. They said quick. Can you get something together and  the idea of leaving x86 just  Disappeared 20 years ago and Intel has continued on with x86, but there's but they're now up against that wall  they were up against with itanium, which is  They're they're limited. They just barely are able to get past 4 gigahertz now  They're starting to get closer to 5 but that speed is limited because of heat because of thermals because these chips  They use a lot of power the very high power chips  They're also running into problems with that thing that this the little Israel start Israeli startup came up with which is  Speculative execution. Oh it turns out that's a security problem  So they're running into that and it turns out every chip that's been made since itanium is vulnerable to that and then  There because it uses so much power. They can't get it mobile and  And they're having trouble for reasons. I don't know the details on Stacy probably does getting to the new processes  They can barely got to 10 nanometers and already we're seeing arm chips done at I  Think so I think TSMC announced. It's kind of a quasi four nanometers, which by the way does come up against  quantum physics  You get you have actually you're so so tiny now that you're having issues with quantum tunneling and things  It's hard to keep the electrons in line. They keep jumping in different states. So  there's all sorts of  walls that  686 has hit and  That's really what happened  I think AMD showed you can go past those walls with the rise in but they're still I think they're still  They're just making a compatible. It's like compact. They're making an Intel compatible chip  And that's I don't and by the way  They also because they spend so much money and time making these incredible rise in chips  they let their GPUs lag behind Nvidia and  Now by the way, nobody mentioned this Apple's not gonna use  AMD GPUs either this is bad  Their own it's all Apple or silicon

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  now  AMD is still competing on a GPU side, but not on the consumer level  They they're dealing more with that upper echelon

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they couldn't do both. They didn't they weren't a big enough company to do both  So Nvidia won and it lapped them several times in my opinion with graphics card, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but they're still releasing those pro grade GPUs to compete with the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like the Vega the Vega Pro and stuff like that, right, but that's not as good as an Nvidia card  What are you using your box using a video card? I'm sure I'm still an Nvidia  Game no gamer worth assaults using a radion

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but I use it for the creative cloud in the CUDA course

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's another big question. We don't know the answer of Apple. I'm sure because remember Apple  That ever is never you know liked Nvidia Nvidia last year said we're that's it. We're not writing drivers for Apple stuff  That's it. No more Nvidia on Apple. You're stuck with Vega. Good luck Apple, but Apple didn't care  They made no effort to fix that that's we now know why because they weren't going to go with AMD or Nvidia  They were gonna do their own thing and this is what really will be interest  I think there's reason to believe that they can make competitive products, but we don't know the GPUs in the iPad are very good  But we don't know if they can make compatible  desktop compatible compared to Nvidia and  I also wonder you know, they're gonna there's a lot of challenges here  Remember Apple does not it doesn't do open GL  They don't do CUDA. They don't do open CL really they do metal and now we also just do good  Oh, it's very good. But now we also understand why all of a sudden this push on metal and dumping everything else  Because this is the new way going forward if you were using metal and all Apple api's and you were doing everything on the iOS platform  That Apple recommended your stuff suddenly works with the new desktops  And and you don't have to do any recoding at all  And if you have an existing x86 slash Radeon  Architecture, but if you used metal that's gonna be a little easier for you  It's just might in most cases just flip a few switches on the compiler and you'll be compatible and then you know  There'll be some 10% of apps that's gonna have to it's gonna be painful  Maybe we'll maybe never make the transition  So it's I really want to see what Apple's GPU strategy is because that's what's gonna matter you you aunt  Mm-hmm, if you can do a Gaussian blur in in ten times faster  On Apple GPU than you can on your ray traced  Nvidia  Mm-hmm  That's good  You it's not a question pay more you can't get it any other way, yeah, yeah  Not whether it's more it's whether you can get it and  That's so I have a feeling that Apple must have looked at this  They know that that's one of the issues and they must feel that they can

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It makes me wonder how long this discussion has been going on with Apple because I can remember when Adobe acquired  metal a couple years back and  Most of the Adobe demos are done on Macs and I can remember to talk about  Just the performance increase and yada yada yada and I'm thinking have they already been talking since then and I assume they have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How long ago Apple said they in fact they showed Lightroom Photoshop running  Yeah on the and by the way the development machine development machine is basically an iPad Pro with more RAM  That's crazy. In fact, they're old demos the demos they did they didn't say anything until later  They demos they did of every all the Mac stuff would turn that was running on that dev kit  Which is running the iPad Pro processor, which is certainly slower than what they'll put out in a desktop. So  Right. I mean, you know what when I got that iPad Pro I even said this many times this thing's way overpowered for  For running iOS apps this thing's got had room to galore and all everybody said was Apple always does that  That's why in a couple of years, you'll be able to run the latest and greatest  No, they were developing their first first iteration at a desktop chip and and GPUs  So I think it's you were beta testing base. Yeah, we're beta  Now I think they'll even go beyond that with their their rumored  there'll be a new Mac laptop this year a 13-inch MacBook Pro running silicon from Apple and and  Ming-chi Kuo who's pretty well connected in the Apple rumor mill. He's the supply-side guy says all Apple computers  Starting in 2021 will be running on Apple silicon  So the Apple's really fast Apple said two years  They said that last time to on the Intel transition. They did the Intel transition in nine months. I suspect that's really fast  Yeah, I think it'll be one. So this is so the reason we're talking about on this show and every other show is  The world just shifted  In a significant way

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What was it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead Jeff we've been gassing on and on well

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, that's because question both of you is Apple that good  Do you have the faith that they're gonna be better than anybody else with their chips or just that they're?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're pretty purpose made that iPad well, they have that advantage on that iPads pretty impressive. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Think they're good because they know their their system that you know is again. It's more of the  If they're going to bake a cake they know all the ingredients going in because they hand-picked them I wouldn't bet against them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've chosen a tough road, but you're exactly right. They wouldn't have done it if they didn't know the recipe  And they didn't have the oven already preheated. Yeah, they've already been working on it. They got that pan greased  They are ready. He's already it was already greased  so  And they had there a trillion and a half dollar company with hundreds of billions of dollars in the bank  They have more than 1000 chip developers. They acquired a chip design from PA semi a long time ago  I wish Stacey were here. This is really her  Bailiwick, but they have been acquiring this talent  You don't know Apple clearly thinks they can I and I wouldn't bet against him, but you know, it's not guaranteed  We could look back in five years and say boy. That was a mistake. I  Said the same thing with Intel effect. I was really unhappy when they shifted to Intel  Oh, this is the end of the world. I love power PC. Where you going to that x86?  I hate x86

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What was it that Apple did at Virginia Tech many years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cluster yeah, they did a giant supercomputer

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that what you know what?  That's what it was and I'm thinking like is there more of that  Coming down the pike for Apple just to sort of give proof of concept that says you know what?  We're not going anywhere and matter of fact, we're probably gonna come after you AWS

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was something called system 10  It was which is kind of ironic because OS 10 was coming. This is in the summer 2003  It was 1,100 power Mac G feet g5 computers  Power Macs. That's what it was. It ran until 2012 and it was fast  It wasn't that fast. We're talking petaflops these days with the supercomputers  Multi-medium petaflops by the way the fat one of the fastest computers out there is running an arm chips

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it was 15 years ago on June 6 2005 the jobs revealed that Apple had switched from the power PC to Intel  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they did it pretty darn quickly the fastest supercomputer in the world  Right now it's called Fugaku. It's out of Japan  It's running on arm chips Fujitsu's  48 core arm chip see one of the things that Apple is a great pains to  You know dispel is this notion that oh arms slow  Arm is not inherently slow. In fact  It's the fastest computer in the world is based on arms, but that's because which by the way  What did I say the system at 10 was 200?  teraflops  Fugaku is 415  Teraflops  That's four hundred fifteen thousand times faster. No, I'm sorry  eight hundred  thousand times faster  It's a lot it's a lot a lot faster  By the way  They're using it for kovat 19 simulations among other things  So this is the first time a computer based on our top the list the timing is very good  that they announced it a  Day after Apple announced they were going to now  It's not by the way arm and I Apple didn't ever mention arm Apple has again and Stacy needs to be here  But Apple has what they call an architecture license, which means they can take they've licensed the intellectual property of arm  Processors Apple started arm by the way, they're one of the partners has started arm. I didn't know that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they sold off so they have they have the they've paid for the right to be able to spin off

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Into something that would literally compete with it. They've never really made arm chips, but they've used I I'm sure it's the arm instruction set  some arm  Stuff to build their chips and they call them the a class. The first was the a4  But they've never said these are arm chips. These are our chips, but we have a license for the arm architecture  so I  Don't think you should think of it as an arm processor you should think of as an Apple processor  That's and and that's  That's very interesting  You're not gonna like this they showed at the event they showed the Apple  processors running  Linux in on parallels  But right now according to the verge  They the new max will not run boot camp so you won't be able to  And that's Microsoft that's a licensing issue  So I wouldn't be surprised if that changed by the time these companies shipped neither Microsoft nor Apple mentioned boot camp  But Apple did say that office is coming for the new max so maybe it's just a matter of negotiation

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's coming from books, too  You say there was confirmed no boot camp

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because of licensing but Tom Warren and the verge says  Microsoft could change the licensing  So because the app Microsoft has windows on arm  But they don't license it for use in virtual machines  or on non, you know license and the Apple's not an OEM, you know licensee  Licensee so that could that's just a that's a legal thing  I don't know if there's a technical issue windows an arm is not impressive, but maybe it's because we haven't seen it on good silicon  I don't know. We've only seen it on

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Qualcomm maybe yeah time will tell  It is good to see stuff like this though, because just like you said when we started  The innovation rate has been a bit stale for the last bit last several years  And it's nice to see that something is  On the horizon that could really make a big difference in how people purchase their hardware now. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah, that's why we're all so excited at because  At least I haven't done this long enough that I remember when it was, you know, there was something new every week

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Mm-hmm  Lately

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple mixing things up is very good news. Yeah, it's gonna make other people compete

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is good. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a little break. We can we have Google stuff. Hey, hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We got good we I said Google at least three times because my phone picked up so we have covered

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah, I forgot about that and and you know, we could take a little victory lap because iOS 14  Has a lot of Android features including widgets. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Marques Brownlee's video was so funny. He basically  He basically did his rundown of the keynote and he said this looks like something we've already seen before and he said that about  Four times and then he was like, okay, I'm gonna stop. Yes, this is always that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's always that way. Look, what's wrong with that? Apple should  Apple shouldn't operate in a vacuum if there's something good. I'm mad that they took so long

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's the thing. That's the Apple MO though is taking the things that are on the market  Taking the things that are already out there watching the competition stumble through it  Even though it's nice new tech and then say okay, let us refine it for you to make it more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Magical as and they did there. I don't know  But I've never seen for instance one of the things they do they have widgets just like  Android widgets, you know  You could an application install might have three or four different widgets styles big little small different information that kind of stuff  But one thing they showed that I really liked and I don't I've never seen this on any Android launcher  You can stack them so you can have one space with five widgets that you can scroll through which is nice  That gives you more widget  Real estate and then the thing I also like they have a smart stack that will show a widget  That's appropriate for the time of day. Maybe the weather when you get up maybe you know, what's what to cook for dinner?  It's 5 p.m. Maybe traffic on the way home  You know that kind I think that's kind of cool now  traditionally these smart things aren't so smart, but  That's something I saw somebody's picture

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I couldn't figure out what they were talking about here or who was now but but I think is the phone also now a widget  I think somebody said this is the end of the iPhone as a phone. It's not a phone anymore  The phone is just a just a feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the phone a widget. What do you mean? Oh, is that his point? What is the phone as a?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw a little tiny thing so, you know somebody calling it was only part of the screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's just somebody's take hot take I mean, okay, so the phone is not a widget but there are widgets on the iPhone the iPhone historically  You don't know this Jeff because you live in the blissful bath of Android wonderfulness has only been a grid of icons  mmm, and since 2007 though they added a few years later the ability to poor soul things in folders folders  They added folders like that was like oh look at this  They've historically always had one thing I hate that Android solved years ago  Every program can have exactly one icon. So you can't have  An eye as shortcuts. You can't have an icon in a folder and the same program on the Apple. It's so  It's so Apple  The other thing that they've changed they did not announce on stage  But they've announced it is you're finally gonna be able to use somebody else's browser and email program as the default  That's huge. That's something androids always let you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let us be clear here that Android is less

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anti-trusty than Apple. Oh, I know what you mean when you say phone is a widget  Yeah, it's a little thing when a phone call on another dumb thing that Apple does when the phone rings  The whole screen turns into that one little phone thing. It's so that's right  So now it's gonna just be a little widget so you that's what I'm saying and you can swipe it out  You know, it's the same thing Siri's gonna change to see watch when I do Siri  goes dark  Like come on Siri, I don't you know, this is dumb. I can't see my icons. I can't see anything  The whole thing is now a giant Siri thing. That's gonna change to it'll be just a little right now and it's not happy  Yeah, let's see what she says

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just a moment you can adjust many of the vision settings. Yeah, but not that one you dope

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Accent is that I think it's South African I change it all the time. I want different people to come out of my phone. I  Hope that sometimes some of them will be smarter than the original  So now it'll be just that glowing icon that is currently like that's is that really what you want when you use it?  Siri for a search is the whole phone screen is taken up or so. There's a few but that's refinements Apple  Always does that?  bit by bit and I'm glad that makes it look honestly widgets were the main reason I  Switched over to Android and I mean I still use an iPhone but yeah  Widgets am I you know my pixel 4 it's all about the widgets  I got a big old widget taking up half the there's only two rows of icons there and  In my audio screen is is has no icon. Well as a few icons, it's all widgets, right?  That's how it is with me. Yeah, that's what widgets are good for you can see what the song is  You can pause it go to the next one. You don't have to open an app to do it. It's right there, right?  That's how it should be. Anyway, Apple's gonna do that. We'll see you know it they didn't steal it from Android  They looked over there. They looked over the fence in their yard and they said well, that's a nice barbecue  I want that five years and I think that's totally fine. Yes, I think that's totally fine. Of course it is  Of course it is because that's what we want. In fact, I'll tell you what my biggest fear about what Apple's doing  And then we'll take a break  My biggest fear is that Apple this is a weird fear is gonna be so compelling and the Apple ecosystem  Now is gonna be so rich  Starting with the watch the phone the tablet the laptop the desktop the TV  That you'll never want to leave that warm Apple bath and  All of a sudden for a lot of us, maybe half the world would be a monoculture and that's not good for computing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  now  Are you putting this along the lines of what?  Mr. Alex Lindsay was alluding to in his office hours the other morning was  Apple is inching closer and closer to antitrust. He wouldn't elaborate but he did say that he was the one defending Apple's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  stance in the app store  I'm not so  He said look Apple's made a beautiful store a beautiful product and it's completely fair for them to charge 30% if you want to be in  It that's just the rules of the road. You don't like it go to and yeah go somewhere else. Yeah, that's completely reasonable on the other hand  In some cases anyway, it's rent seeking its rent taking because you're not doing anything, you know Netflix  You know is doing all the work  You're just letting them be on your platform and you're gonna charge them for that  So I have a mixed feelings, but I'm actually my pick of the week this week  Is that new email program so that you can look at it and see if it's something you want to?  Want to try hey calm. I finally got my invite and I will show you that  New it's a new take on email. It's the one that Apple said no  You can't be in the app store unless you give us you have to write sign up in your app  Sign up in your app  And you have to give us 30% of that and and hey was very upset David  Hannah Meyer Hansen who wrote Ruby on rails and wrote this new app with Jason Fried said no Apple's monopolistic  They're in trouble. There's a class-action suit going on. They're being investigated by the EU for two things. One of them is that  So an Apple made some concessions this week, this is not the Apple show, but I'll tell you anyway, they're going to they're going to give  Create an appeal process for developers who aren't happy about being prevented from being in the store. Hmm  Let's take a break and then we come back  Google stuff. I  Don't know if any of these is that interesting. I've got I've got something  It's a Benedict Evans piece that I think I love Benedict Evans we've talked about him all the time. All right

This is true  I've never understood that sexuality is a wonderful thing. There's no reason yes  Hide and cower in the corner in the shame and I think a lot of that shame  But you know, this is this country was originally very puritanical New England was founded by you know  Religious Puritans and yeah, I think that just stuck with us  So anyway, that was that Stacy you're gonna ask you can only say that when Stacy's not Stacey's not here. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because not Stacey's just afraid of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where you're gonna go? Well, she knows where I'm gonna go. That's why she should be afraid  I don't blame her one cotton pick and bid. I have no  filter at all  She's gonna slap you next time she sees you and you know what and I'm sure you've experienced this too Jeff as you get older  This is this is on it. You're on your way as you get older your filter dissolves completely. Yeah  It's like I got nothing to lose who cares, right? I'm gonna talk  Somebody needs to say it  People you know, we have advertisers like yet Roman on the on the network  Manscaped was another one right people go. How could you talk about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have one or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, I don't I honestly I  feel like  Maybe it's age and you probably don't have much filter either I'm guessing you're pretty polite

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What you see what you get pretty black and white not much gray area with me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel I always feel like you're very honest like, you know, if you say it, it's true  You don't have a lot of you know  Jen hidden agendas or anything like no not at all. I love that. I think that's why we love you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think as mr. Howell has said to me man you wear your emotions on your soul. That's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's what makes you that's what makes anybody I think  Your family authentic and lovable. I think that's so important. Thank you  You were gonna ask something Leo Benedict Cumberbatch, he's one of my favorites, what did he write  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And recent Horowitz, yes  Analyst I think is great. So he wrote a piece but what comes after zoom? This is a hysterical graph from  1994 94

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, describe what this worldwide the picture phone equipment sales in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  1994 are there are there's that is that millions after that?  No, that's just thousands

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow 1994 group conferencing systems under well under 50,000  Analog video phones actually I'm actually surprised to see that in 1994  Maybe fifty thousand  There was actually a little bump in 93  That's probably because of AT&T pushing remember that stupid picture phone. Yeah  picture tell  sales of group video conferencing by the world's six largest manufacturers first half of  1994 picture tell sold  Hitachi sold 315 not millions not thousands  315 and they still had 5% of the market  so clearly picture phones  And but what is really hysterical about this is the projection  They thought by 1999 there'd be half a million PC based video  Phones by 1999 that might be true. I mean we had the ZD TV net cam network  Remember we were handing out picture phones to people around 98 so that we could you know, we called them  You know, what do we call them net cams so we could see them. They didn't work very well  And we've come a long way since 1994

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Benedict as is his one  He you know sucks his thumb and comes up with smart things to say and he's trying to figure out what comes after his zoom  And he looks at he said that  You either had in these calls you either had to have something that was  URL based or phone number based  Right. Yep. He said that's why that's why  by Google has to  Meet is URL based duo is people based  Okay, and zoom came along and they went one step further  The they took the friction out and you don't need an account an app or a social graph to use it  Where zoom made network effects irrelevant, but says Ben interest that means zoom doesn't have those network effects either  It grew by removing  defensibility  It's just a perfect Ben Evans kind of analysis. I hadn't thought of which I which I like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's so this explains a lot because and I even asked this question. Why not Skype?  Why not any one of a dozen other programs that were ever, you know there before zoom even?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You had to have the app  And and it kind of it kind of it was in cold storage really in Microsoft's hands. I think for a long time. Yeah  So so then he asked what comes next and he's just saying that  You know he goes back to is a dropbox the Drew Houston said when he started yeah  I'm every so there's a there's a million of these things. He said, yeah, do you use them?  So, you know, he made the best thing and same with Skype there were there was VoIP, but Skype made it good. So now  Zoom comes along but what he thinks I think and I agree with this is what's the social purpose of it?  They're not really asking. Why are you here? What do you want to do? And there's a few new things coming out that are more for events  But I think that this whole notion of talking this way I find a phone call now so ever since the lockdown  A phone call is just antiquated as hell. Let's feel old-fashioned

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is scratchy. You feel like you're talking to grandma in 1932  I'm missing something. Am I doing this? I'm so zoomed  You know, you like phone calls and are you a phone call guy? Oh, no, I hate to tell

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't stand a telephone but what i've been hearing since this this shelter-in-place stuff is people are  Appreciative of phone calls because it's been so much of a text culture, you know  Yeah, but I think that that's been I mean, honestly whenever possible. I do a video phone call. Yeah, I do too. Yeah, there's that too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There are times when my phone will ring and i'm like, what was that sound? Oh, I don't know  There are times when my phone will ring and i'm like, what was that sound? Oh, it's a ringer spam

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what it is. That's part of the problem, right is the only people who use phones anymore are spammers  What I haven't called my mom on a phone call in many years, but I facetime her  And if I tried to phone call her she said no, no, where's the picture? I want facetime and she said

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And on the other hand with me  We do hang out every now and then with my mother  But most of the time, uh, it's it's just easier  For me to do a phone call. I call my mom on a certain day of the week kind of thing and because I know  She's going 200 mile an hour doing whatever it is. She's doing and the last thing she wants to do is stare at the video chat

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, so really that's interesting. So she'll talk to you while she's doing other stuff. So that's why she prefers. Oh, yeah, definitely  Definitely. Yeah, you do have to I mean i've done with my mom. I've  Phoned her up while i'm cooking you should try this  Video call while we're cooking and put her there. So she's like she's she's like leaning on the counter while i'm cooking  She loves that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, and I love that. I got stuff to do boy. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She should put you on the counter while she's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Watching like I got some stuff to do. I never take it. Say what you gotta say mom's fried chicken

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want some of that fried chicken  She's famous for a fried chicken  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This goes back to our first discussion too, which is which is what comes next. So so ben talks about snap  And he said there were lots of ways that you could send images to people  But snap was the one that came along. So why do you press the camera button the app opens in the camera?  And why are you saving your messages? Isn't that like saving all your phone calls?  Fundamentally snap asked why exactly are you saying the picture? Right? What's the underlying social purpose?  You're not really setting someone a sheet of pixels you're communicating  So I just think that I just I looked this up because it was remind us of our first conversation today  Of their their baby steps towards something new that we haven't thought of I still think that's out there  I think it's still early days. We'll see

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's so funny because uh  The science fiction future was video calls  Yeah, when in 2001 a space odyssey came out, I think it was 77

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I remember going to the world's fair pretty close today in 64, right? Yeah, exactly. I was there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Me too. It was a little nipper. We were kids  Uh, and we saw the first at&t picture phone and we thought oh that's the future  And it didn't happen  And I thought it was and then I was me a big brain  I'm thinking seriously about why and I thought well nobody wants to be on camera because you'd have to put on clothes and makeup  And it would just it's just so much easier to do voice only  And I think that that was true until march  I think it changed and I don't think we're gonna go back. I think we're all kind of used to seeing each other now  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah, we are. Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's not that's we're dragging and into this future. He doesn't want to go. It's because of mom

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a text guy, you know just well, I prefer text too. Honestly, that's asynchronous you to it's not nearly as involving  But you can't call you can't text your mother

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yes, we do all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She prefers text too. I wish my mom did actually I text my mom a lot. We have lots of conversations  She prefers text too. Mostly our conversations are facetime  Nothing not now honey. Nothing. Nothing. I just woke up you want to facetime nothing  Oh, i'm up now you want to facetime nothing nothing. I swear to god  It's it's all about scheduling the facetime call more than anything else

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But we do exchange stuff. She does not like the telephone, you know because she's in in sales  So she's always on the phone. Oh, that's why yeah, you know, that's different  Yeah, I spent a lot of time in it support years and years ago. So I was always listening to her dad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You probably have a nice headset  No, because back then I didn't this is the hard thing for me is holding something to my ear

Transcript:  I was going to ask him. It was april

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds like it was like one of them. Hey, let's take a break. Okay, we got more  Nothing as good as that though. Frankly, you should just  Give up now. I found something in my archives that you'll enjoy even better  And it's your turn something something you can wait for it's your turn to pick something at okay coming up  first word from  Lastpass we here we are in the beautiful last pass studios. Thank you last pass  Frankly, I I think we owe a lot to last pass for being on the air this year  They really have been great supporters. We've done a couple of last pass events  Another one's coming up in the fall. Not sure yet. We don't know how that's gonna  Turn out it'll probably be virtual and and we have some ideas for what we might do  Last pass you've heard me talk about for years literally at 10 years now  Because it was I discovered it was my password manager for all that time. It's where I  Store passwords and the reason you need a password manager is because if you reuse passwords or you use easy to guess passwords  You're going to get hacked. You're just going to get hacked  But last pass generates long strong completely unmemorable passwords and then stores them securely for you  So they're always available it auto fills it works on android ios mac windows linux on every browser known  You go to a site it fills in the password for you. It's awesome  But you should know a few things about last pass for instance. They don't know the password  Only you can decrypt your password vault and it's only decrypted on your devices before it's sent up to last pass  So that it can be sent to all your devices. It's encrypted and sent up there. They don't have access to it  They don't have the password only you do  That's really important. They're using aes 256 the strongest encryption made  To make sure that your stuff is completely safe  It is it is best practices all around and they didn't just rest they could have been the best password manager in the world  But they didn't rest on their laurels  Now last pass enterprise does even more to make it easier for your employees and more secure for you  Even if your employees are working out of the house and a lot of them are now they're not here at the office anymore  They're not protected by it  Last pass if you're not using it, don't worry  It can be deployed quickly in the midst of any crisis to ensure your business keeps running smoothly  Every employee login is secure  They of course have the password management, but there's more single sign on 1200 plus single sign on apps  That means you just say yes on your phone and you're in that's more secure and more convenient  I always thought you couldn't have both but you can with last pass  And it always has insight into who has access to what and where they're calling from that's important  They've added multi-factor authentication not just biometrics like fingerprint or face  They also use contextual factors things like your geolocation and ip address to make sure  That whoever's using your bank accounts and your databases and your servers and your websites. That's those are the people that ought to be and no one else  They even make it better for employees because it's easier to share passwords if you have employees working from home  They have other employees who need access to a resource. They can share it securely in last pass  You don't do a post-it note or a phone call. It's it's just taken care of last pass protects while providing a seamless workflow for your employees  and  Complete oversight of shadow it and enforceable policies for your it department  You get the best of both worlds whether it's password management single sign on  Multi-factor authentication last pass enterprise is right for every business. We use it at twit  So glad we are now that our employees are using it at home  You ought to be too  Last pass it's the way to make remote work simple and secure visit last pass.com slash twit  Find out how they can help your business stay productive and secure no matter what last pass  dot com  slash  twit  and  What should we talk about?  amazon's two billion dollar climate change fund  Oh good amazon's killing another uh, uh  device  Remember they uh, they killed the look  That denise howell uses to take pictures of every outfit.

So youtube tv or amazon prime tv  You pay one fee and now you get all the locals you get a few special channels  Yeah, youtube tv is good  What it would be what what I would love is that there's some competition because youtube tv's raised its prices are now 50  Dollars a month.

Um, well if you go it's still it's down under other no, it's under government government

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mike vasnik responds to bad 230 takes we love mike. We've talked about him a lot. He's a great guy at tech dirt  Hello, you've been referred here because you're  Because you're wrong about section 230, you know, that's really good because  Mike has written so many pieces

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Saying even mainstream media gets 230 wrong. I know i've got new york times has gotten it miserably wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so  He's written a post  that explains

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I apologize if it feels a bit cold and rude to respond in such an impersonal way  But i've been wasting a lot of time lately responding individually to different people saying the same wrong things over and over again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you said quote once a company like that starts moderating content, it's no longer a platform but a publisher  I regret to inform you you're wrong  You're wrong. The law says no such thing if you said because of section 230  Websites have no incentive to moderate you are wrong  You are wrong  So this is good  So you can actually I it'd be nice if you could refer them specifically to the section of this blog post  Section 230 is a massive gift to big tech. Once again, I must inform you you are very very  wrong  If you if and that's true because 230 protects me  As well as exactly every publisher out there. Yeah  Uh, so this is good. He's got all of the straw men  that even responsible publications like the new york times  Probably inadvertently throw up

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  About 230 he just knocks him down one by so so with jeff kossoff who's brilliant and he wrote the book on 230  The 26 words of creative internet there he he and mike were in a little conversation about what comes next  And I said jokingly a board game and maznik said I actually have been working on that  It was supposed to come out in april

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the pandemic got in the way. Oh, that's good. We could have a first amendment and section 230 board game

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the other thing that's related I want to plug something here if I may be so bold  um, I mentioned over time that i've been on a um  Big breath transatlantic high level working group on content moderation freedom of expression  Wow put that in my lower third too. I will remember. Oh, yes  So we can just give all the report  And under government, it's the first link is the report. So i'd like to send people to that  it recommends a flexible framework for  Content moderation discussion that the issue really is transparency and accountability  That that rather than having something like the nets dg law, which are the hate speech law in germany that all everybody's supposed to take everything down within 24 hours  Uh a version of that law was passed in france and then just failed in the constitutional court and was struck down  Because it's a chill on free on speech  The regulation so far hasn't been good. So what this says instead is that each platform should should make  A makes a promise of what it's going to do and then it's held to account for that and to be to do that  We've got to get data out of them  to regulators and researchers  Uh, it also proposes an e-court for matters of legality. So it's not handled in companies, which is part of the french problem  but instead handled  there and it proposes  Social media councils to be able to have an open discussion and a flexible framework. So it's a good report  I get allergic. I get hives when it comes to regulating the internet  I went into this process thinking this is going to drive me crazy. I'm going to jump off a boat  But i'm impressed susan nes former commissioner of the fcc put it together and I just wanted to plug that and then I also  We presented it with the aspen institute on tuesday  So right below that is a video which will be in the rundown folks  Of the discussion that four of us from the group had with various people  So I just wanted to throw that out because we're trying to  even I who seems to be libertarian and against  Internet regulation find a structure here that I think can work

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is all end of one anaberg public  Policy center.org  And now it's obviously not binding. What do you think the  Effectively a proposal to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a proposal to governments to stop doing dumb laws like nest.dg and french hate speech law and french fake news law  and so we have uh, we've we've talked we've had sessions with with the major platforms  We have sessions started with um  government regulatory regulators  And we'll talk to them. So the group includes  Some heavyweights. Oh, yeah, the names are impressive. Yeah, there's a lot of names

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the four pillars of this framework for a better internet trust in the information ecosystem  open and inclusive governance of social media  Enhanced accountability of social media and legally enforced transparency rules. I like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And holding on to freedom of expression and human rights  Yeah, so just that's the end of my plug folks, but I wanted to get that in because I think it's trying to make the internet  Better. It's trying to worry about this. It's trying to find a path

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's interesting because you've really seems looks like social media is the  Bulk of what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah, because it's content moderation

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And and that's really what it comes down to so what are your rights in that case?  Uh, you know, let's be back to mike masnick's post. No, the first amendment does not cover  Does not give you rights when it comes to the platforms the platforms have a first member right to take down your stupid post  We wish facebook would take down more of them  but  um  But it's their right not to as well and leave it up if they want to that's their first amendment, right?  The government only comes into this when it comes to the government trying to make something happen. What's the response from governments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  any interest

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, I think some you know one one member of parliament from the uk is on the group. Um  Uh, michael churtoff is on the group former head of uh, homeland security  um  the former president of  Estonia tomas ilves is in the group. How hard was it to reach consensus?  It actually wasn't that hard. It was it was brilliantly run by susan nes  that  She had had papers written. So there was something like people did a paper about  Nets gg and what's wrong with it and what it's trying to do and so on so forth  There are about a dozen of those papers that informed the discussion we met in nice places  We met in ditchley in the united kingdom new roxford  We met in san monica and we met in belagio in italy. That was nice. That was good  and then um  So it helps when you have good pasta and wine you can come to a lot more agreement. I think that's true and um  Uh, so, uh, no it it I thought was gonna be rough, but no we actually got somewhere  We really did. I think it's possible to have a belief that  Again the platforms  Um, we can uphold freedom of expression. We can uphold human rights and the right to express  The platforms need to find a level of responsibility  Whatever that level is they need to be held accountable for it  And the platform should not be making decisions about legality  Uh, that is the job of government through courts so that we do this with due process in the open

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good and that's our view so it's good it's good it seems very sensible thanks to the university of pennsylvania for  And the annenberg center for for doing that. Yep

We're gonna have to do some technology programming. So they came to ziff davis  I was working for ziff davis tv. I got a  Really frantic call from bill mcrone. Uh, uh christmas break  95 I think  Uh, he said we need he says quick  We're going to new york next week to pitch a show to nbc. We need a treatment  fast pronto  And so I wrote a treatment for  I wish we'd been able to do it. This predates, uh, big brother  The treatment was a little big brother. Eo, though. I wanted I wanted to get a victorian in san francisco  Fill it with young people who were  working on a website  And have cameras everywhere so you could it was a early reality show really this is remember this mid 90s  So you could watch these kids, you know, and you'd kind of they'd fall in love they'd yell at each other  You could see what music they were listening to. Yeah. No, it's a traditional, but I don't think in 95  I don't think there were any reality

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought it was the real world or something. All right, when was the real world? Yeah, when was the real world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, maybe I maybe I was cribbing it from mtv. I don't 92. Okay, so I did know that's okay  That's what tv does. Yeah, I didn't invent it. So we were trying to create the real world but with a tech angle  So you'd be at a website and then and then the tv show  Would be at the end of the day because they wanted a daily hour about what's going on in tech  So I wanted to do this show about the show it would be web-based and then you'd watch the show  They loved the treatment. I remember andy lack who's now was at nbc news has just left  um  Saying I wish my people would bring me something like this  He had his big cowboy boots up on the table and while we were pitching it  It was fun. I pitched it with a bunch of zd executives and uh, but he but he bought it  I remember going down 30 rock, you know  lighten a cigar  Calling hon on a phone booth saying they bought it. They bought it. We're green lighted

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Crushed it honey pack your bags. We're moving to the big apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did change the concept considerably and they did as tv is what to do  They didn't aim at the site so they kind of got the idea I guess  But they couldn't get a better name than the site, but that was all they could get even then  And they had they I was never going to be the the host but I was told i'd be the chief correspondent  you know the kind of the morally safer the  you know chris wallace of the show, but um  So that o'brien anchored it  And uh, they didn't nbc didn't like me so they had me play a virtual reality character on it  Called when mentioned in the review called dev knoll which was unique at the time because it was in real animated in real time  With a big silicon graphics onyx  Computer and I was in the back karsten was this is how I met karsten karsten worked with me on the site  He was my puppeteer  So I would stand in a big basically a rubber suit with dots on it  Connected to wires and go like this  Yes  And then I had a terribly awful annoying voice  I was supposed to be a barista and then karsten my hair would spin my eyebrows would go up and down karsten would do all that stuff  and uh  And then uh soledad would sit looking at a dot pretending to look and listen to me instead. She's just hearing  Jesus  And uh, and there's a blue dot she's looking at the wall and they would superimpose it and that was it  And I won an emmy for it. So i'm happy about that karsten did too  So, uh, you say I do have complaints about the site that annoying dev. No, no, that's not it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  Wired new world  O'brien has not only has a confident command of the subject  But is unafraid of asking the experts the dumb questions you we in the audience would want to ask this is good  This is very accurate. I think that's exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly what so so I in the second column  I'm amazed television has found any time to cover this still small new medium  When tv still doesn't cover tv so well. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of der week of der wiener schnitzel  But first a word from our sponsor express vpn. I hope you know a lot of people think well i'm at home  I don't need to use a vpn anymore. It's true people have been using vpns  Especially express vpn to protect yourself at a coffee shop or an open access point when you go to a hotel  You're at a conference. Yeah, absolutely. You'd be nuts not to use express vpn, but you get home you think i'm safe  But you know what? No  No, in fact, maybe you need it even more because you know  It's completely legal for your internet service provider to make a note of every single site  You give you visit and then give that information to marketers sell it. They don't give it sell it to marketers  It's they've been doing it for years  your privacy  Not important express vpn is a great way to protect your privacy your security even while you're at home  That's why even when i'm at home  I never go online without using express vpn  It's a great way if you've burned through your entire netflix library who hasn't by now  Do you just fire up netflix?  Fire up express vpn it comes on android ios windows mac linux every browser you just start the vpn  But this time instead of picking the one the automatic one the one closest to you you could choose from a list of countries  I want to be in england today boom you're in london  You haven't moved an inch, but you're in london and suddenly when you refresh netflix  You're in uk netflix uk you get all the doctor who episodes all the different content in netflix uk  I want to be in tokyo today so I can watch some anime boom like that. That's very cool  So what do you get you get security you get privacy you get the ability to watch content anywhere in  The world that's express vpn. Now. It's very important when you choose a vpn to make sure it's private  because yeah, your isp can't see you but now you're  in effect express vpn is your  Isp they could you want to make sure they're going to respect you express vpn does read the privacy policy  Audited by independent third parties. It's exactly what it says it is but even better than that  They've invented a technology that  Makes it impossible for them to track you to log you to see what you're doing  It's called trusted server when you log into that vpn server. They spin it up. It sits in ram and never  Can access the hard drive. It's literally sandboxed so that no trace of your visit  Exists and as soon as you log off  It's gone and so is your  Complete track record your log. It's all disappeared  That's really important. And by the way, the auditors also said trusted v server does exactly what express vpn does  Look, i've looked at all the vpn's express vpn is the best. I'm not alone  Number one cnet number one wired  And right now you can get a good deal less than seven bucks a month when you go to express vpn.com slash twig  Get an extra three months free on a one-year package express vpn.com  slash twig express  vpn  dot com  slash  Twig thank you express vpn for us supporting our show by the way  We really appreciate it and I thank you for supporting the show by using that special url  Express vpn.com slash twig.

Transcript:  the google change log

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think google is a little influenced  By all this talk about privacy. I think they're a little bit hurt that apple's become the privacy company. They say now  That they will auto delete location and search data automatically by default for new users after 18 months  oh  Wait a minute. I said new  Well, I think it's for anybody you can change you can turn that on  But now it's going to be the default for new users. So in other words, it wasn't the default  You can turn it on if you're but from now on it will be the default  Yeah, sure 18 months is pretty much used up it's used up all its value to google

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's exactly what they're saying yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can make it even shorter to three months if you want that's in the activity controls page  So I leave it on to be honest  But you have this auto delete option auto delete activity older than three months  auto delete older than 18 months and that is the new default or I just leave it on because  I like to know  Everywhere i've been and if I do get sick, I think this is better  Than the covet 19 tracker. I could I could tell a contact tracer. Yeah, here's all the places I went  That's going to help them a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I leave my location history on but it's up to you whether you want to only left it on because of my own vanity  Just to see where i've been because I know people  In my family haven't been able to travel like i've traveled and it's just a nice little  Yeah vanity reminder

Transcript:  Okay, I admit it is vanity youtube history. You can do this with location history web and app activity  All have deletions. They've always had deletions or at least for some time  So I think that's good to know and I like it that it's on by default 18 months  Google can do that  You know, nobody wants that information after a probably after a week  but anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Son, I can't give you any money, but here's a list everywhere. I've been for the last 40 years  Google ends a trial of a photo service that picked and printed photos for users. We talked about this  This was in the changelog months ago. It's gone  Yeah  I guess nobody wanted the automatic pick it launched in february. It was eight dollars a month. That's one of the reasons  I we did it on the changelog. I mentioned it and never thought about it again. Apparently i'm not alone  No, eight dollars a month  Eight dollars a month  You would get photos you didn't pick you would get ten. All right, that's a good deal problem  It's no control. Yeah, it's less than a buck a print four by six prints from the last month  You could say i'd more interested in people in pets landscapes or whatever, but basically google

Yeah  He's a great great photographer and a really good person too so that I will check that out

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you. Ant. Do you have a number for us? I do so so let's cry a few tears for google  In the ad according to e-marketer the ad giants us digital ad revenue will this year predicted to decline  For the first time since e-marketer has predicted google's money  by 5.3 percent  to 39.6 billion  It had been projected by e-marketer to increase by 12.9 billion. That is covet for you folks  Their market share will shrink  From 31.6 percent to 29.4 percent, which is a fairly big deal  meanwhile  amazon and  Facebook will still go up  amazon's revenue will grow by just 4.9 percent this year compared to 21 last year  Amazon will grow by 23 percent compared to 39 last year really you'd think amazon would have been a big windfall for them  Ad ad revenue ad revenue ad is all around it's all around  So, you know, let's forget that amazon is new to the ad business, right relatively speaking. Okay  so in that  So google's market share, you know, everyone says oh it's a monopoly google's market share goes down to 29.4 percent  Facebook's is  Going to be at 23.4 percent and amazon is going to be at 9.5 percent  And that doesn't make up folks that's 23 and 10 that's 33 plus that's something like I don't know 647 percent  um, wow, so that's 30 percent, uh,  55 65 that's that's so the three of them together  Are in the 60s of I think  Percent a market share. So that means there's a lot. There's another third of the market that's out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank goodness all that revenue is flowing to twit  Yeah, man

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you calculated your market share leo? Uh, no, it's probably about zero. It's probably yeah, it's probably 0.000

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  It's actually not that bad. I think uh this year we're going to be down  Well, the year's not over yet, but we're saying thinking 25 30 down. I know it's a lot  But it's not not too much for us to weather. I think unless it gets worse, which it could very easily do  It could but we are getting it done. Thank you. Thanks to people like you and our great team and  Dano and max and sales and of course mostly that thanks to lisa my wife who busts her and I think I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like you were talking before we were on the air  There's a marketer who wants to come back and lisa saying let's get the right time for you  But they're all going to have to start advertising again. They're going to have to find ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's such an unknown because it really also depends on what's consumer spending going to be like this quarter  And yeah, right. Yeah, I don't know  uh, and and you know some of these it  We're fortunate because we have a diverse number of advertisers and some of them are in enterprise some other in consumer and so  You know different sectors are affected differently obviously zoom's doing fine  So but we're surviving we're hanging in there. I thought it was going to be worse to be honest with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  I did too. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we lost about I don't know something like three million in revenue this year something like that  That's a lot. I mean, that's a big number. It's not like I was putting three million in my pocket  I mean that has to come out of something  Right. Yep  And no just kidding  Should not do that should not do that this time we are going to and he's he's been meaning to tell you about the yacht

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You were he promised you the yacht  It's just no more yacht. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't think you we've all been talking about hey.com david hanneman air hansen and jason frieds  Kind of take on email. We talked about it last week got him in trouble with apple got him kicked him out of the apple store  It's back in now  I finally got my invite a few days ago. So I thought i'd set this up  Actually, I think I set it up yesterday and show you a little bit about how it's a different take on email  The first thing so first thing you notice is the typo on inbox. It's supposed to be m box. I don't know why  But it is  It has some interesting features box  I'm box. I don't know. They explain it somewhere. I couldn't be bothered to raw fish crayfish crawfish  Let's call the whole thing. I have my email from leoville forwarding here. Not all of it, but some of it  So notice screen seven first time senators. So the first time anybody sends you an email you get a list of them  And you decide  up or down  So like I don't want to get any more from  slack connect  Uh, I don't want to get  anymore  Well crushing for somebody this is going to be bad steven. I know  So you say yes or no, obviously lisa. I want to say no more from talc. I won't be going on anymore cruises  Here's a listener. Okay. I'm gonna say yes to him  I don't want to get my xfinity bill anymore  Unfortunately, I still have to pay it me neither. Yeah, and I think mark. Okay, so now they're gone into my inbox  But there's still lots of things I can do  For instance, I I can see my screened out stuff so it's not gone forever, right?  But if that any of these send another email it won't it'll go into screened  It won't go into my inbox or my m box

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I could just general spam go into screened or just the things that it goes into spam and I'm not getting any spam right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But i'm sure I will i'm not done  So I can see my inbox notice there are keystrokes for all of these you never have to use the mouse ever  There's a paper trail, which is interesting if you get receipts  Confirmations or whatever you just say that's paper trail and they'll go into this folder some of that automatically  Anywhere anytime I get marketing or newsletters that goes into the feed  So this is some of that stuff that gmail was doing a little bit of  I love the set aside so I can go back to  something here  And say oh, you know, I really  Like this  Okay, this is a tutorial which has popped up  Oh interesting. So you can say this is from a person something I might reply to or something I want  Newsletter this is a receipt. No, this is from a person. So they're going to keep it in the m box  But i'm also going to say  Reply later. I like that feature  So it's going to collect on this focus and reply so I can do it later  Which I think is really a little better than flagging. It's the same idea  I can also let's see. Here's one set aside now mark. Don't get hurt because i'm just going to set this one aside right now  And set aside is something for reference  But it's it's going to always be easy access down here at the bottom which is kind of interesting  Okay  So it is designed to quickly triage email and to get less email  There's also labels that you can use and then i'll create a label right now  We'll just show you and we'll call it taxes  And now I have a taxes label which I can add  You see it's showing up in my label list anytime i'm looking at an email  So the idea is to quickly be able to process email  It will take all the attachments and put them in this all files folder  I think this is kind of nice. These guys are good at web design. You see how clean and easy it is  I'm, sorry. It's in dark mode. Is there I was gonna ask. Yeah, so there's a dark mode. Let me just turn that off  Uh, yeah, i'm sorry. I think actually it's getting that you know, leo, you know  It's getting that from the operating system. I think is where that's getting from  um  Now it'll be a hundred dollars a month. I mean a year. Sorry a year  100 a year which is not bad, but not you know, not great. They also plan  Unfortunately, my email address is at hey.com  Chief twitter at hey.com and right now there's no way to change that event  I'm forwarding it from my leoville. So that works. Okay, but eventually i'd like to be able to give it my own address  They are going to charge if you want if I wanted leo at hey.com  That would cost me I think six hundred dollars a year and if I wanted ll two letters at hey.com  A thousand dollars a year, but the money is all going to dane golden  I think so. It's good our former producer who used to own hey.com  They bought it for an unnamed but apparently large amount of money  He was one of our early, but dane's got the yacht dane's got the yacht  So I you know, I like this. I don't know if i'll go crazy over it. I'm not you know, I have two weeks to try it  Uh, I don't know if it's yet, uh available to everyone

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I applied for an invite and and you have to have a code at all  If you want to get a code you've got to send them an email telling what your love's right and I did that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Next month they say they're going to open it to everyone. So I guess this is an early beta  They do if you go to hey.com you can read all about it  You can find out all the details how it works and all that stuff  And you know, honestly, these are the guys who did base camp. They know what they're doing  They have apps for ios android mac windows linux  Um, they have a lot of interesting features  I I look I want to celebrate the attempt to fix email, right? Yeah  Um because oh em stands for important or immediate  I get it. Okay  So I I admire that attempt by the way, they block all trackers which is fantastic  And they even tell you hey, you know this email this had a you know invisible tracker in it  You should know about that on a tracking pixels. Yep  So anytime an email wants to phone home  It'll tell you which is really really good  You can uh change the thread and the email but but it will continue to work as if you hadn't which I think is nice  I often get email all stacked together because it had the same subject line and I don't like that subject line. So  There's a lot of ways  That this is trying to solve  A lot of issues i'm gonna keep with it for a couple of weeks because it may in fact  I like some of the things they're doing. I really do

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So but when you reply you're replying from the head. Yeah, unfortunately, that's kind of a bummer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because that's not my email address. That's you know, but I think that so it's gonna look strange  So it's gonna look like spam to me, right? Yes, you're gonna say who can bump it. You ever send me any emails? Yeah  Now kevin rose seems to like it  As does ryan hoover, um, so, you know interesting  If you're in holobotty  Yeah, wonderful guy. Oh, no, they got look at andy bio from uh, uh, you know max pancake. So  I feel like  I want to I love these guys. I think jason and david are very very smart  And I think their take on email is quite interesting. It isn't you know  The same thing as what gmail's try to do  Or outlook with a focused inbox. It's something a little more than that and it puts you a little bit more in control your email  It's worth taking a look at two-week trials free  Uh, and apparently they've solved their problems with apple so you'll be able to use it on your ios device  Hello everybody  It's time to say goodbye  Thank you aunt pruett filling in at the last minute, but we'll see you next week  I think we want to get in on the show every week now because he's so nice.
