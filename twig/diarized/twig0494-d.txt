He's a professor of Journalistic Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism,  and he's a professor of Journalism at the University of New York.  Hello, Jeffrey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello, hello, hello. Good to see you. Glad to see you.  Glad to be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you going somewhere fun?  Yeah, it seems like I was on a plane last week at this time.  We're going to LA just for client meetings.  Oh, okay.  Schmoozing and boozing.  Schmoozing. That's speaking of schmoozing and boozing, that's Stacey Higginbotham.  She is Stacey on IOT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Show off your T-shirt, Stacey, please, for Leo.  Oh, what's he say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Breakfast tacos, I love you. And she's serious when she says that.  She's serious. She introduced us at South by last year to the magic of the Austin breakfast taco.  Oh, so delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't find those in Seattle. They won't know what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll make, that's my new goal. I'm going to stop Twig and I'm going to start opening my own breakfast taco stand.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're going to want kale and sushi on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could, you could. Or you could just hire Dana Perino to make you queso.  Oh, there we go.  Did you see this during the Super Bowl?  Yeah.  This is the hot Twitter feed during the Super Bowl.  Dana Perino, who's former Bush spokesperson and Fox News, currently Fox News commentator, posted a picture of, well, she says it's queso.  It's a crock pot with a crusted kind of cheese thing in there.  And it doesn't look that good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It looks like chili con carne is what it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what it is. Anyway, she's, I think the mistake she made was the very terse caption, which is I made queso.  Somehow it captured the imagination of a great many people.  Twitter went wild, didn't it?  Yeah, really. Twitter meant wild.  Here's one. I made queso.  It's a slice of Kraft American cheese in a bowl. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, I will say, are you ready for this? Velveeta and Rotel.  Those go together.  Those are the queso. I mean, I would have accepted that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's Chris Hook's tweet.  I made queso. It's the famous blood elevator scene from The Shining.  I made queso. I don't know what this is going to be.  Oh, God, it's the melting face from Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Okay.  It looks like it's blood. I get it.  Yeah. And Pat Oswald, I think, kicked it off with a kind of medieval picture of hell.  So it was more interesting than Super Bowl. Let's be honest.  I don't follow Twitter, but thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was going to say, what were you doing on Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have decided that if anything really of a moment happens on Twitter,  I'll probably read about it everywhere else since Twitter seems to be the most covered phenomenon in the 21st century.  That's true.  It's disproportionate, I think. Although, fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I mean, there's a lot of people, a lot of famous people. I don't know.  Yeah, all right. It's not mainstream media, but the media is never covered like mainstream opinions.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I had an argument with Farhad Banjoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we talked about this last week. He wrote an opinion piece in The New York Times.  Never tweet. He said the journalists should get off Twitter.  Now, did he say shouldn't read Twitter or merely shouldn't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They said they should lurk, but it implied get off.  And then I wrote a piece in response and then we were both on a CNBC podcast.  Why am I struggling to find the word podcast on a podcast?  What do they call those things?  Fort Knox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They start with really bad music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we went back and forth and it was friendly enough.  And then Jared Lanier came on and yelled at me at the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Jared Lanier hates technology. But the irony is he was the king of 3D, of VR.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's all these people who find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twenty years ago.  Yeah, it's like Roger McNamee.  Yeah, McNamee is the same thing.  On the way to Palo Alto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Meanwhile, you know, he's made most of his money on Palm, of all things.  I went to school with Roger, so I know he's hated Google forever.  Never tweet. I kind of agree with, as you know.  This is an old column, so it starts with a whole news story that was in the top of the cycle a whole two weeks ago.  Oh, my God. How do you people even know what's happening?  The Covington students, you know, chanting in MAGA hats, chanting in front of the Indian guy.  The pounding is from...  Veteran.  Veteran.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Veteran.  The American.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Native American.  Anyway, I don't want to weigh in on that because that was exactly...  No, but just equal time here.  He's right. An example of like Twitter outrage meets Twitter outrage and everybody's all upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just equal time. Just show my link. I just put it in the app chat.  Okay.  Just so I can get...  Would you tweet it so that I can find it?  We won't discuss it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you tweet it? Otherwise, I don't know where it is.  Well, I tweeted it plenty.  It's sad because Twitter kind of killed RSS. Everybody said, oh, we don't need RSS readers.  Anything that happens will show up in a feed on Twitter.  But your point is well taken, which is journalism is the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. When there are people who've never had an outlet and never been heard and now they finally have a place to be heard,  it's awfully snotty for journalists to say, I'm not going to listen.  Yeah.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although, I mean, honestly, if you're some normal unwashed masses type, just because you tweeted doesn't mean you've got a big audience all of a sudden.  No, not at all.  But you do have the ability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And many of the people who tweeted under the hashtag living while black didn't have the big audience.  But the hashtag was a black political audience.  Yeah, that's a very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do love the illustration you used here, which is...  Coffeehouse.  People may not know this story unless you've read Neil Stephenson's Quicksilver Trilogy or a historian.  The fanaticism, the fattest fanaticism that surrounded coffeehouses in Europe in the 17th century.  And in fact, this is where journalism was born, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One could argue, yeah.  A certain kind of journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why you put it there, I presume.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the kind of conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the conversation.  Yeah.  Pardon me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, it wasn't where journalism was born.  It's where financial markets were born.  I apologize.  The stock market was born in coffee.  Well, the argument is that it's where the public sphere was born.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the public sphere was not terribly public.  It was very exclusionary.  Right.  It was privileged to white people.  You don't need Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just get a gosh darn podcast and maybe Spotify will come along and give you $230 million.  I keep hoping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hello, Spotify.  Hello, Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What have you guys done wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huh?  So, Spotify, it's now been confirmed, bought the Gimlet Network for $230 million.  They make good shows.  Well, they make 16 shows.  Startup was the one that put them on the map.  And then, of course, lately, they've become very well known because Homecoming, which  was a brief show they did their first foray into fictional podcasting, got purchased and  made into a movie that's won a lot of acclaim or a series, I should say.  It's won a lot of acclaim on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the multiple of their earnings going to be?  About a million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's the...  Welcome to dot com bubble two.  As far as I can tell, I was looking back, I was trying to figure it out.  In 2015, they made $2 million.  By the way, in 2015, we made $10 million.  So, I think we're worth a billion dollars.  Yes, you are, boss.  Yes, you are.  One billion.  And they took a significant...  I can't remember, 30 or 40 million in VC, right?  This was the whole point of Startup, was we're going to go and create a podcast network  and take venture funding.  And actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chris Sack has got to laugh at us because we don't know what funding is and cap tables  are, but we still got money anyway.  I know what cap tables are and funding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, as it turns out, the creators of Gimlet, Michael Bloomberg...  No, not Michael Bloomberg, that's the mayor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the other guy.  The creator of the Bloomberg terminal.  If you hadn't said that, I would have...  Alex.  Alex Bloomberg.  Bloomberg.  He was a really good guy.  I'm glad he's a winner.  He's a great guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and his partner, who was a business guy, business school graduate, knew what the  real score was.  It wasn't creating podcasts.  The real score is creating a company, taking a lot of venture capital.  It doesn't matter if you make money and selling it, having a big exit.  It's kind of more the Silicon Valley model than a content creation model.  And Anchor bought, was purchased as well, Anchor FM, which makes sense to me because  that's a platform for making podcasts.  Clearly, I understand...  That's a WordPress podcast, right?  Yeah, exactly.  I understand what Spotify's saying and it makes perfect sense.  Danielak is a smart guy.  They're doing very well.  What is it?  90 million subscribers.  They just released their quarterly results.  They made, I think, a billion and a half in profit last year or last quarter, last quarter.  But there's a big hammer hanging over their head and Pandora's head and everybody's head.  It's the music industry.  They only make money if the music industry lets them and doesn't charge them enough  royalties to take away all the profits.  And they're really at the mercy of that.  And companies like Amazon, Google, and Apple, which also offer music services, aren't.  Because that's not their only source of income.  But if you're Spotify and Pandora, you're always looking over your...  You're in a bad position for negotiation, you're saying.  That sword of Damocles is hanging over your head.  In fact, it practically put Pandora out of business.  It's no coincidence both Pandora and Spotify are going after creating their own content.  So they don't have to...  And then Daniel X said he expects about 20% of Spotify's content to be podcasts or listening,  I guess, to be podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the Netflix model for podcasting.  Bingo.  Or for radio.  Yeah.  Netflix did in fact...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Netflix...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you very much.  Netflix did almost die, right?  The movie industry said, oh, you guys are doing too well.  They pulled all their movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's still a question of what happens when Disney launches its own service next year  and some other things.  So we'll see if Netflix's own content is enough to save it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, what was interesting, I was talking to a former major music executive on this trip I was just on.  And he said...  And now he's moved over to the newspaper industry.  So I said, oh, boy, you saw one disruption and the next, what's the comedy?  He said that the music industry, of course, depended upon blockbusters.  And he said it's really true now in the music industry that, yeah, maybe you get one or two of those.  But that's not the basis of the business anymore.  The basis of the business is finding a large number of popular enough people.  And it's very bloggy and podcasty and YouTube-y in music.  And he said it changed the economics of the industry fundamentally.  And I think that's part of what's going on here, too.  Yeah, it was interesting to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought it was big blockbuster acts that you could charge a lot of money for in concerts and touring became...  I guess that's for the artists, not the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's for the artist, exactly.  And you're still going to hope for blockbusters in publishing and in music and so on.  But the odds of getting them get lower and you can't depend the business on it anymore.  Does it become like the VC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like one out of every 10 is a knock it out of the park and then you've got four or five that are...  No, he said that's the way it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's exactly the model that was.  But now you can't take that risk anymore.  So now you want the...  Who's going to buy Patreon, too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ten years ago, Madonna did a deal with Live Nation instead of a record company.  $120 million deal involved a lot of concerts and records, but a lot of concerts, record concerts, tour to follow.  That was the model.  But that's 10 years, an infinite amount of time now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you ever watch Amanda Palmer's TED Talk?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, which one?  On giving, right?  On asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On giving, right?  On asking.  And the numbers are fascinating.  Her 25,000 sales of her album were considered a failure.  Right.  But 25,000 people giving her money, equally million dollars, was a huge success.  It was the same number.  The industry at the time considered that number a failure because it wasn't big enough.  Didn't know how to handle it.  Didn't scale.  The new industry said, hallelujah, that's a huge success.  And you get to keep all the money or almost all of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure whether this is good or bad for podcasting because Daniel X says he's going to spend up to  $500 million on deals this year, which sounds like he's going to buy more.  Pandora has already started talking about exclusive podcasts on the Pandora Network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is now owned by Sirius, right?  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is really, you know, I think really what people are doing is looking at YouTube and saying,  how can we make that kind of money?  And YouTube, by the way, just put out numbers saying, YouTubers, this is, I never trust YouTube when they say stuff like this.  YouTubers are making, you know, twice as many YouTubers are making money in the five to six figure range,  which is a pretty broad range, everywhere from $10,000 to a million dollars, $999,000.  That they're, you know, they're really kind of pushing the fact that people make money on YouTube.  I don't know more than a handful.  They say double the number of creators now are making money on YouTube than before.  I don't know if that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they keep on trying to sell that.  So Leo, if you, what would make you get bought?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A hundred million dollar check? I'm there.  Exactly. But seriously, you have a proven loyal audience.  So I spent some time thinking about it because we have more podcasts than Gimlet.  We have more downloads than Gimlet for most of them.  I think Gimlet might have some, Startup might be huge, but the rest of them are not.  Right.  We have certainly more revenue than Gimlet.  I think we're on pace to do nine million.  That basically we're sold out this year, which means about nine million dollars.  We'd do more if we had more shows.  So on, like if you were a pure business calculation, we'd be worth more.  But it isn't.  And Gimlet and all these Brooklyn based former public radio based podcast networks have the sizzle.  The cache.  The cache that's more important.  And I don't think we'd even be in the running to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have a loyal, no it's not fine. You can be rich and retire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I would love to be rich, but that's not going to happen.  So, I mean, I'm well off. I'm not going to hide that. We do all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you have loyalty and there's the direct relationship of a B2B world.  What is Spotify?  Which is kind of what you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but what is Spotify? Yeah.  I mean, Spotify. So here's the thing.  Spotify is not buying podcasts because they have ad revenue.  In fact, at first I thought, oh, well, Gimlet's more valuable than we are because they do podcasts for brands, right?  They'll do marketing podcasts.  And I realized, no, Spotify doesn't want that. That's not for Spotify.  They didn't buy them for the revenue.  They probably didn't even buy them for the audience.  You think they'll kill the ads?  Well, that's a good, there's a number of questions.  My first thought was they're going to do what Pandora is planning to do, which make them exclusive on Spotify, which would kill us if you could only get us on Spotify.  Oh, yeah.  But apparently Spotify says, no, we might have a few exclusives like we did with Amy Schumer, but most of them will be available everywhere.  So now I don't really understand at all. I could understand if the point was to generate more Spotify subscriptions.  So they're exclusive on Spotify. If you want to listen to start up, you have to be a podcast, a Spotify premium subscriber, not the ads then, not ad revenue.  They didn't buy it for the ad revenue. They bought it to generate traffic, more subscribers.  That would make sense to me, but they're not going to even do that. So I don't, to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I get them buying, what's the name of the platform again?  Anchor FM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anchor.  Which I've used to make podcasts and I get it completely.  Because then it's like YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't actually don't get the other. I don't, I don't, because do they now have to buy a music studio? Do they now have to buy a radio station?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the other thing. They've never attempted to make music, even though that's their problem is original content. They never went down that route.  So I don't know. I don't know.  Spotify has 207 million active users, but 96 million paying active users.  That's up 29 and 36% year over year, respectively. That's pretty good. That's good growth. By the way, Apple Music has also shown similar growth.  Revenues. I got the revenues wrong for the quarter. One and a half billion euros revenues, but that's up 30%.  One and a half billion euros revenue.  Euros?  They're Swedish.  Swedish. Daniel Ek.  Swedish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm looking at my stats from Spotify. Many, a lot of my audience does not listen.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On Spotify.  We were a launch partner with Spotify when they started podcasts. We were on stage with Daniel Ek, the twit logo and all that.  And I don't, I haven't looked at the stats, but I think it's a small amount because it's very hard to find.  You'd have to, if you search for twit on Spotify, guess what you find? A bunch of Twitter based podcasts.  But if you do look for this week in Google, you would find it.  So I don't know. I think it would be a good thing if every single one of you.  Yeah, we just, please start listening. No, I don't want to do that.  The whole point of a podcast is it's agnostic. It doesn't, we don't care where you got us or how you got us.  We want to be everywhere on Amazon's Echo. I think that's been a good model for podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the, it's, it's, it's the, well, it's the day one or it's the ethos of RSS.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Huh. I got a lot of people from Pandora.  Oh, do you really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really. That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It's actually the second largest.  Really? What's your number one? iTunes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  iTunes is actually, well, hold on.  It's our biggest source by far.  This isn't a breakdown from iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And remember we've been on, you know, around on iTunes for 10 years or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm looking, my web player surprisingly is a lot.  This doesn't pull down my iTunes stuff. Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's the point of all of this is that it's changing.  Just as you said with the music industry, it's changing year by year the way people consume content.  And I would, I was pretty clear to me about four years ago that everybody really is going to consume content on their mobile device.  And maybe that's through your website.  I mean, it doesn't, I don't think you have to have an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  I got a lot. So other than iTunes, which I can't see, it's my web player and Pandora are about the same.  Interesting.  I heart radio. Who knew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're on I heart radio. That's nice.  I don't think we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did not know I was an I heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, what a world we live in. Huh? It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like, I don't know if I had to actively do something to get that or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you probably do, but I don't know.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I heart radio's tagline, all your favorite music, radio and podcasts.  All free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're all doing that. Yeah.  So they're probably just aggregating. They find, you know, Stacey on IOT.  We should have that.  I just, I guess they should.  Apparently, I do have a day job.  We're there. We're there.  I work for I heart radio and their premieres division.  That's my radio show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This week in Google is on it.  Is it?  Oh, you are?  We are, Stacey.  You work for.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I work for I heart radio for the radio show, the tech guys.  Got it.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That word means nothing to me other than you're fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Premier is a radio syndication network and they syndicate Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Leo Laporte, the big three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, excellent. Leo, you're in such good company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Art Bell's Coast to Coast. Oh, I meant it's George Noori now.  Let's take a little time out because as long as we're talking about this, I should talk to you about the company that puts  Twitter and Twig and Security Now and MacBreak Weekly and every other show we do on your system.  It's called Cashfly.  And if you like how fast you get our shows, you'll love Cashfly.  It's a CDN with servers all over the world, which means you get the content faster.  A 100 percent service level agreement, which means for me, I never get a 3 a.m.  phone call saying, we can't get your shows.  When you download Twig, when you listen to This Week in Google, when you watch any of our shows from the web or from your iTunes or whatever,  it's not coming from Apple.  It's coming from Cashfly.  Cashfly is awesome.  We deliver petabytes of data each and every month to our viewers and listeners.  Thanks to Cashfly without a hiccup.  And I tell you what, Cashfly saves us money.  You know, with other CDNs, and I've lived through this, it's no fun.  We've been on Cashfly for about 10 years, though.  So this is ancient memory.  But I remember where you were worried, oh, no, this show's taking off.  We're going to spike the traffic.  I don't want to see the bill logging into the CDN and make sure that you're not over budget for your bandwidth.  No, not with Cashfly, no billing spikes.  You'll get a custom plan tailored to your CDN needs based on yearly usage trends.  On average, customers who switch to Cashfly, and there's a lot of big ones you can see right there,  save 20%.  So it's 100% SLA, 20% less, and did I mention 30% faster than other major CDNs?  You want to be on a CDN.  It means multiple sources, sources close to your listeners.  Cashfly CDN delivers rich media content up to 10 times faster than traditional delivery methods.  Just go to twit.cashfly.com, and they won't give you a hard sell.  They'll just let you understand.  You show them your current billing situation, and they'll show you how they can save you 20% or more.  twit.cashfly.com.  They're the best.  Facebook celebrated its 15th anniversary on Monday.  Were you in Kirkland House, Karsten?  No, I was in Adams House.  But you weren't there in the early 80s when Mark was there.  He was not there in the early 80s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say.  Neither was I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No one was there in the early 80s.  Harvard was a desert.  So you were there in the 90s?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was there in the very late 80s, early 90s.  He was there in the early 2000s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Early 2000s.  February 4, 2004, freshman Mark Zuckerberg,  there's the cutest picture I ever saw of Mark,  fresh-faced Mark Zuckerberg working on Sony VIO, posted the first Facebook.  Now what I didn't know is that Alexis Madrigal was in Kirkland House.  And so Alexis, who was writing for The Atlantic now, has a great story.  Before it conquered the world, Facebook conquered Harvard,  in which he talks to a number of people, including, and talks about his own experience  using Facebook before it was available to anybody, but people in Kirkland House  and then later in Harvard and then later in other Ivy Leagues  and then in high schools and then colleges and then finally, the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I remember when Facebook opened up to everybody and it was a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My old boss, who was a Yale-y, was desperate to invest in Facebook  and I failed him utterly.  The person I got to was, what's his name, who sued them.  Chris Hughes, Peter Tide, oh, the Winklevoss brothers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No!  Oh, Greenspan!  No!  They've been sued by a few people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They changed his equity situation.  He was in the movie.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Went to Brazil.  Eduardo.  Eduardo.  Severin.  And Eduardo was trying to get advertising onto Facebook  and Zuckerberg at the time said, no, he didn't want advertising on Facebook.  He was going to mess up Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting how both Google and Facebook, the early days,  the founders said, oh, advertising is a terrible idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm writing a piece now about my world, the media world.  I'm calling it the Scorched Earth piece.  Because I don't think we're being nearly honest enough about how all of our business models are all left.  But as I think about it, I think that Google and Facebook in the long term are vulnerable  because advertising in the long term is vulnerable.  Really?  What's the difference between advertising?  I think it's decades away in the market.  I'm not short in their stock and full disclosure is I have Google stock.  But I think that mass media has been fully commoditized.  It's gone to crap, right?  It's ruined, clicks have ruined media.  Programmatic commodifies everything it touches.  Retargeting gets in your face.  The public, the jig is up on native.  The jig is up on influencers.  Advertising, because it is meant to fool you when the consumers figure it out,  whatever fad that was dies, they go on to the next one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why ad tech has become so horrific is because it escalates in order to compensate for this consumer fatigue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Abundance goes up.  Prices go down.  Desperation goes up.  And so if you play this out, yes, Google and Facebook have everything now because they're the most efficient at what this is now.  But I think they're vulnerable long term.  I really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think you're going to see creative forms of advertising pop up, especially related to IOT.  I don't think this is good.  I think it's a terrible use of the technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like on Amazon's Echo, they'll start saying, you know, it'd be great if you bought some shoes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe less Echo because Amazon gets Amazon does have a monetization strategy around it and the data is so valuable.  And then they'll resell that.  What's interesting is who has the trusted relationship and how far back can you follow that chain?  And I do believe that trust in your brands will become a huge selling point.  And the people who can will pay for the ability to trust their brands.  But there are plenty of people who won't have the ability to play, especially as we hollow out the middle or pay, especially as we hollow out the middle class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that was cheaper, cheaper, especially as long as we hollow out the middle class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so Thompson in the trajectory, when he went through what went wrong with BuzzFeed, had an interesting sequence of sequences.  One one is he does not blame Facebook and Google for ruining the news industry.  But two is that and I was thinking this through when I was incorporated.  What I was writing is that Amazon, of course, relies on others investments in manufacturing, marketing and distribution.  Right. But then when it knows what really sells, it doesn't rely on any of them.  It makes its own product and it can make that product that doesn't require a brand and doesn't require advertising.  Yeah, there's still advertising for now.  But but in the long run, the perfection gets to the point where they don't really need the advertising.  And my number this week was going to be but I use it now for the good of the show that one out of three major top advertisers are switching off of Facebook and Google to Amazon.  Oh, yeah. Because it's becoming a major marketing hub.  But because they're all arbitraging data about intent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. I'm going to have to go back to first principles and you can walk me through this. Socrates, help me.  First of all, advertising exists because brands, companies, Coca-Cola understands that unless you know about Coca-Cola and have an affinity for it, you're not going to buy it in the stores.  Certainly the price they charge for sugared water. So isn't there demand for advertising created by companies making products?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. But so are they going to find another source of that influence?  They're going to find no. Here's what. Yes. There will always be some level of advertising.  But the way I put it years ago and what Google do is advertising is failure.  The ideal is the customer already loves you and buys it.  Word of mouth. Everybody knows word of mouth is the best.  So every possible way you can you can find through data and other mechanisms, which is where Stacy's point is right on, knowing people through their homes.  Every way you can do that to avoid marketing is beneficial.  Can you avoid it? No, but I think it'll decline because there'll be less and less need for it because there'll be greater efficiency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is what we watch during the Super Bowl. Fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All commercials for for blockbuster podcasts.  Stacy. Oh, excellent. Like the Washington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do think actually that's one of the reasons our podcasts work.  I don't know about others, but our podcast advertising work is because it's so close to word of mouth.  Yes, it's kind of yes. Almost word of mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's really true. It goes to Stacy's point about trust.  Yeah. God knows why the people trust you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so Ben has his I love his he's gotten a little bit better in his hand-drawn illustrations.  They are Ben Thompson and Strutecary.  He said this is the theory of what happened to publishers.  Newspapers in the top one integrated editorial and advertising.  Right. That was the whole reason newspapers existed so they could put full page ads in between articles.  And and they would then distribute to cut to consumers and they make their money.  Then Facebook came along and integrated instead users and advertising, which commoditized news, commoditized content.  It didn't matter where the way is the word. I can never get an answer to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is the word commoditized or commodify? Oh, I like commoditize.  What's the difference? Right. I've been always told to be a misspelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, commodified is not a thing.  Oh, OK. All right. Go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. I didn't know commodify wasn't a word.  Turn into or to treat as a commodity.  Oh, oh, oh, what is commoditize?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I always thought it was commoditize and none of my that is not how you spell that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, come on, Google, fix it. Google can't figure it out.  Commoditize is another term for commodify.  All right. But look at how commoditize usage has jumped over the last 20 years.  Look at that. Oh, I think you're right.  Commodify is the old fashioned way of saying commoditize.  I like commodify. I'm going to use that from now on.  That's because you're old fashioned. I'm using the.  I'm using the. I like being old fashioned.  You got a problem with that, little girl?  Well, in any event, Ben now says the new thing is aggregation, which is a kind of commoditization.  Google aggregates information from a lot of different sources in their answer box.  And the commoditization and aggregation have the same net impact, which is brands, news brands disappear.  They go away. So stay right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That paragraph, while I know a lot of journalists disagree, I don't think Facebook or Google did anything untoward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What happened to publishers, Ben writes, was that the Internet made their business models,  both print advertising and digital advertising, fundamentally unviable.  Keep going. That Facebook and Google picked up the resultant revenue was a fact, not caused.  To that end, to the extent there is concern about how dominant these companies are,  even in the most extreme remedies like breakups would not change the fact that publishers face infinite competition and have uncompetitive advertising offerings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that is a that is a neon paragraph. I think it's exactly right analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm with you on that.  We agree, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this ends up something that we don't.  This is something we don't. It ends up, though, with something we don't like, which is paywalls, subscriptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For now. But I think that there were even had a piece that the subscription apocalypse is coming.  I think we've we've hit the limit of people's tolerance for pain, I believe.  And yes, the New York Times can charge, but you're not the New York Times.  The New York Times just has results out and they're very good and their strategy is working.  They've executed well, but they're the New York Times.  And I people in my industry hate me for this, but I am not a believer in paywalls.  I think that there's business insider, which was all built on clicks and copy and stuff.  Is that going to get me Bloomberg?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what's interesting is that Ben points to Bill Simmons and the Ringer.  And the Ringer is a podcasting network that is doing very well in terms of revenue and unique visitors.  Simmons is embracing his role as a contrarian in the media industry where ad-supported business models are out of favor.  And podcasting is viewed as a low priority at the biggest competitors, a side hustle, not a core business.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although that's partly because the people who run those businesses are in love with their print.  I mean, even when I was at Time and had a well-established podcast that I did in my free time that cost me maybe $300 a month, they wanted nothing of it.  And they also didn't want the digital stuff.  I was brought on to help insert some digital blood in there and that was just like a Sisyphean task.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the Bill Simmons story because he was hired and paid $7 million a year by HBO to do a show any given Wednesday, which flopped.  They canceled it after four months.  They signed him another deal.  But really, it's the ringer that sounds like it's the success story.  How much revenue is he getting?  Nobody knows, but they estimate $15 million last year.  So I think people don't know about Twitter.  I swear to God, people just don't know about Twitter.  It's fine. It's just amazing.  Anyway, advertisers pay between $25 to $50 CPMs for every thousand people.  Actually, we charge a little bit more.  Well, we're in the ballpark there.  We go higher in some cases.  What was that again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  $25 to $50.  If you said you sometimes it's as high as $90 for you, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, not lately.  I think we're more, you know, our high end is $70.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's about CPMs for what we charge too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the ringer keeps two thirds of the money.  We keep a little more.  The rest goes to Midroll, which is who sells their ad space.  That's part of Stitcher.  It's interesting.  So, you know, I get I'm going to make a prediction here.  By the way, this article in The Wall Street Journal is from two days ago.  So it's pretty up to date.  I'm going to make a prediction here.  Bill Simmons is about to get bought by Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It becomes their exclusive show.  Yeah.  I mean, that would that would drive people.  That'd be like Howard Stern's deal with Sirius way back in the day.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And how much did they pay Howard like a half billion a year?  I think it was huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's interesting too.  So when Howard's contract runs away, he probably has a non-compete.  But would Spotify buy Howard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is after all.  I mean, I know they do video, but really it's a radio show.  Be perfect for Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He got rid of the audio.  They know the video.  Yeah, they do.  They have it back on the app now, but they got rid of the shows.  Interesting.  Yeah.  Howard, but Howard Howard ridicules podcasts.  So I've had this argument with him personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, I know, I've heard.  I've heard you talk to him.  It's all right.  Yeah, that's fine.  It's old fart.  Hey, you want to talk about Google?  I have the Google, actually the alphabet Q4 results in my hand.  Your hot little hands.  And I'm going to tell you about them in one moment.  Because actually what I have in my hand is an ad for Grammarly.  Let me be honest.  This is not the Google alphabet results.  This is an ad for the best darn little writing tool ever.  And I know you guys are professional writers.  I am not, but I am enough of an egotist to think that my grammar is perfect.  And I still use Grammarly because Grammarly is more than a grammar checker, a spelling checker.  Sure, it does that, but it's really a writing assistant that makes your writing clearer.  And I think that's really an important thing to emphasize.  Grammarly, it's a communication tool.  It helps you improve your writing.  So it's mistake free.  I mean, that's kind of table stakes, right?  You know, nothing worse than having a spelling or grammar error in your resume or your business proposal or your college paper.  That's not good.  But mistake free is just the beginning.  You also want to be clear.  You want to be effective.  Grammarly helps even the best students and the top professionals to do their best work.  So this is a great time to check out Grammarly.  You can get it in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.  They have a Grammarly editor.  There's iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac extensions or keyboards, depending on what platform you are.  Now, the free product reviews basic critical spelling and grammar.  And that's certainly a way to start.  But I want you to look at Grammarly Premium because it's spelling, grammar, plus advanced punctuation, structure, style within context, vocabulary suggestions.  It helps you be more concise and it grades you on readability.  And that's really important because a business proposal is different than an academic essay that's different than a blog post.  Each has its own kind of standard.  And you want to make sure you're writing to that standard.  It just helps you communicate more effectively.  And that's really, I think, a great goal.  Stop making email typos on your phone.  I know so many people have email phone email signatures that say, you know, written on my phone.  So please excuse all the mistakes.  No, no, you don't have to close more deals at work with your emails, polish your resume to get a new job.  And I love the weekly Grammarly email because it says you're used more words than 90 percent of the other Grammarly users.  Or you did this or you did that.  It's nice. I love it, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like you're 99 percent more productive than the rest of the people.  I'm like, oh, yeah, I write a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think they lie in that email just to make you feel good?  I'm sure they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they are being totally honest and accurate.  And I love them for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know anybody who's ever not been happy by that email.  Like you're writing less than 90 percent of our other customers.  Nobody gets that email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although they do tell you your top errors, which I always.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  And I send to my editors.  I'm like, oh, look, you're right.  I am bad at commas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is commodify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was going to say, you know what?  With the Chrome extension, you can edit your tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you know what?  Because Twitter won't let you do it.  Let Grammarly check it before you do it.  And it does another thing, which is really awesome.  Every once in a while, Lisa and I both have this flaw.  We'll write emails to a staff that maybe are a little brusker than we mean.  We just, you know, in a hurry, we write it fast.  And Grammarly will say, you know, you could soften this a little bit.  You can make this nicer.  Honest.  That's great.  I like that feedback because there's no judgment, right?  It's just it's a it's just a tool.  You get 20 percent off right now if you go to Grammarly dot com slash twig T W I G Grammarly  G R A M M A R L Y.  There's no E in grammar.  Grammarly dot com slash twig.  That's another thing Grammarly taught me.  Thank you, Grammarly.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Alphabet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, here's the disappearance of advertising and the commodification right here.  Yeah, right.  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alphabet margins shrinking.  Cost per click down 29 percent.  Number of clicks way up.  Paid clicks on Google properties up 66 percent year over year.  Revenues up a lot for the last three months.  Thirty nine billion dollars.  That's a 22 percent year over year increase.  Now operating income eight billion.  So they would actually it's funny Apple has a better margin than Google does even though Apple actually sells physical goods.  Google's margins only 21 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because Apple is selling a one thousand dollar phone.  Right.  And they have services revenue too.  So their profits are high on their physical hardware.  Plus they have the extra padding of services which are.  And Google's spending on R&D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you see Apple do a lot with I'm actually curious if Apple services are higher margin than Google services just because Google is much more efficient at cloud computing and delivering services.  So that would be kind of something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because of course Apple doesn't break anything like that down.  They barely break down what services means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, a pox on them.  Pox on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also, Stacey, don't forget that Google makes a point of this whenever people yell at them ruining media.  Google shares a tremendous amount of that revenue with media.  Yes.  Revenue on a top line.  But it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So last quarter Google's effective tax rate.  I guess this is because of repatriation.  Right. Was 138 percent.  Or maybe they put the fines in there.  I don't know.  Do you know what Google's tax rate this quarter was?  11 percent.  I think I'm in the 40 percent range.  11 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My business taxes are about 25 percent.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  We got to do a Dutch sandwich and a Panamanian run around.  Triple Kemmelback.  Because I swear to God that the triple Filipino salt cow.  Because it's just not.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look, you know, I need to go multinational is really what's happening.  That's the issue.  Yeah.  Here I am in the good old US of A and in Texas.  And they don't even tax me very much at all.  You don't even have state income tax barely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, we have a high state income tax.  But one of the haste in this day, yes, they're not doing anything illegal.  The government, they're following the law.  The government really is the one that's the job of the government to decide what they should pay.  Exactly.  At the same time, I think there is a strong case to be made that companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft are making money by because they're in a country, in a society that gives them that capability and employees and educated.  And they ride on the back of it.  They should contribute back to it.  Now, obviously, they're publicly held companies.  They can't say, well, we're just going to pay twice as much tax as we owe.  They can't do that.  But it just it bugs me a little bit.  A hundred almost a hundred thousand employees.  That's a big jump from last year over year.  Big jump.  It was 80,000 a year ago.  How many of those?  They said they were going to moderate that, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They said that that's that's going to stabilize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.  Google alone advertising revenues, 32 billion dollars.  Other revenues, six and a half billion.  Other bet revenues, 154 million.  What are the other revenues?  By the way, the other bets lost one point three billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, yeah, other revenue used to be like 96 percent advertising.  Advertising. Yeah.  So are they diversifying their revenue more?  Is that is that just just AWS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, for instance, what else is other revenues include the billions of dollars Apple gives it?  No, they give billions to Apple.  I'm sorry. Never mind.  Yeah.  Is anybody giving Google money?  I don't know.  What is that?  Isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is there hardware and others or did they break that out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't. Yeah.  So I would imagine it's not there.  But is that how much that can be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I guess it also would be Google Drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Last year, their hardware, they actually it was a surprising amount.  It was a couple billion.  Wow.  That in hardware.  I remember we were amazed at that the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm looking at hardware here.  I don't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that might be under other other bets is that's where Nest and barely like your stuff.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Paid clicks on Google properties.  This is the one you were talking about down year over year from 66 percent to 22 percent.  Cost per click down nine percent year over year, but it was down 29 percent last year.  Oh, I'm sorry.  OK, I'm mixing year over year and quarter over quarter year over year down 29 percent,  quarter over quarter down nine percent.  So big drop in cost per click on Google properties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it the end of advertising or I mean, is there as I say, I'm not going to short their stock.  I still have Google stock.  I can't believe you don't make that disclosure every show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He pretty much does.  I literally that is the first time I known that you held Google stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've said the Facebook thing is is is, you know, I raised money from the directly.  I own Google and I own Amazon.  I do not own me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I own all those stocks in aggregate through mutual funds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But OK, but I don't think I'm very different than something you buy and sell and pundit on.  I'm just I was surprised, Jeff.  I literally have never heard that.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I used to say it all the time.  So he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I certainly knew it.  I'm not going to make him sell it because I did that once.  There was a guy used to be on Mac break with the name Scott Born.  And I said, Scott, you can't be on the show unless you get rid of your Apple stock.  He had a significant amount of Apple stock and he'll never let me forget that because I cost him like a lot.  I like I don't even know, like a hundred million dollars, like a lot.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, Jeff, please keep your stock.  Yeah, I don't have that much.  I don't have that much.  Amazon's been better to me than than Google.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, let's face it, we all have a little bit of a dog in the Google hunt, whether you have stock or not.  But I actually well, I think we're doing a show about Google.  Google went away.  I think we'd be out of luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yes.  OK, I got you.  You know, like we do.  I don't have a financial stake.  Oh, but OK.  No.  And I just I was surprised because I hadn't heard this.  And as a school journalist, Jeff, you know how my I'm sure you can be.  I'm like, oh, yeah, no, no, I appreciate that.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At the beginning of every show, we'd never get the show done.  Fair, fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Sorry.  I'm kidding.  In general, we have very few conflicts of interest on the network.  Alphabet's traffic acquisition cost.  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that trying to those the deals to Apple?  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That could well be Mozilla and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Came in at 23 percent of advertising revenue.  That's why their margins are a little.  Well, they also they also they like media companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's all an arbitrage game.  You buy audience to come to something to fill it out.  Right.  So you're playing an arbitrage game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's their traffic acquisition cost was seven point four four billion dollars.  It's pretty amazing.  Wow.  Is that advertising marketing?  I think I think you're right.  I think a lot of that's Apple.  The fees Google pays to companies like Apple to be the default search engine.  Yeah.  Yep.  There you go.  Wow.  Wow.  That is that's just how valuable the iPhone is.  Because, by the way, as I got told about a thousand times, you can change it to duck duck go in the safari settings.  It's just that nobody ever changes it.  So it's worth that much to Google billions.  Wayne, I bet our way Mo Verily fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did Nest get put into the hardware division?  Is there a hardware division?  I believe it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it did.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So is that alphabet or is that Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would be under alphabet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think so.  Yes, I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you're right.  OK, I should have spent some serious time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  Don't watch the show for earnings reports.  But understanding the structure of the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also valuable to understand where they're making money, where they're losing money and where things might be changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would be better informed.  I'll be better informed next quarter.  I'm sorry, you guys.  OK.  I'm going to blame selling my house.  Suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you actually actively selling it right now?  Is that what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We are putting it on the market this weekend.  Nice.  Congratulations.  So, yes, a lot of work and a lot of paid fumes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  May you get over market value.  Oh, I would settle for market, but thank you.  May you get 20 bidders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Two really interesting Verily stories.  Verily is their health.  Really interesting Verily stories.  OK, let's hear them.  So one is that they're opening an opioid treatment facility in Ohio.  What?  A tech enabled campus that collects information and analytics in hopes to improve it.  It's Verily.  It's not Google.  It's not privacy.  Don't worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I know.  It's less that.  And it's.  I worry that.  I worry as private companies branch into these things and with the current lack of oversight  in regulatory regimes.  They started a non-profit.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even a non-profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm thinking more about accuracy of the data analysis and understanding how high quality  it is.  And part of it is like the tech ethos of kind of being a little quicker and in research  cycles being too slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what bothers me is this kind of egotistical notion that, well, we're techies.  We have a solution for every problem, even the opioid epidemic.  And I'm not totally against it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's an area that's ruled by emotions more than data.  And so there is more data needed.  There's a lot of people who are against drug treatments.  David Schaaf, the author, a beautiful boy, talks about this a lot, as does Sam Kanonis,  who wrote a magnificent book on this called Dreamland.  That there is a there is you know, the AA world believes that you shouldn't be taking  drugs to help you get off drugs.  And the data say that it's saving lives.  And so I think having a database view in that world is probably going to be a good influence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the new nonprofit, this is according to the verge, is called 115.  It will offer both inpatient and outpatient services and will quote use a variety of means  to track patient behavior.  And this is from Danielle Schloser, who's senior clinical scientist of behavioral health at  Verily.  She told CNBC, you could imagine something as simple as people answering a survey or  more sophisticated technology to gain insight of who that person is, what they're encountering  in their environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's your other sponsor, too.  It's calm.  Yeah.  Right.  Which is there's there's ways that technology can help people at various times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm more worried about Verily's other project, the smart shoe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, because I'm not going to like what it says to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like this because IOT.  My question is how much technology and what kind of technology do we build into shoes?  Mine is a bigger philosophical question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this smart shoe IOT or IOF?  The Internet of feet.  So according to CNBC, Verily is looking for partners to co-develop shoes with sensors  embedded to monitor the wearer's movement and weight, as well as to measure falls.  The site quoted sources who had seen a prototype of the data tracking shoes, which were produced  to attract partners who could help on the project.  Not sure if it's still active even.  This is this is more I think this got more attention because of its headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, in smart shoes have existed for a while.  I'm a small spy.  They've been marketing smart shoes for a while.  Smart shoes.  Well, no, they have a partner that they work with that sells them and they sell them for  fall detection and making sure older people or elderly get up and move.  That's good.  The question here that I have is we I have a very deep seated fear of some of this data getting out  in the way it's going to be used.  So they talked about, you know, working with I think Etna was one of the partners mentioned here in.  Well, you could get it.  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  This is Apple lunch again.  App with Etna.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  True.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then what if you got a discount from Etna if you had Etna shoes and they measured 10,000 steps a day?  And they said, you know, as long as you keep that up, we're going to give you this count.  Would that be a bad thing or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the challenge there is once you start discounting that type of behavior, you kind of break the insurance  model in a sense, which is healthy people subsidize unhealthy people.  And while we're all like, well, we shouldn't subsidize, but don't car insurers give discounts to safe drivers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's just the changes the actuarial table.  They give also give discounts to adults over teenagers based on actuarial tables.  Stacey, I think there's another way to look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What you're trying to say is that is that you could call it a discount for the healthy.  You can also call it a premium for the unhealthy.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And also the data, the data doesn't actually show this.  The 10,000 steps number was actually derived from like a study in Japan.  So again, that's the problem.  Yeah.  It's such a good number that you go, that must be true.  So that's one issue we don't know how and we have no insurance and actuarial tables.  The data that they're using, the data that's compiled into those tables is a long running.  It's like it's like in in home space, it's like 10 years in like thousands of hours of data,  which actually makes it really hard for companies trying to get insurance discounts on like their connected products that stop leaks, for example.  So there's there's some give and take that needs to happen.  But I do think that it's hard to authoritatively say for everyone or even for certain classes that some of these numbers that are are good.  And we could end up penalizing people who, again, can't take 10,000 steps a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yeah, no, that's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, let me ask you this. OK, how about how about this one?  Premium for proving you don't smoke.  I presume that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, because that's a voluntary thing that most people can control.  I mean, it's hard to get off smoking.  And I think if you're going to do that, you should also offer incentives and discounts for smoking cessation programs.  A lot of insurance companies do. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So then you start the line going down. Right.  So then it's is it sugary drinks next? Right.  Because you're you're you're pretty quickly into into the same exact questions you're raising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the harm documented from cigarettes versus like drinking and liver damage.  Maybe it's not all drinking. Maybe it's if you consume more than 14 drinks a week.  Maybe you have to pay more. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah, and that's what you're worried about. The insurance paradigm is really good.  It's really right. I just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We we track there's so much bias in our data, we track things.  And then also, how is that data shared?  How does it it's one thing to say, hey, you're not getting a discount because you're not smoking.  And a lot of these programs are trying to develop quote unquote health scores.  So if your health score is 50, you know, you pay this much.  But that's a black box thing where you might be penalizing people based on things that don't necessarily show health, if that makes sense.  And how often are those revisited? They're not public.  They're in. That's that's where I start getting like, I mean, actual real tables you can get a hold of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Insurance is another industry that started in 17th century coffeehouses.  Yes, I just want to say London was a coffeehouse, a coffeehouse. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I did not know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there you go. Sure. Like weird stuff.  I think podcasts are the 17th century English coffeehouses of the 21st century.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So so what innovation are we going to come up with an industry quick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've just how about this?  Fortnite had 10 million concurrent players during Marshmello's concert event, which means so nothing to me.  That should mean something to you.  Fortnite is a phenomenon, but I think the more important point is it goes beyond the popular game.  Wait, wait, was he doing a concert?  Where's a Marshmello head?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did he do the concert in Fortnite?  But aren't you supposed to try to kill people during the concert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that what I don't know about that part?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm a little I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember in Second Life that people would do things they would have events.  In fact, there was one company country that had an embassy in Second Night, which I thought was really stupid.  But they'd have concerts, but it was very limited.  What's interesting is as far as we know, there have never been more than, say, eight million concurrent players in Fortnite.  So this is a significant number.  But it's also yes.  So people would go to the concert.  I don't know if they were killing people.  I don't I don't know.  That's the point.  No, but that's this is my point.  This is my point.  It is becoming a social network.  And I know this is true when I see teenagers socialize in Fortnite and which so because there's lobby, right?  You don't have to be in the in game stuff.  There's lobbies.  And I think Facebook's biggest threat is not Snapchat and it's like and it's ilk.  Oh, it's Fortnite.  Netflix already said their biggest threat is not HBO or Amazon.  It's Fortnite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But haven't we always seen these games that take over the world?  I mean, you know, flying, flying crazy birds was going to take over the world and the economy.  And then people get bored with it.  Yeah. Pokemon. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The difference is in this one, first of all, numbers, but also it's a space.  It's a place people can hang out.  None of these other games were social or as social anyway.  People talk to each other in Fortnite.  You know, you have headsets. You can talk.  I don't know. I don't know.  I'm just maybe it's just me as an old man not understanding what the kids are doing.  Kids are doing today.  But I honestly think Fortnite has just from the teenagers I know who are obsessed has has more than just it's more than just a game.  It's certainly the e-sports, you know, champion at this point.  By the way, Marshmello wearing his Marshmello head because he's a DJ and and the ninja don't have to wear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't have to wear a Marshmello head because you're a DJ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I guess you could wear it around the rest of the time, too.  But dead mouse.  You got an excuse if you're a DJ.  You know, anyway, there are DJs that don't wear funny hats.  Excuse me. Why are you wearing a Marshmello while I'm a DJ?  Oh, OK.  He and Ninja won the big Fortnite charity tournament.  So he's a good Fortnite player as well as a DJ.  I don't know. I just maybe somebody in the chairman says you're overselling this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just put a link in the in the doc, not for discussion right now, because it's a very long article.  But you'd be you'd be wise to read it.  It does a really good analysis of exactly what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what do they say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say that Fortnite's longevity will hinge on its ability to evolve and to be a social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, clearly. Yes.  Actually, the title of the article, which is in redef at redef.com is Fortnite is a future, but probably not for the reasons you think they come to the same conclusion.  I do, I think, which is not about revenue numbers or whatever.  But but they say business models, hyped cross platforms, hyped popularly hyped.  But there is an opportunity in Fortnite because of the social network.  And of course, it will really come down to this is what happened with Pokemon Go and crazy, you know, Flappy Bird and all the other.  Those were just what they were.  And actually, I think Nintendo and Niantic missed a bet with Pokemon Go by not evolving it fast enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What on the other hand, Leo Zynga, Facebook, games, fake hay, Farmingville, tons of games on Facebook and in the long run, didn't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I did it for a while.  What was that music service that you could do? Was it turntable FM?  What was it you got on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but they got in trouble because they didn't have a license for the music.  Oh, OK. That was another problem.  Entirely. I loved that service.  I loved it too. And it was social because you were people.  You were the DJ with your friends.  Yeah. OK.  I think, though, you know, when we talk about obviously something's going to come along to replace Google and Facebook, it's hard to imagine that right now because they're so dominant.  And it may be it may be decades.  And it may be decades.  Or it may already be.  And it may already be here.  Honestly, it may.  And I think if you're going to get a thread, it's going to be something that is kind of orthogonal.  It's not going to be, oh, they just made a better Facebook or they just made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's how that's how all the good threats are.  I feel like we're being like to win this game.  The team needs to score more points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The only way to win is not to fight all the last battles.  Right. Google has a search engine.  We have to have a search engine. Google has this.  We have to have this. Right.  The winner comes around with something new.  Fortnite.  I'm just saying.  Regulators. Regulators keep on thinking, oh, the search engine is too powerful.  Well, there's other things.  Google's a mobile company now.  You missed the bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before we do the Google changelog, I should give credit to Gina Trapani, who created the Google changelog on the original This Week in Google.  Jeff Jarvis, Gina and I and a mention that Gina will be on Twitter this Sunday, along with Matt Cutts, who still works for the US government.  Yeah.  Gina Trapani, Matt Cutts and Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle.  So it's going to be a great Twitter.  Wow.  And now I gave Carson a little more time to play the changelog.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  By the way, I love doing that to work, Carson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he starts going like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Carson, we need to get you a slack button, like a button that you can just hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got to go study at the feet of Fred Norris at the Howard Stern Show.  Do you?  All the sounds at the ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you?  Yeah, but we don't give him the tools that Fred gets.  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Fred used to do carts.  Fred used to do that with carts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then you really are slapping.  It was magic.  You do slap those in.  And I still, even though I haven't done carts or DJ'd in years, still have nightmares that your headphones are wrapped around your head and you can't reach the cart and the song's ending and the record.  Do you ever have dreams like that, Carson?  Leo goes to the changelog too soon and you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, those are not the Leo dreams I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, back to the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was safer.  It is safer Internet Week.  It still is because it's a week.  And to celebrate safer Internet Day, which was Monday, Google's making it safer Internet Week.  And they're doing a lot of things to make you safer.  The biggest one I've already installed on Chrome, which is a password checkup.  So password checkup is a Chrome extension you can install.  And it will tell you if a, the username and password you've just used is one of over 4 billion credentials that are known to be compromised.  Very handy.  It will also see if you're reusing passwords.  It will help you do the right thing.  And it's probably something everybody should install immediately.  So none of you recently used.  I'm just looking at it now in my browser.  It's over here in the right.  None of your recently used passwords are detected on a data breach.  And then in the advanced settings, nothing.  Clear extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This used to be a service that people charged for.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Have I Been Pwned has been around.  Troy Hunt's Have I Been Pwned.  They, I don't believe they're using the same technology as Troy Hunt.  Probably this is similar data, however.  So that's Google has already been doing this.  As you know, if your Google password is discovered in a breach, they'll reset it.  I don't maybe you don't know that, but they will.  So they've been doing that for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where where we find this?  It's in the Chrome extension store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's called Password Checkup.  It's from Google.  Don't use anything not from right.  And then you'll get an icon and you'll be alerted when you sign in with unsafe credentials, which is nice.  Also, cross account protection.  Designed.  It's kind of complicated.  I don't I don't understand what it means.  In rare cases, the attackers able to find a way into your Google account.  We've built useful tools to help you quickly get back to safety.  Unfortunately, these protections haven't extended to the apps you sign into Google with.  Oh, I get it.  So if you're using Google as your single sign in, cross account protection will help address that.  When apps and sites have implemented it, we're able to send information about security events like an account hijacking to them so they can protect you too.  So as they give an example, if you've used Adobe to the Google account to sign into your Adobe account, it will be protected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And if there's an issue with your password on those accounts, though, that's really interesting because I typically don't use Google to sign into things because I don't want it to get data between different services, kind of like the Facebook sign in or Google sign in.  So this is actually an impetus to get me to actually use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep. Yep.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Making audio more accessible with two new apps.  This is by the year 2055, according to WHO, there'll be 900 million people with hearing loss.  So you probably saw this.  Google has announced something called Live Transcribe.  You'll need a Google phone.  And I think they're rolling it out slowly.  But the idea is with the app, you could just put the phone in front of you and it will in real time transcribe what it's hearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The bottom link under Google is testing that with Twista and Bieber.  And it's phenomenal.  Oh, oh, oh, I got to see this.  Yeah, it's good video.  Sorry for you folks who are.  But I can't my own head can't keep up with the speed of the words.  And Google is doing it.  It's pretty amazing.  OK, here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, finally, I'll understand what they're saying.  Yeah.  Oh, this is awesome.  It's doing a really good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They can finally keep up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's too fast.  That's amazing.  It's too good for it.  It's just as flow is too fast.  Wow.  Lower down the page is Bieber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh, that is brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is from Inverse.com.  All right.  Let's try some Bieber.  Bieber will be a little easier.  No, this is Despacito.  Oh, so this is in Spanish.  Well, not yet.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All this time.  I thought it was in Spanish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why did it capitalize the darkest day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google loves random capitalizations like the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Want to savor every moment, sleuthing slowly.  So it's not perfect, but it's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty pretty darn good.  Better than I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, no translation.  OK, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does do it in 70 languages.  But apparently you have to let it know at a time that you're going to slip into Spanish because that turned that into so making last long but a silly money just never mind.  Forget it.  Well, and I'm sure this is on the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If we talk about the translation service that's rolling out, that's actually pretty cool.  And you just say Google be my hey, gee, be my translator or French translator.  Yeah, pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we talked about that last week.  I think it might be last week.  The Google Assistant is coming to nest secure Stacey and IOT.  What does that mean?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  She stepped away.  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She ran away.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean it.  Whatever I said, I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, the dog is there's people running around and the dog is like, I want to be in.  I want to be out.  Sorry, you guys.  The dog.  I thought I was safe because we were in the changelog.  You're not.  I was asking you a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're always a reference for us.  The Google Assistant is coming to nest secure.  Is that that's an IOT device.  Yes, that's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is exciting because this is the little brains of your your whatchamajigger security  alarm system.  It's the thing you wave your little tag over.  It's still expensive.  But now you can opt into having assistance so you can as you leave, say, hey, gee, is  it going to rain today or hey, gee, make a reminder.  I need to pick up milk.  I don't know.  It's opt in because there's a microphone on this and otherwise the microphone is not  on by default.  So if you don't want a microphone in your house that's listening all the time, don't  opt into this.  If you do, great.  And I have a feature that I think it would be even better if they added proactive notifications  because you're usually right at your door when this happens.  And I want Google to be like, hey, remember, did you remember your gym clothes today?  Or, you know, did you bring cookies for the potluck?  That's what I would like.  He doesn't do that yet.  But I want it to do that someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bet it will.  We all have dreams, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mine revolve around potlucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And queso.  So Google created Duplex and played it to our surprise last year at Google I.O. shock.  Now they're fighting back.  This just shows that companies are not monolithic.  Software engineer at Google A.I., Daisy Stanton, has talked about fake audio detection.  How do you know when somebody's calling you that sounds real but it's not?  So they've created a data set of synthetic speech, thousands of phrases drawn from English  newspaper articles, spoke by 68 synthetic voices.  They're going to make it available to participants in a 2019 ASV spoof challenge.  ASV is automatic speaker verification.  They're trying to submit countermeasures against faked or spoofed speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is why I'm not so worried about the deep fakes.  They're going best of both directions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, the same technologists are brilliant people working on both sides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like the bad Russians.  It's A.I. versus A.I.  It's the old spy versus spy comments.  It's now A.I. versus A.I.  And fine.  We survived Photoshop is what I've been saying on Twitter.  We'll survive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I will argue with you that it took us a long time to survive Photoshop.  And in the meantime, many people's self-esteem was hurt.  That's a counter counterpoint.  But that is what led us to then solve it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So people have to get hurt as opposed to thinking about things in advance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  After Gutenberg, there was a 30 years war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, stuff happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just like I'm just saying big picture, maybe individual pictures where people like suffer through eating disorders.  Big picture guy, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People with actual hearts are always moved by the stories of sad, pathetic, disappointing, pathos.  Guys, people without hearts are not.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It turned out the aphorism.  I thought it would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we're going to take a break.  But first, I want to wish you a goodbye to the.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The goodbye change.  And now, real quickly, I want Zach to come up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's celebrating his 39th birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He and his wife flew all the way here from Phoenix, Arizona, because he is a fan of.  Well, I think his shirt will tell the story.  Yeah.  We can Google.  Happy.  We meet his wife, too.  Yeah, actually, his wife's a lot cuter.  His he.  Come on, both of you.  Both of you.  Come on back.  Come on.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Did John take the picture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I heard I heard their their their origin story on the break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, they met at a bar.  And and he was at the time in the Air Force at Travis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They now work for Southwest.  He's a co.  Yeah, he's a coca.  What do you call a co-pilot, co-captain?  First officer.  First officer.  There's the word I was looking for.  Yes.  And.  Yes, sir.  And and she is a flight attendant.  And apparently her her hidden skill is making hats out of pretzel packages and swizzle sticks.  So she is Stacey Stacey and Zach is Stacey Page.  I don't know who Stacey is.  Oh, that's how you got up.  I just got the wrong.  I just crossed wires.  Page and Zach and Page is going to get me one of them hats.  I'm going to get one of them hats.  Wait, OK.  Do you practice your repertoire of jokes being on a Southwest flight or do you just come up with them and you're just like your natural self?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's I'm a moody female to begin with.  So it all depends on the day.  How many pretzel baggies I've eaten, how much I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I knew because when she said she made pretzels swizzle stick hats, I immediately said, oh, you must work for Southwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was like the only one who put up with it.  Yeah.  Also, and how many times has Willie Nelson been on your flight?  How many times has Willie Nelson been on your flight?  Never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, he's always the most famous person you've each had on a flight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you're flying out of Austin.  She's flying out of Phoenix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that means you get Jack Nicklaus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have Ron Jerry.  I have Ron Jerry.  I have Ron Jerry.  I have Ron Jerry.  I have Ron Jerry.  You didn't recognize him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You had to be told who that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacy literally does not know who that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know who Ron Jeremy is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't watch porn, but I know who he is.  What do they call him?  They call him the hedgehog, I think, because he's somewhat hairy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know that you page doesn't know that either.  Thank God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know that.  You know, I've been watching a lot of TV shows.  I've heard that it's a good show.  I don't know that you page doesn't know that either.  Thank God.  Thank you, Paige.  Happy birthday, Zach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Happy birthday, Zach.  Thanks for watching.  He said, what did you say?

Transcript:  He said, where who picked that terrible music that begins every show?  And I said some jerk named Leo Laporte, that's who.  But now we're stuck with it.  So we're stuck with it.  In fact, didn't somebody write to us and say, we want you to pay for it?  And I said, no, I bought it.  You can't ask for more money.  I gave you enough.  I'll tell you where that with the genesis of that stupid flute music.  He says, what did you say?  Zach, you said something like it reminded me of like Renfest, like the Renaissance.  Some like Jester and tights.  We don't hear it when we make the show.  No, we never hear it.  I haven't heard it since 1998.  That's what I hear when I demonstrate it to people.  So I got to get you better music.  I was thinking, you know where it came from?  Remember William F. Buckley, Firing Line?  No, they're too young.  You do though, right?  I just went with grandpa.  I wonder maybe we could just use the Firing Line theme.  Here, I'll play the Firing Line theme.  Right?  Right?  That's what I was thinking.  I thought, oh, this sounds like the Firing Line theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I always, I'm with Zach in the Renfest.  That's how I feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want that video opener with you scratching your head with a pencil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  What you need is the good music that the IoT podcast has.  What is your music?  I can't do it right now because I'm tone deaf, but it's good.

Transcript:  Slapping the bass.  Hey everyone, welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast.  Where did you get that music?  Is it royalty free?  I bought it.  I bought it.  It was a one time.  Yeah, royalty free.  I picked good music.  That's the point.  That's the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can we get the Brandenburg Concertos for our theme?  I think it would be an improvement.  John is the keeper of the theme.  He says you can't change it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you tried to do something weird with that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We did that ragtime something, but it was still under license.  Oh right, yeah, that did not work.  Yeah, I don't know.  I could sing a song.  Okay.  Okay, what about numbers?  Don't you have a flight you want to catch?  I got to get out of here.  Are we keeping you, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What a show they brought to you by On Deck.  It's no shame, by the way, as a small business owner, I understand there are times in business where you've got a cash flow crunch.  You've got to pay payroll.  Payroll is coming up, but you haven't yet gotten paid for the widgets you shipped last week.  Maybe you're getting big seasons coming up and you want to staff up.  Of course, you're not going to have the revenue from that for a couple of months.  You need financing.  What do people like me, small business owners, do?  They go to our credit cards.  That's a terrible, terrible, terrible idea.  I got a better idea for you.  On Deck.  On Deck, it's 100% committed to small business owners, fast, easy, tailored financing.  Fast, yes, you'll get funding in as quickly as 24 hours.  They offer term loans up to half a million dollars.  See the rate?  That's about half your credit card.  Lines of credit up to $100,000.  But even better, no business collateral and it won't impact your personal credit.  The application process is really easy.  You can do it online or by phone.  You'll get approved in minutes.  You'll get your money as fast as 24 hours.  And by the way, On Deck, A plus rating with the Better Business Bureau, US-based loan specialists.  They've lent over $10 billion to 80,000 small business owners.  And on TrustPilot, they have a 9.8 out of 10 rating.  I don't see how you get better than that.  That is really good.  On Deck.  Remember that.  It's a secure financing service business owners everywhere can rely on.  You may not need them today.  Keep this in mind though.  You know, if you just got to get ease over that cashflow bump, it is a great way to get capital.  Or maybe you want to do some remodels, renovations, maybe build a new studio.  OnDeck.com slash twig.  And by the way, because you listen to the show, you'll get a free no pressure consultation with one of their US-based loan specialists if you go there right now.  OnDeck.com slash twig for a free consultation.  A plus in the Better Business Bureau.  It's simple business financing.  Fast, easy, affordable.  Don't go to the credit card.  Go to OnDeck.com slash twig.  Time to wrap things up.  I don't want to wrap things up.  Stacy Higginbotham, do you have something?  I know you're moving and you're actually tearing things out of your walls.  Are you muted or did we mute you?  Oh, nope, I muted you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Thanks.  I have an internet.  It's okay because I have an internet service that actually a friend of mine used and said was awesome.  And I looked at it and I was like, oh, this could be awesome.  So I'm going to tell you about it.  It's called AirHelp.  And if you're flight, if you travel a lot, I travel a lot.  Oh, hey, look, there's pilots that are actually here.  It is an AI that actually helps you argue.  It's kind of like that.  There's a parking lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The guy, the guy, yeah, the London student who did a parking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the same thing for figuring out compensation for delayed flights.  So I thought this was interesting.  I have not been in a delayed flight recently, so I could not try it out.  But my friend tried it out and really said it worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, you know, it's more for Europe, I think, than US.  No.  Or is the right.  Because the right is far more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She was in Europe.  Oh, yeah.  I thought it was for everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Rights are strict.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, well, I thought it was for everyone.  Now I feel sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would try it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But, you know, if I have somebody nice in the flight who's going to make me hats, I won't be so disturbed that it's like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I would still be disturbed.  I would just be like, oh, well, yeah, I'm usually pretty like I'm pretty chill when my flights delayed because I'm like,  it's not their fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm only I get crazed, but only if I'm connected.  I'm also neurotic as hell.  I literally show up at the airport.  There was that onion story about a year ago, two years ago.  That's right.  Dad suggests the family should get to airport 14 hours before flight.  My family all sent it to me.  That guy, Leo, on the other hand, is going to be rushing to Santa Rosa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know I have a I have a flight in two hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not I think we should have some fun here and just just to make sure.  I can get it.  Stacey, now is our time.  Hey, hey, hey, Jeff.  What's your number?  What's your number?

Transcript:  Julia Rada, a member of the parliament in the EU, Green Party, kind of a pirate by spirit, really fights for the Internet.  And Article 13 is back.  And this is bad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because remember when we talked about the fact that Article 11 and 13, these are copyright proof.  Proposals in the EU that we think are terrible.  Remember, we said they've gotten, you know, oh, they're on the back burner now.  But what we mentioned was the reason they were in the back burner is many states thought they didn't go far enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently, 13 is the one about checking copyright stuff.  So the big media companies use their.  Yeah.  Yeah. And that means that nobody's going to let you upload a podcast or anything because they're going to be afraid of what you're going to do to them.  And so it's going to take away yet more of the freedom of speech.  The Internet, God bless it, brings us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So why does she think it's it's back?  I thought we.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because a couple of countries kind of negotiated it.  And then how about 11?  Is that 11?  She doesn't mention, so I'm hoping it's still on.  But we'll see.  Eleven is the snippet law.  Yeah. Oh, both terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is the one that would make memes, you know, a thing of the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a whole language.  I mean, it's it's memes are an alphabet of the age.  They're they're a new form of literacy.  They're a new form of creativity.  You do not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  My daughter, like that's what she speaks in.  It's really terrifying sometimes.  I'm like, what are you saying?  Where?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's so I gave a presentation in Germany last week and I showed a meme and, you know, I think occupied Democrats.  I said this is a meme.  Right.  And then I said that I ran into Nick Kristoff of The New York Times.  This is now two years ago, and he blamed me for showing him Twitter.  Then he said, what's next?  And I said, memes, young man, memes.  And now, by God, Nick Kristoff makes memes.  There's still black boxes with a quote and a fact in it.  But the point is that people can share that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, you're thinking that memes are new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To Nick, they were.  Remember, he talks to really old people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like, what is happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I was new for a journalist to do.  Yeah.  No, no, I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you were right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I use memes to illustrate my story all the time.  I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we should.  I was going to show this doodle for Google thing, but it doesn't seem to be working on my computer.  I don't know why it's just sitting here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a good Google related thing.  OK, OK.  Change your password, you freaks.  It's simple, it's sweet.  It's to the point.  Nest, you know, Nest has been implicated in the news recently for having people's baby cameras or people are coming on and talking on their Nest cameras to people.  And the reason isn't because Nest has crappy security.  It's because individuals are using their passwords the same way, the same passwords.  So Nest actually just sent out an email today to all of its users reminding you that if you use multiple passwords on for different accounts, you are in danger of being hacked through no fault.  Like.  That's your thing.  We can't solve that.  I will say, though, that if you want to avoid this and reuse your password, Nest offers two factor authentication.  It's via SMS, so it's not the best.  But my gosh, you guys, there's no excuse for your baby camera to be hacked.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you're in Japan, it will be the government hacking you because the government decided as they get ready for the 2020 Olympics.  We talked about this on security now yesterday to try to break into all the IOT devices, any of them using default passwords or easy to guess passwords, and they are going to actually use database of well-known passwords.  They will break into your IOT device and then send you the ISP a note saying you might want to tell them to fix it.  Yep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We talked about that last week on the show.  I thought that was a good thing.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the Google for Doodle for Google thing.  I finally was able to scroll down.  I don't know why.  Maybe my machine just really is too slow to handle this.  But if you go to doodles.google.com slash D4G, they're asking people to doodle.  Enter your doodles.  And a lot of kids do this, although apparently adults say it can too.  This year's theme when I grow up, I hope dot dot dot.  What's your hope for the future?  Doodle for Google.  My hope for the future is never to see Jimmy Fallon playing the ukulele.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why aren't there so many songs about rainbows?  And what's on the other side?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, you guys, this song makes me tear up every time.  That's it for this week at Google.
