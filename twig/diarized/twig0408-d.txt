Transcript:  Coming up on this week in Google, I'm Jason Howell.  I'm here with Stacey Higginbotham and then Danny Sullivan from Search Engine Land.  We're going to talk all about internet safety for children, what the future of the internet  of things will bring, specifically for our civil liberties and how we allow that to happen,  how Google is fighting bad ads and letting the good ones, its own, stick around, and  a whole lot more.  Twig is next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Twig.  This Week in Google, episode 408, recorded Wednesday, June 7th, 2017.  Being Internet Awesome.  It's time for this week in Google, the show where we talk about, well, it's in the name  Google, but we're also going to talk about a bunch of other things.  Leo Laporte obviously not here today.  He's on week one of two, three weeks?  I don't know.  He's away enjoying his life, not podcasting.  I'm Jason Howell.  I'm happy to be here.  Super stoked to welcome back Stacey Higginbotham, of course, creator of the IOT podcast at iotpodcast.com  and the Internet of Things newsletter at staceyoniot.com, and occasional dancer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Always dance it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, good.  Dance like no one's watching, except everybody's watching because you're on a podcast.  That's the extended version of that saying.  Joining us is Danny Sullivan, founding editor of Search Engine Land and Marketing Land.  It's great to have you back, Danny.  It's always fun to do a podcast with you.  Good to be back.  Thanks.  Yeah.  I don't know how to get this ball rolling.  I'm just excited to be here and excited to have you guys on board.  Should we start with some Google stuff?  Does that make the most sense?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to start with whatever Danny wanted to start with because good Lord, he is raring  to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  I'm going to start with shadow boxing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We can dance where you want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Hey, why don't we do that then?  I think this is a great place to start.  Danny, you wrote about Wall Street Journal.  Wall Street Journal has had a program where if you searched for a Wall Street Journal  article through Google search, it would bypass the paywall and it would let you through and  you feel like you're getting away with something.  Many times I go to a Wall Street Journal article and it would show me the three paragraphs  and then tell me I had to sign up.  I'd open up another browser, search for the name of the article, go through the results  and I'd have my way in.  That doesn't work right now.  But you wrote about this.  Tell us a little bit about the change that's happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it actually came off of a good Bloomberg article.  So be sure that people read the Bloomberg article as well.  And they had done an interview with Wall Street Journal and in February, the Wall Street Journal  dropped out of this program that's called First Click Free.  And the way First Click Free works is that if you have subscription content behind a  paywall, you can still be listed in Google and have that stuff show up just like any  normal article as long as you guarantee to let somebody click through and see the article  for free.  And there's like a maximum of three articles per month or per visitor session that they  can do.  Well, the Wall Street Journal felt like this was getting abused.  They said I think they had like a million people a month that were just using Google  to go through and view articles for free this way.  And so they shut it all down.  In February, they said thanks, but no thanks.  We don't want to do First Click Free.  So in that program.  And so one of the downsides to that is then if you don't allow Google to come through  your paywall, then it only gets sort of the first three or four paragraphs of your article.  And so if there are lots of long tail terms or there's material that's further down, Google  can't read it.  It doesn't understand what your article is about.  So potentially you're not going to get as many visitors because you're not going to  show up for as many topics.  The other thing is that when you do show up, there's going to be a little subscription  thing that shows up next to you in Google News, not in Google Web Search, but in Google  News.  And people might say the subscription thing seeing thing there and think, well, I don't  have a subscription, so I'm not going to click through.  I'm done.  And they said that the traffic after they did this from Google dropped 44 percent.  And so and they seem upset about that.  Like, well, we feel like that's unfair.  We should be showing up just as well as we were before.  But on the other hand, one of the reasons they did this is that they said they were  getting greater conversion when they cut people off into becoming paid subscribers.  So they were getting less traffic.  But then they also said that their conversion of paid subscribers has gone up fourfold.  So it's sort of a balancing act.  You know, do you want the free traffic that you're monetizing with ads or do you want  less traffic?  But when you're not giving it away, people are more inclined to then pay for it.  And I think they're kind of feeling their way with it and now kind of figuring out what's  next, you know, but clearly not happy with the traffic drop.  Otherwise, I don't think they would have mentioned it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How long how long was this project in place?  I feel like for quite a while, right?  A few years at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. First Click Free goes back at least to 2008.  Most publications make use of it that have paywalls.  You know, it's kind of seemed a good balancing act, but it's come under fire over the years.  The New York Times, for example, gets very, very restrictive about it.  And the Wall Street Journal is the same on social media.  They are much more liberal.  So you want a free read for something that they shared on social media?  Cool. But you want a free read from something you found in Google?  Not so cool.  And they still kind of seem to view social media as, you know, a marketing platform for them  or worth the free giveaway there, whereas, you know, they kind of view Google as somehow,  you know, freeloaders are just coming in and stealing all their traffic and all their  pages for free.  Although in both of those cases, it's not like those pages don't have ads on them.  And that's that's ultimately the thing here is like, well, if your subscription website  and you feel like you're losing subscriptions, why do you have all the ads on that stuff?  And that's because really, you're not just a subscription website.  But so, yeah, that's where we're at.  And I'm waiting to hear back.  I don't know if I will hear back.  But I did try to follow up with the Wall Street Journal to find out, well, is the new  subscriptions you're getting offsetting the amount of money that you're losing in  potential ad revenue and also what they think the solution should be.  You know, the balancing act, I think Google faces is do we show, you know, you  have a limited amount of articles and listings you can show in search results.  Most people do not have subscriptions to these publications.  So do you take up some of that space, putting things in there that causes a user to  click on them and then maybe the majority of them get frustrated?  And then when they get frustrated, they don't blame the Wall Street Journal for having a  paywall. They blame Google for like, why did you put this thing that wasn't useful to me?  But there's also an argument I wrote about this about two or three years ago where, you  know, potentially if Google puts more subscription content up there, it causes people to  understand there's more value to it.  It's like, yeah, you want this news content, you pay for it.  So, you know, start paying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, as long as people are actually doing that conversion.  Now, you mentioned that there are other sites that are also like that.  This is a pretty common thing.  What can I mean, I'm sure there's a lesson here for for those sites to learn.  Is there is there any like clear kind of advice to come out of this switch, this decision  that Wall Street Journal made that that other sites that are trying to do this have learned?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think you need to understand and I think like the Times of London and some other  places have learned this in the past, too, that if you put up barriers to Google coming  into your website, you're going to get less Google traffic.  That's SEO 101.  And so you you kind of have to understand, is that worth the trade off?  You know, it's very easy that people want to beat on Google, especially in the news  industry, that they're somehow stealing all their traffic and screwing them up.  And then it's like, well, so apparently the Wall Street Journal was getting a lot of  traffic from Google without paying for any of that traffic, by the way, and traffic that  they found so useful that they're now upset about it.  So and this is from a company whose CEO and leaders have been merciless in slamming Google  as this like horrible thing to news industry.  It's just like, so now you're upset when you took your stuff out.  You didn't get all the free stuff in the first place.  So I guess it's kind of like make up your mind.  Do you want the free traffic from Google?  And if you do, then you understand these are the tradeoffs that are coming with it.  Or do you become very segmented in what you're doing?  You understand what content you want to give away for free.  You've got that in a way that you can list it in a way for free.  And you know, you've got your subscription content and maybe you're being much more  religious about it really is subscription content.  We're not having all these these holes that are in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I wonder what's what's what's kind of a valuable metric for the Wall Street  Journal in the sense that, you know, is straight up page views on these articles  important? Obviously, money is is important to run the business, but I have to do the  conversion in order to pull that off.  There's got to be value on both sides.  And if they're serving up ads and we can talk more about ads in this next story here,  but if they're serving up ads, at least they're making something.  But I guess we just don't know what they're making in terms of.  Yeah. Well, speaking of ads, Google is we kind of had heard a little bit about this  in the past and now it's becoming a little bit more clear.  Google is going to be including an ad blocker in Chrome for mobile devices as well  as for desktop.  Things is going to happen sometime in the in early 2018, sometime early next year.  And I don't know, I'm very curious to get both of your take on this, because it seems  like it seems like a strange line that's being crossed here.  So they're going to be blocking, quote, bad ads.  And Google did say including those owned and served by Google.  What are bad ads?  You know, bad ads would include pop ups, autoplay ads, flashing image ads, those sorts  of things. Basically, sites need to comply with better ad standards per the coalition  for better ads to avoid this blocking.  But the members of that coalition, of course, are Google and Facebook, which account  for somewhere around 99 percent of digital ad revenue growth in the U.S.  last year, 77 percent of gross ad spend.  It just it seems I don't know, is there a potential for some is Google the right  one to make this decision when they are so intrinsically tied into what makes a good  ad or a bad ad and they cover the majority of the market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think? Well, when your advertiser network sets the quality of your ads, that  actually can be a good thing.  I see where the problem comes in.  But my one question about this, and I don't know if you know the answer to this, is.  Autoplay ads inside content.  So if like I used to work at Fortune and we had these autoplay ads and autoplay videos  that we had to insert into every story.  So is that a bad ad or is that content just really irritatingly delivered?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a really great question.  I mean, I don't know. I know that anytime there's an autoplay ad on a page, I want to  scream. Well, yeah, any auto effect for me anyway.  I don't know where Google is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's that's a question, because then publishers would probably just hide the ads  a little bit more in things that look closer to content.  And these are obviously publishers, not like the crazy publishers like Outbrain and stuff  that are just crazy clickbait.  But, you know. I don't know.  I mean, like, that's irritating.  And I would call that a bad ad and it uses my data plan and I get all cranky.  So I would love for those to be blocked or at least to maybe say, hey, do you want to  play this before it actually happens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.  Somewhere a long time ago, I changed the settings, you know, when kind of this conversion  to flash or away from flash was happening.  And I changed the settings so that any time there was a flash element on the screen,  never make it appear automatically.  Always ask me like I had to actively enable that module anytime I actually wanted to see  whatever the flash content was, something similar like that, potentially, because that was  actually really helpful. I avoided a lot of pain with flash.  But I don't know. More and more, we're not really seeing as much flash these days.  And that's, I think, a good thing.  They say supposedly there will be a threshold for sites.  So it's not as if a site offers a single bad ad and at which point Google blocks all the ads  on the site. There will be a threshold of quote bad ads that would have to be passed  on a site before Google would then decide to block all the ads on the site until the  site or the publisher went in there and tweaked it and got rid of the bad ones,  essentially. Who knows what that threshold will be.  But it will also be active by default.  So this is not something that you opt into.  It'll be new Chrome browser released.  Everybody's getting blocked ads and you have to opt out of it if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I can't see a lot of people choosing to opt out.  I can as a publisher who's trying to get attention like, oh, crap, are my ads going to be bad?  I have a pop up that shows to my readers on the site if they go there.  I think it's every 30 days.  So like it refreshes every month.  It'll pop up for you the first time you visit for that month.  Right. I'm like, I don't love it.  But I'm also like, it only happens once a month for people.  So maybe. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think, Danny? Where do you fall on this idea of Google backing this ad blocking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think there's a good degree of unease of Google's going to have this  this way of stripping out ads, especially for their own.  You know, but but our ads will probably be all right.  I mean, when they say, well, our ads will fall under it.  You can be sure that by the time they get to this, that will all be cleared up.  Like they shouldn't be running ads that are having that kind of issue.  Right. What they might have are people who are using their ad serving technology  who still do things that they don't like.  But I don't know.  I will see how it gets when it's out there and it's implemented.  It's really easy that you hear these things come along and they're going to be this big, huge change.  And we've had that with Internet Explorer.  And I certainly haven't felt like when Internet Explorer said, well, we're blocking ads, that that really changed things much.  We had that when Safari, especially in iOS, rolled out the support for the third parties.  And it was like, well, that's it.  Ads are dead. And then, like, you know, the ads are still there.  And, you know, a lot of people downloaded those extensions to begin with or the, you know, the apps.  And then they didn't seem to do much with it.  So, you know, I think the main thing is, are you really introducing something  that's going to fundamentally improve the experience or are we just introducing something that pretty much  keeps us seeing all the same kind of ads that we get as before and takes out a little bit of the stuff?  And I think a lot of us would like to have some improvement.  I think when you go to a website and it's loading up twenty nine different trackers and, you know, forty nine different ads,  like, OK, that's a bit much.  You know, how do you clean up that experience?  So and they certainly have the platform to do it with Chrome.  You know, ultimately, I think I'd feel better about it if I felt the major browser people all together were sort of united.  But, you know, I can dream for many things of unity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, someone posted this in the chat room, and it's worth mentioning just because of who's involved.  But Google is going to provide a tool for publishers that they can run to see if their ads are in violation and would be blocked.  But the people who are part of this include Google, Facebook, News Corp and the Washington Post.  So that makes me feel like at least big publishers aren't going to be even angry or Google because of something like this.  Which, you know, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think another another element of this, too, is that to a certain degree, like if you were to ask anyone who's interested in technology,  whether they run an ad blocker, there are people that are all for ad blocking because, you know, it's it's my Internet experience and anything that degrades my experience.  I want to get rid of. And there are people that are vehemently opposed to ad blocking.  They might not like the ads or the experience that it brings with it.  But ethically, they feel like if they're blocking ads, then they're ripping somebody off and know I don't want to do that by any means.  So it'll be interesting to have someone, a company as as powerful and especially with Chrome, which is something like what?  Forty four point five percent of all web browsers online, according to Data Analytics program, compared to all the other browsers, it's kind of blowing them away to have someone, a company with that kind of backing, putting this out there by default and seeing kind of, I don't know, like when this happens.  And suddenly all of these ads are being blocked as a result of that.  And let's be serious.  None of those are going to end up being Google ads because Google is going to take care of it ahead of time.  Like you said, Danny, then will the call be, oh, look, Google is just squashing any ad that isn't its own ads because they're bad.  And look who benefits.  It's Google, the ones doing the squashing.  I don't know if that'll end up being a big issue or not, but I can I can already see the art of it.  I can I can already see the articles.  I can see them.  They're flashing before my eyes.  You live in the future.  Yes.  All right.  I'm telling the future right now.  Also related to this is something called funding choices and which is actually have either of you ever used Google service called Contributor?  I'm sure you've heard of contributor.  I've heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this the one where you answer the questions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  This is basically it's a it's a paid service.  I think you choose what you pay up to like five or ten dollars a month or something like that.  And what it essentially does is it's ad blocking that you paid for ahead of time.  Currency of Google.  Oh, OK, yes, I have with partner sites.  So any of the sites that fall under the purview of this, you'd pay like five dollars at the beginning of the month.  And then that would cover you when you go to those sites.  You're a member of this this program.  You won't actually see the ads on there because instead of seeing them, you kind of paid up front for them.  So funding choices is kind of the next phase of contributor.  And what it's going to allow is for sites to sites that work with funding choices to show a custom message to people who are using ad blockers when they hit the site.  That custom message can say something like you can enable ads on our site or you can pay for contributor to remove all of the ads.  You know, legitimately, let's say.  And so that's going to start happening.  Apparently, funding choices also hides more than just AdSense ads and every page view, you know, has an associated ad cost somewhere around like a penny per page, which I don't know the way some of us surf the Internet.  I suppose that could add up to be a lot if you really work it out.  Oh, God, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, a penny per page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the monthly cost of that suddenly your web browser, your your broadband cost just doubled because you're paying flat a fee that you pay per month.  You can pay a specific fee.  But from my understanding, that covers only a certain amount of views, right?  Only a certain amount of pages.  And then at that point, I'm guessing I didn't read it, but I'm guessing you would just start seeing ads then at that point.  It's like you run out of your funding and you avoided ads.  But here you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So one of those stupid slideshows could be like a full quarter.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could really add up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, that would you would have to think about like what's interesting.  So sorry, I was digressing.  What's interesting here is that all of the what the Internet does and what kind of is happening with basically delivering all of this connected content is everything becomes super transactional because we can very clearly understand the costs associated with everything.  Right.  And there is no more like hiding things behind like, oh, it only cost me twenty dollars to subscribe to the paper and I'm supporting it.  But really, it's all of the advertisers.  So it's kind of a fascinating thing to think about how this plays out and how how different sites will be valued and who would pay for what?  Just like on a true per page or per, you know, cost of delivering a page basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If people do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, one of the gaps with the funding choices thing is that you could have websites that don't have ads who can't participate because there's no ads to block.  Right. So what they really need is a Google contributor where people can pay.  But then they really need a Google contributor where people pay as they land, not where they can say, oh, yeah, I read that.  Now I'm thinking after the fact, they want to do it.  But that, you know, potentially you could have sites that just put up fake ads and say, support us so that those ads can be blocked for the ad blocking people.  But yeah, I agree with you.  Maybe we'll get to this shift where people are thinking much more about, you know, I am paying for everything.  The Web actually isn't free and I'm paying for one way or the other.  You know, I'm paying for it because someone's going to be showing me an ad or I'm paying for it because I'm actually showing out real, real hard cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But or you're paying for it in terms of your demographic data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. But, you know, at least it gives an option.  You know, when the ad blockers, I think, especially on Safari, mobile Safari came out, you would have people who started getting these blocks and they'd be upset.  And it's like, like, at least they have a solution now for them.  Right. Well, if you don't want to turn off your ad blocker on this site, then I guess you can buy this type of thing, whether they actually then follow through with their principles of I don't want to be see ads.  To the degree that I'll pay for stuff. We'll we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. I know Ron Richards on the other show I do on the network all about Android.  He has been using contributor, I think, now for a few years, and he's he's loved it.  So so it's it's definitely a viable option.  It's an interesting kind of approach for this.  If what you want is to kind of improve, clean up the experience of the web, but not feel like you're just jibbing every every site that you go to because you've got an all out, you know, like brick wall ad blocker.  That's just shoving it all off.  So I guess we'll see. I guess we'll see the value, the actual value to people as far as like if it's worth worth it to people to remove those ads and to pay a little bit of money up front in order to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe if the ads were more obnoxious, it would be better and worth it.  We're worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure they're going in that direction.  I mean, Google's got a couple of different fronts here tackling this.  And I mean, essentially, it seems like making money on all sides.  Yes, we'll show you an ad.  We'll let you pay us to block the ad.  Exactly. Exactly.  Let's see here. What else?  We've got some other Google stuff.  There's there's no I mean, those were the things that actually interconnected.  Now everything is like little pieces here and there.  So we can just hop hop through some of this stuff.  I saw this actually today and I think I missed it.  It was yesterday's news that Google is working on an initiative.  It's a project that they're calling be Internet Awesome.  And it's a way to educate kids.  And I think it's aimed more at younger kids on how to protect themselves online.  It was developed by teachers, Internet safety and literacy organizations.  And it's a program to kind of advise kids who are just learning about their digital life online to understand, you know,  why you should limit sharing your personal information,  how you avoid scams or why, you know, what might be a scam in the making password health,  just in general, avoiding bad behavior online.  And they've got a like a curriculum for classrooms.  They've got a game that you can play through that.  What is the game called? It's out of my view here.  Interland. There you go.  Interland that kind of walks you through some of the concepts and everything.  And it's all about educating kids on being better Internet denizens and protecting themselves.  I think it's a great effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do too. I mean, because I will say as a parent who's tech savvy,  it's actually hard to remember all of the things that are that you kind of take for granted.  Right. And so having something that codifies it is really helpful.  And, you know, we spend time talking to my daughter about like not clicking on emails and, you know,  posting things online and but it's still like, you know, she's on a she plays a online game right now.  And we had to sit down and we realized that it had like chatting.  So then we had to talk about like, hey, don't share your password with people.  And, you know, it's weird having to like teach someone that.  But there are people who go around and, you know, scam kids or worse.  Right. So this is great.  I love it because I don't want to have to remember everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And Google has it really seems like Google is on a roll right now with really rolling out initiatives and efforts  and apps and services into Android that family link not too long ago that are really designed around kind of  improving the family the family experience with their products.  Of course, they benefit because they get, you know, they get users from a very young age to have brand affinity with Google products and to learn it.  But, you know, on the flip side of that, we live in a world where all this stuff is so so pervasive and just a part of of life that it's important to kind of know it to a certain, you know,  at a certain point, you have to know this stuff.  So, yeah. So, I mean, I applaud Google for putting this together and doing it.  And I suppose we'll see, you know, it's free resource.  Anyone can go there and check this stuff out.  I don't think you have to be in a classroom curriculum in order to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll get my daughter to go through it and we'll see how we feel about it afterwards.  I can tell you guys next, maybe not next week, but the week after that, I'll tell you guys what we thought.  I would say here's what I would like to see.  I would like to see a corollary to this that talks about like data collection and how companies like Google and others use your information.  So kids are aware of that side of the Internet, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess the big challenge here is that kids are capable of so much, yet you can easily overwhelm them and have information fall off the edge of the cliff.  But it's all so important.  Like, you know, I was thinking about this just yesterday, the story about how Harvard nixed a bunch of incoming students because of really offensive memes that they posted to a private Facebook group.  And I don't know how to formulate my thoughts around it exactly, but it kind of ties into this idea that like we are of a generation of an age where we've grown up with the Internet.  At least for myself, the Internet came along when I was already kind of a young adult.  And so I kind of learned these things over time.  But I mean, kids nowadays, like this is just they're born and they're surrounded by the Internet.  And like, I don't know, is there a different way of thinking about like what's OK to share out there and how do we how do we let them know that like, no, this stuff actually has repercussions like, oh, by the way, you're accepted into Harvard and now you're not going because you posted this thing on the Internet that even though it's a private Facebook group is not entirely private.  It's not like it was sealed and no one could see it.  It's very easy to take a screenshot.  It's very easy to do all these things that make something that you think is private is not.  And how do you communicate that to kids?  I think that's a really big challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I will say we did that with my daughter the second she had access to the Internet, which was probably like at age seven.  We just we tell her this all the time.  Nothing on the Internet is private.  Nothing.  Nothing on your phone is private.  And, you know, that's the I.  So I think of web safety and tech savvyness is probably similar to teaching your kids about sex education kind of stuff, because you don't overwhelm them with everything all at once.  But you have to start talking about it very early.  The second, you know, you're seeing them.  And I think as parents, you also have to follow through on this yourself.  So maybe you don't post, you know, the pictures of your kid in the bathtub on Facebook.  And, you know, if you do that, maybe you explain to them how you're limiting these settings and that you'll take it down when they're 13 and like, oh, my God, mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or maybe not getting their permission to post that photo of them in the bathtub, but getting their permission to actually post anything on Facebook at all.  I stepped away from Facebook back in December.  I was just starting to feel a little overwhelmed with kind of the time I was spending scrolling and just some of the decisions that they were making just didn't really didn't really ring true to to me.  And I felt like I needed to step away.  But one thing I had been struggling with up until then was this growing kind of need or feeling inside of me to stop sharing as much about my life on the Internet.  Because basically what I'm doing is taking that choice away from from my kid and just basically saying you don't have the choice.  I've decided to share all this stuff about you.  And more and more that just felt weird to me.  And so I had to do that, you know, giving them more of a voice.  What do you think? What do you think about all this, Danny?  I mean, you're a father. I'm sure you've you've struggled with a lot of these issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's funny, my son had to do a senior project.  And so it's for a senior project. His was going to be oversharing on social media.  And I was like, all right, because I'm I'm an overshare around the house.  I don't know. You know, I I think we talked with our kids about some safety things early on when they've done online gaming and stuff like that.  We've talked about, you know, you don't take requests from strangers, don't do things from people you don't know.  I think we've been fortunate that they've been pretty savvy and kind of come up with it at the same time.  But, you know, I think the education stuff is all very good.  I remember Eric Schmidt once talking about the idea that every teenager at 18 ought to have the right to just completely cleanse out their record.  And I thought, oh, that's crazy.  And it probably still is crazy in the sense that you could do it.  But, you know, you kind of think, yeah, actually, you've got people sharing stuff that really don't understand the longer term repercussions of what they're doing.  And, you know, they probably could use a good cleanse in a lot of ways.  And then at the same time, I think we'll also be going into a culture that will become more accepting of this stuff.  If you go back to the idea of like, you know, I think it was when Clinton was like the first president who said he ever smoked pot and that you finally got through this point.  Well, OK, I guess that doesn't end it.  That I don't want to excuse the things that people may post, but that people may become more or less shocked about that sort of stuff that is, oh, you have this weird thing you posted when you were 15.  Yeah, OK, everybody's got something like that.  But overall, I like the idea of better education, of teaching kids to think more about what they're doing, that you don't need to share all this sort of stuff.  Certainly the idea, I think one of the things that I find most tragic to me is when you find people who especially feel like they're doing all this effort to present themselves in a special way on social media that aren't feeling that way internally.  And, you know, that I'm going to make myself look great, but I actually feel awful.  And, you know, you kind of want to say, I just wish you had, you know, actual people that you know who are there to support you and tell you that you're loved so that you don't feel like you've got to express it that way out on social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah, that's a really good point.  I mean, at one point it seemed like social media, you know, is a tool that allows you to express yourself.  And then at another point, it becomes a tool that allows you to portray yourself as something that you wish you were or something that you aspire to be, but you're not.  And that could be self-defeating because you're not.  Yet you're portraying yourself of this very public sort of sense that you are.  I can't even imagine being a kid like having to figure out what is the right approach on something like that.  It's hard enough figuring out how to be authentic in person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's crazy, too, because you think on the one hand, you know, when I was like seven or eight, I would walk home from school alone, you know, for like a mile in the snow.  But OK, maybe there was this snow, but you walk in the snow.  You walked home from you. You went out. You had a key. You went to your house alone.  You know, we get dropped off at maybe Disneyland and it was like you had your dime and you just wandered around.  And like I got to find my friends. I know where all my kids are. I know what's going on with them.  I know they have their cell phones. It doesn't make them perfectly safe.  But our ability to watch over what our kids are doing versus say what I had when I was growing up is hugely different.  I mean, before you could have said, well, I'm at a friend's house.  And now it's like if you weren't at a friend's house, I can tell because I can either see it or I know that you've turned something off or you've done something to kind of cover your tracks.  So I could tell that, you know, that wouldn't be the case if that's going on.  Plus, the idea that, you know, I think a lot of us really usher our children around the idea that can just wander around is, you know, feels less and less of a type of thing.  So on the one hand, I think there's an increase in the physical world safety as we've developed as a society.  And now it's just weird or bizarre or strange or it's just a whole new world where the virtual world safety now has a lot of catching up to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that is super true. How do I am very interested in this topic, obviously, as a parent of two kids.  And they are right at the point right now.  Definitely, you know, my older daughter is seven.  And so I'm kind of at this critical point where she's very interested in technology.  And I know I need to educate more around this.  One of the struggles that I have is this idea that, like you said, Danny, we've got as parents nowadays, we have all these tools that we can use.  They're available to us for free to be able to kind of track how our kids use the Internet, track how our kids move across the landscape of the real world and all of these things.  And I struggle with this kind of weird, weird place where is how do our kids respond to being watched all that all that time?  You know, that that's certainly when I was a kid, right, I could go to someone's house at the very most, you know, at the very least, leave a message and say, hey, I'm over at so and so's house.  I'm going to be there until nine o'clock.  Then I'll walk home and everything's fine.  Nowadays, like we we we would not allow for that.  We require so much more because we have access to all these tools to know so much more.  But how does that affect kids who are growing up now with that kind of oversight?  And what does that lead to 20 years down the line?  Obviously, we don't know the answer to that.  But got any guesses?  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't have to do it.  Yeah, well, that's true.  You absolutely throwing that out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like you don't have to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're right.  I'm like, we give my daughter a phone.  But, you know, when she's going to walk to like her friend's house, which we let her do so, she walks to her friend's house and she's supposed to text us when she gets there.  And then she's supposed to text us when she leaves.  So we can kind of keep an eye.  And it's the same thing.  Like I was a latchkey kid when I arrived home from school.  I had to call my mom first thing.  And if I didn't, you know, I would get a phone call.  So, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And to tie this back into Google, I'm sure you guys talked about it on this week in Google when it launched a few months ago.  But Google Trusted Contacts is an app that you can put on.  It's very, very close to what we're talking about here.  Kind of selecting contacts that you want to stay connected with from, you know, in a sense of personal safety, emergency, your close friends, siblings, basically sharing your locations.  You're walking from point A to point B and you want to you want to make sure that somebody that you trust is kind of looking over you in a digital sense.  So there are tools that Google offers to to help facilitate this stuff.  And we have the ability to do so much with the device in our pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, how how old is your kid going to be when they get their device, their first device, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so I guess it depends on what is defined as their their device.  They don't have their own device.  I have a four and a seven year old.  They don't have their own device necessarily.  But every weekend, each of them has a tablet that they can use for two two hours each day.  And, you know, they have YouTube kids on there.  So it's the it's the kids version of YouTube.  And that's really all they ever do.  Maybe play a handful of games, but it's really that.  So I think in their minds, they own those tablets.  They don't know those tablets.  They aren't going anywhere with those tablets.  If we go on a trip, we might bring them, you know, we'll bring them and they can play on them.  But I don't know.  I don't know what the right age is to say, here's a phone.  Have fun, because I mean, I'm already getting getting into conversations with my seven year old about how friends at her school.  Some of her friends have phones.  I'm like, are you serious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's weird because, yeah, some of my my friend, my daughter, she's going into sixth grade, which feels like a time that might happen with a phone.  But like her friends like call her on our phone, not for social, because they don't talk on the phone, but they call like for projects or something or just to snag her to get her online a lot of times.  So a lot of times they're calling to ask her to go online so they can do work via Hangouts or whatever.  So, yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, that's a that's a tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I have a feeling that the age at which kids are given their own device has gotten younger and younger over the past probably 10 years.  You know, as we've had more of these smartphones and more of our own lives as parents have kind of evolved around relying on these devices and, you know, lots of these apps are created to enable things like knowing where your kid is at all times and everything.  Then it becomes more and more enticing for parents to give the device to them at a younger age.  But who knows what the right decision is?  That's the hard part about being a parent.  You just never know.  Anyways, kind of related to this, actually, at least to a certain degree in this weird kind of world where we're moving into technology and everything's connected and everything.  Stacey, you tweeted out, I think today or yesterday, this Pew Research study that came out yesterday.  It was yesterday.  It was yesterday. It was examines the kind of the deeper potential of what the Internet of Things leads to and kind of the future that we can look forward to as the Internet of Things becomes more pervasive.  Tell us a little bit about what what stood out to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, man, this. So we talked about this a lot on our show today that we recorded.  Because this is something we've been talking about for a while.  But the idea is that soon connectivity will not be something you can escape.  One, because it'll be in everything.  But two, because you'll be required to have it as part of your job or interacting with people or paying for things.  And so then it becomes like, man, in this world that we're we're rapidly moving towards and kind of halfway are in.  How do we know what decisions are being made on our behalf? How do we know if it's safe?  How do we know, you know, what back end deals are happening behind the scenes that, you know, show that end up showing you the content that you see?  So it's kind of a lot of that. It's a it's a really great report.  I encourage everyone to read it. And it has like just scary, scary things like, let's see.  Unplugging is nearly impossible now, but by 2026, it will be even tougher.  Resistance is futile. You can't avoid.  And then my next favorite thing is you can't avoid using something you can't discern.  So much of IOT operates out of sight that people will not be able to unplug.  I'm like, whoo, whoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And being kind of pulled into the the benefits of something like IOT, like, you know, I've recently upgraded.  Once I started upgrading lights in my house to Phillips Hue, it's like I'm I want them all on Phillips Hue now.  And slowly but surely something that used to be just this passive dumb light bulb has been swapped out in many rooms for something that connects to the Internet  and can be used in a number of ways for who knows what we hear about IOT and security all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There we go. And I would like to I would like to think I mean, there are so many positives to this,  not just the fact that you may never have to leave your couch again to turn on your lights.  But companies do need to be transparent. And there is a real issue.  I think The Guardian wrote this up and they made a bunch of good points that, you know, I know that we've made in the past.  But when you're doing something like buying something on Amazon Echo, you know, you don't know what the best price necessarily is because you don't see it.  You're just saying do this. And if you set like a reoccurring subscription, there's not necessarily a guarantee that that's going to be, you know, the best available option all the time.  Right. And there are just so many examples of this.  Like, can you imagine yourself driving car, maybe taking you a slightly different route based on your personal preferences?  Maybe so you drive by a Starbucks and think, oh, yeah, I should totally get that.  Those are those are all things that like Carnival is doing a connected cruise line and they will know your preferences.  And I was talking to them about wayfinding because one of the things they want to do is help people negotiate around these epically huge ships.  And I was like, so if someone likes gambling, you know, would you send them to, you know, their their movie or their brunch by way of a casino?  She's like, we might. So. OK. But will the consumers know that?  Right. That's scary. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, that's that's that's a really good point. I mean, so much of that happens, you know, online with with advertising.  I mean, that's that's a large part about, you know, how how that works.  You go to Amazon, you search for something and then you end up going to a site a day later.  And what do you know? That thing is down there and it's on sale. It's ten dollars less than it was yesterday.  Do you want to buy it now? And, you know, I think it's easy to think that that's all purely coincidental.  And hey, isn't that weird? But as long and we're OK with it, many people are OK with it because they understand that that's just how ad tracking ad marketing works.  But if you don't know that happens, then it feels very manipulative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was I was looking to book a hotel and I had like three different hotel sites opened and I found all the rooms between them.  Pick the one that I wanted and shut the other two down. And like I continue to get emails.  Hey, finish your booking. Finish. You know, and I know why it's happening because I've logged in and they know that I was logged in.  They followed me all the way to this or whatever. But yeah, if you don't know and you've been seeing that also where I think there's been a rise where people are convinced that their phones are listening to them and where they've, you know, said there's the only way that the phone.  The only way I could have seen this ad is because I was talking to somebody about this and, you know, it's it listened to me.  And so now it knows that I I'm this person who was interested in that.  It's like, well, actually, your Internet browsing probably gave them that data because it's become that that good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But, yeah, people don't know. And I think people will figure it out over time.  You know, that's kind of our job is to explain some of the stuff that's happening and find good use cases.  But, you know, it's it is becoming harder because for a lot of companies like I was talking to GE's appliances division and they're looking at putting connectivity into everything, not because they want to give you necessarily these whiz bang features, but because they want to understand how their appliances are being used and be able to track and make service calls easier.  So I see it totally in the future. Like maybe you won't get a warranty on something unless you connect it. Right.  And that becomes kind of coercive in a way to a consumer.  And, you know, maybe you don't want to connect it up and maybe you don't want someone knowing when you're cooking or what you're cooking or the or the stuff that simply dies because you can't connect it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So like I recently dug out my zoom because I don't want to give too much of a spoiler away.  But there was a movie where the zoom got featured in, which was pretty cool.  So I went out and I thought, well, we're going to load this up and I'll put the movie soundtrack on it just for a laugh.  And I had to set up a personal web server and download files from a separate thing and alter some other thing to convince the zoom software that it was connecting to this Microsoft server because the Microsoft server had gone down.  And so like, whoa, and like you couldn't even reset it to go back to its basic mode.  You know, it was really, really tied in to being connected.  And I think more of our devices, somebody else had a device that was like that.  Oh, the the DJI. I always say DJI, but it's the DJI drones.  Now, you know, you have to have them connected to an account for them to fly.  And there's advantages to that because they ensure that they have the right firmware and they know who they are.  But then you're like, so in two years, if you go away, does my drone die?  And maybe that's just part of, well, things don't last forever like they used to anyway.  Not that things will ever last forever, but maybe they made it more than a year or two.  But, yeah, it's kind of scary. Or just our televisions.  Right. And the whole thing that came up with the Samsung sets or the Vizio sets where, you know, you're monitoring what's being watched or like, hey, I just want to watch TV.  And I or, you know, and I paid for the TV. You didn't give me a discount.  It's not like when I bought my Kindle and they said, do you want to pay twenty dollars more and not get the ads?  I paid for the TV. I paid for my direct service every TV every month.  I don't want to be data mined in that way.  It's sort of way unless you're going to give me some good incentive with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's what you get for having a TV that plugs into the Internet, which is, I mean, pretty much all TVs nowadays.  You know, they all have some sort of smart Internet enabled functionality on the back end.  Some of them are just dumb monitors, but they all have that.  And that basically means that like the days of just, you know, hooking an antenna up to the TV and it's all passive.  I mean, they're they're numbered at this point because it's all it's all fed through.  And that's and that's with the trade off of of convenience and, you know, nice services that we all love that we look for and everything.  So obviously we're getting something from it.  It just kind of removes some of the choice, which is kind of one of the parts, you know, one of the points of this this Pew research study is that the more we go down this path, the less choice we as users actually have to avoid it.  If we so choose, it's going to be next to impossible to step away from it.  And then you get into this weird world of like, OK, so if our lives are surrounded by all these connected devices and we've chosen to go there and everybody's like that now because all devices are connected to the Internet somehow.  What does that say about kind of the civil liberties that we have built up around ourselves and have enjoyed for a very long time in this new world where everything is capable of being tracked and traced and monetized and that's that's 10 years from now.  I mean, that's now, you know, now for the next 10 years, it's going to get crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so this is something that we talked about, I think, last week, and we were talking about the role of government and regulation about like privacy.  And this ties directly into that is we are right now at a stage where we're relying on companies to be the.  Benign actors in this scenario of data mining everything and us not having a choice whether or not we're going to be part of this.  I think we will see really well off people buy unconnected devices will probably see a robust eBay economy and like old dumb things like heck.  My mom won't even buy a car that has power locks.  It's kind of ridiculous.  Yes. But we're also like.  The amount of data that these things are connecting is insane. And I just tweeted before the show I was talking about Uber because more stuff is coming about out about Uber.  And to me, this is the perfect example of an IoT company that is running amok with your data in doing things that are just incredibly unethical and not being penalized for it in ways.  I mean, everything from the first mess ups around God view and like showing, oh, look, there's Beyonce driving around New York right now, you know, to the latest allegations about like people there having access to someone's medical records.  You know, I'm like, oh, we we have to start doing something about this because it is it is not going to be pretty.  And we can't really rely on these companies to really protect us and not be jerks.  Man, that's overwhelming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry. No, no, I mean, I completely agree.  I think we would all probably agree with that 100 percent is just like, what do you do?  Do we hit a point where we where we look backwards and we go, man, maybe I should not have shared as maybe I should not have been entranced by all that technology as much as I was, because look where I am now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think that you can step it back? But you can step it back even further.  I mean, just anybody who's ever had to deal with a credit report and you're like, what, where'd they get this information on me? And this is a nation isn't correct.  And now I got to try to get it fixed. And that's a nightmare process that you go through.  And we have some laws that allow us to deal with this sort of stuff, but we don't have laws that prevent all that stuff being flowing into one place.  Every purchase you've ever made and what happens with all that sort of stuff and who, you know, just just imagine what you do with your credit card alone.  Yeah. Right. And what are your protections with that?  And how do you push a button? I mean, and we can and I'm not believe me, I'm not taken away from the Internet companies.  But if I want to purge all my stuff on Google, I've got a dashboard where I can do it.  If I want to purge all the things that I purchased on my credit card, I don't know how far that that goes.  I don't know how to get rid of those things. I don't know where all that stuff is. So, you know, I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And police can't get access to that data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So, you know, you know, eventually they'll get me for that person I wiped out.  But, you know, you we could use a better protection, I think, for just period, better consumer protection overall.  And I don't want it to be just limited to Internet companies.  I'd like to see a good fundamental bill of rights that we have in terms of what information you can gather about us,  what information you can compile in various sources and put together and what our ability is to purge some of this stuff if we want to purge it and apply it not just to the Internet and tech companies,  but just companies in general, especially because I don't want like loopholes to get through, you know, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's I like that. That's a good I mean, because that's true right now.  There are the tech companies, but I also have devices that are made by companies that aren't technically tech companies.  And they're sucking down data as much as they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, I mean, anybody who's gone to a grocery store and then when the receipt spits out, you're you go to a grocery store.  And of course, you have a loyalty card and the loyalty card gives you the discount.  And then the receipt spits out a coupon based on the path purchases that you've made.  And you're like, oh, I guess you know, you're keeping track of all the things I purchased and, you know, who gets to see that and that sort of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, but 50 cents off of a package of Ritz, I'm all for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We use it. So here's here's you can play the loyalty card game.  You just swap people's loyalty cards around.  Maybe that's sure create like a consumer network where you're like, all right, I'll mail you my stuff.  You'd use this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's also if you go back to Uber, it always drives you crazy when people either have thought of Uber as a tech company or as a ride hailing company, because I don't know what the hell ride hailing was.  I think of them as a taxi service, right?  They're a taxi company.  But if you're going to consider them to be a tech company because they use technology to get a taxi to you, then our grocery stores are tech companies.  Like, what is it to tech company at that point?  Right. Who isn't using technology these days other than maybe my small local business that sells me milk when the grocery store is closed that that that isn't kind of doing that sort of stuff.  So, yeah, our tech companies are broader than what we think of in terms of tech companies.  And the amount of data that's being gathered about us is even broader than we can imagine, just with the stuff that we already know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting what you what you were just saying about about using a loyalty card and then getting a coupon for a discount on something you've bought in the past.  It remembers a couple of weeks ago that there was news that that Google was going to be working with credit card companies or something to be able to track your purchases.  You're spending inside stores and be able to offer you advertising around that.  And that's that definitely had some people talking about the creepy line and wow, now Google knows everything that I buy in stores.  But that's basically what you're talking about, Danny.  And we've been doing it for years with loyalty cards.  We didn't have a problem with it then.  It just goes back to what people actually understand about what's happening behind the scenes or just or just accepting the fact that it does.  And we've been OK with it to a certain degree in one way.  Well, you know, what's different about the way it is now that it's a little bit more technologically tied, you know, in a sense of the Internet or I'm not sure.  Sure. But that changes.  Wow. That was a rabbit hole.  That was fun. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We'll need something to lift us.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's talk about HomePod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you. That's a great that's a great segue.  Yes. OK. So I don't know how do you guys talk about Apple on this show very much?  Probably doesn't happen very often. But you know, we talk about everything on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, really, it's it's it's a free for all.  Sometimes we even hit Google. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, we started with Google. We did all right.  There just isn't a whole lot of Google News this week.  Yeah. So obviously, Apple had their big WWDC event and keynote on Monday.  And of all the things that were demonstrated to developers and things like laptops, new MacBooks, new IMAX, whatever, probably the star of the show, I would say.  And the thing that people were wondering if it was going to happen and if they were going to see it is Apple's answer to the Amazon Echo.  Or maybe it's Apple's answer to the Sonos speaker with a little bit of Siri tied into it.  It's called the HomePod. And it's kind of Apple's foray into this home assistant world.  Speaker first, though, every everyone that I've read that's that's heard one of these things says the sound is tremendous.  Like it puts out a really nice sound, especially when you compare it with the Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When people listen to that sound in a room that Apple set up next to an Apple Echo and Sonos, it was amazing that the Apple but it probably is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's probably I'm guessing it's probably a little better than the Echo.  They did a good job with the design. What do you think, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I was going to just say this isn't out till December.  And I think in some ways the the good speaker is fine.  But, you know, in Apple did mention, I think on a slide that it was a personal assistant, too.  But that is so clearly missing. And my hunch is it's missing because Siri right now is not worth talking about as a personal assistant.  And so what I expect is in the next few months, they're going to be working hard on Siri, maybe showing something off in September.  At the hardware launches that they do.  And then, you know, when it's out in December, we'll see it.  So I wouldn't discount it on the basis like, yeah, it's a good speaker.  I would expect nothing less from Apple. Music is its DNA.  But, you know, we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it really did feel like like they put Siri totally second fiddle to the idea of this being a speaker.  And that felt to me like an admission that Siri wasn't worth featuring as a front and center highlight point.  Although maybe, you know, I mean, it's an expensive piece of gear.  It's what is it? Three hundred and fifty dollars right around there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is not something a lot of people are going to put in every room.  I mean, you look at the Amazon strategy, which is, you know, get people in the door.  The Echo is pretty cool. Or you give them a fifty dollar dot.  Right. And this feels like something that's.  Yeah, I mean, would you put this in every room at three hundred and fifty?  I don't know. Someone.  But I wouldn't. Well, yes. But like everyone.  And then with the Google Home, I kind of feel like.  I have one in a lot of the stuff you can do on your phone.  So that may be like the poor man's way of getting all of these features.  It may not be a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm you know, I'm perfectly happy with my Google Home.  I make no I make no secret about that.  I have one now in the kitchen and I have one in the living room.  And of course, you know, as as I get more and more huge bulbs,  that becomes kind of neat to be able to do a voice command and turn on my lights,  which is kind of like, OK, great.  You know, like that's that's neat and everything.  How essential is it? But I mean, I use I use my home all the time.  My family uses the home all the time for music.  Like we're always playing music, playing playlist.  It's really easy to fire off a playlist.  So I so when I saw the home pod, I was like, well, that's actually pretty nice.  As a music device, a voice activated music device that actually sounds really good.  Personally, I'm satisfied with the way Google Home sounds for my ears.  But if you have, I don't know, a more tuned ear  and you require more out of the sound coming out of that little pod in the in the corner of your room,  maybe it's worth three hundred fifty dollars.  Danny, what what voice assistants do you have?  Is this appealing to you at all?  I have both the home and the echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And, you know, I think generally it's smart in the sense that the primary thing  I think people say that you on these devices is playing music.  So the idea that, wow, that's what people like a lot is that can play music on these things.  So we'll come up with a great music playing device.  That's an interesting strategy.  But I also don't know to the degree that people play music on this or audio files.  Right. Because I have a home speaker system and like my wife listens to music a lot.  And occasionally she remembers, oh, I can stream to that.  And she likes it. And the music is much better coming out of that because it's like all the speakers.  But, you know, typically she's just kind of want some casual music playing and the echo is good enough.  And so I think that I think that if you get into that price range, you're going to go,  this really is a replacement for my home speaker system because maybe I've already made that kind of investment.  Or I don't know how that will play out.  But I do think that even though the primary thing people do with these devices is play music,  I think they like the other aspects to it as well.  I think they like the idea that echo gives them information and news.  Certainly the smart home connected stuff is very helpful.  And I'll be interested to see how. First of all, I don't know whether or not the HomePod is going to deal with, say, Spotify.  I assume that there's going to be some option for that to do it.  But if there isn't, to me, that's almost going to make it dead in the water for a lot of people because I listen to Spotify.  Spotify, we're getting all of our stuff off of not Apple Music.  And if it's a pure Apple Music device, there's a lot of people who use other alternatives in both the Echo and the Home will turn to Spotify as well as Amazon Music, as well as their native things that they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google won't play Amazon Music.  And the Echo won't play YouTube. Sorry.  No, I just I'm like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. But what I mean is they both go to third parties or they both have their own native stuff to fall back on.  So that if you're a Google user, you could use Google Music.  So if I would assume that your Apple Music will be the default for HomePod and that hopefully they allow you to use a like Spotify, I wouldn't expect them to use Google Music, but we'll see.  But the assistant aspect, I think, will be important.  And I think Siri is pretty dumb and I don't see Siri getting any smarter anytime sooner.  And I especially think that so you're going to roll out a speaker that sounds better than the Echo, but is probably stupider than the Echo, which itself is already stupider than the Google Home.  And if people actually want a little bit more out of these things, just playing music, it's not a compelling thing.  It's sort of been also ran.  So, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then in that sense, it's a competitor to Sonos, which already I think a lot of people see as overly expensive.  I mean, there's definitely a fan base for Sonos hardware, for kind of the interconnected speaker system.  But I mean, once Google, you know, they release their Chromecast audio and then now Google Home is like an extension of that.  They can be their own points for this network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google Homes will already network with each other.  Right. You can have two Google Homes and they will do the playing in multiple rooms.  I don't think the sound quality in the home is as good as the Echo personally, but not that big a deal to me.  Right. You know, I'm three drinks in.  I don't really care about the sound quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would consider like I'm a musician.  I feel like I have an ear for sound, but I don't care about the sound quality of Google Home.  It does exactly what I want it to do.  It's a small, you know, it takes up very small footprint on the windowsill of my kitchen.  And it's there to very easily place music on a, you know, in a flash when I'm like bored and want some music while I'm washing dishes or cooking dinner or something.  That's all I really need it for.  I'm not looking at that little device to be like the most pristine audio file experience in the world.  That's just not why I bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this reminds me of the MP3 debates from back in the day.  Like, oh, here we are again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, there's I think they're going to I think they're going to sell a lot of these.  There are people who definitely care about sound quality.  I'm sure the sound quality would be great. I'm sure some people are great.  I love my Apple thing. This is the best thing.  It's the wonderful thing. I'm put it in all my different rooms and it takes away from me having to have all these speakers or whatever.  But, you know, I think there's a lot of other people who don't don't care that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's also the fact that this is going to be available internationally to a greater extent than either the Echo or the Google Home have been up until now.  So just that that availability alone is going to bring me get this December.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  December. Yeah.  So it's like it's going to be tough for Christmas gifts and such.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's an expensive Christmas gift. Yeah.  Yeah. $150.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was that was one of the smarter things the Echo did with like the Echo was it it launched it actually a hundred bucks for people.  But then then at 180, you're like, but then they came out soon after with the dot.  And, you know, if you already had an Echo, you're like, well, crap, I can stick a dot everywhere.  And again, so I would look in the next couple of months for Siri to get better because, you know, Apple is Apple's not dumb.  They know where their weak points are and they are addressing them to I would look for the Amazon Echo.  So no integration, because I think that's going to be a really important thing for retaining that market.  And then three, I would like to see what they do on privacy.  Like Apple really did talk a lot about privacy and not just in a whole home way, but they talked about encrypting the data, not not just the device isn't always listening, but that they're encrypting the data to and from servers and they're anonymizing it on the servers on the back end.  And that's a really big deal. I would agree. I would agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But my question about that, I'm happy you brought that up, because I think anonymizing it on the back end is a big deal for privacy.  It's something that Google, as one example, can't do because they're so tied into their cloud information around you that anonymizing it wouldn't.  It's why it's it's a didn't they have the same reason for why they can't couldn't encrypt alo is because if they encrypted it, then you wouldn't get that extra assistant functionality built in around your specific account.  So I think that's the reason that they don't do that.  So that's a big deal from from privacy perspective.  This always listening thing that they touted.  Don't they all do that? They're not all listen. They all always listen. They just don't send it up to the cloud.  They wait for the keyword and then that's the thing that they they grab on to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Yes. That's how they all work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK. I'm sorry. Was Apple saying they were doing something different or that's what that's what I couldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Apple says that there it listens for a very see on the device, whereas Amazon sends five second loops that are basically always always getting deleted to its servers for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's interesting. OK. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's why that case was a case of a month or two ago about a crime that had happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we learned about the case a while ago, but like several months ago, but it was actually like a 2016 or 2015.  It was a 2015 maybe murder. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yes, that's really interesting. I didn't realize Amazon was sending stuff up.  I assumed it had a device specific hot word that caused it to wake up.  No, but they don't keep that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've always talked about that's how it works. Yeah. OK. That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Home. Is it just looking for the call the the the the word and then once it detects that on device, then it's it prompts you for your query and that sends to the cloud.  Is that the only thing that goes to your cloud is your query?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know specifically how Google Home works. I was like words.  What's it called? OK. That's my understanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's always been my belief.  And I'm trying to I'm now at this point where I'm trying to figure out is that based on something I read or is that just an assumption that I made?  ScooterX and chat says yes.  That's always been my understanding is that Google Home also it's an open mic.  It's just but but on device it's waiting to hear that.  Hey, G or OK, G. Once it hears that you do your query, that's the thing that gets sent up to the cloud.  It's not doing it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was pretty sure that I was pretty sure the Google Home had an on device hot word just as like I thought the Xbox and Cortana or whatever it was before that they were on device hot words that they were always listening just to whether or not they heard the hot word.  And when they hear the hot word, that's when they would go to the cloud.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Yeah, but I mean anonymizing that and you know in in the cloud that's that's something that Apple can do because their business is not built around this massive trove of information and data that's been built up around you that makes Siri more useful.  So it'll be interesting to see how Apple does improve Siri to compete with some of these other home assistants because they just don't have as much information on you.  And that's the kind of stuff that makes people go, oh, wow, that's really useful.  It knows by calendar or whatever the case may be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think the other big change, though, if if I remember or understood it right from what from what they were saying with the WWDC was that Siri was now going to be smarter across your devices because currently right now Siri is device specific because Apple's real like we don't send any of that stuff out.  So Siri learns your thing on one device.  And then if you were to have an iPad, Siri on the iPad doesn't know the same things that Siri on the iPhone understands, just like if you had a home pod, Siri on the home pod wouldn't necessarily know that except that they're making a change now where it's all encrypted and it's magical and it's provided privacy protected or whatever.  But I think that they said that now Siri is actually going to be cross device.  And that's a significant change because that allows them to then let Siri get smarter because you have a common Siri profile rather than a device specific Siri profile.  If I'm understanding all the things that it was saying that it does.  But to go back to the other thing with what Stacey was saying on the Siri getting smarter, it's going to be really hard for them to make Siri smarter because Siri doesn't get smarter unless you start letting Bing do stuff.  Because right now Siri is designed to just this only talks to you know, this only deals with a set number of very very databases that it can have.  Like what's the weather? Set a timer. Do these very specific things.  And then if you want to go beyond that, of course, you have to have installed the apps or whatever they call them.  Siri will answer a lot of common vetted stuff that they have as well.  And then if you try to go beyond that, it tries to hit various databases like I'll go to Yelp or I'll go to this.  And then ultimately it decides, well, I'll try to go to Bing.  And usually it's sort of this half-hearted effort that's not very useful.  Google, when you ask it, goes to Google.  There's none of this like, well, I'm trying to figure this out. Maybe I can go over here.  Maybe somebody else is like, Google, I know everything.  It doesn't know everything, but it but it but it knows it knows a lot and it's not got this delay of, well, I'm not certain about this.  Let me ask someone else to see if someone else knows.  And then I'll just throw it out there. So, you know, they don't just get to make Siri Google Home Smart by flipping a few switches.  That's they don't have a search engine.  They don't have a deep integration like Google has.  So, you know, they might get it closer to doing what an Amazon Echo does.  But, you know, I don't see them getting anywhere close to what a Google Home does unless they want to really let Microsoft into that device a lot more than they're doing now.  And, you know, they've been years and not doing that.  The other question that will come up is whether they're allowed to do that.  So they use Bing for Siri as the backup.  They still use Google as the backup in Safari, and I don't know how their contract would work with we're serving stuff out of Siri.  Is that coming off of Google or is that coming off of Bing and who's it providing or whatever?  So I don't know.  It's been the one area that Apple has not really done as much as people think with in terms of having and owning and operating their own search service.  They don't have that.  And I think that's going to hinder them in terms of making that the home assistant that some people may want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From an IoT standpoint, Stacey, I mean, you know, when it comes to controlling devices in your home, do you think that, I mean, the fact that this has HomeKit, obviously, that's kind of part of the strength from Apple's perspective.  Is that a strong enough sell for IoT enthusiasts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I don't think a lot of people are really into HomeKit.  There are people who are into HomeKit, but I don't think it's a mass market thing.  What I think HomeKit may have going this actually may galvanize people to actually know about HomeKit and buy HomeKit.  Because when you are an Apple user and you activate a device from your iPhone, like a new connected device, it'll see that your phone is on your network.  And this device is on your networking.  They'll be like, hey, do you want to use HomeKit?  And you're like, sure.  And then you're like, ooh, magic.  And then you have control of this device that you may not really care much about.  But if you've done it enough times and you see and then you bring like a HomePod into the home, that gets interesting because then you might be like, Apple, I assume, tell you that, hey, by the way, you know, you could talk to this and control your thermostat because it's a HomeKit thermostat.  And then suddenly people might suddenly wake up to the fact that, holy cow, I have a connected house and I didn't even really realize it.  I don't know if that's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I have a lot of things that are on HomeKit and there go my lights now.  I don't know if you can see them clicking off.  I'm doing it off my phone.  And I've got to.  Yeah, there we are.  I mean, HomeKit, when it works, is really wonderful.  And sometimes it's easier to me than trying to set something up with the Lexa.  But not everything works with HomeKit.  So then you're like, to where is one of the things that like, I think the Echo, more than any of them, seem to work with everything now.  Like I struggle to find something that it can't handle that's a connected device in my house.  Whereas, you know, the Google still has some things it won't do.  And then HomeKit or Apple has a few things it won't talk to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Google has a bunch of stuff it won't talk to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, HomeKit, I'm way less knowledgeable on the Apple ecosystem side of things, but HomeKit is pretty much specific to just iOS, right?  Are there devices that are HomeKit and also support other platforms?  Or if they're HomeKit, they are only HomeKit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, there are bridge devices and devices that do both.  The challenge with HomeKit is that you have to have a physical chip right now inside the device for it to be certified for a HomeKit device.  Which means that if you've got older devices that aren't, if you've bought into a smart home, right?  And maybe they weren't HomeKit certified.  They're never going to become HomeKit certified.  But, but here comes the but they did put this in W.  They did talk about this at WWDC and Apple made a reference and I can't wait to find out more to making it easier to certify or to get HomeKit devices connected.  So, but it was a very cryptic thing and a press release.  So I'm like, could it be software enabled?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they might be able to like I had like the Hue lights, the my original hub with Hue, I don't think was HomeKit.  So when I upgraded the HomeKit Hue, I think the second one was, I believe it was.  Yes, it is.  Yeah. So when I got the new hub, then all my individual lights worked.  And like I have the Lutron lights that are HomeKit, but then the Amazon can work with them and Google can work with them.  But my Liffix bulbs, they don't have a hub and they're each individual bulbs.  And I have like 12 of them in various places and they're not going to get HomeKit.  You know, I'd have to throw those bulbs away.  But maybe this maybe goes to what you were saying, Daisy, is that they could talk to, they could talk to, say, my Apple TV or they could talk to a HomePod if the HomePod wanted them to, right?  It wouldn't be that hard to set them up.  But if the HomePod itself acts as a bridge, that might be a way to basically HomeKitify a lot of devices that don't have the HomeKit chips built into them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's an interesting thought. But that would kind of break Apple's security model because that's what HomeKit's all about.  So that would be that would be actually interesting.  So the HomeKit certification is built into the HomePod as a bridge.  I like it. Yeah.  OK. And yes, today was HomeKit Day at at WWW.  I can never say this. I've got too many W's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  WWW.WWDC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's a lot more stuff that we have now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll see. Good. All right.  So then you're going to have all three of these things in your house and then the Harman Kardon one and then the essential home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I already have a dozen hubs.  So, you know, what's what's a few more? What's a few more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to have a room that is nothing but home assistance waiting for you to fire them off, waiting for you to put them to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is true. I still have some rooms that we can we can trick out with with gear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, boy. That's awesome.  All right. So let's see here. Is there anything in here?  I mean, there's a lot of stuff in here that we haven't talked about.  Is there anything that that like really catches your eyes before we get to kind of tips and tricks and picks and all that kind of stuff?  Anything that you wanted to talk about that we that we haven't touched on before we move on?  And it's OK if there's none because we've got other things to like to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's the Amazon I smart phones. I don't know if we care about those.  Oh, yes. OK, yeah. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, yeah, let's talk about that real quick.  The Amazon Fire Phone, the opposite of fire is ice.  And apparently Amazon is working on a new take on their phones.  The Fire Phone was, let's just say it was a little bit of a failure when it launched a few years ago.  Did not last very long. It kind of had some gimmicky kind of aspects to it.  And it just it was a failure. Didn't work.  But apparently Amazon's back to the drawing board.  The internal name for it supposedly is ice.  Don't know if that's branding that's going to make it to release if and when it ever comes out.  But it seems like it's more targeting the device that's in the works is targeting kind of the lower end market in emerging markets specifically like like India,  somewhere around ninety three dollars when you convert it from Indian rupees.  But big difference this time is that in Android or Amazon doesn't do this with their Android devices.  So this would be a first is that it would have Google mobile services on it.  So it would have the Google Play Store. It would have Google apps like navigation or maps, you know, Android messages, whatever.  It has that whole package that you get on a phone that's officially GMS certified.  And that would be a big shift in Amazon's kind of mobile strategy.  In the past, they've been very, very much about their app store keeping you in on on all things Amazon on that device.  This would be a change, a transition away from that.  What do you guys think? Are you getting one?  No, no, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A low end Android phone? No, no, I think it's I mean, I think it'll be.  I can't tell if it's Amazon trying to make up for some data it doesn't own because it's not on the phone and it recognizes that's important.  Or if it's recognizing that's important, it's like, well, we'll get in on the ground floor here in India with these low cost phones and see if that works.  Yeah. So I mean, either way, I think Amazon signaling here that having a mobile component is important and it recognizes to get there.  It's going to have to take a slightly different strategy because the US market is pretty saturated.  And if I were Andy Rubin, I'd be like, oh, crap, what's going to happen with the essential phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, yeah, when you when you really look at how successful Amazon has been and all of the other places that they are present, like when you when you look at it, not.  And let's say you didn't know that the Fire Phone ever existed.  You'd be scratching your head wondering why Amazon wasn't doing a phone, because that makes perfect sense for everything that they're trying to achieve.  Yet they did try it and they failed pretty miserably at it.  So it makes sense that they go back again, maybe hitting a deal with Google.  Obviously, Google wants as many partners and would love to have Amazon on its side of the ship.  I don't know. I don't know what that means for Amazon devices going forward, because my understanding of GMF's of of that that agreement is that once you go in on it, your your future phones have to all also carry that.  Otherwise, you're breaking the the terms of the deal.  So I don't know if that means that. OK, well, I guess now, you know, our phones, I don't know if that also extends to tablets.  My understanding is that it does, but maybe it doesn't.  But that their future devices would have to have some sort of Google, you know, Google Play Play Store and all their services on it.  That'd be a big shift. But I think you have a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But probably a smart one, because I don't think they're they're getting there in terms of, you know, we're going to have our own play.  We're going to have our own app store and we're going to have our own thing.  It's like, you know, you're probably just going to do better if you dive into the Android space.  Yeah, yeah, that's true. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see here. You mentioned essential.  Apparently there is a trademark dispute.  Not even a week later after Andy Rubin showed off his essential phone and essential home.  Spigen, which is the cell phone case slash battery pack maker, has a trademark for essential.  Since August of 2016, a range of battery packs and chargers that they sell with the essential brand on it, also some Bluetooth headphones.  So they charge that essential the phone being a phone company is too similar to confusing.  And apparently essential, the phone company applied for this registration and it was refused.  One could assume why, because it existed already.  But they went ahead with it anyways. Andy was like, whatever, we got this.  So now it's a case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's crazy that they were denied their trademark and then they still went and did it.  That feels I don't know. Of course.  Remember Apple took on Cisco with iOS as a as a networking nerd.  I knew what iOS was before before the rest of you when it was something completely different.  And, you know, Cisco finally caved.  So maybe that's the playbook that, you know, Andy Rubin's running from.  I don't know. I don't know.  Yeah, who knows on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it was still kind of it was a bold move on Andy's company's part.  Essential says threat letters are commonplace in our sector.  While Spigen's prerogative to make assertions, essential believes they are without merit and will respond appropriately.  So we'll see what that appropriate response is.  I think I think I think we did all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we can. I was like, we could talk about Amazon doing prime for what used to be food stamps, which I thought was.  So let me let me pull up the story, which is open in one of these tabs.  I'm like, oh, dear God.  Hold on. Is it EBT?  I think is what it's called now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Electronic Benefits Transfer Card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you.  Basically, they reduced the prime.  The ninety nine dollars you pay for prime to was it forty five.  Here it is. I found it.  It's six ninety nine or sorry, five ninety nine.  So six dollars from basically eleven dollars a month.  You have to have your electronics benefits transfer card.  And it you don't have to use that card for Amazon purchases only for verification.  So this is really interesting because it makes me kind of wonder.  One is Amazon just trying to increase prime.  But to remember that kerfuffle about Amazon not being in low income neighborhoods.  I think it was Bloomberg did a really good data analysis.  And one of the reasons Amazon said it wasn't was because it didn't have one of the metrics  that looks at when trying to decide where to do like now delivery zones was Amazon now.  So the really rapid delivery was the number of prime subscriptions in that area.  So I thought this might be kind of both just a nice way, like a way to get people who aren't as wealthy.  On the program, but also might give Amazon, you know, a better insight and better ways to like serve communities that I mean,  some of these places don't have access to, you know, cheaper groceries and things like toilet paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And I mean, you know, potentially people could actually save a lot of money if they could shop on Amazon  with some of the sale prices that happen and get that that shipping kind of included in there.  One of the statistics I found is that historically prime subscribers have made one hundred twelve thousand dollars  in a household per year or more.  Seventy percent of all prime subscribers fall into that category.  And so Amazon's missing out on a whole other tier of potential customers that could totally buy some of the products that maybe go on sale or whatever.  You know, buy the buy the lower cost items as they as they happen, it just opens them up to a new a new market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the Walmart market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And actually, 30 day free trial on that.  So people who are interested in order to validate, like you said, you need the EBT card, the electronic benefits transfer card.  And then once you validate, you can get a 30 day free trial, Amazon dot com slash qualify.  Amazon apparently is also working with the government on ways to allow food stamps to be used for some purchases as well.  So they're really open it up trying to anyways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I mean, I there are more people than ever on food stamps.  You know, you look at people who are like adjunct professors on food stamps, their teachers on food stamps.  This is not we there's a lot of people that, you know, could really take a benefit of this.  So, absolutely.  OK. All right. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anything else? Anything going once?  I'm going going twice.  Sold to tips, tricks and numbers or whatever we have.  Hopefully. Maybe maybe you do. Maybe you don't.  Stacey, what do you what do you have? What's your thing today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, I just got this. So this is a friend of mine recommended this to me because I've been having trouble sleeping.  It is snooze.  Let me guess it's spelled S N U Z.  S N O O Z. So close.  All right. Close. So it is a basically it's a white noise machine.  It has an actual fan inside. Does that matter?  I don't know. It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually would agree. I love sleeping to white noise.  And we have an electronic one that just plays a sound.  And then we have one that's an actual mechanical motion white noise.  And I totally know the difference.  Like, I appreciate the difference. So I'm right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is this is the sound of the snooze.  There is soft going on.  Stop snoozing.  And so the reason I bought it is because it's connected to the Internet.  Of course. I know.  Was I talking earlier about how all of our devices are going to be connected and how we shouldn't have all this stuff?  Yes. Slapped my hand.  I am. I am. I understand.  It is. But so, yes.  Yes. And all of the app, all the app does and you is just let you control it from your bed.  If it's not like right next to you on the table, you can just open your app and be like and dial it down your your watchman trigger.  I think you can also schedule stuff. Again, I literally just opened this before the show, so I haven't played with it yet.  But I'm very excited about it because so many people have told me so many good things. It's kind of pricey. I'm going to let you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what? How much is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, what? You want actual prices? What? That's crazy.  How much did I pay for this? I think I got mine on sale, but I think it's seventy nine dollars.  Oh, that's not. I was like, I think it's eighty dollars. So it's not cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not too bad. I actually I don't know. I don't know what what white noise machines cost these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's it's compact. I mean, this is like something if you like I could bring this to my hotel and I feel like it would be like here's here's my phone in case my head is not a good indicator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Phone and head for scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That helped me visualize it before I was struggling. I only had your hand and you know, everything's going in this like mesh cylindrical design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yes. So trendy right now. Good Lord. My goodness. They all look they all look messy and round or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I feel like what two years ago, everything was square with rounded edges and like LEDs.  Here's a good example of, you know, design from, you know, last year. Oh, yeah. Last year or two years ago this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh huh. Yep. My how far things have come from a squirreled to a circle.  All right. So, Danny, what you got? It says in here, Danny's stuff. So what's your stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll just give you a quick thing. You can maybe find it real quick if you Google or Google ads personal search filter.  They experimented with it about last week.  And the main thing was you could do a search and you got this little tab that came up that said personal.  And if you clicked on it and you had everything all linked together, it just let you search through things like your Gmail and stuff from regular Google.  We've had this before with Google search plus my world, but it looks like they're experimenting with making it possible for you to deliberately just look through the stuff you've stored on Google itself.  Now it's gone, but maybe it'll come back because it looks like they're experimenting.  So not really a tip you can do right now, but keep an eye out on it. Maybe it'll come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, find personal in the more drop down. Yeah. To jump into that. Nice.  That's it. All right. Excellent. That works for me. Mine's a quick one.  I didn't even know this existed until last night. We were doing an email on all about Android.  And there was a young budding programmer who wanted to know how to learn Kotlin.  Because if you remember Google I.O. Kotlin was a big deal to developers that were there.  And so if you're starting to want to get into developing for Android, the question is, you know, do you learn?  Do you go the traditional route or is it better to start off with Kotlin?  Because everyone seems to really think that Kotlin is a much easier direction to go for, you know, for programming for Android, for coding for Android.  So why not start there? And right now, Udemy is having a has cut the price of their Kotlin for beginners course.  It's learn programming with Kotlin. It's a six and a half hours of on demand video, a bunch of supplemental resources.  You know, search a certificate of completion if you need that certificate.  But it basically kind of walks you through the beginning process of Kotlin for beginners.  And normally it's ninety five bucks, but apparently it's on sale right now for like ten bucks.  And that's only going to be at that cost for the next two days.  So I was just thinking if you are thinking about getting into coding, you want to learn a little bit more about Kotlin.  Here's a great way to do it for next to nothing.  And it might be a good kind of beginner's course, good way to kind of kickstart your education around what Kotlin means.  And then the next time at Google I.O., they make some big announcement about Kotlin.  You can go crazy like all the developers did this last year. You can be part of the crowd.  So there you go. Learn Kotlin, Kotlin for beginners at Udemy, U-D-E-M-Y.  And you can do a search for the course there. But I think we've I think we've hit the end of this week in Google.  That was a lot of fun. I love the rabbit hole that we got there in the middle that we were we were on a roll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did we ever talk about what Danny got so upset about in the beginning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we did. OK, good. That was all that was all the HomePod stuff. So we definitely got to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, I was like I couldn't remember. I was like Danny got really excited about something. What was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got my excitement going. We covered all the bases. I think we did. I think we did a great job.
