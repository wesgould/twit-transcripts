Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hello. I was just reading, you probably, I don't know how you'd feel about this.  I was reading a blog post by a guy who left Silicon Valley to move to Austin about how awful Austin was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, is this the one on Insider?  Yeah, is this the one I made on?  I tried to read it, but I don't have a subscription.  And you know what? I get it. Austin is not for everyone.  He said it was really hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is hot. So hot.  And the water was expensive. He says, yeah, there's no state income tax,  but the property taxes and the water and the power are really expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Water, power, well, we have a city-owned utility.  Although, I will say my city-owned utility charged me more per kilowatt hour,  but it stayed up more often because there were tree lines,  or the city was in charge of trimming the trees,  whereas up here, no one's in charge.  That's why you had no power two weeks ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now, we have that problem here, which is PG&E, which is a for-profit utility,  has decided when the state gave them money to trim the trees to give it to their executives instead.  So the power lines run through tinder dry brush and trees.  And so that's why they turned the power off when there's windstorm or dry conditions.  They figure that's better to do than burn the state to the ground.  So there you go. There you have it.  I read it. It sounded kind of like a whiny blog post about Austin.  I didn't judge Austin.  And then I read the comments on the Hacker News about it, and everybody was mad at the guy.  So I just thought it was funny. I thought I'd bring it up.  Hi, Stacey. Good to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I left Austin, so...  Mostly because it was hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I was thinking. She moved to the Pacific Northwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that a raccoon on your shawl that you took before you left there?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's Daniel Boone's hat tail.  Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is my mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's cute. It's really... That looks so cozy.  She's wearing a beautiful gray shawl.  Is that a pashmina?  It looks like a pashmina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a wool wrap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A wool wrap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because pashmina wasn't enough. And it's actually brown, but yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's brown. Yeah, you look like a hobbit. Let's face it.  Also with us, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, the Leonard Tao professor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fashion critic, former employee of Conde Nast.  That's why I note the raccoon on her outfit.  You see, that's the way I think. That's the way I go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Leonard Tao professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark...  Craig Newmark!  ...graduate school of journalism at the City University of New York.  Hello, Jeff.  Hello, hello, hello.  And from Hands On Photography, Mr. Ant Pruitt, man of downtown Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello, Ant.  I'm laughing so hard because I'm just waiting on Ms. Stacey to reach through that camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unfortunately, I know it won't work, but Ant, I am with you. If I could just text you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If y'all were in the street, I'd love to be my punchline.  You guys behave, or we're going to play Nickelback.  Before the show began.  We were playing the Nickelback Shandy song, unless you're nice to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We were torturing Stacey with Shandy songs.  But Stacey, we can also torture Jeff Jarvis.  Because we can... go ahead, show Jeff's room.  We can add a little interloper into Jeff's room.  You see it there?  You have to go full screen on Jeff. Can you do that?  He can't.  Apparently we...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no!

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He disappeared!  Oh, there he is! He's teleporting in.  He's teleporting in.  Hi, Bernie.  We've set up a little folding chair for Bernie.  Is it my imagination, or did these memes burn out faster than usual?  The Shanties and the Bernies?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're still talking about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're still talking about the dad gum Shanty stuff.  But only because we're so not with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think everybody's sick of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ant and I are trying to move you on, but you're just sticking...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the Bernie one, you have it in the rundown, but there was an update.  If you go to the page where you can make your own Bernie meme,  turns out he ran through his API time like crazy.  9.8 million Bernie memes made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I bookmarked this when I could still use it.  He was merging the picture of Bernie at the inauguration  with Google Maps Street View of whatever address you put in.  So you could put Bernie anywhere.  And as you say, Jeff, 9.8 million memes were created,  but it was so expensive he had to shut the thing down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At the bottom he says, if you'd like what I do,  can you buy me a cup of coffee, please?  Nick, Nick Sonny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nick Sonny. Well done, Nick.  Very good.  Outstanding.  But again, the meme has run its course.  So what is that, Stacey?  You think a week is a normal five days?  When is a meme done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I am not Taylor Lorenz. I don't know.  I'm old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There are, I mean, for instance, the meme of the guy  with his girlfriend looking over his shoulder at another woman.  Oh, that's been going for years.  So that's a half life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like it's like it's like a nuclear waste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you could always for a well done meme,  you can always bring it back from the dead and pull it into timeliness.  Then it's nostalgia.  Right. I mean, I think the crying Michael Jordan face.  I've just been so bombarded by it.  It's like the equivalent of like when hot songs like the top 10 radio songs  of the summer, you know, when you had to listen to the radio.  Right. It was always playing, always playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Night Rangers, Sister Christian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now, by request from Bedminster, New Jersey,  we bring you Gloria by Laura Branigan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK, I can't do it. I don't want to do it.  Let's explain. Let's explain.  Stacey, you used to be a financial reporter.  Let's explain what the hell's going on with Reddit,  the Securities and Exchange Commission and GameStop.  By the way, not just GameStop.  Now Reddit's GameStop traders are are turning their attention to AMC stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's two AMCs and they're getting confused between the two of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is like my mom.  She gets confused between Best Buy and Bed Bath and Beyond  because their stock tickers are so simple.  So she'll be like, can you get me some sheets for Best Buy?  And I'm like, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this also is happening because of platforms like Robinhood,  which encourage because it's free, you know, commission free trading.  Yeah, but really they're making the money on the spread.  And people don't aren't sophisticated enough to know that you're getting a bad buy price  because they're making money on the spread.  But anyway, it's complicated.  But because that app is so popular with young people, you've got a whole generation of people like my son  who think it's possible to make a quick killing and are tempted to.  And actually some people did make a quick killing.  So we've got to explain this starting with in order to understand this,  you have to understand what shorting a stock is, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. OK. So when you short a stock, you're making a bet that it is going to go down in price.  So what you do is you usually borrow money.  You usually borrow money. You buy the stock at the higher price and then you're OK.  Hold on. Yes. You're sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've already screwed this up.  We said it was confusing.  I hate it. I hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're borrowing the stock, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're borrowing the stock. I'm sorry.  Yes. So the bet is it goes down in price.  So you borrow against the stock at the high price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then when it goes down, you pay it back at the low price and your profit is the spread.  Yeah. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. But if you bet, if you make that bet and the stock price goes up, you have to.  They do a margin call and you have to pay to stay in your short.  And that's real money you're paying out.  And that's what happened with the hedge funds.  And that's how they're being bankrupt because instead of the stock for GameStop falling,  it's going up and the hedge funds, they're being called on their margins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this is called this is called a squeeze.  So when you squeeze the shorts, I love the terminology.  When you squeeze the shorts, you force them to sell.  But when, of course, that pops up the stocks, the stock price goes up because the squeeze is going to buy more shares.  Oh, no, quick, quick, quick. Get out of the stock.  And it goes up. So and this has been called the squeeze of a lifetime.  The Reddit folks and this is a Reddit subreddit called Wall Street Bets, slash are slash Wall Street,  Spell out street bets.  And what the Reddit it was kind of a conspiracy to squeeze the shorts.  They said, oh, what we could do is is it's essentially it's a meme with real money behind it.  So these these guys basically squeeze the shorts, force the price up.  Some people probably made a lot of money, right?  If you weren't shorting it, if you were going long, in other words,  what most investors do, buying the stock, expecting it to go up, you would have you would have made some money.  The SEC, which is basically at this point going, well, what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you spell that? What the hell's going on?  What the hell's going on?  Reddit, the guy who was for a while, Joe, is that who it is?  He read it. Is he doing this? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I want to get you know who I want on the show or somewhere to talk about this.  I want Patrick Byrne, who is kind of gone crazy, but he is the former CEO at Overstock.  And remember how the Hedges came after him and he was squeezed by the short sellers.  He would be an excellent person to be talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Short sellers, I would be willing, I'm going to say, and you're right, this is what hedge funds use to hedge.  But in general, I think short sellers don't do anybody any favors.  Remember, for a long time, people were shorting Tesla.  And in order to kind of preserve their position, they would publish terrible stories.  They would downplay it. They'd go into forums and, oh, this Tesla is terrible, because they really wanted that stock to go down.  In fact, Tesla stock ended up doing very, very well.  And I'm sure they got squeezed mightily.  But for a long time, Elon Musk complained, look, we're doing fine.  All of these bad stories you read are from short sellers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, I will say I will say there is an argument for short selling in that, like, if you know something is if you really fundamentally believe, like, someone's making a stupid mistake and you can get that out there, then yes.  And so the rationale for short selling is that you believe that something is overvalued and you think that someone else is going to see that, too.  Now, the question, the lines get crossed when you start doing crazy stuff like calling your favorite friend at the Wall Street Journal and planting false rumors.  But I mean, there is some stocks that are trading too high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's legitimate. It also even it also I mean, it has a legitimate purpose in the ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, well, people resent it.  They think so. Somebody was saying they read it's manipulating the market.  I said people think that as they're short sellers are manipulating the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They are. So let me give you the chronology so that we can tell you what's going on.  You might assume if you just, you know, an unsophisticated person that a company that was made up of brick and mortar stores selling video games in malls might not have a glowing future.  Right. Right. They have five thousand stores.  People aren't going into stores anyway because of the pandemic.  Many of them are in malls that are shutting down.  And frankly, the video game industry is moving to downloadable content.  There's really no reason to buy a physical copy of a video game anymore.  So GameStop became popular with short sellers.  A lot of people took a bet that GameStop was going to go down.  So because a lot of hedge funds were in it and a lot of these people on the Reddit Wall Street Bets don't like these guys.  It does. Yeah.  And because an analyst at Bloomberg said that maybe GameStop, which isn't expected to even turn a profit till 2023, might be a good buy.  You made a what they call a bull case for GameStop.  And so for the last two years, I didn't realize it's been going that on that long.  This bullish case for GameStop been showing up on the sub Reddit and in bubbling up.  I'm reading from a Vox, by the way, really good Vox story.  If you want to kind of understand how how this happened, Emily Stewart did a good kind of explanation of of all of this.  So as Reddit and retail traders started to take notice of GameStop, they also noticed and I guess you could figure this out how heavily shorted the stock was.  And they figured out and this is where you get in trouble if they all acted in concert.  That's the key. Right. And no individual buyer is going to have enough clout unless you're Warren Buffett to move the market.  But if everybody on Reddit said, hey, guys, this is exactly what happened with storming the capital, except it's storming the stock market.  Orcon straighted event. Yeah. Hey, guys, Wall Street.  If we could screw the shorts and make a profit, that might be a pretty good thing.  So this started about four months ago.  There was a post bankrupting into institutional investors for dummies featuring GameStop.  The GameStop stock price went from twenty dollars to one hundred and forty eight dollars.  There's more than seven hundred percent growth.  Now, of course, there's a lot of zigs in that zag.  And that's the Redditors who are buying it, selling it, buying it, selling it.  Redditors are pissed off also because several times during this process trading was halted.  And it's their contention. They halt trading to protect the hedge fund guys.  Right. They don't they don't care about individual investors.  They don't care about us making money off of these guys.  Bad short bets. But they are going to protect the hedge fund guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, maybe you don't want to piss off a Redditor even worse.  Yeah, that's probably that's probably the case.  It's like pissing off a bunch of crypto boys. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. A short seller named Andrew left who works for Citron Research announced on Twitter  they'd be hosting a live stream laying out the case for shorting GameStop and saying anybody buying the stock at this point is our suckers.  They say it's going to go back to 20. Don't worry.  Immediately, there were attempts to hack his Twitter account.  And now he said, I'm not going to comment on GameStop because of the angry mob that has formed against me.  Complained that he'd quote, never seen such an exchange of ideas of people so angry about someone joining the other side of the trade.  So basically, because of places like Robin Hood, where a large number of people at no cost in effect, at least no commission cost to them, can trade stocks.  And because of sites like Reddit, where people were able to act in concert, they squeezed the hell out of the shorts.  And in the process, some people probably made money.  Now, some people probably also lost money.  One of the things that's important to understand about the stock market, and I don't know if everybody gets this, it's a zero sum game.  For every dollar you make, somebody is losing a dollar.  The only time that's not true is when there's a new issue.  A company sells stock. They get a lot of money. You're giving them money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not totally true, Leo.  Where is it when the whole market goes up?  Yeah, I was like, if I sell my stock at 15, for example, I have made, well, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a zero sum game because somebody bought your stock at that price.  Right.  So that dollar that you made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Overall, the market tends to go up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's the one thing that probably just changed that a little bit.  So it's not a zero sum game.  It's not.  So the total value goes up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I bought it at five, it went up and we're ignoring the time value of money because we're not doing those calculations.  But I bought it at five, I sell it at 15.  You made 10 bucks.  I've made 10 dollars.  Someone else buys it at 15. As long as that stock keeps going up, they're fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I hate to tell everybody because we've been in such a bull market for so long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What goes up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eventually, it stops going up.  So this is why here's Stacey's free investment advice.  Always put a set of like, find some money, your money, allocate a certain percentage, even if it's like 50 bucks a month, allocate that, buy mutual funds.  Don't try to chase individual stocks.  It's stupid.  And just let it go forever for as long as you can.  And you will have great months.  You will have bad years.  But eventually it should even out and go up.  Dollar cost averaging.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dollar cost averaging.  But you can say that about some certain stocks too.  I mean, they all have their moments of peaks and valleys.  Just sit on it.  If you chase the peaks, you're going to find the valleys too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm saying something different, Stacey, which is invest in the stock and hold it for the long term.  Right, Ant?  Oh, no, no, don't do that.  That's not a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want to get in the business of investment advice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's basically my philosophy that anybody who's giving me investment advice, if they're not already a billionaire, I'm not going to take it.  Because if you're that smart, why the hell are you telling me?  Guess who's not a billionaire over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why such a high standard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  100 millionaires.  In other words, if you're still working for a living, you haven't figured out the stock market.  Right.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Keep going with the tale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The real point of this is the value of the GameStop stock, whether 20 or 142, had nothing to do with the inherent value of GameStop.  It was really all about this thing that was going on and it was being propped up or went up and down.  You probably could say that the long term prospects for GameStop aren't that good.  I don't know.  I'm not an expert.  That seems like a fair guess.  But that has nothing to do with the 700% run up in the value.  Today it's closed at $348, up 135% from Tuesday's close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Market cap of $24 billion.  The stock traded as high as $380 today.  So it's not ended.  That's the hysterical thing.  So let's say I have a thousand shares on short.  I can get out.  I'm going to pay money.  But it's a question of when I choose to get out.  Right.  Or am I squoze forever?  I can just say, OK.  You get out and you lock in a loss.  Yeah, you get out and you lock in a loss.  Why does it keep going up then?  If people are saying, OK, I see the game.  Screw it.  I'm getting out.  Because not everybody gets out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because not everybody gets out.  So what also brings up the price is these short sellers as it goes up and up and up.  They go, oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, oh crap.  And if they all got out at a price, then it'd be over.  And then there's also momentum because people see the price going up.  And now you get long buyers saying, oh, GameStop must be a great stock.  And that's the warning I want to give people.  OK, it's not a perfect zero sum game.  But if you don't be a chump, don't be a chump.  And I like to show this.  This is legalized gambling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  So let me ask one more double question.  So now the stock is at three forty eight.  Geez.  Logic would say that there's no logic in Reddit or the Internet.  Logic would say now is the time to short the stock.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Except that it will go up.  Here's the problem.  Here's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's the problem.  Your margin can get called.  So when you go short, you can't just go short and sit.  If you go put money down.  Yeah.  At some point, your margin gets called and you have to you could lose a ton because you're not only is it short, it's generally leveraged.  Right, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, it's so you're that's why it's so scary.  So your margin.  Yeah, you have to put in more money.  And once you've done that, you're also you're you're basically losing more than you thought because you've also borrowed against it.  So you got to pay that back and then pay the continuing squeeze, the continuing spread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you know, you can't just say, I'm going to I think it's it's really overvalued at 300 bucks.  So I'm going to I'm going to go short and buy a ton of shares.  At some point, it might continue to go up and you will get you'll have to pay the piper.  You can't just sit on it.  You'll have to you'll have to pay.  What was that called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That guy from Homeland was in it.  Billions. No succession.  Yeah, yeah. Billions.  There's a whole plot line around a short.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can actually get a lot of learn a lot about finance from watching billions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Bank of America just raised its price target to ten dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So they're doing that because they think they have a good plan.  So here's the thing.  I think this is the thing that makes professionals cuckoo is that you have all of these young people who don't really understand what's going on.  Buying the stock.  And that's why it's very now it's gotten really unpredictable because of I don't know if it's they don't understand what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they're just saying F you know, well, maybe let me put it another way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  When you play chess and you're a good player and you're playing another good player, you have certain expectations.  You kind of know how to play that person.  It's actually sometimes hard for a very good player to play a terrible player because they do completely stupid things.  Exactly.  They are not prepared for.  Same with poker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Poker is actually poker is a better analogy.  It's a lot easier to play poker against good poker players than it is against a fish who has you know, you don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Stacey's added in something else here, which is which is righteous anger.  Yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I'm saying that in other words, all of these new people coming into the market are unpredictable because they're not acting.  In a way that a normal trader thinks is rational.  And that includes revenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think I think the difference here is normal traders never pay attention to retail investors because they don't have to write.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  That's right.  Institutional traders.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Well said.  And so what this is, they have created.  Yeah.  I mean, they just they don't exist.  So what's happened here is they have given the power to.  Oh, it's like mass media.  They've given the power to the masses to actually hedge funds have to pay attention.  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, where stock markets started was individual, you know, in the Hudson's Bay Company.  Yeah.  An individual could buy shares.  Didn't take long before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ruined by technology.  Yeah, it didn't take long before institutional traders in 1789 ruined the whole thing.  So this is actually a really good point.  But from this Vox article, the GameStop episode is a mix of factors, both serious and silly part retail traders demonstrating actual power in the market.  To your point, Stacy part, accepting that some of this is makes no sense.  To my point, whether GameStop took off because it's a meme stock, a stock which in which interest is as much cultural or social as it is financial or because it's possible.  It's possible.  There is something in the business case that's unclear.  There is a business case.  There is a cultural interest.  The balance between the two and driving the price.  It's unknown.  It's indeterminate.  Part of it might basically be a joke.  What is clear is a lot of what's happening with the stock now is not because there's a potential turnaround.  It's merely because the trade went viral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if and here's a craziness GameStop somehow got their hands on a container full of graphics cards and they're going to put them on the market?  And you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If anybody would know that, it'd be it'd be Reddit, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. So then their valuation would be totally assured.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And that's the answer to your question, Jeff.  How come this stock keeps going up?  You know what it is?  In some ways, it's the financial market version of QAnon of conspiracy theories.  And this kind of viral spread of information and misinformation and the very difficult job of prying one from the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think there's any actual information.  We don't know. There might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what Emily's saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bank of America actually raised the price because they said they actually have a good business plan.  Yeah, but 10 bucks is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bank of America is doing this as a salve as a salve to some of its big investors.  That's all it is.  It's like, oh, we still want to be parts of your deals.  We still want your relationships.  We're not crazy.  We're not going to say 348.  But, you know, if I can cut your losses a little and give you 10 bucks, I will.  That is all that is.  And call me cynical, but it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should also point out that the stock had sold it two weeks ago.  I'm happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, some.  That's the point.  And as with any pyramid scheme, the earlier you get in, the more money you make.  And while I'm in school here.  In that respect, it is a zero sum game.  I mean, you know, that's the problem.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  While we're in dummy school here, I always get confused between call and put.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Financial reporter Stacey Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, man, I got to look that up again.  See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Confuses everybody, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Call gives you the option to buy a stock and a put gives you the option to sell a stock.  Right.  Don't ask me about callers because I will.  I will come out there, Jeff, and yell at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Honestly, with bull and bear always if you don't know the difference in call and put, you should probably not be buying stock on Robin Hood and Weeble and all these others.  Oh, yeah.  Which, interestingly, now are way higher up in the rankings in the app stores.  People are jumping on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now explain Robin Hood and how that why that fuels this.  You started before but finished that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Robin Hood has got a lot of people into trading, especially young people with the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Email was to spam because of the post office.  That's what Robin Hood is to trade.  Yeah, it's free.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK, Leo, it isn't really free because you have to spend money to buy the stock, but you don't pay a commission.  The thing is, and the thing that people don't understand is that Robin Hood makes a lot of money without charging commission.  And the way they do it is in effect by giving you a bad price for the stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it is not terribly bad.  It's just a little bit bad, but scale it adds up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You would if you should probably before you use Robin Hood, you should probably compare the price, the buy the price that you're buying or selling with some other places.  Just to make sure a broker you're getting.  Yeah, regular guy who charges commission or the problem is now because of the success of Robin Hood, all of Schwab and E-Trade and all these are starting to follow suit.  But so you have to kind of learn about what the spread is, which is the difference between the price you're paying for it and the price the person buying is paying for it.  And the bigger that spread, the more money Robin Hood is making and the less money you're making.  So it's complicated.  Do we see this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I understand more about this.  Michael Lewis's Flash Boys is a great book.  Highly recommend it.  It talks about the value of a millisecond in trades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The whole story starts out there building a fiber optic connection between Chicago and New York that is as straight as possible because if there's even one bend in it that slows the light down.  And that's how time because if you can get a millisecond ahead of the trade that happened in Chicago and take advantage of it in New York, you can make money.  But you have but it's that tight.  And that's the it's what caused those flash mobs, those flash selling.  Remember, there were some big crashes because all of these automated has to be automated.  Human can't do it.  So these automated trading systems are very, very valid.  And can be very, very volatile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why the finances, financial markets and banks are such big spenders on cloud computing and the latest in networking.  Right.  Just to bring this all back to technology.  Yeah.  Well, so it was this was a good segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The same thing about this whole network effect about two weeks ago, I believe, with Bitcoin, Litecoin and all the other cryptocurrency just sort of taking a huge spike.  Everyone could jump in and get a piece of Bitcoin going through the likes of what you call PayPal and just put a couple of bucks there.  And people were thinking they had Bitcoin when they pretty much didn't have Bitcoin because it wasn't thirteen thousand dollars.  I lost a hundred dollars of Bitcoin since then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, there are a couple of those.  Of course, there's the Wolf of Wall Street where Margot Robbie explains shorts, which is really a great moment in that movie.  There's the Big Short itself, which was an excellent film about five years ago, which is based on actually Michael Lewis's earlier book, The Big Short, which is a very good book.  That's the one that got him started.  I think he I love what was the one might because Michael Lewis was a trader money.  No, no, no, no, no.  It's before Moneyball.  It was the one where he's talking about the big swinging DS.  Yeah.  Liars, liars, poker, maybe.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He is a very he's an excellent journalist storyteller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He really has worked in the industry.  So yes, he knows where he's where he speaks.  Liars, poker, his first book was about his own experience in in financial markets.  But also the Big Short is great.  Moneyball is great.  That's about baseball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Liars, Poker was his first book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, Liars, Poker was great.  First notable book.  If you want to kind of insight into what it was like to work in the 1980s and 90s in Wall Street, it's really hysterical.  Very, very good book and very I don't pretend to understand any of this, by the way.  And you can you don't have to email me or complain on Twitter about our we've done a good job.  I think I don't know anything.  Yeah, because I don't know anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So don't don't take my word for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I guarantee you there are people listening going you guys don't know.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just I just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that happens a lot in the financial markets because they're like, you don't believe the same things we do.  You look at it differently.  You're so naive.  And you're like, yeah, am I or am I just smart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's where it really it reminds me so much of I make the deposit and leave it just and be at peace with it.  I'm not as stressed out as you folks are about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It reminds me so much of QAnon and conspiracy theories in general.  And because a lot of it is belief and and faith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, stop.  Stop. OK, that's not true.  There are fundamental values.  But what it is is gaslighting.  It's like, yeah, oh, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it lends itself so well to the modern mean gaslighting like financial gaslighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Believe me, I have I've had had many a trader argue with me on things.  But yeah, so it's not a conspiracy theory, though, because there is.  There is actually fundamental value in most of these stocks and issuances, and maybe it's not where it's at.  And there's always the I think there if we really want to get into this, I think there's some really interesting things coming.  One intangibles like I.P. are becoming much more important in valuations.  Right. And we don't really know how to value an intangible because it's not a hard asset.  Right. Two, I think we've been optimizing for decades for profit margins and efficiency.  And we need to start thinking about resiliency.  And I actually tweeted this recently, but this was in response to Intel's.  There are some activist hedge funds coming after Intel.  And one of the issues is they want them to.  Intel makes a lot of their own chips, not all, but most.  And they have they need to invest in manufacturing still.  And the argument is, let's not do that.  Just go to TSMC and T Taiwan Semiconductor.  Yeah, I was like, TSMC. Is that it? Yes.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation.  And, you know, Intel, you don't need to be in the business of making this.  And they're like, well, it's part of national security.  I don't know if we want to go get on the national security horse, but there is something to be said about auto chip makers right now.  Auto companies can't buy chips from TSMC right now because other companies have ordered them.  So there's there's something about resiliency and having, you know, a little bit more slack in your supply chain that probably makes it very important for Intel to have their own manufacturing and not outsource all of that.  The point here is that Wall Street thinks in terms of efficiencies and eking out profit margins.  And I don't think that fits in today's world. That was a really long thing.  But since we're talking about financial value and Wall Street and conspiracy theories, I figured I'd throw that in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, we could we could go on and on.  And Stacey will know about honestly, there's real structural issues in general in our financial markets, in the intersection between our financial markets and our politics.  I mean, and it's and the problem is where there's a lot of money to be made.  You can never trust people's motivations.  Integrity goes out the window sometimes if there's indeed a lot of money in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any any system that can be gamed will be game.  Yeah, that's the fundamental law of life.  The markets prove it. The Internet proves it. It's being gamed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's actually perfect synopsis. That's exactly right.  I first learned that when my friend Kevin Rose was running Dig, which was a great idea, brilliant idea, brought to its knees and eventually dismantled by gamers, by people gaming the algo.  Yeah. Yeah. And our friend Matt Cutts, that was his full time job for years was block effectively blocking gamers from the fundamental mistake that the platform is all made was not doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially Google did it better because they were dealing with information, not people.  They had Matt Cutts, who was brilliant.  Hi, Matt. They, you know, they they dealt with spam and things like that when you don't with people gaming people.  That's the problem with Facebook and Twitter. It's just much sicker in some ways.  And they were I put myself in this boat. I was too optimistic.  And and and certainly the founders of these companies were and they didn't build in enough systems to detect and counteract the gaming.  They thought there was such a thing as neutrality. You can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the beauty of people is we'll work around. I mean, they'll get away.  We're like ants. We're the worst, the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're awful. We're awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem is not me, by the way. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so if you think about sorry, not not you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're kind of the little sugar spill and you put something in front of them.  They will they will find a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And if I were if I were the kind of person that wanted to build giant edifices of conjecture and and cause and effect, I would say that's because ants in effect work like networks.  They they that's precise. They're not individuals.  They are they act in concert.  And so they're very able to get around things, flow around things like water.  An individual might be stymied by that barrier, but they signal to one another.  They're very clever. I you know, it's so hard for me not to despair and just say humans are awful.  Anything with a critical mass of humans is going to go downhill.  But at the same time as we ask, it's not it's not false.  It's true. But at the same time as we're awful, we're amazing.  We create amazing works of art.  I mean, we went to the moon.  I mean, we're amazing.  We're both at the same time.  We are such a contradiction.  We have choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the whole point is that we have choices and it's not all of life hasn't gone to hell in a handbasket.  All of life is not utopia.  At every turn, we have choices to make and we need to make those choices informed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my God. We're back at the Garden of Eden.  Holy mackerel.  We have now discovered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I could argue against that because I don't know if we do have choices.  Or maybe we make all choices simultaneously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry. I feel like you should be saying we have the ability to make choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes. Whether we actually do that effectively is another matter.  And I think part of the fine though, that's another argument, long time argument about free will versus determinism.  Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You believe you believe this week we have free will.  Maybe maybe we don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This week in Calvin, who was that sponsor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do. Anyway, thank you for indulging our conversation.  But I find it fascinating this whole GameStop thing.  And now it's happening in AMC.  And now that these people have felt their oats, these this Reddit sub Reddit and others, I expect to see more more of this kind of behavior.  Can you will there be a healing function?  You know, a lot of times when you get these, you know, they always they always talk about not marching in lockstep across a bridge because the resonance of all your footfalls will actually break the bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to break. Don't say that to me. Don't say that to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That scares me. You have to break step.  Is there some sort of I don't think it's the SEC.  I think if SEC just went, what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's nothing. There's nothing illegal about this. Right.  What Reddit did. It's all public.  There's no insider information. Right.  Is there anything possibly illegal?  This is not illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is actually how marketing works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is pump and dump is illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pumping and dumping. And there is a manipulation through like sending people seeding false information about short sellers, because that's what Patrick Byrne was so upset about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.  But it sounds like they just towed the line in that Reddit group. Right.  They dig right up to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not dumping. They're just pumping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  I should warn you that there is a risk that a guy on Twitter who started posting in 2016 is real name.  He posted under the name Ricky Vaughn.  You might have seen his tweets.  His real name Douglas Mackey of West Palm Beach, Florida, is has been indicted by the Department of Justice for conspiring with others to spread election misinformation, not stock misinformation, but election misinformation designed to deprive individuals of their constitutional rights.  He's been charged with violating the civil rights conspiracy statute.  The penalties for that could be up to 10 years in prison.  So I think that there are.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the legal argument there is related to voting rights, not related to anything regarding stock.  Understand.  Or peddling this information.  I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it's probably a civil.  I don't know what pump and dump.  Is that a civil or criminal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pump and dump is civil and pump it up.  It actually doesn't have anything to do with short sellers necessarily pump and dump is anytime you pump up.  It's usually with OTC stocks.  It's when you give false information and you talk up a stock and then you so that you can sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can get a higher price and sell it.  Right.  So the pump is you pump up the price.  The dump is you sell it as soon as that price goes up.  It's a form of fraud.  And it's been absolutely used to be a lot harder to do.  But now thanks to social media, it's a lot easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And those kind of things were why we had, you know, we have state.  Most states have regulations and the SEC has regulations, although they are being dismantled by the venture capital industry, believe it or not, against common people and common people.  It's unsophisticated investors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what that's what the Wolf of Wall Street went to jail for.  In fact, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And when I used to work at a I worked at a local business journal and you would actually see companies created go on the OTC market and pitch their pitch their stocks.  Now, those were public.  So you anyone could buy them.  You didn't have to be sophisticated, but you can also see how it would be very easy for someone to go, you know, go to a bunch of old people and pitch this great like, hey, I'm going to do a covid testing.  And then we're going to go public.  So I just need you to invest, you know, ten thousand today.  And, you know, you've got your file.  You've got your papers for incorporation.  You've got all this.  And then people give you the money and then you just run.  And that's that's why Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, don't don't get me.  I've been I've been pumped many times and then dumped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm supposed to get a briefcase.  I ordered two years ago this week.  Oh, Lord.  Specter Gadget.  Take it where?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Every time I do that and I, you know, I get the I get like a package two years later.  What is this?  Oh, God, I definitely remember ordering this.  And then it turns out it's like made of plastic.  It's like you feel so stupid.  Yes.  Stupid. I fall for that stuff all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so so wait, wait, wait, wait, Leo, Leo, Leo.  You know, one of my one of my sports on the show is to get you to buy something.  Occasionally, can you buy a one share short on GameStop and just see how it plays out today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't do that. Don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Please don't discuss this on air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How do you know I have it already?  No, I don't. I don't buy individual stocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He doesn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. For a variety of reasons.  Wasn't there some sort of penny stock story?  I don't know if it was in our.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's talk about Google.  Run down.  No, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I want to talk about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he's not.  Nothing good comes from any stocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nothing good.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I felt like I read something in the news recently, but I will.  I'll stop. We'll stop right here.  Yes.  Let's mention you have a quibi.  Let's let's mention one of our fine sponsors.  What do you think? How about that?  I love this is one that you will really appreciate.  This is one everybody should know about.  And one I can say I've been using for a long time.  Privacy.com. Have we talked about privacy on the show?  So here's the idea of privacy.com.  Create a credit card that there's two ways you can do it.  That can only be used once.  It's a burner or I do.  This is what I do all the time.  Locks to an individual merchant.  This is so cool.  A lot of companies used to offer this.  A number of credit card companies used to do this.  They stopped most of them for some reason.  I'm not sure why, but this idea of a single use credit card is something I use on the internet almost exclusively at privacy.com slash.  Twig privacy.com is named privacy though because it's more than just protecting you from fraud.  You know, misuse of your credit cards.  It also keeps your personal information, your bank information from the retailer.  So and it's a great way to you know, how many times have you bought a subscription online, you know, recurring charge, and then you forget and it goes on for years and blah, blah, blah.  With privacy, if you use a privacy.com card, you can pause the card.  You don't have to figure out how to cancel something.  You just pause the card and it can't be charged.  Furthermore, with privacy, you will automatically get notified about any declines.  So if somebody tries to misuse your card, you'll find out.  If somebody tries to charge a card that you pause, you'll find out.  You can set limits.  You can say this card can only be used for $50 a month for a year or whatever.  So it's never you'll never get overcharged.  You'll never get charged twice or upgraded to another service without your consent.  You know, and if you subscribe, you know, I wish I'd done this.  I subscribed to a gym a couple of years ago, went in, officially canceled my membership, didn't pay attention.  They continue to charge my credit card for six months.  When I finally contact the credit card, they said we can only reverse charges for three months and we have to investigate it.  It was very frustrating.  Next time I'll use privacy.  I don't know why I didn't.  And then you don't have to jump through customer service hoops.  You just block the charges and they'll notify you anytime that somebody tries to charge over the allotted amount.  You'll always stay within your budget.  There's a Chrome or Firefox extension so you can instantly create a new card and fill it in with one click.  Privacy doesn't require that to use the charge.  The merchant is great.  So when I charge at Amazon or Audible or I can go on and on, Nest, all of those are using single merchant privacy cards.  So no one can steal that card number and use it anywhere else.  I love that.  It's really easy to safely share a card with a friend, a family member or co-worker.  I wanted to buy my mom dinner.  So I set up a door dash account using a privacy dot com card so that I was able to share it through privacy.  So there was no risk of you don't have to email it or text it to her.  It was very easy.  No screenshots, copy or paste.  I shared the card.  There's a button on it and you give it give my mom's email address and it's done.  They handle the rest.  They give complete reporting, which is great.  You get an account summary.  So it's easy for you to track how much you've been spending this month.  There's now a new summary page for budgeting.  You could filter by date, see how much you've spent in a month.  No guessing where your money's going.  I just go on and on.  I've been using privacy for several years now and it's the only card I use when I buy online.  It's just so convenient, so easy.  Just so you know, it isn't a charge card.  You can't build up a...  And actually to me, that's a benefit.  I can't build up a balance.  It comes right out of my bank account.  You can attach it to a debit card or bank account.  But there's no temptation there for me to overspend.  I really, I actually really like that.  I can just go on and on.  It's just, it's been a lifesaver for me and I think you're going to love it.  Protect your financial identity.  Keep, you know, don't give out your real credit card numbers.  Use virtual cards.  Privacy.com slash twig.  Sign up for a new account and you'll automatically get $5 to spend in your first purchase.  It's not a lot, but it's a little thank you from us and an encouragement to use that special card.  An encouragement to use that special address because then they know you saw it here.  Privacy.com slash twig.  This is just a no brainer.  Use virtual numbers.  Mask your bank information.  Keep yourself private and secure.  A great way to start the new year.  A little digital hygiene.  Privacy.com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support.  This week in Google and we thank you for supporting us by going to privacy.com slash twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, are you old enough to remember the charge plate as opposed to a charge card?  Yeah, they call it a plate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember I'd go to Macy's and it was a funny shape and they put it in the machine.  You do?  Ant?  Well, before that day they would.  Oh, I remember, yeah, I remember the thing that they would, the jujube.  And they called it a plate.  Yeah, we used to actually sell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It had notches in it.  Yeah, when I worked at the grocery store when our power went out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we used to have one notch.  Oh, then power went out.  It was a metal plate, like an addressograph plate.  Yeah, that's what it was.  Your name and number, account number.  Was raised.  The boss on it.  Was it raised?  Yeah.  It was raised and so the carbon paper, I have to explain that to you kids what carbon paper is.  The carbon paper would come down and make the impression on the paper, which is how they would bill you later on a paper receipt.  Are you old explaining this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ant and I both know this.  I am, I am. I'm old explaining this.  I know all about that.  What? Yeah, I used to use them when the power went down at the grocery store where I worked there.  Wow.  So stop old explaining then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought they were long gone by the time you, Nick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My mother used to be a buyer for a retailer there in Carolinas and so I saw all of that stuff and dealing with her and her job.  So yeah, I remember that stuff, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I got a new kind of explaining.  So you see this when you're watching the NFL all the time or I saw it a lot at the inauguration where people wear their mask below their nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's pointless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a new kind of instead of it's the new it's the new man spreading.  It's called mask spreading.  I am now mask spreading.  All right.  New term.  I just.  What's next?  Yeah.  Stacy wants to talk about Google.  Google announces plans to tackle privacy issues and online advertising.  What it really means is that Google is like Facebook terrified by the new IDFA rules on the iPhone.  The new privacy rules are really given it.  It's there's estimates like it's costing Facebook like 15 million a month or something.  So Google is trying to figure out a way to in fact I think they're going to do it.  They've announced they're not going to use the IDFA, the ID for advertisers from Apple, because if they do use it, they have to pop up a thing on the iPhone that says, hey, we would like to use this to track you and give users a chance to turn it off.  Of course, they know people are going to just say, you're right.  I don't want that.  Turn it off.  So Google has been working very hard to figure out a way around it.  They've decided not to use IDFA, so they don't have to do that announcement.  They're there.  Basically, their plan is to create a new way of tracking you.  They're not going to call it that.  They say privacy first.  So this is from the Guardian, Google's new plan to tackle privacy issues.  I just wanted you to have that background.  Maybe I'm a cynic.  In online advertising.  I know this isn't the same, but what about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It makes me think of the whole GDPR when it started up a couple years back.  I look at what has it given to us as consumers nowadays other than that annoying pop-up that people don't read and just hit accept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I think it empowers users, in this case on the iPhone.  You don't use an iPhone, Ant, so you don't see this.  I'm one of the smart ones.  Kidding.  When you look at apps in the app store, it looks like a nutrition label, a privacy label, that tells you.  You certainly are aware of the fact that there has been an exodus away from WhatsApp and signals going through the roof.  That is exactly because of Apple's new privacy policy.  That and the fact that WhatsApp felt obligated to say, and by the way, which we've always done, we're going to share this information with Facebook.  But the thing is, it's now explicit.  People are going, what?  I don't know why they're surprised.  What?  You're sharing my information with Facebook?  They're going to somewhere else, like Signal.  Signal's gone through the roof.  Telegram's gone through the roof.  If you ask me what's the impact, I just have to point to that by itself.  That's just one of many.  Fair.  Google has been avoiding this by not updating their apps.  We talked about this before since the middle of December.  They did say initially, oh, we're going to do it.  But they have announced a plan to, as the Guardian puts it, chart a middle ground between Apple's privacy first approach and the needs of advertisers.  Let me explain what Google's trying to do.  They will use AI.  This is actually kind of what Apple's already doing.  Apple calls it differential privacy.  They'll use AI to bundle your information, individual information, with similar people in an attempt to convince users they don't need to block all tracking on the Internet to preserve their privacy.  It's going to use a, and the Guardian puts this in quotes, trusted server to store advertisements without needing to connect to hundreds of providers across the wider web.  That is a problem.  In fact, advertisers often ask us, because we have some banner ads on our website, if they can serve them.  We always say no for that very reason.  Because in effect, if a third party is serving an ad on a website, that third party has access to everybody who goes to that website, sees who it is.  Google's going to use a central server.  They're also going to use crypto to ensure that advertisers only find the information they need to pay websites.  We believe, this is Chetna Bindra, Google's head of user trust and privacy for advertising.  That's got to be a tough job.  Chetna says, we believe the notion that it's privacy or it's advertising is a false choice.  We really do believe there's a way to meet user expectations and protect their identity while allowing for ad-supported content.  I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So relate this, if you would, to the post-cookie Google sandbox.  It's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the same exact thing.  Google says it's going to start experimenting in Chrome with how to do that.  A new privacy sandbox bundles together five proposals with bird-themed code names.  My favorite is Flock.  Who do you think they are, Twitter?  My favorite is Flock.  F-L-O-C.  Federated Learning of Cohorts.  Fledge, which is first locally executed decisions over groups.  And Turtledove, which is not an acronym.  Two uncorrelated requests, then locally executed decision on victory.  Oh, it is! Sort of.  Yes, it is.  Two uncorrelated requests, then locally executed turtle, decision on victory.  Dove, no E.  These are all designed, in effect, to separate the user's identity with the user's information.  And they think it's preferable to Apple's system, which is just say you can't track them.  Publishers are freaking out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's because Google has to make money on ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, well this is Google's business. This is how they make money, period.  Yeah.  Well, and the publishers, too, are freaking out.  Why are publishers freaking out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because a lot of them basically aren't doing very well at selling their own ads.  They've never done well at getting first-party data.  So they depended upon these networks that required third-party,  and they had to produce cookies to serve to these sellers.  And they never got their act together to create first-party.  So they're going to see a fall in value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have to say, for people like Stacey and others who've advocated regulating,  there should be some nice governmental solution that would make this all work out.  This is a good argument for the power of regulation,  because they're only doing this because of EU GDPR, the investigations from the Federal Trade Commission.  This is them and Congress.  This is them saying, well, maybe if we do this, everybody will be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the publishers said regulate them, and then they regulate them,  and then there's unintended consequences.  So what happens, too, is that there was a Guardian story not long ago  that regulators looking into Google getting rid of cookies.  Well, you told them to get rid of cookies, and cookies were evil, so they get rid of cookies,  and then what are you doing getting rid of cookies? You have too much power.  It's the old can't win, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, Google did say publishers may see, we'll see,  a palpable impact on their Google ad revenue on iOS once this happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Regulatory capture again. Google can afford this.  They can do whatever they want.  You want us to re-regulate how all of advertising works? Okay, we'll do that.  And we're going to end up stronger than we were before.  It's the way all of these things, GDPR, all of these things have made the platforms stronger in the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Alison Schiff writing at adexchanger.com says Facebook could take a multi-billion dollar revenue hit  from Apple's IDFA changes, as much as 7% of total revenue in quarter two.  Actually, she's quoting a consultant, Eric Sufert, of Mobile Dev Memo.  That'd be about $5 billion based on the current revenue.  Okay.  That's significant.  So, Ant, to answer your question, this is more than a cookie checkbox.  This is a big deal.  It changes the architecture.  You think in a bad way, Jeff, do you think it's going to harm publishers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, no, I know it's going to harm publishers, yes.  Well, what will be the unintended consequences?  Well, because they don't have the data. Google has the data.  They don't have the data, and they can't share it.  They never have had the data, though, right?  Because they were in networks of third-party data.  So when you demonize third-party data and you never had your own strategy  to get first-party data, you're screwed.  Now, I'm not saying that that's necessarily a bad thing,  because the publishers should have.  I've argued to them for 10 years now that they should have created the means  to get their own first-party data by creating things that were customized  for users rather than just a mass.  But they refused to do it.  They absolutely refused. They just didn't know how to do it.  And so they're dependent upon programmatic networks.  One of the pioneers of programmatic was at an event that I had at my school,  and this person scolded the publishers in the room and said,  why the hell are you on programmatic?  You're commodifying yourself.  There's no value to your environment. There's no value to your brand.  You're just putting your stuff out there as a commodity.  And they said, we got to. We got nothing else, basically.  And plus, that's where the advertisers are.  So the publishers could have, 20 years ago, built better strategies,  and then this wouldn't be an issue for them.  It's an issue for them because they didn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This stuff was also a move in target, too, back in the day.  So we can't really say they planned it poorly.  It's a move in target. You really know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'll disagree to this extent.  You're right, Ant, when it comes to understanding,  putting your finger to the wind and predicting where the ad technology was going to go.  But in terms of a basic strategy of saying, if I know my users  and I have a direct relationship with my users  and I serve them in a high value way through knowing them,  then they would have been set up properly.  They would have been ready to buff it through lots of storms.  But they didn't.  They just said, we got all this inventory. We can't sell it.  Let's fire the salespeople. We'll put it up on programmatic.  Did they really have a choice now looking back then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Looking back, did they have a choice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, yes, they absolutely did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If they had started then to build these platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. The New York Times did that because it's the New York Effing Times.  So the New York Times built its food app and food business just for this reason.  So they know you're a foodie and they can sell you high value things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just started that like two years ago.  And then the New York. Well, I think actually longer than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're the New York Effing Times. So they can do that kind of thing.  They have the money development. They have the brand.  They can convert. You know, they can do all that.  But but yeah, newspaper companies could have done this.  They could have done it locally. What town do you live?  I try the hell I went through to try to get newsrooms to merely geo tag content with a town or county, even a county, just geo tag it.  So we can serve it to people based on where they're coming in from.  Or I wanted to set it up so that you would have your own little feed and I'll tell you where I live and where I work.  I will give you a feed. I could not get a single newsroom in my company or other companies ever to do that.  They just make one product for everybody and they want to find new ways to pay for old ways to do the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right. So let's let's talk about the present because it's too late now for that.  I know I do my grandpa moment. What do you what do you think?  At least it sounds like Google's trying. So Apple has been and honestly, I support Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Apple finds fun ways to kill the ad business because it's not in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not in it. It's not in it. And there are going to be consequences to this.  Google's trying to have, you know, do the best it can, balancing the interests of advertisers and the requirements from Apple and the interest.  Let's point out from its customers in privacy.  Do you do what do you think of Google's attempt to do this? It seems like a good start. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I think it's I think it's a good they're trying to bring the publishers and they're trying to train the publishers.  But publishers are still going to lose a fair amount.  But yes, this is but again, let's not let's not forget if you're Google fine, if you're a publisher who has political clout fine, if you're the New York Times, you're schmo.  But the Indianapolis current. Well, or you're you're a travel search engine, a small travel search engine.  Right. And and I don't know what happens to you in an entirely new architecture of advertising where third party because what you did before was I could generate data.  I could say this person came. It's this person came to my site. They looked at boots.  Now I can put a cookie on him to say this is a boot interested consumer and the boots are going to follow you all around the Internet for six weeks, even after you bought the damn things.  Right. That's how it operated.  And I could get money by generating that data or get money by serving that ad.  I could play in a couple of ways. Well, now I can't really play in either because third party data is outlawed.  And so what I can afford their own, they know where you've gone on the Internet, they know how to do this.  But little tiny Leo's travel site.  Now you're a subtle luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would say no, no, no, I'm just going to throw something out here.  I know we're focused on advertising display advertising, but I think as technology moves deeper into our lives and you look at things like digital assistance and you look at voice, we get into this weird place where and there will be fights over this.  I get it.  And I don't know the business model behind it, but it's not advertising.  It's not what we see today.  If I'm asking.  So I feel like to go forward, you've got to think about how do you charge for these things?  How do you not alienate your user?  Because that's where and like I was talking to my husband about this, Andrew, and he was like, well, I think companies like Google's assistant will say, hey, it's your wife's birthday next week.  Do you want to order flowers for thirty nine dollars?  Do you want to order these flowers?  And then what happens is a florist will bid for the chance to get you to serve you that, which is a different type of programmatic market.  Yes.  It's a permission based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's permission based market.  Yes, I want flowers.  Show me the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so we're getting to that.  So I think it's really like we're looking back at what the mistakes that we made, but we need to be looking forward to like what does privacy look like under that framework?  Where does the money come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  And take advantage of new opportunities.  I have my own uncle Jeff obnoxious standard lines for my students.  You can imagine one of them is that when journalists face a problem, they report on it and go to the bar.  When engineers face a problem, they try to solve it.  And when when entrepreneurs face a problem, they try to exploit it.  Right.  And so the problem is we need to pay for these services in new ways.  My business hasn't done that, but there's lots of new ways.  But beyond that, there's new services like what you just said.  Right.  The by the way, my sister scared me to death two days ago.  She texted me and she said, isn't today your wife's birthday?  I knew better.  But it's next month.  Damn it.  And she gave me a heart attack.  So, yeah, I could use that service.  Right.  I think you've heard my spiel on the show before.  I think the Internet thus far has been built to speak and I celebrate that because we have Black Lives Matter and we have me too.  But it hasn't been built to listen.  So I think there are services to be had to help me find who and what are worth listening to and maybe to verify things.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As I said, there's still the line of what are you willing to give up for the you know, for these extra benefits?  And it's just going to be some give and take.  It is what it is.  There's a market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There'll be a market for these things and we'll see how it works out.  But there's all kinds of new services to envision.  But publishing is stuck in trying to pay for what they always did.  And actually, I would argue, I think, Stacy, the larger point you're raising too, is that Google and Facebook are also stuck in the old ad market and the attention based ad market.  And they haven't really started to reimagine that kind of service and that kind of middle role in marketing.  And they're still selling attention.  I think they they I think I'm a short coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they know it's coming.  They're working on it.  That's why you see their deals to buy all kinds of like more data and hardware deals like the Fitbit deal.  So I think like getting that context, they're trying to build up their understanding of people's context and surroundings.  So deliver those services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Self driving cars.  So you're going to sit in your car and be entertained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to take you somewhere.  Draw for us, paint for us a picture.  It doesn't have to be you, Jeff, but certainly you have an opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But everybody in this whatever it is, I'm sure I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In this world where Google's doing this, some sort of differential privacy, Apple's saying, you know, it's kind of an absolutist on privacy.  Most users now, Cory Doctorow calls it the largest consumer boycott in the history of the world.  Most users, many users are running ad blockers, privacy blockers.  What is what are the consequences of this kind of privacy focused world?  I mean, this is the world we're going to have.  So it's not like you could at this point advocate for anything else.  What are the I'll let you start.  I know you've been thinking about this.  What is the one's just this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He wants you to have a vault of your data and that you can choose whether to negotiate with somebody.  What's the consequence?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What's the I'm asking about the consequence.  Does do all the small town papers go out of business?  Yeah.  That means local news is no longer collected.  Nobody's going to know.  I don't mean that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It means there's new ways to do it.  Go ahead, Stacey.  What do you think?  They see you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't think that's actually what's going to happen because it's too much work for consumers.  I think what's more likely to happen.  And but if I follow your thought experiment, one of the losses will be things like a greater understanding of populations.  So if you think about like pulling together algorithms or AI, you know, to understand health outcomes, right?  Soliciting me, I trust the system.  I'll give you my data.  Like so then that influences the algorithm.  But think about people who may not trust the system.  They're not going to give it and that's going to influence it again.  So I think there's a loss associated with some of this at different levels.  I don't think people are prepared for the minutia of information that is collected about them to go places like for a split second in time.  You know, an advertiser might care that I went to.  I don't know my local bakery, but they're not going to care about that forever.  And right now, this is built on the free flow of information.  When that comes to be a decision point, we're going to have we're not going to have as much.  We won't have advertising in certain ways, but we also, you know, you'll have to convince people of the value of a service like Waze.  Right. And it'll be interesting to see who can build services because a lot of people build services that they can't afford early on with advertising dollars.  Sometimes they never give it up, but you know, sometimes they do.  So there's but I don't think we're ever going to get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So to podcasts pick up the slack does who picks up the slack for the oh, there was this great article on one zero.  Oh, sorry, and you go. No, no, you said something and then we'll give it a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't don't talk about news, news, local news going to next door.  Did you read this, Jeff? I thought of you when I saw it.  So it's all about people.  But the problem is next door is a platform only for people actually live in a certain area.  So people can't if you were outside that area, you can't join and refute arguments made is kind of one of the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I met with them trying to bring in newspapers into next door, but they kind of they're suspicious of other brands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is a Will Aramis's article from yesterday.  Next door is quietly replacing the small town paper while Facebook and Twitter get the scrutiny.  Next door is reshaping politics one neighborhood at a time.  Certainly next door does have that information, but it's written by your neighbors, right?  It's not written by. Yes.  There's there's there's the stuff you could imagine in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's things that are wrong. My wife has gotten this one guy kicked off next door about three times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the problem I have with this is sometimes that neighborhood is not quite the sharpest group.  Hey, you know, I think let me just say this.  I'll think back to the one of the neighborhoods that I lived in years ago and all of the horrendous information that they would share amongst themselves.  And it would eventually come back to me because I didn't want to associate with some of the idiocy in this right here.  I get their approach of trying to keep local news alive because it seems like local news is starting to sort of fade away.  But if you just putting it down to the people and having them be in the source, I don't think that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it sounds like that we should all join next door to fix it, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, if you if you can only fix it in the small area where you live.  So if my neighborhood's cool, but there's some flaming racist, the next neighborhood over and there are more of them making decisions that affect me as a whole community than in their like spouting their conspiracy theories over there.  I have no way to know it or in no way to refute it or go in and do anything about it.  I mean, it's the same issue like, you know, India has had this issue with misinformation spreading on WhatsApp and they were like, screw it.  I'll let you go on WhatsApp.  So I mean, I can't tell you how many times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you can't I can't I can't help the people not next door.  They're going to have to work on their own issues.  But shouldn't I participate in my next door as a good neighbor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they ask questions like I started my next door group after Hurricane Sandy.  And we needed to find out things together.  We needed to share things together.  There was a platform that was built for that and it's verified identity.  So they're truly my neighbors.  The problem was they said you have to have like 72 neighbors.  Well, I live on three acres zoning out here in the country.  I said to get some people, I've got people who are five miles away.  I don't know who they are.  Right. But they kind of did it anyway.  They have I have a little old neighborhood, but now they've spread it out to get enough traffic.  They have the next two towns over.  I don't care about but it's it's it's another input.  It's like LinkedIn is not my whole life, but occasionally LinkedIn is useful.  Occasionally next door is useful.  You know, but that's right, though.  Occasionally also my neighbors are real dorks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I just signed up for next door in my neighborhood.  And this is the first thing I see is a good neighbor pledge to be helpful.  Do not discriminate. We do not tolerate racism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the same terms of service no one no one ever reads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK. But but honestly, by doing this and having community guidelines, they could clean it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you've set your next door is the home of racist people and next door moderators are normal people who live in your neighborhood.  Yeah, it's almost like you don't want to really realize who's living near you.  It's like it's. Yeah, go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you were asking for us to paint a picture in my picture.  Part of it, I see just a bunch of silos and.  One side of me likes things being sort of siloed off and just because I'm introverted and sort of like to keep away from myself.  But at the same time, it's not good to have things siloed off where people aren't able to get good, valuable information.  And this whole next door thing, let me give you my perspective.  I'm the new guy here. You know, the pruits were the new new people here in this particular neighborhood.  And we were told about next door, logged in and got verified, yada, yada, yada.  And oh, my goodness, I couldn't do it. I couldn't stay in there. I couldn't read through it.  It was racist. Well, it's not racist stuff, but it's just a lot of people that just doesn't have.  They don't have a lot of common sense with some of the stuff that I've seen.  But yet if I walk outside, physically walk outside my front door and look at my neighbor to the left, absolutely love them.  I have the best neighbors in the world. I mean, they made me shepherd's pie last week.  Oh, that's really sweet. So next door doesn't really show that part.  Next door is showing me all this other underbelly that I I want no part of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm looking at my next door now that I signed up.  And it's all pretty good. Like how much rain did you get?  Hey, here's a guy who's doing irrigation. Somebody wants to know, hey, I want to donate my body to science.  Sixty three comments from people explaining how to do that. Where do I get a vaccine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stuff like that. Oh, scroll down on your vaccine. See how many anti-vaxxers pop up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's good. That's a good 73 comments. Does anybody know anything about vaccines?  Now, how do I I'm trying to see the comments. How do I see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm in mind. So the same thing. Well, it says see previous 44 comments or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm clicking it and nothing. Oh, so there it is.  So Stacey and mine. Oh, there they are. Oh, boy. Let's see if we get any anti-vaxxers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mine is entirely about the details of getting it. That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not that about I haven't seen anybody yet.  Vaccine update. Here's where you go. If you're over seventy five, here's this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I got one. Now I got one. I got one. Yeah, I'm in Northern California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm in Northern California. I'm not going to probably get a lot of what happens is you get a lot of California, too.  I know you're in Rohnert Park. That's a very different town than Petaloma.  Petaloma. You get I should have warned you about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm just teasing. You get a bunch of people who are normal people and then you get the one person who's not normal.  And then other people try to engage and they double down being extra awful.  And any time someone's a jerk, you notice it way more than you do someone who's like a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's fair. So my premise that everybody that the good people should participate, join and drown out the bad people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that a false premise? No, I think I mean, that's fine.  Yeah, yeah, I'm just saying that that way in Austin, my next door would start with.  I mean, granted, we would we would go to it for much entertainment, like especially around Halloween, inappropriate decorations came out.  But you also did like, you know, there was definitely people.  And again, this was two years ago, but they were like, letting you know there's a black man in a hoodie walking down the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. That neighborhood had that problem big time.  And so doorbell thing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And sometimes, you know, or someone will say something, you know, borderline or I mean, this happened to Texas.  People would, you know, the lawn signs for various politicians.  That was always it gets heated. But most of the time, yes, it's very like, oh, hey, I've got.  I've got too many zucchinis. Anyone want to come get them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK, I went through the whole vaccine thread. Not one person said, oh, don't do that.  It'll kill you or anything like that. It's all like, here's how you do it.  Whereas it was very helpful stuff. So maybe I just live in a better neighborhood than you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. Yeah, you do, because I logged in and the first thing that I saw was something quite nice.  And then the second thing says, just move on.  I've come to realize you can't you can't just block annoying people and move on.  You know, it's that extreme. Does it have blocking?  It really looks like a form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, again, they actually listen. My wife has gotten this one guy out.  I think he's out permanently now because there was three strikes. Yeah.  And he was being a jerk and she and she reported them and they did something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, we have bad neighbors. I mean, it's not that we don't have. Oh, Lord knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't need the Internet to have my bad neighbors. They've been bad for long before the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sometimes people get blocked for like teasing people.  You know, like Nextdoor isn't a forum for teasing people, but man, sometimes people just, you know, and I can say,  there's no irony on Nextdoor. Yeah. So you've got to you've got to know your audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. OK. All right. All right. Yeah, we got to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK. Hey, speaking of the Ring doorbell, you see, they have a new this is a good one for you, Stacey.  They have a new sixty dollar entry level doorbell.  And the way they save money is they don't put a battery in it. But I have a wired doorbell.  I don't know if most people do, but I think that's not uncommon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not uncommon. It's super easy. You don't. OK.  I well, I'm not going to tell you this. That would be irresponsible.  I was like, most of the time you don't even have to turn off the power to do a doorbell because it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's low voltage, but you still should probably. I OK.  I didn't like somebody's going to have. Yeah, they're going to be blasted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they'll be like, you nasty grams for Stacey Higginbotham.  No, but so, you know what? Turn off your power. Be safe. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of times I put in the rundown. I put in Stacey's four bears.  Did you see that one? You watched this video? Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's just finish up on this. OK. Oh, I'm sorry. I think we're done. Oh, well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, OK. I don't know. Oh, democracy. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's finish one before we go to the next one. How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought you were done with that one. I was OK.  What did I raise my hand and say? Anybody? I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anybody have anything else? I just wanted to ask Stacey. I apologize already.  You think this is a good doorbell? I'm not going to steal ants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are we scared of Amazon in the ring or is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't like. I mean, this is super cheap.  And the reason why is because wise has a doorbell, too.  So we're seeing prices get lower. Good. Thank you.  I don't like ring simply because I don't want to pay a subscription to get access to my feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's the other way. Which is what?  The subscription to get your data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's to see videos after a certain amount of time. That's very fast.  Like if you don't catch it in the first two hours, you're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I'm asking Stacey, is that is that their primary or their secondary revenue stream?  Is this about the long haul? Is this about subscription money or is it about sustainability for a connected device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, you know, you can sell it on hardware and your margins are probably OK.  Well, they're less on a 60 dollar bill. If you have one ring doorbell or security camera, three dollars a month,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  thirty dollars annually, if you want to have more than one,  it goes up. You could have as many as you want for ten dollars a month, a hundred dollars annually.  So it's actually a better deal than the Nest Nest Protect.  It's not that expensive. And for free, you get ring and motion alerts, current custom motion detection, interact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What you don't get is you get your live video on demand, but you can go back to the thing so I can see what their plan is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You get 30 to 60 days. If you pay for it, you get no recordings if you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So basically, if you miss that person at your doorbell, you can't see them stealing your package.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. And for the hundred dollars annually, you get monitor professional monitoring as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any idea what proportion subscribe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have been trying to get that data forever. Oh, but what I would say about sustainability is when you have a connected product,  you're constantly having to pay to update it with like security updates, the software associated with it.  And then the cloud costs associated with the video going to the cloud and getting stored is just constantly accruing.  So that's why connected project products always try to have a subscription plan because you can't pay for them all up front because the costs accumulate over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The Wyze camera is not yet available, but it's half the price. It's 30 dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And it's local. So it has both cloud and you can pop an SD card in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a nice thing. Then you don't have to pay any subscription with the SD card.  They do also have an optional subscription, though, don't they? I believe. Yes. Yes, they do. Yeah. You can get home monitoring and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People did not like the 30 dollar Wyze video doorbell. I did not test it because I'm no longer testing doorbells.  So the basic plan, which is free with all devices for Wyze, again, the 30 dollar camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And John said he is on his way. So we'll ask John when you get yours how you like it tomorrow.  Twelve second video events, five minute cool down period, motion triggered, but no face detection, pet detection.  And it looks like if you're going to do recording, you have to do it yourself.  Cam Plus, which is cheap, it's a buck twenty five a month when you buy a year, gives you vehicle detection, package detection, fast forwarding through events.  You can record events. So Wyze is really making their name in the business by completely undercutting the big guys.  I love seeing it bring prices down even for the big guys. So that's you're right.  I think it's this is wise. This is the response to the wires. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, now we can move on. Jeff, we. Well, no, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know.  It's no, never mind. It's not a democracy you pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, it is. And I know it's one of the reasons that from time to time I'll say, is there anything you guys would like to talk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but you're being forced into it. I don't want you to know.  You pick up. This is like a story you put in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google Play Bands video app for standard dot ass subtitles report.  Did I how did I know? So it was one.  A.S.S. stands for Advanced Substantial Alpha Files.  It is not a naughty word for the buttocks area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Google, of course, you know, when they were coming up with that standard, they were like, let's call it ass.  Giggle. OK, so the alternative is S.R.T. correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a variety, I think, of these for these subtitles. Yeah, I think S.R.T.  There's there's others like ass like ass like S.S.A., which is substation alpha.  And then there's advanced substation alpha, which really should be ass.  But, you know, and then you're right, S.R.T. T.T. M.L. V.T.T.  There's quite a few of them. Reminds me of a great Seinfeld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Man, license plates. Oh, yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Bad idea. Loon's balloon is popped.  Have we done this story? Nope.  All the year going on Sunday. Yeah, I thought the problem is I have different shows and different calendar.  So Astro Teller, best name ever.  The man who runs the X Google's X there, they're there.  What do they call them? Moonshots or other bets?  He says it's not a failure. It's not a failure.  We've we've learned these are the balloons that we're going to provide for G Internet access anywhere in the globe.  Remember, Facebook had their own version of this, these drones called Akila drones, which they killed about a year ago.  A while ago. Yeah. Loon was founded in 2011 and it was used.  It's been used in a number of ways. It was used in Peru after I think an earthquake.  It was used after Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017.  They have been using it in Kenya as a commercial service for LTE.  Thirty five balloons covering a 50,000 square kilometer area over the city of Nairobi.  So but it was never going to turn a profit.  And I have to think that things like Elon Musk's Starlink, which was which is going to use satellites to do the same thing.  I'm saying actual full Internet, not just LTE. Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's probably going to eat his lunch, right? Yeah, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, is that it? Oh, OK. You got two competitors in that field.  Yeah. Bezos. Bezos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The balloons were expensive. Ten thousand tens of thousands, tens of thousands of dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they died after five months. Yeah.  And people who are in change for Google. Yeah. But they have it not under Ruth Porat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't want to spend the pocket change. They want to keep it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They said, yeah, 100 million a year that it was it was losing 100 million dollars a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There was also there were apparently regulatory hurdles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's always. Yeah. So why do they do it in the first place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, because providing broadband to places that don't have broadband is a public good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's God's work. It's not about all. It's not always about the privileged people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, you know, this is not one of them to succeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But was this a bad business? If it's bad now, then why wasn't it bad?  Nine years ago is what I'm just trying to understand. But they were trying to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the hope was that they would come up with some way to build economies of scale.  So maybe the balloons would get cheaper over time.  Maybe governments would help fund it to bring, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that just because it's still important work, it's still vital and it's still good for their business.  The more people they can get on the Internet, it's it's God's work all around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and Stephen Levy got talked to Astro Teller about it and teller said, look, this is this is he said, it's not a failure.  It's a successful experiment.  Levy says, I asked him what an unsuccessful experiment might look like.  Real failure is exploded. Yeah.  No real failure, says Astro Teller, is when the data tells you what you're doing isn't the right thing and you do it anyway.  It's a right, you know, his his version of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love that response. Yeah.  You all talked about that Sunday. I believe it was that's right.  Lansing. Yeah. That brought it up and it makes perfect sense.  You look at a lot of businesses, heck, you can just look at production, people to produce shows and podcasts and things like that.  After a while, you see a certain way of your content is not really growing.  You say, OK, I need to pivot. You don't just keep bleeding yourself to death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My wife, Lisa Laporte, is the Ruth Porat of Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yet we're still on the air and we're still crushing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, but, you know, and I appreciate it.  Am I right? Because I will never get rid of anything.  I will do a show forever.  But if it costs us money, try to do something right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huh? Are you trying to tell us something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have sponsors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to blame Lisa for it. Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, Lisa. So the other thing that I thought was interesting, this was Steve from Stephen Levy's story on Wired, is that when Loon was started, Internet availability was seventy five percent of the world.  Now it's ninety three percent of the world.  Really? Yeah.  And or you had just finally people wiring up the world.  And then the remaining areas, Levy says, are primarily populated by either those who can't afford the 4G phones Loon requires or aren't convinced that the Internet is worth the effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are the six percent, like even at the U.S.  Internet deniers.  Yeah.  Well, no, they just. So here's one.  There's a large portion who just don't have computers. Right.  So that was why they didn't get on. They didn't see the point in it.  Right. There was actually like one or two percent who were very focused on porn.  They were just like, that is how porn gets into your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, they want the focus on keeping it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Sorry. This is why they don't have it.  And the rest were just like, you know, it just it made no sense.  And a lot of these people were older.  Some people had it at the office and felt like that was sufficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there's monks and nuns who aren't on the Internet, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are days when I wish I weren't on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there is the Internet, which is the growth of it is what do you say?  It's like 90. How much? 93 percent coverage now in the.  That's amazing.  That makes me think about my sister, my youngest boy.  I'm trying to think how old he is. All right.  So it's been at least 10 years that my sister in South Carolina,  her residents didn't have Internet access.  Wow. Just just didn't have it.  They just got it about two weeks to it. They just got out there.  About 10 years, no Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, I have no reason why Google killed Tilt Brush.  I didn't know what the heck Tilt Brush was.  It was one of the best VR painting games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Four people played.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now it's open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  At least, you know what? I got to praise them for doing that.  That's the way if you can to kill any software project, open source it.  Reader, reader.  Yeah, I wish they'd done that.  Couldn't they have done it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Federated reader ages ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or Wave, you know, open source it because if you know,  an open source project doesn't have this have to have the same metrics as a commercial project by Google to survive.  And I bet you anyway, we'll see.  You know what? We'll watch and see what happens with Tilt Brush.  This is an example of Google product Google bought in 2015 praising its innovative approach to 3D painting.  It even had Tilt Brush artists in residence.  But Ruth Porat, it's been poratted.  Can we use that as a verb? It's been poratted.  I don't even know if it was Ruth, but I played it in the HTC Vive and it was really fun.  And it was it was one of those 3D VR games that people would often show use as an example.  You know, and I there were some people doing some wonderful stuff with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wacom and Adobe, they were pretty keen on it at one point in time as well.  Wacom to mix the pen tablets and styles that people use for digital art.  I thought it was Wacom. Wacom. Wacom. Wacom.  Wacom. I say Wacom. I never knew that.  No, it's Wacom. Wacom. Wacom.  Wacom. Wacom. I only know because I only meet the CEO and speak with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I figured you'd know. Yeah, I never knew that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's official. It's a Japanese company.  Japanese. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  150 million. 150 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google committing to vaccine education, partnering with One Medical.  Amazon has said we want to help use our facilities for vaccine.  Everybody's jumping in, which is good. Let's get those vaccines out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I got some news. Yes. I got it yesterday.  Congratulations. Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw that tweet. Oh, I'm so happy for you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel a little weird because there are teachers, there are people who have ahead of me, but it's a hot mess here.  I saw this sign up, but I did it. I'm 66. I've got two 9-11 cancers, one 9-11 heart condition.  I've got a lung condition that comes back with COVID.  So I figure I'm a walking collection of conditions.  I don't think you have to justify it in the sense.  I feel like I did, but I did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. And a lot of like a friend of mine who's a yes, she's in health care, but she's young.  But Washington State was such a mess.  And they were like, hey, we literally have thawed vaccines that we have to shove in people's arms and no one's here.  Do you want to come? I'll volunteer. Hell yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. You're no Rodney Baker.  Let's put it that way.  He's the former head of a Canadian casino company and his actor wife who chartered a private plane to a remote community near the Alaska border  and got Corona vaccines meant for vulnerable indigenous residents.  Oh my Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The tribes up here, there's a tribe actually on the peninsula that actually they had too many doses.  They vaccinated the tribes and then they were like opened it up to the community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This was not that. This was not that.  Rodney and Ekaterina Baker traveled by charter plane to Beaver Creek, a community of a hundred in the Yukon territory.  A mobile team was administering the Moderna vaccine to residents, particularly elderly members of the White River First Nation at the mobile clinic.  The Bakers claim to be workers at a local motel.  Oh, son of a.  But then they asked for a ride back to the airport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They called the motel. They said, no, they don't.  They don't work for us.  So the enforcement officers, that's what they call them, Mounties in Canada.  Enforcement officers searched the couple, searched for the couple at their quarantine location and Whitehorse found they'd already left.  They were discovered at the airport preparing to fly back to Vancouver.  They were both fined for breaking public health rules, but they didn't do any jail time.  But they got 500 bucks fine.  Big deal.  Did they get the shots?  Yeah, they got the shots.  So it was worth it for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're trying to sign up for it.  You have to be just the right minute.  And then I saw them and I thought, OK, I took it.  And then I went back a minute later and all the silence were gone.  So now I've got to worry about getting the second appointment because there are no times in there.  I went to the fire academy and I was very well run by Middlesex County.  It was I've got to say the one thing that disturbed me was that it was almost entirely white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because you have to sign up on a freaking app or a computer and most of that's not the time to sit here.  That is just not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're absolutely right.  It's not.  You know why I'm feeling funny about having gotten it.  There are teachers, there are bus drivers, there are grocery store people who should have been prioritized in that way.  It wasn't. And so I got a time and I got it and I am vulnerable and so fine.  But this should have been prioritized against people who are exposed and vulnerable.  One thing that people have to fit about in New Jersey is that you make the current list if you smoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, hold on. Hold on. It's a legitimate health impact.  Yeah, but it's a lifestyle choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't think you should be rewarded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. OK, I do that because of fine.  Can we talk about or fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I happen to like to I happen to sleep on a bed of nails every night.  Can I get the vaccine?  I might get it. You know, that could be that could be a if you take that line of thinking,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  then what you're going to start doing is demonizing unhealthy choices and not everybody makes unhealthy choices because they're like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, like I have a family member.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a fascinating debate smokes and it makes me mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also, asking someone to give up smoking in the middle of the freaking pandemic.  That's right. I took up smoking. Are you kidding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I got myself. I got myself a triger. Yes.  That's the smoking I took up. I got a triger. I smoke your brisket.  I smoke your ribs.  Get a triger for for.  Yeah, I want to get in line with a very vaccine.  I smoke. I smoke. I got a triger.  It's a pellet. I know it's not really a wood smoker, but I smoke.  I'm a smoker. All right.  Smoker.  Susan Wojcicki, her first letter of 2021.  Addressing YouTube's priorities for the year.  Let's see. Here's.  Go ahead.  I forgot what she wants to grow the creator economy.  OK, she says this is actually amazing.  According to Oxford Economics, YouTube's creative ecosystem contributed 16 billion 16 billion to the United States GDP in 2019.  340,000. The equivalent of 345,000 full time jobs.  The UK, one point four billion pounds.  The equivalent of 30,000 full time jobs in France, five hundred fifteen million euros, fifteen thousand full time jobs.  So, you know, this is these are the same kind of stats Apple says about their app store, about how many, you know, people are employed by it.  But yeah, I mean, it has it has an impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to win tomorrow. A lot of people have problems.  Yeah. Sorry, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, I was just like, I'm feeling very cynical about PR today. Yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Always am. Always. I'm like, I guess that's the main.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want a Facebook story? Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, we have actually some big ones. But before I'm just scanning, scanning through the letter because I forgot I had bookmarked some stuff, but I forgot what it was.  Now we turn our focus to the possibilities ahead with vaccination.  In October, we expanded our covid-19 medical misinformation policy on YouTube to remove content about vaccines that contradicts consensus from health authorities.  In other words, anti-vax stuff.  I think there is absolutely a burden on places like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to make sure that they because one of the biggest problems is going to be, you know,  as we slowly work through this supply issue is going to be vaccine deniers, vaccine, yes, yes, you know, or doubters, doubters who aren't going to get the vaccine.  And it will keep us from getting to that critical 75 to 80 percent for herd immunity.  So I think it's appropriate that there be kind of a drumbeat of, you know, it doesn't have to be aggressive or, you know, it's not about banning.  It's about just this kind of generalized drumbeat of it's good.  You got to do it safe. Please.  You know, it's going to help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's a fascinating thing to Leo.  I asked this with journalism, right?  If there are a large number of people in this country who refuse to wear and even burn masks, I take that as a failure of journalism.  Now, if you play that out, that says the job of journalism should be to convince you to wear a mask.  And so am I an educator? Am I a propagandist?  I don't know if journalism should be an advocacy forum.  Oh, I think I think in this case, the science is clear.  And if you don't know the value of a mask, if you're ignorant to it, we failed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We fail. Well, you know, God knows I intentionally very visibly wear a mask when I'm coming into the studio.  I've written many blog posts about masks, kind of promoted early on my own, you know, homemade masks and that kind of thing.  All with it was my intent to subtly reinforce the notion of masks are good.  Masks are safe. Masks are positive.  You know, it's a good thing.  But I don't feel like that's advocacy as much.  And I don't feel like I'm a journalist as much as a opinionist, opinion person, a pundit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So YouTube is making a decision here, which I think is the right decision.  It's an advocacy position. It's a judgmental decision.  But I think it's the right one to say we're going to get rid of this stuff that we say is wrong and we're going to do this.  Yes, yes, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Facebook's done the same, right?  Yes. Facebook always gets a lot of heat because they aren't.  It's so big, it's hard for them to be completely perfect in this.  But I think they've made it was generous of you.  They have referred the Trump case in the oversight to the Oversight Board.  The Oversight Board has accepted it.  This is clearly what the Oversight Board was designed to do.  How long is that going to take though, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's 90 days, up to 90 days.  I talked to the people at Facebook beforehand and they have up to 90 days to do it.  Facebook could have made it a rush, but they didn't want to rush this decision.  The decision will be binding in regards to Donald Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See, I'm surprised because I thought that the Oversight Board lacked teeth, but apparently it does have the teeth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is binding in terms of if the Oversight Board says you were wrong to take down Trump, put him back up, they will put him back up.  Now clearly this has implications.  It's restricted to the case of Donald Trump, but clearly the discussion goes on to Duterte and others.  Right. The Junta, Myanmar, all that.  So I got called from a London journalist doing a story about how there's an activist trying to get the Khomeini down because of human rights violations.  So you're going to find this in all those places.  At the same time, you have Merkel and Macron saying, oh, Twitter shouldn't have taken down the head of state.  No, we might not need to have a law about that.  Poland now has legislation going through that would forbid the platforms to take down any legal content.  It's the opposite of 230. We give them no choice at all.  But to keep everything up that people want up there and make them all into parlor.  How's that?  So we see that there's I think there's implications to this case.  It'll be fascinating to see whether the Oversight Board raises this up to a level of principles or not.  We can all make public comment to them if you want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Have you noticed I noticed on Twitter the lack of President Trump's tweets, actually not just on Twitter, but also in the general national discourse and news.  That absence has been beneficial. Have you noticed that on Facebook?  Is there I didn't at my sense is he it wasn't the same on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It wasn't the same. Yeah, it wasn't getting quoted the same media.  But it was there and you could you know, you could you can find it.  It's not there now. But of course, they didn't take him down entirely.  They froze his contributions to speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Speaking of YouTube, they have decided to continue to block his videos.  They're good. This is going to they're going to have to make a decision at some point because I it depends if Trump fades away.  I don't think he's going to or if he decides to take the national stage again and become active, then that's going to be interesting to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If he decided to hold a press conference tomorrow, longer tomorrow, you know, there'd be reporters there.  I don't know they should be because he's has been. But, you know, they'll be there.  He has a voice if he wants it. He's not he's not silenced. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Any more than Josh Hawley is silenced, Josh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't you can't be wild just as we went on the air. Yeah.  So to speak, air quotes around air. Am I allowed to go to another related story now?  Actually, I want to do an ad. So you've done with that. Can we do an ad?  Can we do an ad? OK, that's fine. It's it's it's it's your other dictator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Because I was getting kind of like, please do an ad.  We could be here for years otherwise. There's a change log to do, too.  I know I've been taking small breaks. That's how sad I'm like. Oh, I've got to get more water.  Oh, I need some food. I'm just not cut out for this.  You got cookies. I didn't have cookies today.  But you know what? Oh, I'll tell you this and then we can go to that.  My husband is so nice. I asked him for a snack and he pitted a bowl of cherries and brought them for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you don't want to spit cherry pits on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly. Well, you say, honey, I wouldn't want you to choke.  Chewy. Remove these cherries.  Would you like me to peel you some grapes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He brought the bowl and I was like, I love you, but I'm not doing that.  I thought it was the most romantic thing he's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, you said you had a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, just real quick.  So two things related.  Facebook says it's going to dial down politics now because it's just such a pain, obviously, and they're going to mean politics in general.  They don't need it.  Let's all dial down politics.  At the same time, line number 116, Politico reports that new campaigns are suffering badly.  Because without Facebook and Twitter and being able to put up political ads, they don't have a way to reach the voters and their piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Boohoo, they'll figure it out.  That's what the world, I mean, that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're stuck with mass media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, maybe they can figure something else out.  Maybe they can do door knockings.  Maybe they can do a Kickstarter for their campaign.  In a pen gimmick.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Egress mail is expensive.  Yeah, screw it.  Figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the reason the reason we have I am I am so unsympathetic.  Also, this idea that Facebook, I mean, maybe they just shouldn't have like the algorithmic reach.  Maybe they should just let people post.  I mean, I know that's their whole business, but it's kind of like maybe this is acknowledging that their business isn't doing the best it can for people.  And the other option is then what are they going to show us?  It's not our messages for our friends because that doesn't make them money.  It's going to be stupid Instagram gigas and whatnot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Anyway, I'm interested in this fact.  You know, newsletters are the hot new hotness, right?  Substack for this week or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I think there are a lot of people like shanty songs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's the life of the lifespan of a shanty song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I feel like a lot of people are looking at ways to monetize via companies like Substack.  Twitter has just acquired a small company called from from Holland called Review.  R.E.V.U.E. It's a newsletter platform for writers and publishers.  It probably didn't cost him much.  There's a six person team, but it does.  I think it's telling that Twitter acquired him.  I think it'd be very interesting to see them create a platform for creators involving newsletters.  They say it'll work seamlessly with Twitter.  Twitter says they plan to create new features.  It'll make it easier for writers to connect with their audiences, allowing people to sign up for newsletters from people they follow on Twitter, adding new settings for writers to host conversations with their subscribers on Twitter.  I think there's a lot of potential here.  I think that's very interesting.  Agree? You agree? Yes, I agree.  Twitter is opening up its fire hose to researchers for free.  This is good news.  Very good news.  I think it's become clear, it certainly was clear in the last four years, that Twitter is an important resource for what's kind of the zeitgeist, not just on the internet, but just nationally.  Twitter used to require researchers to pay for full access.  Instead, they're going to make the full history of public conversation.  They refer to it as its full archive search endpoint available to any researcher or developer who applies as part of the launch of a new academic research track.  They're also going to improve the Twitter API, something that's been a source point with third-party developers, to make it easier to do this kind of thing.  So big news. Big, big news.  That's the right thing to do.  Twitter is also doing a few other interesting things.  One is Birdwatch, which is kind of like a forum to combat misinformation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's crowdsourced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Crowdsourced.  Alerting, yeah.  Birdwatch allows people to identify information in tweets they believe is misleading or false.  It's one way to palm this off on other people instead of having to do it yourself.  It sounds like an online forum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You have to apply to be a Birdwatcher.  I applied.  Did you? Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They haven't said yes yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Twitter says it will be available to a small set of users at first, largely on a first-come, first-served basis.  You don't have to be a high-profile Jeff Jarvis type or a traditional fact checker, but you will have to have a real phone number and email address.  Okay.  If you're a Birdwatcher, you can flag tweets from a drop-down menu within the Twitter interface.  But any discussion you start about the tweet will remain exclusively in the Birdwatch section.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus, people will rate each other's, I don't know what they're going to call them, chirps.  That way, they'll get some kind of karma system going, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's good. This is a good experiment.  That is.  We talked a little bit about Blue Sky, which is something that Jack Dorsey talked about last year as a federated Twitter.  Open source federated Twitter, yeah.  Interesting post. I guess this is a report from Twitter on the review of the ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He hired basically researchers to work on this, so this is the report of what this looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Including, I'm pleased to say, Gargon, who is Eugene Rochko.  He's the creator of Mastodon, which is the Fediverse instance software that we use at Twitter.  The what? The whatverse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fediverse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The cheeseverse?  By the way, you started something, Stacey.  Greek cheese.  We now officially on Twitter social call it the Fetaverse with a T.  Nice.  I love it. This paper is good because it talks about IndieWeb and Activity Pub and all of the open web protocols and things.  I don't know what Twitter is going to do with this.  But it's still kicking. He has people working on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is I think this could be really this goes back to what I was trying to say earlier.  I think there's a chance for the for Twitter to be open source and for value to be on top of that.  We're going to find you the good tweeters.  We're going to find you the good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I love it if Twitter would become a an instance on GNU social on the social graph.  I think that would be a really interesting play.  Then I could on my social feed follow Twitter posts from you, Jeff and Stacey and Ann.  That would be fantastic.  It would allow me to have my own server, my own control, not see the general Twitter noise, but follow the people I'm interested in.  I hope very hopeful.  They also talked about Matrix in this, which is an open source kind of discourse like platform.  I'm very excited about Matrix.  I think Matrix is really strong.  There are a number of Matrix clients that are end and encrypted like element.  It's very interesting.  So good.  I'm glad Twitter's putting some.  Yeah, I like that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some effort into this.  Thanks to Jason putting the rundown up earlier.  I saw it at the end of last week and oh, I'll forget this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why we have the rundown.  Yep.  All right.  I think we could quickly do a change log.  Stacey is really running out of steam.  I can tell she's running out of cherries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm so I'm still here.  I'm still here.  I just was getting worried because we were like almost two hours in and we'd only done one ad and I was like, yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You were right.  I was I was a laggard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Show hallway stretching out into eternity.  It never ends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Although I think this would be a good time to scare Jeff with the first item in the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yay.  I'm sure you're familiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jeff with a very useful page.  Everybody should know about the Google My Activity page.  It now has dark.  Oh, awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As it should, as it should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is the place you go to monitor your Google activity.  My activity dot Google dot com.  And it looks so nice in the dark.  It looks so nice in the dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, the benefit of dark mode is really great when you're on camera because every time you go look at a site that's in dark mode, your lighting doesn't change.  I prefer it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm still pink or orange no matter what.  It doesn't help.  Laptop closed, laptop open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google has redesigned mobile search on Android and iOS to be easier to read with dark mode.  No, I'm just kidding.  Just teasing.  It is just cleaner and easier to read.  Significant redesign of how search looks on mobile.  So if you say, hey, that looks different, yes, you're right.  And very visual.  Lots more of those carousels that Google loves so much.  Very pretty.  Which unfortunately, the side effect of this is fewer results.  What is happening on that page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's three different pages.  And different controls and stuff.  Scrambled whales?  What was that?  Scrambled whales.  So if you search for humpback whale, you see the entire first page is taken up with a knowledge card.  If you search for running spots in San Francisco, you don't get websites.  You get, well, I guess you kind of do.  It's a little different.  It's a little different.  More cards, basically, is the answer to that.  Chrome now hides notification content when screen sharing.  To keep alerts private.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for that.  I don't use Chrome, but if I did, that would be a problem.  I always have to go in here and turn off notifications so you can't see it when Stacey Stacey says,  Stacey's yelling at me, it's time for lunch.  Let's go. Come on. Hurry, hurry, hurry.  She doesn't do that.  It's dinner.  It's dinner anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She has a red button on her desk like Trump and she pushes it and cherries arrive.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I want the diet.  What is it? A diet? Was it diet Pepsi? Diet Coke?  I want the diet Coke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, Boing Boing had something saying that A, the button was still there.  B, he didn't use the button.  And C, there's another button in other places just in case.  So the button story was apparently all blown out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, they didn't really know what the button was.  It was a couple of reporters who looked at this button next to the phone, big wooden box presidential seal and said,  we wondered what it was until the president, President Trump pressed it and a butler came in with a diet Coke.  I think he bragged about it, too. I think he like, whoa, what's this?  He says, everyone gets a little nervous when I press that button.  So according to Boing Boing, the button, actually multiple buttons are apparently back in place, but their purpose has not been disclosed.  A White House official, unfortunately, this is for Politico, wouldn't say what Biden will use the button for.  The official said, I don't have anything for you on that.  He didn't know probably.  According to Politico, Biden is a big fan of orange Gatorade.  Oh, God, I please don't make an orange Gatorade button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like that. M&Ms, peanut M&Ms.  That would be what my button is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I respect that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Former official said there's also another similar button next to the chair by the fireplace.  But he said Trump actually didn't use it much.  He just said the valets are always around.  He says, give me a Coke. You don't have to.  You don't need a button for that.  You're the leader of the free world for crying out loud.  You don't need a button.  Google hides notification content.  Well, I said that Chrome OS 88 is here.  Smart display like screensaver with Google Photos and Weather.  I don't really need a screensaver on my Chrome OS.  But now you can.  YouTube.com is now available as a progressive web app.  I like that.  Just in time for Mozilla to announce it's not going to support progressive web apps.  Those are the web pages you can download and use offline or have a dedicated icon for.  So if you go to YouTube.com and Chrome, you'll see the circle with a plus in it directly in the Omni box.  You can click it to install the app.  Then you'll get a large red play logo on your app launcher for opening YouTube in a window.  It's a Chrome-less window. No buttons. No UI.  That's nice. I'm a big believer in PWAs. I like that idea.  Google Lens for Android rolling out offline translate capability. Nice.  Good stuff.  And Google Photos for Android now has a tablet optimized interface.  Just in time for Google not to release a tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's your Google change law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jeff wanted you to see this. I have a feeling this was from Jeff.  This is for Stacey.  Westinghouse presents the all electric home.  Heating, cooling, appliances.  Hi Betty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In all my years with Westinghouse, I've covered some pretty interesting stories.  But here is truly the most wonderful and exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Betty had a hard time walking a straight line. I might point out.  I wonder. Okay. Never mind. It was a long lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can fast forward anywhere into it. It's just wonders of the new world.  It's the working house's extra button to automatically lower a protective screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is your new fireplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cooking is really a joy in the food preparation center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We don't call it a kitchen anymore. It's a food preparation center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here you have a refrigerator that looks like fine furniture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not really. It looks like a refrigerator on your counter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It looks like a diner's kitchen display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Fine furniture. Little bit of an exaggeration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For convenience, the upper unit of the refrigerator opens from both sides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's convenient. So you can peek at your friend in the other side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Below are handy, spacious refrigerator and freezer drawers.  Then too, there's the miraculous electronic oven that will cook these appetizers in six seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's from June and it's only $1,500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  PGAVs. Loving every minute.  Appetizers that were prepared from recipes kept in this microfilm file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This looks a lot like my thermomix.  Thermomix.  Microfilm though. That's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thousands of recipes are on file here.  And simply by pressing a couple of buttons, the recipe of your choice appears on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why those pears look beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why didn't someone make the recipes for them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Someday you'll be able to use your telephone to order food brought to your door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Anyway, look, there's an exercise bicycle.  It's the early Peloton.  Look at that.  Well, that is exactly what your office looks like.  Okay. They didn't know about COVID, but they were ready.  The Westinghouse All Electric House in color.  Jeff, that was your addition.  That was my little moment. I got it.  I like it.  It was amusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was IoT before its time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Clearly.  It's amazing what the internet has changed.  I mean, you had to have a microfilm reader and a microfilm cache in the basement to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was there like a little robot you would tell it what you wanted and would go get the right microfilm for you?  Yeah, they didn't show any of that stuff.  Do you remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You probably are old enough to remember going to the library to look at old newspapers.  Oh, you're not going to join us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Sure do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a lot harder than they showed.  Even you, Ant?  Yes.  Ant, are you going to buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My school, we had one reader at my school for microfilm.  Everything else.  We did have the internet, but we still had one room that had microfilm.  Well, you got all that microfilm.  What are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You got to have a reader.  Are you going to buy this new Sony Xperia Pro phone?  It's only $2,500.  In a word?  Hales?  Hales?  No, that's two words.  This phone is unique because it has an HDMI input, which means you can connect it to your Sony camera and use it as a viewfinder, which is kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's great having a larger monitor like that and especially something that's got a great resolution to be able to see.  More so from the videographer perspective, not necessarily for the photography side, but I love that idea.  You can pinch and zoom and all of that.  You can get a feetwell monitor for maybe $150, but the nicer ones like the Atomos Ninja, that's a couple hundred bucks.  You only have that one functionality where here you at least get a phone out of it, but it's still too much in my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you're excited about the Westinghouse All Electric Kitchen, you'll be very excited about Nothing.  The founder of OnePlus, Carl Pei, has started a new company called Nothing.  This is not a joke.  Brilliant.  It's a company about nothing.  $7 million in seed funding.  Investors like YouTuber Casey Neistat.  Wait a minute.  There we go.  Casey made enough money that he can invest in companies now?  Nothing?  Neistat's been making a killer now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You only have to have a million to be an accredited investor.  Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman all investing.  I think they might have made a mistake because here's the mission statement.  Nothing's mission is to remove barriers between people and technology to create a seamless digital future.  We believe the best technology is beautiful, natural and intuitive to use.  When sufficiently advanced, it should fade into the background and feel like nothing.  Which is what you're going to get if you invest in this company.  If we short it, let's short it.  I would short nothing.  Gladly.  Isn't that the mission of IoT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The home of IoT?  Nothing is the mission?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's ambient intelligence that delivers what you want when you want nothing else.  Yes, I'm all for it.  It's hard though.  Yeah, very hard.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Company about nothing.  All right.  Poor Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, we're still on the shorter end.  No, the cherries are long gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The cherries are long gone.  All right.  That's why I leave the pits in.  It takes longer to eat them.  That's my story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then I have something to spit at you.  I'd be like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Coming up next, it's our picks of the week.  This week, I'm going to start with Stacey's thing.  What's your pick of the week this week, Stace?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, we're doing it.  We're there.  We're there.  OK, we're there.  This is the tunnel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You see that light?  It's the light at the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  The light in the tunnel.  My pick is not a thing.  My pick is something.  This is kind of silly, but I'm doing it anyway.  Y'all were talking about Bridgerton.  I say go for Hilda, which is a cartoon on Netflix for children.  I'm not going to lie.  It's based on a graphic novel.  And my daughter and I, who is my daughter is 14.  This is for seven year olds.  It is so low key.  It is so nice to have on.  And it is quite funny.  And it's basically this Finnish Scottish, not Scottish, Finnish or Scandinavian town.  This little girl named Hilda lives there.  It pulls from mythologies from the area.  And there's an elf that likes paperwork.  If you want to test it out as an adult, I would say go season one, episode seven, which is legit funny.  And even if you don't like cartoons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not normally a cartoon fan, but I think that if it's a cartoon made in Finland.  It's actually Canadian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's Canadian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's made in Canada.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Give me the Finnish keynote tomorrow.  Are you?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, yeah, I like, you know what?  We've at least and I've decided we're going to start only watching shows that are happy.  That's why we're watching the fabulous.  All creatures great and small.  Stacy hates because she's a Grinch.  She's a grump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  James Heron is not my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you're right, though, after you said in every episode he seemed to be or every it's a novel series of novels that became a TV show.  He seems to be sticking his hand up an animal orifice.  Everyone.  And there is every time I'm going up there.  There is there goes his hand again.  So you really ruined it for me to be honest with you.  That's not all I see.  That is all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right.  Hilda on Netflix.  If you got Netflix, watch Hilda.  Jeff Jarvis has a number for actually got a lot of numbers.  Pick one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, because I don't know, because you know, and retaliation might steal one from me last week.  So you never know.  What happened?  I could. What the hell?  Oh, so all right.  The fall of Silicon Valley.  Let me go to that one.  Oh, hell, where did it go?  Where did it go?  So Silicon Valley was already kind of falling apart before the pandemic.  The pandemic says that it's gotten a lot worse.  Rents are supposedly down 24 percent year over year.  That's bad.  That's good.  That's good.  Local sales tax collections are down by more than 40 percent.  So the town services won't be so good.  OK, so they ask people about how their companies are going.  So it's worth before the pandemic when asked where they want to start a company today.  A technologist said forty one point six percent in the San Francisco Bay Area.  After the pandemic, forty two percent distributed or remote.  Only twenty eight percent in the San Francisco Bay Area.  So I'm just saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Goodbye, Val.  Fine. Go move to Austin.  See how you like it.  Go. I don't care.  Wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a legit story on the changelog the scooter X brought up that hold up.  Did we talk about Google's new feature for the electric vehicle owners?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't.  They plan to use AI to plan electric car trips.  And you you're you have interest in this because you drive an electric car, don't you, Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I do. And this is like a huge like I am manually like it is such a pain in the.  Orifice.  The A.S.S. protocol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So they're going to use something that I have just been studying lately.  So I'm actually very interested in this called graph theory to solve.  It's basically a way of solving a puzzle.  The puzzle being I have I'm running out of electricity.  Where can I get a charging station that meets my needs within the range I have available to you?  The reason this is a challenge is because your Tesla has a certain kind of charger.  It actually comes with adapters.  So you can like I have dongles you can use.  Yeah, you can use anything.  But most other people can't use Tesla chargers because they don't have the supercharger dongle and so forth.  So this will only work with Android Auto.  Oh, wait a minute. I take it back.  It's Android Automotive. That's a different thing than Android Auto.  It's only going to work on electric vehicles that are using Google's specific automotive operating system.  Aka not your Tesla.  That basically means you're either using a Volvo or a Volvo.  It's either on the Polestar 2 or the Volvo XC40.  But Google says more cars are going to do that.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just put it in maps.  I mean, my God, people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, put it in maps.  That makes more sense.  I have a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm very excited when I get my Mach-E.  Ford has an app and you pair it to your car when you first get the car.  And then you just kind of get automated payment system at any chart.  You just pull up, plug it in.  It goes, I know you.  And you don't have to do anything.  So I'll let you know how that works.  That's going to be interesting.  When do you get the car?  Valentine's Day.  Very excited.  So we will be all electric because Lisa has a Chevy Bolt right now, which is ostensibly her son's who still doesn't have a driver's license.  He's 18.  I don't know if we're ever going to get rid of that bolt.  But that's all right.  We like it.  That's what we're driving right now.  That's our single car.  When I get the Mach-E Mustang Ford, I'll let you know.  But that uses the CCS fast charging combined system.  How fast is fast?  It really will...  Stacey knows.  It really depends on the amperage offered by how many watts you can get from that particular charging station.  You don't actually want to be too fast.  That really can hurt the battery.  Superchargers are usually pretty fast, right?  Half an hour to get half a tank, something like that.  It depends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sometimes now, like because they've been metering them.  Yeah.  So it's been kind of like, and it's cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll be able to.  Yeah, that's right.  It slows it down too.  I'll be able to use the Electrify America Chargers.  Those are the ones that VW had to build as part of its settlement for the diesel gate.  Oh, that's funny.  But they're putting in a lot.  They're spending a lot of money to put them all over the country.  I don't know if it'd be interesting.  And you probably saw that President Biden wants to improve electric infrastructure in the US.  He's pledged to spend billions of dollars to add more than half a million EV stations over the next four years.  So he's also very committed.  I think the federal fleet will go all electric.  He's very committed to doing this.  So I'm excited about that.  That's going to be good news.  Me too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, sorry.  I just was like super excited when I saw that.  I was like, we didn't talk about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is.  I've done the Giz Fizz myself and it is.  It's a lot of fun.  He's great, isn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My favorite truck, car, or vehicle?  My favorite car would be probably the BMW 7 Series or the Mercedes Benz S-Class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, you got some fancy taste there.  I got good taste.  Holy moly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just don't show it.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right.  Yeah, you can watch that.  It's on YouTube.  I didn't realize we put it on YouTube actually.  I think it's on Beatmaster.  Oh, Beatmaster does it.  Yeah, because we actually do not publish it at all.  You have to be here Saturday afternoon.  We just own it as soon as it's done.  We go, what Giz Fizz?  I don't know.  I don't know anything about that.  But apparently Beatmaster, who is from Switzerland and a neutral in all of this, posts it.  Thank you, Beatmaster.  My thing, I got an email from a listener who told me about a Kickstarter he was putting  together and I thought it was so cool.  You remember, Jeff, I'm sure the Tandy Model 100.  The Model 100.  Remember that?  I remember the Trash 80.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess I'm before that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, this was the one that was like the first laptop, the Model 100.  Oh, yes.  Remember that?  A little tiny screen?  Yeah, a little screen, but it was small.  I have one in my office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you do.  That's what journalists, I used it as a journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly.  See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pushed a coupler and a cassette recorder for the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a Model 100.  Does it bring back memories?  Yeah, I've got that in my office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well.  It is the TRS-80 Model 100.  Thus we called it in the field the Trash 80.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  But there is another Trash 80 that is even trashier.  So I always call this the Model 100 because that's to distinguish it.  So one of our, because I'm a geek, one of our listeners is doing a  Kickstarter.  You know, he knows how I love retro computers.  He's got a kit, a Model 100 kit that you build yourself, a single board expansion  computer.  Look at this.  It's aluminum.  It's only going to be 239 bucks.  Now you provide the Raspberry Pi or you could even put a small x86  motherboard in there.  No soldering required.  If you like that.  Complete with shoulder strap?  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Yeah, it's very retro.  You see the antennas?  I don't know what they do.  Yeah, what would they do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have no idea.  But it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Those are handles.  Yeah, it's hysterical looking.  Look at real full size keyboard.  Look at that screen.  That's no 40 lines.  That's a full size screen.  That's a model.  Yeah, yeah.  So if you have some nostalgia for the model, I love this.  I love this model 100.  I love the strap.  I missed that part.  The shoulder strap.  Now it's a bare bone.  So you don't get the computer.  You do get the screen.  You get the aluminum enclosure.  You get your choice of retro punk, silver or cyber punk, black, a screw hardware kit,  64 key programmable, mechanical keyboard.  Even comes with stereo neodymium speaker system.  Good speakers.  It's pretty cool.  So this is a listener, Jesse, founder of the Ready Computer Corporation.  This is one of those scratching my own itches.  He always wanted this.  It's not expensive.  You can find it on Kickstarter.  Search for Ready!  Model 100 on Kickstarter.  I told Jesse, yeah, I love this idea.  I'll give you a plug.  And I'll probably buy one because you know me.  I can't.  I'm a sucker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's that or short some stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  If I can't short stock, I'm buying retro computer gear on Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Until you get boreheaded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's nice.  Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.  Where's your key?  You don't have to.  I got it here.

Transcript:  He said that every hero has what he calls an ashes time, a time when the hero just sits  in the kitchen in the ashes by the stove and hang and just kind of regenerates.  It's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So like the phoenix before you rise back up.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like ashes and can I say it?  Asses.  Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're right.  You use ashes to make lye.  And the reason lye is so widely used in so many cuisines is because it's a common byproduct  of cooking.  You got ashes.  You got to do something with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like how we went full circle.  That was so nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Think about soap.  Think about soap.  The only reason we have soap is it's made of byproducts.  Fat rendered from animals and ashes from your fire.
