Which is right next door to Sugarland, Texas.  Stacey here.  Three hours away.  Yeah.  Stacey on iot.com.  Stacey's newsletter is at staceyoniot.com.  Her podcast is on theiotpodcast.com.  Right?  Am I right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also on Stacey on iot.  Just go to Stacey on iot.  Just go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go there.  And you have family coming.  And you showed us before the show  that you have a Gantt chart to organize.  Thanks Ganting.  Thanks Ganting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thanks Ganting.  Yes, to organize the workflow.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is also here.  What are you doing for tomorrow's feast?  Oh, as little as possible.  Good man.  Do you watch football?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, my son, poor him, is a Jets fan,  and so I started.  Oh dear.  Yeah, it's hard.  And Jake is.  So I started, but now I'm wondering  whether I should feel guilty for watching it all.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  You know, I feel guilty  because you're talking about the brain trauma  that football. Yeah.  And we're learning that this is really devastating  to everybody.  The sad story, Aaron Hernandez, the patriot  who went to jail for murder  and then committed suicide in jail,  he was, I think, 27 or 28.  The doctor who recently did the autopsy on his brain  said it was the worst case of,  what they call it, BCE. CTE.  CTE he'd ever seen in somebody so young.  He said he had the brain of an old man.  And so then you start to put that in context  that this guy, you know, he wasn't a murderer.  He was, his brain had been injured by years of football.  Very sad.  So you watch football?  I do, I love it.  I mean, what are you going to do?  But Lisa, who's really the real fan of the family,  same has the same qualms about it.  It's like, should we, maybe we should give it up.  I don't know.  Do you trust Alexa?  Cobra wants to know, Stacey, for your timings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yes, actually I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will this be your first Thanksgiving with the Echo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I've had the Echo since 2014.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, you're a pioneer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bought it the day it came out.  I was like, this is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that funny how you, I just did the same thing.  I mean, we got it immediately  and then still there are people who go,  I don't understand why you would want that.  What, what?  You would want this, trust us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am using my June Oven  and I have a lighting recipe for my family,  like for the dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's a little late, but we did,  Saturday we're going to do a cooking new screensavers,  including the June Oven, the Mellow Sous Vide Cooker,  which I love, by the way,  another super pricey internet connected gadget for cooking.  And we roasted potatoes in the June Oven  that came out perfectly.  We, and I can show you the video of the oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you have a Heston Q?  What's that?  It is a cooking appliance that is a pan.  It looks like a pan and you stick things on it  and, or it looks like a stove top.  Oh, it's a smart cooking system.  Yes.  So the Heston Q is, it's a smart fry pan  and then a burner plate basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like an inductance plate.  Or do you have the Thermomix?  Man, you've got gadgets galore.  And what's funny is these are all IOT gadgets.  They all have Bluetooth and that's crazy.  What's the Thermomix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, now this came out in Europe years ago  and basically it does everything for you.  People who, it's a $1,500 device,  but people who have it, love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's so weird.  It's, what is it?  It looks like a blender, but it's heating things.  It chops your food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It cooks your food.  It's magic.  Eats your food for you.  It does everything.  It does not eat your food, but yeah, it's kind of crazy.  I don't know how to, it's like something you would see  on Late at Night on the QVC channel, but it's-  Did you get this?  I didn't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She said 1400 bucks.  Oh, you didn't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've seen it.  Thermomix keeps track of your cooking time  and gives you precise and constant temperature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the access-  Thermomix will stop-  I'll buy it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The exact time you need.  You just have to wait until you hear the sound  that will remind you-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you'd need a college degree to operate this thing.  Cooking.  So I know a lot of-  Cooking.  Cooking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cooking.  Cooking.  That's what they used to call it.  Now they call it thermal mixing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know people use their Vitamix blender to make soup  because it does heat up  and your soup will get hot from the Vitamix,  but this looks like something-  Wow.  So you don't have this.  I'm glad to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't have that, no.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm only so fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did.  I got a-  I don't want to even go into it.  It's ridiculous.  What'd you get now, I'll let you know.  The problem with being a geek  and then having other hobbies like photography or cooking  is it just ends up being really expensive.  And it doesn't make you a better cook  or a better photographer,  but it's what-  And the photographers call it gas.  Gear acquisition syndrome.  And I got it.  I've got such bad gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Thanksgiving is tomorrow.  That's why we're talking about all this.  But today, a little Thanksgiving from Peter Thiel  who sold 73%.  Remember he was-  He's featured in the social network movie  as the first guy to invest in Facebook.  Mark Zuckerberg came to him and said,  I got this thing.  It's at Harvard right now.  He gave him half a million dollars, a small investment,  that made him a very, very wealthy man.  73-  Billion dollars, right?  Yeah, a billion.  He sold 160,000 shares for 29 million.  He still has $11 million worth of shares left  as of this morning.  So Facebook's up a lot, 58% this year,  so which makes Mark Zuckerberg 25 billion richer.  He's now worth $75 billion.  Thiel is a mere three billionaire, $3.2 billion.  But, well, you know, Thiel's also off the board  at Y Combinator, right?  Or he was an advisor at Y Combinator.  He's off the board there.  And he's now off the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is he off the board at Facebook?  It doesn't say that he's off the board.  I just tried to look it up.  But I would have to imagine at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a pretty big, I mean, he still has some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  God help us, he's getting ready to run  for Senate or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe he's-  He might.  Maybe he just wants to take a break and enjoy life, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think this is a guy who enjoys life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I was about to say,  I don't really envision him doing that.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always wonder, see, this is why I'll never be a billionaire  because you give me five bucks.  I go, okay, I'll see you tomorrow.  I'm like, okay, I'm off.  Time for my Enchirito.  Yeah, Enchirito time.  I'll never, that's a problem.  I give up too easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think that's really a problem.  Only in America in our ethos is that a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  Yeah, I know.  Hey, neither of you have bought the Pixel Buds yet, right?  Oh, I just canceled them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I canceled them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to return mine.  Mine stopped working.  Why'd you send yours back, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because they were the most uncomfortable things ever.  God, it felt like spiders clawing at my ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The sound quality was good,  although Sam Mishkovic had a pretty good piece  in Ars Technica in which he said,  and he has a broader musical taste, I guess, than I do,  but he listens to older music.  It doesn't sound as good.  It's tuned for modern pop music.  I didn't know, but there's a lot of sound shaping  going on in the Pixel Buds,  but I thought they sounded very good,  the music I was listening to.  I kind of liked the idea of it being in your ear,  but then it just basically, they stopped working  and I can't repair them.  I can't pair them to anything.  So now I have to call them and get a new one.  Did you un-pair them or?  Well, yeah, because it wasn't-  You had to un-pair them first.  It wasn't working, so I forgot them on my Pixel phone,  and then I never could repair them.  So the whole thing is, I mean,  and they've had such trouble with the Pixel phone.  I mean, I think it's okay now.  They put out an update that let me saturate the color more  and there's no burning on mine,  but still, what's going on, Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can we talk about that momentarily  because I have my own issue, which is-  You have the smaller Pixel.  You have the little one.  I have the smaller, I have the little Pixel,  the Pixel Mini.  The wee Pixel.  The wee Pixel.  So I called them because I was kind of sick  of having my NFC radio turned off,  so I was like, hey, my phone is clicking.  Can we, is there something you guys could do?  And they're like, well, we have an update  that addresses that.  But it's not out yet.  Okay, so he tells me it's out.  We've started pushing it, and I was like, great.  Could you push it down to me super fast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, yes, because I didn't have it,  and he's like, well, it'll be out to you in a few weeks.  And I was like, I am not on a carrier.  They are not Apple having to stagger their release times,  it's not like he's got 50 million of these out in the wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're on Google Fi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm on Verizon, but it's an unlocked phone,  so my carrier doesn't.  Push anything.  Right.  So, what this tells me is Google can't do an update?  An over the air update?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What this tells me is Google can't do hardware.  God, it's so frustrating.  It's very disappointing.  I mean, here they are, they're really kind of making  a push to compete with Apple.  And in some respects, they do.  The camera's great, right, Stacey?  You love your camera?  The camera's, yeah, it's great.  But in other respects, they just,  I mean, this is not as good a screen,  and as either the Samsung Notes or S8s  or the Apple iPhone X, it's just not a very good screen.  And then it's got buzzing and clicking on the Pixel 2,  it's got a burden issue on the XL,  and the Pixel Buds, why did you return yours, Jeff?  You didn't return them, you just canceled them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just canceled them just today.  I remember the show coming up,  oh, better cancel them before it's too late.  I just read the reviews too often.  The pairing is what killed it for me.  Yeah, well, it's broken.  I wanna be able to operate among three devices seamlessly,  and you gotta unpair and repair,  and you gotta put them back in the case, do so, oh, forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plus, the translation is dopey.  It works much better just using it as always on the phone.  Because the person, so the real problem is  the translation that's being made is you hear it,  but the person who made, who talked to you  in the other language doesn't hear it,  so can't correct it.  And since it does make mistakes,  it's really better to do it on the phone  where both sides can hear the translation  and say, no, no, no, that's a mistake,  what I meant to say was, you need to be able to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a gimmicky thing, because they said,  okay, we can put an assistant on the Buds.  Oh, what can we do with it?  Oh, I don't know, we'll translate.  Yeah, we'll translate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So actually, I think one of our chatters has it right.  Which is, where is it?  I wanna give you a quote, basically,  that Google's not a hardware manufacturer.  Well, you know, it's what you just said.  It's an information company.  It's an information company, that's the quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or what you just said, Google is in fact like Apple  in the sense that it's no longer wowing us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but Apple has wowed us with the iPhone X.  Apple is not 100% consistent,  but they know how to manufacture.  And the AirPods do exactly what the Pixel Buds don't.  And it would behoove you if you take the headphone jack  out of a phone to provide a good wireless alternative,  or you've really just screwed your users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if you want wired ones,  there are very few good USB-C wired headphones.  Oh, are there any?  There are like five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they give you an adapter, so you could use any headphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, my adapter stopped working,  so I'm getting a new dongle.  I'm getting a new dongle, how awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And how quickly are you gonna lose the adapter?  It's just, or did you buy five of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But yeah, it is really frustrating  to take something out that worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I see no reason the size of this phone,  why can't, I'm sorry, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I was gonna say, and it's my fault for buying  the Pixel phone, but I really like being on stock Android.  And Google, my God, I'm your most loyal customer here.  These are the people who are like,  we love you, Google, we love Android.  Why must you screw us over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had the marketing director from OnePlus  on All About Android last night.  Yesterday, the OnePlus 5T came out.  And this might be the phone,  I'm not gonna get it, because I already have a Pixel.  The camera isn't as good as the Pixel.  Why can't I click this?  Maybe they're not selling it anymore.  But this is kind of everything the Pixel 2 XL  should have been, including a headphone jack, and isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ooh, maybe I should buy that.  Maybe I should send my handset back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, this is the big, big though.  It's more Pixel 2 XL.  It does have dual lenses.  I think Google has done,  one thing Google should really get credit for,  they have proven that they can do with a single lens  many of the same things that dual lens cameras do.  And I think it's actually a better camera than the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Single lens and lots of processing power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, computational skill, yeah.  But the OnePlus 5T is Oxygen OS,  which is a really pretty pure Android experience.  So, I kind of regret now,  and by the way, 550 bucks instead of eight or 900 bucks.  What's that song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Regrets, I've had a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  500 bucks for six gigs of RAM and 64 gig storage,  but they actually make an eight gig of RAM version  and 128 gig storage for 60 bucks more, $559.  Yeah, the charging's really fast.  It charges from zero to 100 in an hour.  Wow.  Jason Howell has it.  I played with it a little bit.  I came very close to ordering it,  and I thought, well, I can't really justify it.  I just bought this thousand dollar Google phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could send it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm gonna send the Pixel Buds back or get them fixed.  You're right, because it's one size fits all.  If you don't like how it fits, you're not gonna like it.  It's kind of on top of the ear.  You've got this big round thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and my ears are really tiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, my wife has the same problem.  She tried them, she said, I can't use them, they're too big.  She can barely use the AirPods.  I'm sorry, Jeff, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I was just saying the same thing.  If they don't stick in the ear, they're gonna fall out,  and I hate that feeling, and it's not gonna work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Again, it's like a spider just perched there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you, I'm more disappointed than anything.  I really want there to be a good competitive environment.  HTC's gone by the wayside.  I think Sony, unfortunately,  although they make kind of nice hardware,  it's uninspiring, and I don't really see  the big future for them.  LG, maybe, OnePlus, maybe, but really,  the king of Android has to have a reference design  that is kind of top flight, and it's very disappointing.  We need the competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although, if anyone wants to share  some nice wireless headphones that will not break the bank,  feel free to share them in the chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The AirPods are the best right now,  but it's not cheap, it's 160 or 150.  It's definitely the best that's out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I can't use my AirPods with this, can I?  Yeah, any Bluetooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can?  They're just Bluetooth headphones.  You get more features if you use it with an iPhone,  just as you get more features if you use a Pixel Buds  with a Pixel 2, but it's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they also feel like they're falling out of the ear?  A little bit.  Yeah, you said I can't feel them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They go a little farther in the ear,  but see, the one thing I did like about the Pixel Buds,  they had that wire, so if they fall out,  they're kind of there.  I like the wires.  The AirPods, they're just loose.  Yeah, I don't mind the wire.  The AirPods are just flying free.  Fly free, little AirPods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got my mini today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh.  Oh, I got mine too, but I got it a while back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't got my coupon yet.  Oh.  You're kidding me.  They said within a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you sure it didn't go into updates or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, let me go to my Gmail.  Maybe it went somewhere I wasn't looking like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was really impressed with, I put it downstairs,  and I'm really impressed so far  with Google's calendar efforts,  although I find it hard to like...  It would be so cool if I could just tell it  to put something on my calendar,  but it's really actually kind of hard  to think through the process  to say all the right words to put something on your calendar,  so that was a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the problem all along, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm like...  Syntax.  Set an appointment for accounting at 4 p.m. on November 4th.  It got it, and it got it when I set it a different way too,  although it didn't recognize accounting,  it said counting, but that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's close enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it now has...  It personalizes, so it can put my voice on my calendar  and Andrew's voice on his calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think this is specifically for Google Home,  they've added these features.  You go to the Google Assistant settings,  scroll down to Services,  there's a Google Calendar icon there,  so you just kind of expand that menu out,  and you can choose a default calendar.  Okay.  Availability.  Okay, so there's more stuff.  So, and you're saying it's doing a good job.  Ah, it's so hard, because I have...  Like you, I'm all in on the Echo.  I don't know if I want two assistants in every room.  But the price is right.  These minis are 30 bucks, I think,  with the Black Friday deal.  If you had neither now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  both of you, if you had neither, which would you buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google Home.  Actually, we did our gift guide this morning,  and Google Home was our gift guide item,  or the Sonos One, if you want two speakers in one.  So I would not do the Echo.  That's a big deal, that's interesting, Stacey.  Yeah, because I have been all in on the Echo forever,  but Google is smarter, and now it has almost every...  It doesn't have the June Oven skill  where I tell it to pre-heat my oven, which is nice.  Well, that's it.  Echo does that?  Yeah, have you not enabled the June Oven skill?  No.  Oh, Leo, what are you doing with your time?  You could be telling Madam A to pre-heat the oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a big problem in general with all of these,  what I call discovery,  the ability to figure out what the hell they can do,  and then turn it on and then remember it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's true, yes.  Andrew was actually mad at me when I was doing it,  because he's like, you didn't tell me we could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm like, I'm so sorry.  You didn't tell me either, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bought that June Oven because of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was also on our gift guide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, it was expensive,  but we use it all the time.  Lens is now rolling out to Google Assistant as well.  I have it, I have it, I have it.  Oh, so you take a picture of something  and it tells you what it is.  Yeah, so I'll just leave it here.  Let's find something and take some pictures of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm gonna take a picture of this item,  and it's gonna tell me, let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you took a picture of the Google Home.  I found home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it says.  If it didn't know that.  I found this Google Home.  So what all can you do with this lens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just point it at things and click on them  and it'll tell you what it finds about them.  It's a search query.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not just buying it, it's not just products.  No, no, no, no, it's anything.  I do like the squeeze part of the Assistant.  So how do I get her to look at it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm forgetting that.  So there's a, on the bottom right,  go to Assistant, on the bottom right,  there's an icon, click on that, it opens the camera.  I don't have the camera yet, that's the problem.  Well, what does it look like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Show me what it looks like.  It looks like your normal Assistant  with a keyboard on the left and a microphone.  No, show it to me, close up.  Where's the camera part?  Oh, you're right, poor Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I have too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so now I have seen in photos.  So if you take, you can do that if you take a photo,  you can then post, post-hawk, or is it propter-hawk?  Post-hawk, you can take a picture.  Here, bring me, oh yeah, let's see if it knows a TIE fighter.  So I'll do a close-up of a TIE fighter.  There we go, that's a Star Wars thing for you people.  And then, is that the lens icon?  I can't remember what the, yeah, yeah.  It says, I'm not seeing this clearly.  Is that the logo you're talking about, Jeff, with the,  it says kind of a square, incomplete square  with two blue dots in it.  A little kind of Instagram with a gap.  Yeah, I'm not seeing this clearly.  What can Google Lens do?  And then you can search the image on Google,  which of course will immediately find you.  Oh, it thinks it's origami.  Well, okay.  It's not wrong.  Maybe if I take a picture of the front.  The problem is I do this stuff and then I go,  why is there all this crap in my Google photos?  What are these pictures of weird things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you know, I have pictures of strange men  because I'm always taking pictures of founders and people.  And my daughter scans through my photos and is like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mom, who are these guys?  So this, it's kind of cool.  So it does, it acts like it's looking dot for dot, right?  So it has all these dots moving around,  which is just obviously a bogus animation.  It thinks it's model aircraft.  That's close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bring me something else.  And take a picture of the logo behind you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you think you'll know Twit?  Yeah, I think I know.  Wow, that would be impressive.  I would be very happy if it knew that.  All right, I took a picture.  Now you go into the photos, you press this button,  watch the animation, it's so cool.  Hmm, not seeing this clearly.  Oh no.  It thinks it looks like a Stargate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just did the logo, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no, I'm not gonna.  Okay, how about, all right, we're gonna do,  this is so boring.  How about your lunch?  Yeah, yeah, I'll do my salad.  No, here's, see if it knows Batman.  But it's not your everyday Batman.  That's not fair, yeah, that's not gonna.  It's kind of a funky Batman.  Batman, fictional superhero.  It knew.  Character created by Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger,  pulled up the Wikipedia result.  That was pretty good.  Oh, I know, I got one I know it'll get.  Let's get this.  It might be the angle is fooling it.  And does it work better if there's nothing else  in the image or is it pretty good at figuring out?  It's not figured out.  It doesn't know an Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you're kidding me.  I'm screenshotting that.  You know what's harder for it is in the photo version,  you're actually, you click on the,  you point at the thing itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would make more sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which makes more sense, yeah,  because it's too big a photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's too much for it to figure,  it's a little brain to figure out.  All right, there we go.  We wasted another 10 minutes doing stupid stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can talk about things.  We're time wasters.  Say again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We could talk about things like.  What would you like to talk about?  Well, I'm looking at stories.  I gotta be honest guys.  I have been like not paying attention to the news today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we got the big one in Peter Thiel.  Well, FCC has decided that you don't need net neutrality.  Well, let's take a break and let's talk.  That's a fairly big story.  That's gonna, we're gonna spend some time with that.  Very irritating.  Very irritating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Leo, I never say I told you so do you.  Except for one case was the Chromebook.  The other one is you said give Ajit Pai a chance.  Ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What a fool I was.  Well. Yes, you were.  Everybody deserves a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he's used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's not getting another one.  No.  Let's take a break.  We'll talk about what the FCC plans to do.  What's going on?  What you can do about it?  What it all means.  Jeff Jarvis, Stacey Higginbotham,  this week in Google, our show today brought to you  by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  If you're out there looking for a new house  or maybe you like your house  but you wanna get a little money out of it and refi,  maybe get a lower interest rate or lower your payments,  you oughta know about Quicken Loans,  the best mortgage lender in the country.  One of the biggest, I think second biggest,  only that big bank that you really don't wanna do business  with for many reasons.  Quicken Loans is awesome.  They're very cool, very high tech.  Number one in customer satisfaction  for mortgage approval and mortgage servicing  year after year after year with JD Power.  People love Quicken Loans.  And I love them.  They want a little bit more in my heart  when they created Rocket Mortgage.  It's a completely online mortgage approval process.  So that means you don't have to go to the bank.  You don't have to get up.  You can do it on your phone.  You can do it from the couch.  You could do it in an open house.  Yes, an open house,  because you don't also, you don't have to go get paperwork.  You don't have to find your bank statements  or your pay stubs.  You don't have to go up to the attic to get tax returns.  Everything they need is online.  All you have to do is say, here's my basic information.  They'll say, ah, you give us permission to,  you know, whatever it is they do,  their magic with their trusted financial partners.  They get the information.  And then based on your income assets and credits,  they crunch the number and numbers  and they can analyze all the home loan options.  And then they'll say, okay, what's your down payment?  What's your term?  What's your rate?  What would you like?  And they'll find one that fits your needs.  And all of this happens in seconds.  You can be approved.  You could be at an open house,  be going out the door and say, wait a minute, let's buy this.  And then before you leave, show the realtor, we're approved.  Rocket Mortgage, I love this,  is aptly named by Quicken Loans.  Apply simply, understand fully every step of the way,  and mortgage confidently.  It's easy to find.  Just go to rocketmortgage.com slash twig  and do use that last part,  because that gives us credit.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twig,  equal housing, lender licenses, all 50 states,  at MLSconsumeraccess.org, number 3030.  Quicken Loans brings you Rocket Mortgage,  and we thank them for their support of this week in Google.  Thank you, Quicken.  Thank you, Quicken.  So we knew it was coming.  Jit Pai, the chairman of the FCC, the new Republican FCC.  There's, I think, three out of the five commissioners  are now Republican.  That's what happens every new president.  They switch parties.  They have to, though, nominate equally from both parties,  and then the chairman can be whoever,  in this case, a Republican.  Former Verizon lawyer, Jit Pai,  former FCC commissioner,  announced his new net neutrality plan.  And December 14th, they'll vote on it.  It will ascend.  He says, I don't wanna micromanage the internet.  I think that we don't need to regulate this.  These companies will do a fine job,  a fine job of making the internet free.  He says net neutrality rules are heavy-handed.  They are stifling the internet.  And come December 14th, there will be no rules.  There will be no rules.  These are the Obama-era regulations.  We've certainly been in a world without these regulations.  In fact, it's only recently that they were,  the Title III regulations were put into place  by his predecessor, Tom Wheeler.  Title II.  Title II.  Title III is another one.  Title II, thank you.  Ajit Pai says, President Clinton got it right.  Wow, you never thought I'd hear that.  In 1996, when he established a free market-based approach  to this new thing called the internet  and the internet economy we have as a result  of this light touch regulatory vision.  Well, that sounds right.  What's wrong with that?  We saw companies like Facebook and Amazon and Google  become global powerhouses with no net neutrality regulations  precisely because we had light touch rules  that apply to this internet.  The internet wasn't broken in 2015  when these heavy-handed regulations were adopted.  So maybe we're over-exaggerating  the potential negative consequences of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Will this set?  Yeah, give Ajit Pai a chance.  Yeah, I've heard that up in the book before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other thing they're doing that's very infuriating  is they're also saying,  by the way, states don't bother making regulations  on your own, we'll handle this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I thought these people believed in states' rights.  No, only when it-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, as someone in Texas, I'm sorry,  as someone who lives in Austin, Texas,  I can tell you that is most assuredly not the case  since our legislator stripped us  of all of our municipal rules,  including being able to handle plastic bags  and the size of trees that could be cut.  Thank you.  I have lots of opinions slash information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, the size of trees?  What's the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so Austin won't let you trim or cut down trees  of a certain size because we want to preserve  the big trees, right?  Oh, I see.  I would say this really upset Governor Abbott,  who, when he was attorney general, lived in Austin  and ran into the city and had an issue over his tree.  So this year, he was like, that was one of his examples.  That sanctuary cities and our plastic bag ban  all really hacked him off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the chairman's proposal, which he calls  restoring internet freedom order,  would mark a shift in authority and emphasis.  Instead of the FCC regulating how ISPs operate,  the Federal Trade Commission would handle enforcement  of net neutrality violations.  Some have said that's not gonna work very well.  They're overburdened as it is.  Pai said the FCC will still require transparency.  Any business practice that would affect  the offering of a service has to be disclosed  to the consumers.  The ISPs have to create a publicly available webpage  where it's all spelled out and entrepreneurs  can understand exactly how these businesses are operated.  FTC had long had authority prior to 2015,  and the result was pretty clear.  They took targeted action against the bad apples,  let everyone else thrive in a free market.  I think consumers and companies are better off as a result.  You know, that's pretty compelling.  Okay.  So there's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm like, Jeff, I'm going after it  because this is something I know a lot about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do it, go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All the way back to Jenikowski,  so way, way back in 2008 timeframe,  as the internet got bigger,  there was always a question about the FCC.  Did it even need to exist in the internet era?  So part of this isn't just,  hey, let's tackle net neutrality.  Part of this is let's take as much away  from the FCC as possible.  And I think there is actually a valuable debate to be had  over do we need a particular regulatory agency,  has it outlived its time, blah, blah, blah.  Like we still have railroad commissioners.  They have a function, but you know.  So that's one thing.  So part of this is just disempowering the FCC,  but, and then we get into these rules.  Doing anything on a case by case basis  at the government level is almost always harmful  to consumers.  If you think back to one of the big cases that launched this,  it was Comcast actually blocking BitTorrent traffic.  And the case was all the way back,  I think it started in 2007.  It took over 17 months to get Comcast  to change its policies to not block BitTorrent.  And so if there is harm,  it is possible the government will intervene  absent actual rules,  but it's also a process that will take a long time.  In 17 months in the life of like a startup or an app  that people want to try to use and can't,  that will kill them, done.  So that's one.  And I'll stop talking and let Jeff talk some too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I was just going to point to a link I put up.  Let me just before you do that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just want to back up Stacey's first point,  which is really an interesting point  that I hadn't thought about that the FCC,  this is all really about eliminating the FCC  because a week ago they also relaxed  their media ownership rules.  So that it used to be you couldn't own more than two  of the top four radio stations in the city.  You couldn't have a newspaper and radio stations.  All of that's gone.  So media ownership regulations.  And that's really good for companies like Sinclair  about to buy the Tribune Corporation.  It adds to the consolidation of media voices  in this country.  And I think that's a terrible thing,  but it is exactly the same idea,  which is we don't need to regulate this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And here's the, so I wrote a tweet two days ago, I think.  It's actually like the most popular tweet I've ever done.  And it's talking about all the things  that the FCC is currently doing.  Another item that it's doing is it's saying that  because it used to regulate copper wires,  there's been a long running process to eliminate copper.  And the FCC was like, hey, it's cool  if you want to not have your copper network,  but you got to have something equivalent there.  So you can't just rip out your copper  and offer something crappy like satellite  or mobile broadband that's super expensive.  What they're doing now is they're saying,  hey, you know what, don't worry about that equivalency.  Wireless is fine, that's good.  So that is another sphere of influence  where the FCC will no longer play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, for a long time when Verizon put in Fios,  it would cut the copper illegally.  And the homeowner was responsible for saying,  no, no, no, I want my copper lines  so that I can leave if I want, I can go to a competitor.  Once they cut the copper, bye bye,  you have to use Verizon Fios.  So that's an example of why you want  to preserve some of this stuff.  Ajit Pai says with these new media ownership rules,  the FCC is dragging the broadcast rules  into the digital age.  So maybe we are in a new era where we don't need  an old fashioned commission like the FCC  to voice things like equal time.  If we had competitive landscape,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah, I might agree, but we do not.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At its core, this is still an anti-competitive area.  And I think people, like there is a false argument out there  and I yelled at my former colleague Adam Leshinsky  about it this morning, which is that Google, Netflix,  the original protectors of net neutrality from back in 2008,  they have all the power now and they don't need protection  from the big guys.  And that is true, these guys do have the power.  And actually about a year ago, a lot of them  weren't even worried about net neutrality.  They were kind of like shrugging it off.  Yeah, Google's gone back and forth on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  But Twitter needs protection.  Well, that's the point.  And not even Twitter, although admittedly,  I would like to make sure that we don't get discriminated  against, YouTube's gonna be fine, they can afford it,  Netflix is gonna be fine, they can afford it.  I can't afford to go through a toll road  to get to our audience and it's not even me.  What about a new person, an innovator,  who wants to create the next Netflix or the next Google,  they're gonna face all kinds of roadblocks.  Truthfully, I think Facebook and Google love this.  This is what they secretly in their heart of hearts want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It protects them.  No, I think they have more principles than that.  A, B, the things that are gonna make them grow,  they see are the things that are gonna start,  they can buy.  And if things can't start, they are threatened  with stagnation.  Netflix loves it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Netflix even said, didn't even say,  we don't need net neutrality, we got this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they can afford it, but in fact it's okay.  But what's the next Netflix gonna do?  So look at the link I put up from Portugal,  is life without.  No, I'm sorry, yeah.  Is it BS?  Okay, that's what I was gonna ask.  I've seen that link all over Twitter,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you gotta be really careful to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I was gonna ask, the question I was gonna ask.  It was a Google Translate and it looks like it's just,  for all these reasons, just give us 49.99.  Yeah, and a lot of people are using this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  as an example of what it will look like  that you'll have to pay.  But what it really is, it's a telecom,  it's a cell carrier in Google, in Portugal.  And we talked about this on the security now.  And somebody from Portugal explained,  you're paying to be zero rated on these services.  And it is an even unlimited zero rating.  You're paying to say, I'm gonna get two extra gigabyte.  This'll pay for two more gigabytes on Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but wait, wait, wait, why is it BS  if they're separating out the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have it like for certain services.  It looks like they have a music package.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you're so certain services are included there.  And if you wanna do Leo's musical hits from the 70s,  you're not there, you're F'd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is zero rating, which is a net neutrality issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not exactly zero rating though,  because you're paying for it.  Paying for it.  And it's a limited amount.  You're basically, basically they're selling you  a basket of additional bandwidth that covers these services.  Now I agree, it's not neutral in the sense  that it doesn't cover all music services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so wireless is different,  it's fundamentally different than wireline.  So that's something to think about  from a technological standpoint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's the picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been angry with Google for that, but go ahead, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's a reason why.  Wireline is almost unlimited in the sense  of how the packets get to you.  When you talk about wireless though,  there's a limit to how many bits you can cram  into a Hertz of spectrum.  And that is physics.  So it does cost more.  And you can't send out as much data over wireless  as you can over like a fiber connection, right?  So that's a fundamental issue.  Now, are we reaching those limits on a consistent  and regular basis?  That I kind of doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a really simple way to do this,  which is simply say, here's our price per bit on landlines.  Here's our price per bit on wireless.  It's gonna cost more on wireless  because it's more expensive for us.  That's that.  We don't care about what's what bit.  We just, here's what it costs per bit.  And then that's, to me, that solves it, right?  And if you say, well, I want more bits, I'll pay for it.  If I want more speed, I'll pay for it.  And I think that solves it.  But the problem is discriminating against individual bits  and saying that bit's not the same as that bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so you can't measure just the bits.  You've also got to think about how many people  are asking for certain bits at a certain time  because congestion is real on wireless networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but paying for the bits solves that as well.  Because if that many people are using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You would have to do it like a toll.  That would be congestion pricing.  You would have to do it on a toll kind of basis.  So like at certain times.  The challenge is, and I don't, I mean, I am very,  I guess libertarian from an economic standpoint.  I don't necessarily think that a care,  like an ISP should charge, should say,  okay, it cost me five cents to deliver this bit.  And consider, many of them have unionized workforces.  You've got to consider the costs that go into it  from an infrastructure and ongoing maintenance.  So once you account for all of that, it costs five cent.  Okay, that's incredibly expensive,  but let's just say five cents per.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  100 megabytes or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is not so crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it costs this much.  And then I think that they can charge  whatever the heck they want.  As long as someone else can come in,  build that same infrastructure and charge less.  And that right now is where our policies  we're trying to head didn't quite make it.  And so now we have this stupid area  where we've got only a few companies  that actually have the literal capacity  to offer broadband services.  And they can, and that's why we're trying to regulate  what they can and can't do,  because they're the only source  for this fundamental good infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what you're really regulating,  it's the opposite of regulating, isn't it Stacey?  Aren't you saying that this is the internet,  here's what you can't mess up?  Isn't it kind of a negative?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sure.  I mean, it's, this is the internet.  You can't charge exorbitant rates  because we don't have a competitive market, basically.  Like normally if we'd have a competitive market here,  like let's say we put Conduit in,  let's say everybody who put in Fiber had to either share it  or just put in Conduit, then we wouldn't have this problem.  We would have other people coming in  to offer these services.  I just-  Like BT.  Like BT, although BT has gotten in trouble in the past  for the way it's tried to price people.  Amsterdam is probably the best and most famous example,  but Amsterdam's a city.  Amsterdam has dark fiber and everyone,  anyone can run a service over it, anyone.  Amsterdam also says that broadband is basic right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a model I really like.  And many people have talked about this,  that the municipalities, the localities  should own the infrastructure and then rent it out to ISPs  to ride on top of it.  And then you'd have more competition.  But we failed at that back-  It should be more like a utility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but when we did the Telecommunications Act  back in 1996, we decided our competition  was cable versus copper and the companies that own it  will always own it.  And you can't take that back.  I mean, these companies have made a legitimate investment.  So it becomes this weird game of like,  if they behave badly, how do we stop them?  And that's what the net neutrality rules were for  because the operators were behaving badly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't actually, you could take it back  with eminent domain and you could all,  in many cases, for instance, the cable company  in most towns and ours certainly operates  as a monopoly franchised by the city.  The city council said, yeah, Comcast, you're our incumbent.  And if Comcast loses that contract,  they don't come take all their cable out of the ground.  They just go, goodbye.  Well, they don't?  They don't get any payoff?  Well, I'm not sure how those contracts work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Has that ever happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a really interesting question.  I was actually serving on the technology committee  for the city of Petaluma where we debated this,  but I just think politically it's very difficult  because in effect you're telling your constituents,  yeah, we're not gonna have cable for a while.  Or your Comcast is not gonna be your cable company.  Suddenly it's Cox.  It's happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And who's gonna come invest in your town  and install things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, well, I mean, you can make the case  that they have made back their investment  in the infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I don't, it's been.  They'll make the case that they're always in the red.  But that's clearly not the case.  And it's a far future payback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But see, I do think that, I guess what I'm saying  is I think there are, it's not completely without merit  to say, well, there might be a way to make this work  without government regulation.  I think government regulation is tricky of the internet.  That's tricky.  It is.  Others have pointed out,  we're not regulating the internet,  we're regulating the companies that provide the internet.  But I don't know if that's a distinction with a difference  with a distinction or a distinction with a difference.  But there's no thought.  No, I think it's actually a really important distinction.  I have no problem regulating Comcast.  That's not a problem.  They are regulated.  They should continue to be regulated.  They're regulated in other ways as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Stacey, is that the better way to say  what I asked you a minute ago?  That the internet is unregulated.  Eric, go, you who come along and screw it up,  we regulate you.  I'm trying to come up with a prompt with it.  There's no, I feel like the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  should be treated like infrastructure.  Yes.  So like roads, like power.  Like water and power.  So like utilities.  Yeah, they're utilities.  So you should have regulations.  Not the services upon it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Google's not a utility, but the wires are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Now, if we want to talk about regulation though,  so there is, I think we should be having a conversation.  It sounds like we might be getting it  about the power that has accrued to companies  like Google and Facebook  by virtue of their massive data stores.  I think that's an interesting debate  that people are going to start having,  but that is totally separate from net neutrality.  And people who equate,  well Google and I'll have all this power,  I'm like, yeah, sure, fine.  Let's talk about regulating them if you want.  But that doesn't, it's a false equivalency  in the net neutrality debate.  Google may not need to take advantage of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm gonna give you guys an assignment.  I would like, there's a couple of things I think we need.  First of all, I think we need a way to describe this  to normal people and in general  that acknowledges that there are two sides to this,  that explains it clearly.  That's by the way the biggest problem right now  is the American public has no idea  what net neutrality means or why it would impact them.  And in a way that's persuasive for,  I think what we all agree,  which is that the internet needs to be free and open  and all bits are created equal.  But how do we express that in a way  that people will get and support?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo, I have written probably 50,000 words on this topic  and I still don't know how to do it.  So I was thinking about this.  It's a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a challenge.  How about this?  The FCC just turned the internet into your cable company.  Everybody hates their cable company  and the structure basically is the same.  The cable company gets all the power.  They decide what you get.  They bundle things at their own will.  They decide what you can and can't do.  They overprice, charge you for it.  The FCC just turned the entire internet into your cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the cable companies are kind of getting screwed though  now by like rebroadcasting rights  and some of these by some of the content companies,  which is meaning their power is, what's the word?  Dissipating somewhat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know what I'm trying to say is,  I think Leo was asking for what tugs  at your emotional heartstrings.  How about- We all hate our cable company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me, yes, that's true.  I also think it's not,  I mean, we've seen those pictures of,  if the internet were run by the cable company,  you would buy the premium package,  which would include YouTube and Skype.  And if you didn't want to pay that much,  you'd get the medium package,  which would include Vimeo and Tango.  I honestly don't think that's gonna happen.  I don't think it's gonna be as obvious  and as awful as that.  I really think it's gonna be more subtle.  Things like bandwidth shaping or blocking BitTorrent.  I don't think they're gonna come out and say,  okay, if you want access to YouTube,  that's a buck more a month.  I can't imagine that actually happening.  If it does, then you really,  then people are gonna be up in arms.  Back in the day, they would have been free to block Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would have happened.  So that'll happen in like 10 years  or maybe five years even.  We will go from, I can't believe they're doing that.  Now remember, I mean, what'll happen slowly  is there will be bandwidth shaping  and maybe there will be some form of zero rating.  It's kind of like what the airlines have done  with charging people for basic economy.  So what you'll end up with is a more fee-based internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do.  Yeah, if you had asked me 10 years ago,  you think an airline would ever charge you for carry-on,  I'd have laughed at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think you might be in that same position today  with this. It's a slippery slope.  It is.  In the carriers and ISPs, bless their hearts,  they will go rush down that slope  faster than you can imagine.  Because they can.  And because these are companies  that are not innovative,  that are designed around eking the most profits  that they can out of this massive infrastructure investment.  And that is a mindset.  And it's not an incorrect mindset.  It's from an era a long time ago.  So if you think about it like that,  then you understand where they're coming from.  And I think that's respectful of both sides.  I mean, it's just a mindset  that feels utterly foreign in this era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's an analogy I got from Reddit  that I thought was not too bad.  A Redditor asked to explain why net neutrality is important.  He said, well, imagine that you have a library in town  and you pay for a library card, 20 bucks a year,  whether you use it or not.  And so you go to the library, the librarian is very helpful.  But then when you go to check out some books,  she says, well, those books are going to cost more.  Like that book I wrote, so I'm going to give you that for free.  This book I agree with,  so I'm going to give you that for cheap.  These books, I don't want you reading,  I'm not going to give them to you.  And the rest I'm going to charge you 20 bucks for.  So you say, well, that's no problem.  I'll just go to the other library in town.  Oh, wait, there isn't one.  Is that kind of a good analogy?  Is it like that?  And will that happen?  Will cable companies say, will they tier the internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they've tried to tier the internet.  I remember when Time Warner Cable  wanted to tier the internet back in like 2008.  Oh, that was good times, good times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody said, just wait until,  you really want to see people scream bloody murder.  Wait until Comcast says, well, you can't get any free porn,  but you're more than welcome to subscribe to Cinemax.  Yeah.  Just wait till that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the better case will be,  it's things that you don't recognize as brands.  We'll cut off BitTorrent, we'll cut off a phone call, Skype.  We'll cut off some new protocol that's hungry.  We'll disadvantage it.  We'll sell you a service that guarantees the value.  It's like also going to hotels.  We're going to give you a purposely crappy service  for our advertised free wifi in your room,  but then we're going to charge you  a ridiculous amount of money for the use.  Actually, that's a good example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It will be like hotel wifi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which lie about it being wifi, about it being high speed,  and then rips you off in trying to charge you  to get to minimal standards of accessibility.  And then fails at that as I prove on every trip  in which I try to be on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's going to be really hard to convince people.  Part of the problem is you'll never know  what you're not getting.  You'll never know about the innovative startups  that just don't ever happen.  Because they won't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From an IoT perspective, I always say,  and there's some interesting,  probably too much nuance here,  but from an IoT perspective, I tell people,  oh hey, Comcast has a security offering.  Maybe they just will say, hey, you're Nescam.  Let's deprioritize those packets.  And then you may or may not know, but you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It happened with Netflix, remember?  Comcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that was peering,  and I don't know if we want to talk about peering  because that is a different layer of the internet,  but I am happy to dive into it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because I broke that story.  Here's why it's germane.  It's an example of how Comcast could disadvantage a company  by just not buying more interconnects, right?  Just, man, we're not going to buy more interconnects  until you give us some money.  So I mean, I think that's-  That's another way to disadvantage, yes.  Yeah, I think that that's relevant to the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's at the utility layer.  Which is what we should have be open and competitive.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You get the internet you deserve.  And I think that, well, for one thing,  the FCC has shown that it's completely willing to disregard  any public comment, even lie about-  That's another issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is a totally different issue.  And it is very upsetting what is happening  with public access to information, to meetings,  and the willingness to listen to comments.  So the FCC is one.  Austin just got sued again  for Public Information Act violations.  I'm feeling like the entire world is just,  oh, guys, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you.  It's funny, yesterday I was feeling kind of similar.  I was feeling, I was, you know,  the worst thing you can do is despair ever.  But I was perilously close.  How do you not?  It's kind of hard sometimes when you just,  one after another, these things happen and you just,  how could it get any worse?  Oh, it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, my wife is taking, watching tennis reruns now.  Yeah.  Just to turn something else on.  Parks and Recreation reruns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's my, like, I want to have faith in the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jake said last night he was going upstairs,  when he got home from Thanksgiving,  he said, I'm going to go watch fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I'm despairing again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, let's not despair.  Let us contemplate.  But what happens is bad behavior at the highest levels  engenders bad behavior lower down.  And what is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  People don't understand how tenuous a nation of laws is,  how tenuous a republic is.  It is easy to corrupt it from the top down.  Very easy.  It happens quickly.  We've seen it happen in Turkey.  We've seen it happen in Greece.  It is very easy.  I've seen it happen in Egypt.  As soon as there is a lack of respect,  as soon as there's a sense it's not fair,  as soon as you don't feel like we have the rule of law,  it crumbles instantly.  I'm reading right now,  rereading the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,  which is, of course, the classic William L. Schierer book  about the rise and fall of Hitler.  And I'm in the point where he is coming to power,  and it's terrifyingly familiar.  Well, I will tell you-  And everybody thought he was a buffoon, by the way.  The Americans thought,  oh, no, you don't have to worry about this guy.  He's never gonna be a chancellor.  What are you, crazy?  He's a nut.  He's a nut job.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ah.  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So can I follow up on an earlier story?  By the way, Hitler did everything he said he would  20 years before.  It was all laid out.  And everybody said, oh, he won't.  He'll be much more presidential when he's chancellor.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, so why do you think Comcast  is gonna magically change his-  No, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, I was playing devil's advocate.  But I do think it's important  if we're gonna have this conversation in public  that we acknowledge that there might be some merit  to the other point of view and figure out a way,  that's what politics is, is that we can-  Yeah, I agree with that.  That we can come to a mutual agreement  that everybody agrees, yeah, this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're dealing with rational people  with rational interests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and I think they are, so, well,  are we talking about the ISPs or are we talking about Trump?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we can stipulate that Comcast is greedy  and Comcast is gonna maximize profits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So again, I would say, okay,  greedy, maximizing profits, maybe.  Again, I say, look at that worldview.  And also, and I will tell you,  I am pro net neutrality because I am pro consumer,  but I spent years talking to engineers  at telcos and cable companies.  And I understand at a very fundamental level  how these networks work.  So I can understand their arguments.  Yes. And so I would say,  when I'm talking to you guys about stuff,  I am putting that perspective in there.  That's why I can explain wireline and physics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  That's why we're delighted to have you here.  No, I agree with you.  I agree with you.  You bring that perspective, yes.  But to your point about the politics, Leo,  you have a world where we believe in states' rights,  except when it comes to this,  the state can't actually decide,  or the city can't actually decide  to do its own internet rules.  Sorry.  But I'm a cynic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, same as it ever was.  I mean, going back to the founding fathers,  everybody pretends that we-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've got a worldview, a party that says,  we believe in pushing down to the states,  except in this case, we're not allowed to.  You believe in the one hand that we should open up  all ownership regulations around newspapers and TV stations.  We should let Sinclair merge with Tribune,  going way beyond the old bounds.  But CNN, no, no, no, no, you can't be part of AT&T,  because they don't like you.  When you're dealing with inconsistent,  politically motivated, emotionally motivated people,  then your effort to find that common ground  in negotiation falls apart.  That's all.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you know Comcast is greedy,  you can figure out how to deal with that.  You can serve the greed.  But when you're dealing with people who are irrational  or doing things for spite, it's a lot harder.  Yeah.  And speaking of spite.  Yes.  To update our earlier story,  it appears that Peter Thiel is trying to buy  the assets of Gawker.com,  so that he can shut it down,  so he can erase the archives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so just for those who don't know,  Gawker.com, which was founded by Nick Denton  and was a scandalous website that spoke truth to power,  and sometimes-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pretty much presaged the entire sex stories  we're going through right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, in many cases,  they were the first to report  on Louis C.K.'s rumors, for instance.  But they went one step too far  when they published a sex tape of Hulk Hogan.  And Hulk Hogan went to sue them in Florida court,  but unbeknownst to us, Hulk's lawsuit was funded  by this billionaire, Peter Thiel,  because Peter Thiel had his own acts to grind with Gawker,  because they had, I think inappropriately,  outed him some years before as a gay man,  and he didn't like that so much.  So he was happy to have this lawsuit, funded it, and won,  and essentially bankrupted Nick Denton and Gawker.  Nick sold Gawker to, I forgot, somebody.  But- Fusion.  Fusion, that's right. Fusion.  Fusion has the assets.  I know, Univision.  Univision. Univision.  Which owns Fusion.  So Univision has the, I guess, has the assets.  I know the nasty Gawker story- Except not Gawker.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that was not sold.  The Gawker.com name was not sold.  It is in the estate of the company once known as Gawker.com.  So now there is an effort to buy that.  So those pages are still up, that's the point.  Somebody's trying to buy that in the bankruptcy court,  because that's what's still in bankruptcy,  and Thiel is saying that he's the most qualified buyer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I can't, I mean, if he takes it all down,  I wouldn't be unhappy.  I would.  It's a bad story.  Eleosis.  It's a bad story.  They kind of did the same thing to me  that they did to Peter Thiel, and I'm not a public figure.  You could say, well, I agree, you need to out people  who are using their power and doing bad things,  but they also were completely willing to publish  salacious, sometimes untrue gossip  as a means to generate page views as well.  Let's not forget that.  And I don't think it was right for them to out Peter Thiel.  That's not germane to any conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think it was, I mean,  I'm not arguing that it was right to,  but it was one of those open secrets  that they were like, you know what,  let's just pop it out there.  Kind of like Kevin Spacey, but now that's out there.  That's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Peter Thiel being gay, there was no assertion  that he had molested people or done anything wrong  or illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was actually a tribute, a piece that was in tribute to.  Well, Owen, yeah, I think.  As far as Gawker was in tribute to anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't understand why Peter would be pretty upset about it.  I don't blame him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little, a little, he doesn't have to sell  his Facebook stock to afford Gawker.com.  He can afford Gawker.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He could, it's his lunch money probably.  Wow, so is Nick selling it off?  Is that what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, it's the estate, it's in bankruptcy.  So the creditors, I guess, own it, whatever that may be.  Nick's not dead, so it's not the estate, it's the.  No, no, a company has an estate.  Yeah.  Oh, it does?  Really?  A company has an estate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I apologize.  You knew what you were talking about.  So the assets of Gawker are still lying around.  Wow.  He was apparently not told that he could have bid for it.  That's what they complained about before, yes.  Yeah.  That would be kind of.  But he was not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shakespearean.  A creditor of any sort, right?  It was.  Oh, they didn't owe him money.  Oh, actually they might have.  The Hulk Hogan might have had more rights,  I think in this case.  Yeah, he might be owed money.  And Peter Thiel, Peter Thiel was just the funder.  He had no standing.  Hulk might have owned money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hulk might have said, I'll give you half of the settlement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or Hulk will buy gawker.com and then sell it to Peter Thiel  and make even more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think that would be bad.  Oh, I know you guys, I'm a bad person.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What else do you want to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there's more, there's more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have we done all the, have we,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  are you satisfied that we've done the net neutrality thing?  I mean, I think all that we could do at this point,  it's not a done deal by any means.  Congress might intervene.  The courts certainly will intervene.  There will be lawsuits galore.  And you know, I mean, maybe your internet  will get more expensive.  Maybe some startups that would have been nice won't.  And maybe, who knows, your cable company  to come to you with a tier plan that says  you have to pay more if you want to see YouTube.  So here, I'll say one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is just part of, in keeping with despair.  So I wrote a little something about net neutrality.  And what is most frustrating  is that we have spent so much time and effort  lobbying this, educating people about this,  regulating this, and we regulated it.  Although we started this process all the way back  in like 2005 with those pillars of the open internet  from Chairman Michael Powell,  after a tiny ISP, Green River,  in I think Wisconsin was blocking Skype.  So there were actual harms.  We did not have a net neutrality.  We debated them for years.  We actually created rules, went to court,  court said, no, you gotta create them this way.  So then we created new rules,  which were the 2015 Tom Reeler rules.  And that's what government is supposed to do.  That is what we do.  And then to have someone come in after the fact,  and just take it away.  Like it wasn't causing problems.  We have not seen a decrease in investment  from the ISPs.  We have not seen problems on their end.  To take it away, smacks of corruption.  It is a step too far.  It's just, it's so frustrating to me to see this,  because the way forward would be to say,  okay, let's find the actual problem and address that.  Not to rescind rules that we made  in response to an actual problem.  And maybe this is just me, but it's-  Well said, Comrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On a lighter note.  We want a lighter note?  Yeah, please.  Please.  You could now have a Marta bus drive  in front of your Facebook profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought that was very funny.  That was the best thing of the week.  This is so- Exactly.  They were blowing up the Georgia Dome,  imploding it, as it were.  And was it the Weather Channel that was-  Yes, Weather Channel.  Weather Channel was broadcasting,  listen to the countdown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Five, four, three, two, one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And just as it's about to implode,  here comes the bus!  Blocking the view entirely.  What the f***?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a wave bus?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Are you f***ing kidding me?  You're kidding me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I laughed till I cried when I saw this.  What the f***?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is the guy who's swearing,  is he from the Weather Channel?  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you missed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But now somebody has set up a thing  so you can have a Marta bus,  an Atlanta bus drive in front of your Facebook.  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh really?  Oh, I didn't want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there's a joke that lasts for about 36 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm gonna do that on my,  that's awesome.  Are you doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I'll forget how to undo it.  This is the internet.  This is what it's good for.  What if you could not create those silly little apps  because it would cost extra?  Right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  So wait a minute.  Search for dome implosion.  Okay.  So this is where you go.  And then you can search for a theme.  Dome implosion.  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  And then I'm,  you can drag it.  Yeah, okay.  Actually, that's pretty good.  I'm gonna do that.  That's my new profile picture.  I like it.  I like it.  It looks like I'm looking right over the bus.  That's perfect.  Is the bus actually gonna drive in?  I don't think it moves.  I think it's just,  did you just pop a cool one there, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's sparkling water, but yes.  Is it, what do you call that?  Topo moco?  It's not a Topo Chico.  Topo Chico?  It's just a straight up HEB sparkling water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or as Jeff Jarvis and I would say, Topo Gigio.  Or a Seltzer.  Seltzer.  Seltzer.  There was, there were,  do you remember the Seltzer Sisters in San Francisco?  No.  Oh, God, yeah.  There were two women who bought all the old Seltzer bottles  and were delivering Seltzer to your door  in classic 1920s glass Seltzer bottles.  And when you finished them, you would put the empty,  just like in the three Stooges,  where they put the Seltzer on your pan.  And then when you were done with it,  you put it on your doorstep and you get a new delivery,  the Seltzer Sisters.  I had them on my old radio show at Canviar  to make an egg cream for us all.  Mmm, egg creams.  There is no egg in egg creams.  Right?  Just chocolate syrup and Seltzer.  I never liked them much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, did you know that pumpkin pie filling  doesn't have pumpkin pie in it?  No, it does too.  No.  Is it, okay.  Butternut squash is pumpkin pie filling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  Cause I love butternut squash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that true?  This is what I learned.  This is what I learned.  Did you look at the can?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How did you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it was a 2014 Huffington Post article.  Here's why your pumpkin pie  probably has no pumpkin in it at all.  It's a butternut squash pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you called it that,  nobody would eat it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, whoops.  This is from Kitchen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's actually in your canned pumpkin puree?  Well, you know, butternut squash is better.  The label says 100% pumpkin.  But apparently the F, this is good.  The FDA says.  The USDA says pumpkin and squash, close enough.  The canned product prepared from clean, sound,  properly matured, golden-fleshed,  firm-shelled sweet varieties of either  pumpkins and squashes.  That's by washing, stemming, cutting, steaming,  and reducing to a pulp.  That can be called pumpkin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, look from time.com.  Relax, that canned pumpkin isn't actually squashed at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you see?  Another internet meme squashed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ah, pumpkin.  So to speak.  Now I just read, I did read somewhere  that pumpkins were actually,  it's a generic term for like an orange squash.  Oh, there you go.  That is another question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We always used sugar pumpkins,  the little sugar pumpkins for the pumpkin pie.  These are cantaloupies.  Yeah, I wouldn't use a cantaloupies,  but when you use real pumpkins,  then you know there's real pumpkins in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I tell you my, this is why I can't cook  really stupid pumpkin pie story very quickly.  Yes.  So in my young adult days,  when I was trying to impress a young lady  and thought I would show her how  multi-talented I was, I wanted to cook dinner.  I did the same thing, yes.  So I got a recipe from my mother  for the pie that I love, pumpkin chiffon pie.  And the recipe was written out in that recipe ease,  which I didn't quite understand.  So I got to the one and one half seed period,  canned pumpkins.  So I thought that's really stupid  because the sizes are different, but fine.  I took a can of pumpkin,  and I took another half of a can.  Luckily it stayed together as a glob,  so I could then calculate before there was a Google  how much I had to measure and take out  to make pumpkin pie.  Because I had to buy everything  including salt and pepper for that pie.  I think the pie at the time in pre-adjusted dollars  cost me $29.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And she wasn't impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course the chat room has found  video of the Seltzer sisters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aha, yes we do.  And that's kind of an interesting thing.  We have with us two young ladies from Texas  who just moved out from the East Coast.  They're called the Seltzer twins,  and they have come up with a brand new business  that simply shows people  a lot of splitter water inside these darn things.  They were married.  I can't remember her name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please welcome Freya Silver and I want you.  Ross, was it Adam Ross?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, good to see you.  Look at the hair.  This is 1981.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm curious.  Well, you can do the same thing  That's what I love to do.  That you do with the old Seltzer bottles.  You could do the same thing, couldn't you,  with perhaps Calistoga water and some of the bottled waters.  Oh no.  Look at those bottles.  That's what they looked like.  As good.  This is about triple the carbonation  and it does not contain any salt.  Aha, very important because a lot of folks say,  oh boy, I'm really gonna lose weight  if I stick with that stuff.  Not necessarily, right?  How did you guys happen to come up with the idea  Morning television, nothing worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And actually make a business  Nothing worse.  Are we worried that Google is collecting  Android users locations,  even when location services are disabled?  They say they're gonna stop it by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is an error.  This is where I'm like, you know, guys,  as we connect things to the internet,  we have to actually think about what those things do,  the data they collect and what happens to it.  I mean, Google's response to this was basically like,  yeah, we were trying something out.  We didn't realize it.  Okay, we'll stop.  So like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In January of this year, says Google,  we began using cell ID codes,  the code from the tower as an additional signal  to further improve the speed and performance  of message delivery.  However, we never incorporated cell ID  into our network sync system.  So that data was immediately were discarded  and we updated it to no longer request cell ID.  But for briefly for a few months,  they were from the beginning of the year,  collecting where your cell tower,  near a cell tower was,  even if location services were turned off.  This seems to me to be a tempest in a teapot,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but I.  No, no, it's a legit issue.  I mean, I think if you say you're not collecting  location service or location data and you actually are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, if you think about the actual operation  of a cell phone requires it to figure out  what cell tower it's on.  I mean, it's kind of,  admittedly that's the carrier doing that  and they obviously discard it,  but your phone kind of has to know where it is in space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, but Google collecting that information  is a new party collecting that information.  And Google has a lot of other information about you.  I can see why it's an issue.  I can see, I mean, remember street view  collecting all that wifi data?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was even more so accidental.  And bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, I'm not saying it's malicious.  I'm just like guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the problem is each of these things is presented  as if it is malicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the media.  I love us in the media, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even Steve Gibson, who is normally very conservative  about this kind of thing and you know, really,  I don't want to say paranoid, but paranoid.  Even he said, look, if you carry around a cell phone,  you're kind of carrying around a location device.  I mean, that's just, if you don't want that,  I mean, that's kind of the nature of how cell phones work.  It's just, and you know, Google says,  we're not going to do anymore.  We never meant to keep this data.  I'll give them the benefit of that on this one.  Yeah, I will.  I'm glad they got caught.  Let's put it that way.  They got caught.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think it's important that companies  like pay attention to this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cause someone could actually,  if that data is going someplace,  somebody who notices it could actually take advantage of it.  Yeah.  And that's not great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, an update to our story about weird kids videos  on YouTube, they've taken down a kids quote channel,  exploitive kids channel called Toy Freaks,  and they are tightening their child endangerment.  Now I want to see Toy Freaks.  Apparently criticized for his violent,  seemingly exploitive videos featuring a dad and his daughters,  which many said bordered on abuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jesus. Wow.  And that's a different problem here.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were enforcing their child endangerment policies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeez, did anybody, Stacey, did you ever see this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, because I don't like videos of kids  put in distressing situations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't blame you.  But, you know, so this wasn't a channel aimed at kids.  This is teenagers love this.  My son used to watch, you know,  your daughter will get old enough where she,  my son used to love watching what they call fail videos,  which is just people are wiping out.  Yeah, it's like, but worse,  it's just wiping out after wipe out after wipe out.  It looks like horrible maiming  and disfigurement is happening.  And he just howl and laugh.  And that's just, you know, that's how people are.  Michael, our 14 year old used to love those.  What is the, and it turned out they were fake,  but I thought they were real when I first saw him.  The one where the dad gets mad at his son  because he's playing video games all day  and he takes all his video games,  puts them out on the lawn and mows them  with his riding mower.  And the kid just goes crazy.  And it turned out then they made a whole bunch more of them.  And it turned out the whole thing was a great act.  But that, and I imagine that's the same thing  with Toy Freaks and kid and teenagers, you know,  they love this.  It's a little transgressive, feels a little dangerous.  And the thing is they were probably making a lot of money.  And these are pretty little kids.  Yeah.  You know, Anna Belz freaks out when a real spider attacks her.  You know, and these are, these are little kids.  So the dad probably is kind of,  maybe exploiting his children a little bit,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but the kids love it.  They love it.  Parents on social media are exploiting  their children all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Parents have done this since showbiz was invented.  Right. The stage mom.  Hey, very good news for people who use Echo Shows,  which I know is in a lot of you.  I love the Echo Show.  That's the Echo, Amazon Echo with a screen.  YouTube's back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My Corgi videos are back.  Yay.  Corgi's at breakfast.  La la la la la.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can watch the show.  You can say Echo, watch, not listen,  watch this week in Google on YouTube and it will play it.  Unfortunately, it plays it in,  before it had a really nice kind of full screen interface.  Now it plays it as if you're looking at the YouTube webpage.  And I think what happened, I don't know,  but I'm guessing Google said, no, no,  we want people to see those coming up next videos  and auto playing the next video and all that stuff.  We put a lot of time into that.  Can you leave our interface alone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it, go ahead.  Scooter access.  Amazon says that saying,  bottom A, zoom in will swap to full screen mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  It's not quite the way it used to be, but it is good.  So Echo, zoom in.  Is it the case, it's just, or is it just me,  that whenever you see Mark Zuckerberg out in public,  he looks like Data, the Android from Star Trek.  Doesn't he just kind of,  it's just something that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you were him, how would you,  how could you possibly have a self image  except knowing that you're constantly on camera?  Yeah, I guess.  It's like being raised in the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right.  I'm sure Barron Trump will look like that in a few years.  Interesting article, Alexis C. Madrigal  writing in the Atlantic, the education of Mark Zuckerberg.  He's been to 30 states now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  on Twitter and drove me a little bit nuts.  Where is it here?  Most recently, for example,  this was how he described his major takeaway  from his travels at the concluding stop  of the University of Kansas.  The thing that struck me everywhere I went,  and I have stories from every state that I visited,  was how central communities are to people, he said.  You don't say, says Madrigal.  This level of naivete sounds unbelievable.  You know, F me.  Media, which you're part of.  We're a little cynical, aren't we?  You never, media never paid attention to communities.  We treat everybody as a mass, we treat everybody the same,  we give no respect to tons of communities in this country,  and this guy comes along and actually wants  to put communities together, and you have to mock him.  Look in the mirror first, fella, look in the mirror.  Good point.  Media have not respected communities.  Mark Zuckerberg respects communities  a hell of a lot more than we do in media.  Thank you for that commercial interruption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's a good point.  That's a good point.  I still wonder why he's doing 30 states barnstorming,  and meeting with people if he's not running for president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I think he-  He's probably getting out of the bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, all right, that's fair.  He wants to sell to people in all those places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He needs to understand what they need, what they want.  But the truth is, I'll be honest,  all he really needs to do is let the algorithm do its work.  It's doing great.  You know, they've got all the signals about what people want,  and they just keep feeding it back in a feedback loop,  and the news feed just gets better and better and better  from that point of view.  Do you think he really has to care about anything else?  All he has to do is make sure that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because there's a next phase of Facebook.  What's that?  If he moves, well, because the first phase  was friend to friend only.  Then, you know, friend to college, then town and wiring.  Now he says it's community and the polis in society.  And so I think you've got to fundamentally rethink  parts of what Facebook does.  It is tuned now to give you just your friends.  And if it's really gonna-  I don't think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I disagree with you.  I think everybody's Facebook feed is unique  because it's tuned to give you more  of what you engage with, isn't it?  Yeah, but it tends to value-  I don't see a lot of my friends.  I see a lot of you.  I see.  No.  Because you have no friends.  I have a Jeff Jarvis feed on my Facebook.  But the thing is, I think no two feeds  will probably look alike because-  They don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what he said to me long ago.  No two people are the same Facebook.  But I think there is something to understanding  what communities do together,  what the hell they talk together  that's different from what Facebook is now.  And I think you've got to get out and talk to people  and understand how they live among other people  to have a better sense of how you can serve that.  Don't forget that it's that line  that he said in front of me many years ago  that I've quoted on the show that I love so much,  that when a certain publisher of a major newspaper  in the US begged him, how do we make communities?  How do we create communities?  Zuckerberg said, you don't make communities.  They already exist.  You should ask them how to help them do  what they already do better.  And his prescription for that was that you bring them,  his quote, elegant organization.  So he knew how Harvard operated.  He knew how that community operated.  He knew what people wanted to get dates, shall we say.  And he created a structure around that.  That was a contained world and relatively simple.  Now it's so complex that I think he does need to get out  and be inspired by getting among people.  And we yell about the filter bubble of Silicon Valley  and he gets out and then we mock him for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt  and I'm gonna give Mark the benefit of the doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  Another snobby media piece.  That's what got me.  Yeah, I guess it is, yeah.  I mean, that's a little unfair of me.  He went to, did you read it, Stacey?  Yeah, I did.  The chance was long.  So I didn't mean to make you point that out, I'm sorry.  But he basically analyzes everything that Zuckerberg has said  with the word community since his birth.  And I don't know that it needs that kind of criminology.  He's more apparent.  He's not as mysterious as he seems.  Says, I think communities are important.  I wanna have better tools to help communities connect.  That's what he's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I might believe that except it feels like Facebook  when faced with this issue of whether Russians  were using Facebook to manipulate the electorate last year,  Facebook denied it and denied it and denied it  and denied it and denied it and denied it  and denied it for more than a year  and then finally admitted it.  Makes me think that there may, I mean,  do you think that they really genuinely  didn't know what was happening until they did?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's the same thing with Al Franken before  questioning Google and Facebook.  Rubles, how did you not know about the rubles?  Because they weren't looking for that signal.  This vast system with billions of ads,  they had no reason to go looking for rubles  and political ads until once it was pointed out,  oh crap, yeah, all right.  I'll give you the benefit of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I would submit that we have to keep  a really eagle eye on them.  That they have to, there is a, because of the power  that Facebook and Google and others wield, Amazon,  they need extra scrutiny.  And they, I mean, the standards have to be very high for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, and the way that that occurs in my view  is that they should be smart enough, and they're not yet,  to get ahead of all this and to set standards  and principles that go beyond current expectations.  And be key in those standards,  and Stacey's talked about this a lot, is the transparency.  Because only with transparency can we keep up on this.  Let's go to a different story.  The fact that you can target an ad  to not African Americans.  Right. That's abhorrent and awful, right?  But I can also see why somebody,  Black Lives Matter might come along and say,  I want to target this message to people of a race.  Then anything that can be used will get misused.  The way the platform should do this in this case is to say,  here's a very easy neon way,  if you see something people misusing this tool,  tell us immediately, and we're going to have staff,  and we're going to get on it.  But how would you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are dark ads.  So basically, ProPublica discovered they were doing it.  Facebook said, we'll stop.  And then they, ProPublica tested it again.  The way they were doing it, they would buy ads,  but they would say,  I don't want any African Americans to see this.  Actually, they had a really kind of funny list  of the kinds of people that they may or may not want to see it.  And they were able to buy those ads.  So it's not redlining exactly.  It's kind of using Facebook's tools to target advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So one way to deal with that is to make every single ad  on Facebook transparent.  Every ad in a newspaper is transparent.  So far, they've only talked about doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with political ads, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Political ads.  I think if you really want to think this through,  you say, let's make every ad transparent  and all its targeting criteria transparent.  Good.  And put an API to them.  And then the public can help you keep them honest.  Because inevitably, someone's going to come along  and they're going to game the system.  They're going to do something awful.  Facebook does not watch for rubles  until they know they need to watch for rubles.  They need help to do that.  If they were, A, transparent in the first place  and B, had very easy mechanisms to people report  and then C, they actually acted on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of interesting, though.  I mean, I've heard of ad targeting.  When people buy ads on Twitter, they're targeting a group.  This is kind of untargeting.  I've never heard of negative targeting.  So ProPublica said, we don't want ads to be shown  to certain categories like African Americans,  but also mothers of high school kids,  people interested in wheelchair ramps.  We don't want the ad to be shown  to people interested in wheelchair ramps.  We don't want the ad to be shown to Jews,  to expats from Argentina, to Spanish speakers.  You could see how that would be used to discriminate.  I'm surprised Facebook has that tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, stop for a second.  People interested in wheelchair ramps,  do you want to advertise to them?  Yes, right?  I want to sell a wheelchair.  I want to sell a better wheelchair ramp.  That's a perfectly logical okay.  Yeah, but I don't understand why you would have a tool  that says not to sell to them.  Okay, let's say you want to sell skateboards to people  and you don't want to waste your money.  You don't want to pin it to people  who have wheelchair ramps,  or some better example than that.  I think as an advertiser, you're more likely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All you have to do is say,  I want people who would be likely to buy skateboards.  I mean, really, is there, I don't know.  Maybe I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, so I want to advertise to this product to women.  But not married women.  Retired women, so please make sure  to exclude women who have babies.  I don't know, I can't come up with a good example.  So there are some conceivable reasons

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  why you would want exclusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so, systems get this used.  And so, if you have anything possibly related to race,  somebody in the company, a chief risk officer,  has to stop and say, whoa!  Let's make sure we limit how this can be used.  And maybe they are messed up.  I don't know what they did.  But there's legitimate reasons to target  and not target groups.  People, expense from Argentina.  There's nothing fundamentally wrong with that.  I may want to sell them tickets on a Bianca.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, and this is the problem with something operating  at this kind of scale with automated systems.  All sorts of things like this are going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All you can say is catch them and fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The real issue is that ProPublica,  that this issue was raised before  and Facebook said they would fix it  and they still haven't, I guess.  Yes, that's the issue.  Yeah.  Twitter's testing a TweetStorm feature.  Oh, joy.  Black Friday, are you all gonna,  Stacey, I know you get in line 3 a.m.  at your local Walmart store  to get some of those door buster specials, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, last year I actually did go to Target.  Did you?  Thanksgiving evening.  We wanted to pick up a Nintendo DS.  Maybe it was the year before that.  Oh, you had to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you succeed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We did.  It was touch and go, but we did succeed.  Did you fight anybody?  We did not fight anybody.  I am not ready to fisticuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now you gotta get the Nintendo Switch.  Forget the DS.  We have that.  Oh, good.  I'm sure your daughter lives on that.  That thing is super fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We just bought Rime on it  and I'm sad to see that that game is not as good  on the Switch as it is on the PS4.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Zelda was great and Mario was great.  Mario Kart or whatever it was, was great.  Oh, well, I won't bad rhyme then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a beautiful game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm very sad.  Yeah, it sounds familiar.  R-I-M-E or R-H-Y-M-E?  R-I-M-E.  Oh, you're a young boy who is waking up  on a mysterious island.  Oh, it is pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll have to get this on Steam.  I'm really excited by games like this  that are not kind of the traditional shoot-em-up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's...  There have always been games like this.  They're just not.  They're not huge sellers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they were PC games.  I mean, remember like, I don't remember.  Mist.  I mean, like all those games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but the world is dominated now  by the Call of Duty's and Grand Theft Autos of the world.  This looks a little bit like Zelda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a story game.  And what's nice is there's all kinds of other things.  I think as people realize that there's a huge market  for games that isn't shoot-em-ups.  Right.  I mean... I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Call of Duty World War II, the new version,  sold half a billion dollars worth of units in three days.  Yeah.  So if you're a game developer,  you're looking at that going.  Of course, Cuphead went platinum in a couple of weeks.  Still shooting, but at least it's a little different.  Something a little different.  I don't know.  I think that's the problem is people want to make hits.  It's like movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I'm not gonna...  I mean, if I wrote a book, I'd want it to be a best seller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you wouldn't write it to be a best seller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like Eric Segal did with Love Story.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's an old story.  He said, I am going to...  I think, was he a Harvard professor?  He said, I'm gonna write a best seller.  And he wrote a 1970 best seller  that was as big as it can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'll trade a neural net to do it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now you could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Love Story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Love Story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jenny Calvary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's nothing to her, nothing.  Do you know Love Story?  No.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wasn't born in 1970.  Where do I begin to tell the story of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is the tearjerker of all tearjerks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like Beaches?  Worse.  Wow.  Oh, you should watch Love Story.  You'd like it.  Really?  Actually, don't watch the movie.  Read the book.  It's a better book.  It's a good book.  It's actually a wonderful book.  Okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a Love Story.  It's a sappy Love Story,  but it's not a happy Love Story.  Are you all gonna buy a new Tesla truck?  I would like to.  Imagine arriving to work in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Vroom.  I don't think it makes that noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it doesn't.  In fact, I called it a Tesla diesel on another show  and John said,  ah, not a diesel.  Let me explain to you how this Tesla thing works, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not a diesel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think of diesel as a synonym for big truck.  It's not.  Weird though, it only has one seat.  You can't have, you can't, no hitchhikers.  And unless they go in the sleeping compartment.  500 mile range.  There is a frunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's where the hitchhiker goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The hitchhiker goes in the frunk.  It also held, interestingly, a Tesla Roadster,  an updated Roadster,  that goes from zero to 100 kilometers an hour in 1.9 seconds.  That'll pin your head to the back of the seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Already ludicrous mode hurts.  I can't do it.  I have insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have ludicrous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, or is it ridiculous?  Whatever, they're high. Insane.  A friend of mine has it.  And I was like, yeah, too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't, I'm gonna black,  I start to red out when I do it.  So I just, I don't dare do it  because I know I'll go unconscious and drive into a wall.  So yeah, I don't, definitely don't need anything more,  more than just average acceleration.  Well, I think zero to 60 is about the same  as zero to 100 kilometers per hour.  I think that's pretty close.  That's why I said that.  I think they quote for some reason, zero to 100.  Maybe that's the European story I was reading.  And the Roadster.  And actually, I don't know why.  Maybe I've got Tesla mania,  but I decided to put a Model 3 deposit down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I've had one for a while.  So mine's coming.  Both of you?  Well, I put mine down way back in the day of craziness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you do it today, it's 12 to 18 months.  And I'm hoping it's gonna be 18 months, more than 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know what?  If you want mine, we're kind of debating.  Do we want the three or not?  We're about to have to make a decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wouldn't get it today because I feel like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're not putting the seats in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel like they're kind of,  they still have some issues to work out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's kind of our thought.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But on the other hand,  I think a year and a half from now, it might be all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're a very optimistic man, Leo.  That's the theme I'm seeing through this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm despairing.  But didn't you get the despair?  You missed the despair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did get the despair, but you default to optimism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do, I do fall to optimism.  That's why when I despair, it's so despairing.  It's so bad.  No, the reason is because I only leased the Model X.  So in a year and a half, about 18 months,  I have to give it back.  I thought maybe I'll trade it in for Model 3 by then.  Maybe it'll be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the Model X had its problems too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it did.  Yes.  But I'm all in on electric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm all in on electric.  And once you drive a Tesla,  it's really hard to go to like a Prius or a Boulder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have either of you been on a trip  where you've had to stop at a charging station  or you always use it locally enough  that you don't have to?  Superchargers are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the superchargers are nice.  And I've got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry, have you gone to a trip longer than your range?  Yes.  And how long do you hang out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  About 25, 20 minutes.  Half an hour, yeah.  There's a, the supercharger,  because we drive to Houston a lot,  there's a supercharger in Columbus  that is next to a Mexican food place.  So we'll stop at that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Queso and electricity.  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cheese and juice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're gonna have a Nissan Leaf,  the 20, the new Nissan Leaf,  which comes out in the United States in January  on the new screensavers in a couple of weeks.  They're coming up and we're gonna take a test drive.  That's their all electric car.  What's the range like on that?  It's like, it's under a hundred miles.  It's not really long.  But that's the best,  was the best selling electric car, I think, last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I could afford to own another car,  I would love it for daily commuting.  Electric's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just feel good about it.  Of course, electricity is very expensive in California,  but that's why we got the solar panels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Electricity in Austin, super expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it expensive?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  16 cents per kilowatt hour.  Woo.  Woo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Woo.  Okay, you win.  I win.  I have no idea.  Not a game I wanted to win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You win for losing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kaspersky says, yeah, well, we got NSA secrets,  but we didn't steal them.  I would still not run Kaspersky antivirus if I were you.  I wouldn't run any antivirus,  but I definitely wouldn't run a Kaspersky.  They said, well, yeah,  it's part of how the antivirus works  that it exfiltrated the NSA viruses,  45 megabyte zip archive that contained source code,  malicious executables,  and four documents bearing  US government classification markings.  So when it got to Kaspersky,  because that's what automatically happens,  they quarantine it and send it off  to the main office in Russia for analysis.  The company analyst who manually reviewed it  quickly determined it contained confidential material  within a few days.  And at the direction of the founder, Eugene Kaspersky,  the company deleted all the materials  except for the malicious binaries.  And then they created a special software tweak  to prevent it from being downloaded again.  Problem with all of this is you don't know who to believe.  I don't know who to believe.  Why take a chance?  I don't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But don't be, may I go back to another story?  Yes, you may.  So backing up what you said, Stacey,  so Tim Wu, inventor of the phrase net neutrality,  has a piece in the Times saying.  I blame Tim for this whole thing.  Yeah, I know.  Why the courts will have to save net neutrality.  And in it, he says, not only have,  as free press has demonstrated,  investment has gone up since these rules have been in place,  but he says, and I quote,  Mr. Pye faces a more serious legal problem  because he is killing net neutrality outright,  not merely weakening it.  He will have to explain to a court  not just the shift from 2015,  but also his reasoning for destroying the basic bands  on blocking and throttling,  which have been in effect since 2005,  and have been relied on extensively  by the entire internet ecosystem.  This will be a difficult task.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hope so. Good, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hope so too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, there is a reason  that a Republican commissioner  that later became a lobbyist  enshrined the anti-blocking and discrimination clauses  as the four pillars of open internet access.  Internet. You're talking about Michael Powell?  Michael Powell, 2005.  I used to have these memorized, but now I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Used to be a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You didn't think you needed them again, right, Stacey?  It was enshrined, that was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was over.  When I stopped covering net neutrality,  I celebrated so hard, and then I couldn't stop.  I couldn't look away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll take another queso, please.  No net neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's take a break, come back.  We gotta get to queso.  It's soon to be queso time.  What was it you said?  Juice and cheese?  Juice and, cheese and juice.  Cheese and juice time.

Justice Department wants to block,  so strange, AT&T Time Warner merger.  That's what Trump said he would do when he was a candidate.  But then, I don't know, for a while I kind of thought,  oh, there's no bad mergers.  Now the allegation is maybe it has something to do  with the fact that Time Warner owns CNN.  And we know that Mr. Trump is not a fan.  It's an $85 billion deal.  No, and that's, let's ban autoplay video.  How about that?  Yeah.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When does Chrome stop those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm now on Firefox.  I should go back to Chrome.  This is Firefox Quantum.  The new Firefox 57 is great.  I really like it.  Although, and we'll talk about in a second  some numbers from Mashable that say  it's still not as fast as Chrome.  Still not as fast as Chrome.  So let's ask our political analyst, Jeff Jarvis,  who appears regularly on CNN.  What do you think?  Is this Trump's revenge or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm appalled because there's no consistency to this.  First off, as everyone points out,  it's a vertical merger, not a horizontal merger.  There is no major consumer impact.  Where there is consumer impact,  they'd be in a better, stronger position to negotiate that,  to negotiate strictures on their behavior  as they did with Comcast, NBC, Universal.  You can certainly argue it's too big,  but the way the law is set up now,  just as Comcast, NBC, Universal could go through,  so should and could this.  And then third is that, as I said earlier,  that they are about to let through Sinclair and Tribune.  As way, way too big, and Sinclair pretty scary.  I saw the CEO of Sinclair,  and he's kind of a creepy guy at an event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sinclair carried water for the Trump campaign  all through the election season  by requiring their local channel, their local news,  to carry special press release,  effectively press release stories,  in favor of the Trump campaign.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you also have the FCC's about to take down  the limitations, as I said earlier, of ownership rules.  So big is fine with everything except, oh, you own CNN.  And it's a cloak to say they have to sell  either a CNN or DirecTV.  It's the government trying to hamper the merger  such that it doesn't happen, just out of spite.  Now, the interesting thing here is that just today  there was a case around transsexuals in the military  where Trump's own tweets entered into the case  as they have in the Muslim ban.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He keeps forgetting that tweeting is material  and can be used to discover intent,  and the courts are very happy to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, so I think it'll come back in here,  but it's just, where do you turn your attention?  Where do you turn your despair?  Where do you, you know, it's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And further evidence to support your case,  the DOJ has reached out to 18 state attorneys general  asking them to join the deal,  and none of them have agreed to do so.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in the Philippines I was forced to watch CNN,  which I have not done in months,  and again I realized how bad and fake it is.  Loser!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the worst of it is probably him retweeting that,  him being up CNN and the logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He retweeted that?  He tweeted it again?  After all the heat he got the first time?  Oh no, this is back in the first time, yeah, yeah.  FCC votes to abandon rural and low-income Americans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was in my tweet, here's my tweet.  I'm gonna find it, because someone...  Oh, please do. So here it is,  encapsulating all the despair.  This FCC is going to destroy net neutrality,  strangle competition and media,  let wireline providers off the hook for replacing copper  with a fiber or equivalent to copper,  and kill broadband access for the poor.  This is an unprecedented attack on consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ms. Higginbotham, that is the first good use I've heard  of 280 characters.  Yeah, nice and long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I needed all of them to get that all in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the...  So why would they do this,  given that it is obviously politically gonna be challenging  to abandon low-income Americans?  Why would Agit Pai do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Lifeline has been...  There's no secret.  First thing he did when he got into office,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  first thing he did was stop the Lifeline payments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it has been a boondoggle.  If you wanna look at scandals for the SEC,  you can look at how much carriers have gotten from Lifeline,  big ones, small ones.  The abuse of Lifeline is rampant.  So, there's always been talk of getting rid of it.  Usually reforming it is the issue,  or replacing it with something more suited to the times,  because Lifeline originally only was telephone,  and then we had to fix it to offer broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Democratic FCC Commissioner Minyon Clyburn,  who I like a lot, says the FCC continues to push.  It's a carrier-first agenda.  One of the things this allows carriers to do  is discontinue phone service to rural users  who don't make them any money.  In the past, they've been required  to offer something in return,  but now it's, hey, you got cellular.  What do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's what this is.  That's the same reason that they're talking about  the copper equivalency and getting rid of that.  It's because it's expensive to push infrastructure  out to the middle of the country  where there are like five people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you have to, you know, this is,  it goes back to the Depression  when we had a rural electrification program.  Once you say, well, electricity is important,  or telephone service is important to everybody,  the only people that are gonna make that happen  is the government is gonna push carriers to do it  or subsidize it themselves.  It's in the national interest.  And it's to abandon rural users and low-income users  because, well, it's not very profitable.  That's not what government is supposed to do.  So I run, I-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we have been doing this.  Go ahead. Sorry.  No, go ahead, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was gonna say, we have been doing this  since probably the 80s or early 90s.  We have decided that government does nothing useful.  There has been a constant debasement  of what the government does and provides.  So it makes sense that we would say no to this.  And we have been leaving behind  our most vulnerable for decades.  This is-  What is it, Ronald Reagan used to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just coming to a head.  What is it Ronald Reagan used to say?  The scariest words in the English language are,  I'm from the government and I'm here to help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so to your point, Stacey,  I plugged this book last week  and I'm still listening to it and it's just wonderful.  Americana, 400-Year History of American Capitalism  by Boo Srinivasan, an entrepreneur who dealt with this.  It's just wonderful.  And I was just listening today to,  I didn't realize that it was John Wanamaker  who built one of the early department stores,  changing retail entirely.  Who was, yes, who was Postmaster General.  And he was the architect of rural free delivery.  Oh my goodness.  Yeah.  And the point that Srinivasan makes is before this,  government actually did very few things,  which of course is a world  that certain people want to return to.  One of the things it did was postal service.  And people were left out.  People in remote farms without cars,  before there were cars,  had to go long distances to get mail and they were cut off.  And so RFD was a major equalizer in the country.  So we did that with-  Did it enable the Sears robot catalog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It enabled Sears?  Exactly.  We wouldn't have Amazon if it weren't for RFD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, he also, this is the retail chapter.  So we talked about Montgomery Ward came first,  then Sears, and it sounds so much like Amazon,  because what they both did was they offered free returns.  Right.  So that you were safe to order.  It was safe to order.  And it killed the local stores and did all kinds of things.  So, Stacey, you're right.  You start with RFD, then you go to rural electrification,  then you go to the fees added under our phones  to assure phone service.  And internet is vital.  And we cut it all out.  What's this book called?  I want to get it.  It's really good.  American, a 400 year history of American capitalism.  By Boo Srinivasan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it is on Audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is on Audible.  It's excellent.  He reads the intro.  Scott Brick is great.  I love Scott Brick.  All right.  It's really, really well done.  Really fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm putting it on my list right now.  I'm gonna buy it.  How many credits do you use a month?  I have two a month and I use them.  Even if I don't read the books, I got them in my library.  I figure I'm gonna retire  and I'm gonna just listen to books all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I buy extras.  Do the credits expire?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it depends on your plan.  I think they can, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am just not an Audible.  I don't like listening to books.  Yeah, it's weird.  Some people do, some people don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't either, Stacey.  In fact, you know what?  I made fun of it.  That's not really reading.  People used to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wouldn't make fun of it.  I just, I'm like, I can't get into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I did, I did.  Well, of course I've got a long commute  and I've read and I've got to do  and I've got the freaking internet thing and all that.  It's books that I don't wanna have to underline.  So it's either fiction or fascinating books like this  and it fills the hours  and it takes me away from the news sometimes,  which I need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Last night I couldn't watch another bit of news.  I went to bed, put my earbuds in  and I listened to a book till I fell asleep.  It was very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Leo, the problem with that is  that you don't know where you left off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  That didn't work very well.  Well, yeah, I gotta back up a little bit.  That's all right.  Did you read the Daily Beast piece?  First of all, have you played HQ, the trivia game?  Lisa and I like to play this, never won.  Crazy game.  This night 112,000 people were online.  It actually crashed the servers.  They had to start half an hour late  and the idea is they have big jackpots.  This was a thousand dollar jackpot last night.  You get 12 questions.  If you answer them all correctly,  you get a share of the jackpot  and last night I think five, what was it?  No, nine people got it right.  So each won 111 bucks.  Not bad for playing at 12 and it's fun, it's trivia  but part of the reason for its success  because I mean, we've seen this a million times.  You don't know Jack.  I can go on and on.  There are lots of games like this.  It's Scott Rogowski.  He is the host, former comic.  He was actually about ready to throw it in  and move away from New York.  He was trying to make his career  when he got this call to do this  and now he's such a big star on the HQ app.  When he's not there, occasionally he's not there,  all the chat says, where's Scott?  Bring back Scott.  Well apparently because of this,  the Daily Beast wanted to interview him.  So they called him up, they interviewed him.  They didn't talk about HQ particularly.  They talked about his daily life.  He's a cult figure now and how he can't walk down the street  without people asking for selfies and stuff.  One fan recently tweeted,  everyone needs 15 minutes of Scott in their lives.  Another, if you don't like Scott from HQ,  we can't be friends.  So they wrote what they call a lighthearted profile  on his career.  He agreed to do the interview.  Daily Beast also reached out to HQ's PR and Russ Yusupov.  He was one of the founders of Vine who founded HQ,  letting him know they wanted to do a story about Rogowski.  Several hours later, we received an email from Yusupov  saying HQ is not making Scott available  to discuss his involvement with HQ  in the media and the press.  The reporter informed Yusupov  we'd already interviewed Scott.  The story was nearing publication  but call us with concerns.  Then they let him read the story.  Yusupov said, you're completely unauthorized  to write this story.  I am gonna fire Scott if you publish it.  You're putting Scott's job in jeopardy.  Is that what you want?  Scott could lose his job.  Among other things that Yusupov objected to is the line,  Scott said that despite the attention,  he's still able to walk down the street  and order his favorite salad from Sweet Green  without being accosted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He cannot say that, Yusupov shouted.  We do not have a brand deal with Sweet Green  under no circumstances can he say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When asked to confirm that Rogowski can't say  he personally enjoys eating at Sweet Green,  Yusupov said he cannot say that.  Now, on the one hand, if you worked at Apple,  you couldn't, and we look at,  we try to get people from Google all the time  and they have to ask PR and PR says no.  So on the one hand,  I think it is the company's right to say,  well, of course, one of the things they learned  is that Scott is not an employee but a contract employee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, well then they can't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can't really stop him from doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can fire him, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they can fire him.  You can fire him for anything, right?  You could fire him for nothing.  You could fire him for nothing.  It's called at will employment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Yusupov then,  a day later, when the Daily Beast called,  letting him know that the story  was gonna be reframed around his comments,  we're gonna talk about what you just said, Russ.  Yusupov brought Rogowski onto the phone call  and falsely claimed, I never threatened to fire him.  Poor Scott, I have to feel bad.  I don't wanna fire Scott.  Scott's our guy, says Rogowski.  So I know none of this means anything,  but from journalistically though,  who was in the right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, why did the reporter read the quote to the dude?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he said.  About Sweet Greens.  Yeah, he said, normally we don't,  we don't, we refuse to do that,  but in this case, he was so upset,  we gave him the whole, we emailed him the article.  Which is, that's dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You never do that.  But you know what, Stacey, in Germany,  when I get interviewed, they read the quotes to you.  That happens to me from time to time.  I vote sometimes different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, that's kind of a form of fact checking, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did I get this right?  You read about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  But still, you would read it back to the person  that you said it to, not to their CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  But from a journalistic point of view, it's okay.  I mean, that's not your issue.  That might be an employer employee issue,  but if somebody from Google agreed to let me interview them,  it's not my responsibility to make sure that he's okay.  The group is okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that happens to me all the time.  I mean, I get people telling me stuff all the time.  They're like, oh man, I shouldn't have said that.  I'm like, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you ever had anybody threaten to fire an employee  if you ran the story?  No.  Although, if you work at Apple and you leak to the press,  you do run the risk of losing your job.  Not that Scott leaked anything.  I don't know if there's anything to leak.  It's a trivia game online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At some point, just think people  about how this makes you look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I feel bad for Scott Rogowsky, the host,  although he's probably in the catbird seat here,  and Russ did not acquit himself well in this.  I'm sure he's feeling bad right now.  Ah.  Guys.  I know, you're getting hungry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, not only, I'm not just, I know.  I'm sorry that I was not there.  I'm looking through our stories.  I thought, oh, did we want to talk about Uber and their-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God, Uber.  Oh, geez.  So this really goes back to Travis Kalanick's watch.  Last October, Uber discovered there was a breach.  7 million drivers' records, including drivers' licenses,  had been exfiltrated by bad guys,  and 50 million customer records.  Not credit card numbers, they say,  but names, addresses, and phone numbers.  The hackers ransomed it.  They contacted Uber, as I understand it,  although the story seems to have changed a little bit,  but the latest I understand is the hackers contacted Uber,  say, for $100,000, we'll bury this.  Uber paid the money and then made the hackers sign an NDA,  swearing they would never tell anybody it happened.  Of course, the new CEO over at Uber,  I think when he discovered this, decided to reveal it.  This was something Uber revealed.  Right?  Did I get that all correct?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, Dara did explain that that was something  that he discovered and he-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're supposed to reveal data breaches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so in Europe, that is the law now.  What is the state in the US about data breaches  and your obligation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you have to reveal them  after a certain period of time, a certain PII.  I'm pretty sure that's been the rules  for at least a decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me ask Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm like, hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the US law regarding revealing data breaches?  You're not gonna get a good answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, here we go.  48 states, the DC, Guam, Puerto Rico,  and the Virgin Islands have enacted regulation  requiring private or governmental entities  to notify individuals of security breaches of information  involving PII.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good, and this would qualify as PII.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It says, most of the laws say  who's responsible for doing it,  so businesses, data brokers, government, blah, blah, blah.  It defines PII and then it also says  these will define individually what constitutes a breach  and the timing and how people have to be noticed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The deal was arranged by the company's  chief security officer, Joe Sullivan.  He has been fired.  Kalanick knew about it.  And good on Dara for revealing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, that's kind of like the bare minimum.  I mean, this poor guy.  Yeah, it's a bare minimum.  Coming in, it's like you're walking into  a truck stop bathroom and you just know  you're responsible for cleaning up,  God only knows what.  I don't think that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that true?  No, no, you just leave.  You don't clean it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but he's a guy who said he's going to clean up.  Oh, he agreed to clean it up.  It's like the janitor.  Yeah, no, you're right.  He agreed to clean it up.  But he took the job knowing that it was,  when he walked into that bathroom,  it was gonna be not exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Koshra Shahi said, none of this should have happened.  I will not make excuses for it.  While I can't erase the past,  I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee.  We will learn from our mistakes.  We're changing the way we do business,  putting integrity at the core of every decision we make  and working hard to earn the trust of our customers.  I think that that's genuine.  I've heard from many people that Dara is a good person  and there's no reason not to believe  that Uber wants to turn over a new leaf.  But this is old history.  They're gonna, you know what?  Props to him for revealing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think he had to.  Once you know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to.  Well, yeah, except that those other guys didn't.  Sullivan didn't, Kalanick didn't.  Do you care that your every move at Thanksgiving  will be tracked by a company called SafeGraph?  This is funny because I saw the story like crazy  about how people are not gonna have Thanksgiving dinners  with family members who voted differently than they did.  You know, there's a big lifestyle story  in a lot of newspapers last week.  But props to the outline and Adrian Jeffries  who said, well, wait a minute.  How do they know that?  And it turns out a company called SafeGraph  has 17 trillion location markers for 10 million smartphones.  Companies who make wallpaper apps, maps apps and the like,  install the SafeGraph software.  I'm sure SafeGraph pays them something.  And then reports back on their users locations for SafeGraph.  So SafeGraph, for instance, says,  well, we're gonna identify your home  as wherever you are most of the time  between the hours of one and four.  And then they looked at where people were  between one and four a.m.  Then they looked at where people were between one and five p.m.  on Thanksgiving Day to see if they spent it at home  or traveled.  And then they looked at who you were with for Thanksgiving.  And they were able to generate this data.  They say it's fully anonymized,  but how anonymized can it be  if they know your political affiliation  and whether you're with family members?  Nothing to say, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you gonna do?  So, so, so-  See this I blame more than Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Foursquare has this data.  Yeah, I give Foursquare willingly give them my data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're willing to give it to them  and they sell it as data now and they get value out of it  and they analyze it in new ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, all right.  Well, all of these apps now, I mean, for a while people,  that was a problem with these apps  because you didn't have to give permissions.  Like when you gave your permissions, you were like, oh.  So when your wallpaper is like, can I use location tracking?  Your wallpaper should not ask for location tracking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Say no.  There's the moral in this story.  Yeah, that's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just say no.  So the paper, the site, the online site in Germany  simulated Thanksgiving since they don't have it.  They asked people at the end of about five stories,  binary opinion questions,  like Germany already has enough refugees,  Germany has more refugees.  They then on one day in June had 12,000 people volunteer  to meet someone near them who disagreed with them.  Oh.  One on one.  That sounds unpleasant.  There was sort of 6,000, no, there was 6,000.  I asked, were there any fisticuffs?  They said, no.  My favorite part of this was one woman was matched  by the algorithm to her father-in-law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm not going to go into too much detail,  but we will be having Thanksgiving dinner  with some people of different faiths.  Different worldviews?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Different worldviews, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's life.  It's always, it has always been that way.  I grew up with long hair as a hippie.  Don't you think we had those conversations  during the Vietnam War?  I watched all in the family.  They called me meathead.  There's a game, there's a game, very popular game  called Player Unknown's Battlegrounds.  It's a, they call it a battle royale game.  You're dropped into a world with a hundred other people  and the last man standing wins.  All of that aside, it's apparently a very fun game.  They're, they want to, they want to release it in China.  So they've agreed to put socialist friendly messages  in the game.  Is this, this is the beginning of it.  I think we're going to see a lot more of this.  The localization will provide quote, healthy, positive,  cultural and value guidance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Socialist messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To sell it in China?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, why not?  While you're shooting somebody at least to say, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, forward with the great economy.  Everyone, everyone sells a little of their soul  to do business in China.  So, you know.  That's a minor thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well.  Meanwhile, we've got artificial intelligence  that can hunt down missile sites faster than a human.  Much faster than a human.  A good use for AI.  They don't too much.  No, this is ours.  These are our guys looking for missiles in China.  They could be the other guys.  Yeah, well I'm sure the other guys have that too.  They're doing the same thing.  Yeah.  My uncle did this for the CIA.  This was his job for years for the CIA  is analyzing satellite photography.  I guess he'd be out of work now.  An AI would be putting him out of work.  You know what I need?  I know what I need to turn around this culture of despair.  I need a fine cup of blue bottle coffee.  Oh my goodness.  Blue bottle time.  Blue bottle is the best coffee you've ever had.  The days are getting shorter.  The weather's cooling off and nothing compliments  an autumn day, a crisp autumn day,  like a warm, delicious cup of coffee.  Not just any coffee.  Coffee's so rich, so flavorful, so delicious.  You'll say, where have you been all my life?  I don't know, have you had blue bottle  when you've been in San Francisco, Jeff?  It is uniquely amazing.  Darn good.  Darn good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is so good that I actually gave my neighbor some.  Well I did subscribe, but I gave my neighbor some  and she subscribed.  Nice.  She was like, this is delicious.  And I was like, yes it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You wouldn't think, I mean you'd think coffee is coffee.  But if you've been drinking U-Ban all your life,  ho ho baby, that's not coffee.  Look at this is, by the way, one of the things  that makes Blue Bottle unique is when you subscribe  and they have a bimonthly subscription  so you get coffee every other week.  When you subscribe, they roast your beans  within 48 hours of shipping.  So it's, and it has the date right on it.  And I have to tell you, fresh beans make a huge difference.  They source amazing both blends and single farm coffees.  I'm looking at the Costa Rica Chiripo Regulo de Rivas  and they have a whole cart in here about the family  that raised the coffee and about the notes, you know,  fudge or sweet, ah, sweet aromas and ah,  fruit forward profiles, deep chocolatey espressos.  Peak freshness.  They haven't been sitting on a dusty shelf for hours  or days or weeks or years.  No, this is the freshest, most delicious coffee.  They even have a decaf.  I don't know why you drink it, but if you needed it,  the nightlight decaf is fabulous.  Oh, this is three Africa's,  it's three different African beans.  Oh, and you gotta read the card.  It says, this coffee is the definition of homemade,  grown, processed, and even dry milled  on the Urena family farm among the mango trees  of Rivas, Costa Rica.  Years of tinkering have brought its sweetness  into focus with a tart complexity that should please  its farmer, the ambitious Regalug Gerardo Ruirenya,  as much as it astonishes anyone  with the good fortune to taste it.  Rainier cherry dried fig creme brulee.  I've got a Giant Steps.  Actually, this is my favorite.  I shouldn't admit to liking blends, but I love,  I don't know what they're, they have a coffee master,  really knows what they're doing.  Ugandan and Sumatran beans,  ultra balanced, dense, chocolatey cup  that stands up to cream quite well.  That's might be why, because I drink it with,  sinful but it's delicious heavy whipping cream.  If coffee were any heavier bodied,  you could pour it on pancakes, viscous, fudgy, substantial.  That's my bean, that's my brew, what's your brew?  Go to bluebottlecoffee.com slash twig,  $10 off your first subscription order.  And Stacey said it, what a great gift.  This would be for friends and family.  Maybe a great gift for Thanksgiving.  While you're there, check out their digital holiday store.  Blue Bottle Coffee makes a great gift.  That's actually a good idea to bring coffee  for your Thanksgiving.  Bluebottlecoffee.com slash,  oh, that smells so good, slash twig.  Time for our picks of the week and our number of the week.  Why don't you start us off, Stacey?  You got anything fun for us?  You already gave us a bunch of fun stuff  with that weird pot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The weird pot.  Stacey and her weird pot.  Okay, if you go to my Twitter account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, I always do.  Twitter.com slash at Gigaome.  At Giga Stacey.  Giga Stacey.  Giga Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, where'd it go?  Hold on.  Oh, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you take it down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, okay.  Have you been banned?  November 22nd.  So no, there's this, there's it here.  I'll pop it in, copy, paste.  My thing is a toy that I'm reviewing for my dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The clever pet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, you found it.  Okay, so that is the clever pet.  That's a toy?  It is a $300 WiFi powered game for your dog.  And the goal is, see those things that light up?  It's like simple Simon.  So the goal is eventually your dog will be trained  to touch those in order to get the treat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if he does it right, he gets a treat.  Right.  Does, has your dog learned?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So my dog is still trying to figure out  how the touch pads work.  Yeah, why does it open sometimes, mom?  Yeah, if you turn the sound up,  you'll hear her barking at it,  cause she's just like, ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, what is this doing?  Why are you doing this to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so.  There you go.  That's my daughter whispering.  Yes.  And then.  Your daughter's gonna help with that cheat.  That noise goes on all day long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Basically it's a Skinner box for your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yes, that is the toy for your dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish it weren't so expensive and I wish I had a dog,  but other than that, great pick.  Cats would just say F you.  Oh yeah.  Although there are cat games,  we have played the little Friskies fishing game  with the kitties and they will paw that iPad  trying to catch those fish forever.  I have a video of it somewhere else.  I'll find it with the brilliant Google Photos search tool  while Jeff Jarvis gives us his numbers of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I was going to do the new hashtag 2017 in four words,  but then I looked up the most current entries  and don't go there.  Oh dear, of course, cause they're filthy, right?  No, it's ruined.  But my favorite was vote.  I can't get the four words vote next time, but basically.  Hashtag vote next time.  But it doesn't.  So nine ways Twitter can punish you doing bad things.  Okay.  Right?  So there's a list there.  What I wonder is, do they ever do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they say that what they can,  they can yank your blue check.  I know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can ensure your tweet reaches  a smaller audience.  They can block you from tweeting.  They can hide your tweet from users in a specific country.  They can, but if they can do all these things,  how come we still have so much abuse on Twitter?  You know, I used to be of the mind that Twitter should be  open and everything goes and it's an open network,  but I'm now in the mind that they need to worry about  the civility of what occurs there and their responsibility.  And they got to figure out their own standards of that.  I know that's not easy,  but they let a lot of really bad crap go  that's been reported.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it, it's not getting better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so, but I don't know.  Maybe that's, maybe I sound like, like right now,  like all the despairing internet users who say,  the society's falling apart.  But, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, my, I, and I'm not trying to invite people  to yell at me on Twitter,  but my Twitter stream is a really nice place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mine's been getting better.  Now maybe I've blocked, muted,  and unfollowed the bad apples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I have.  He was mean to me today was very nice.  I had someone who told me that this is a,  what did they tell me?  It was, they didn't like something I wrote  and they love our president, Donald Trump.  So they are unsubscribing to my newsletter.  Fair enough.  But, and I said, okay, because, you know,  but even that is like the most negative thing  that I think I've had, which I'm okay with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are a very fortunate person.  What I see is people who report awful stuff  and then show the response from Twitter saying,  this doesn't violate our standards.  I do see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, now, and I have seen people talking about  what they've, you know, and I'm not denying  that it's a bad place for other people  and that it shouldn't be a bad place for people.  I'm just kind of like, I don't know.  I feel like I like Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My Twitter has been, you know, and sometimes it's terrible,  but last few months it's been quite pleasant.  I agree.  Oh, all right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And actually to that point, I'm gonna show you  a little tool that I've been using a lot lately.  You may notice I have a lot of news stuff in my tweets.  I basically tweet out, you know, any of the news stories  that we're thinking about.  This is from Dave Weiner, the guy who, I love Dave.  He's kind of a-  He invented blogging.  Yeah, he invented blogging.  He's kind of a curmudgeon.  He also invented outlining with Think Tank.  You may remember Think Tank going way back when.  Podcast, podcast.  And was a proto-podcaster when Adam Curry,  the pod father came to him and said,  you know, Dave, he invented RSS, Dave Weiner did.  Dave, you ought to include binary enclosures  in those RSS feeds, like maybe an audio file.  Dave did and invented thereby the medium,  which we are using right now.  He has a lot of little tools on the web  because he's a programmer.  He just likes to write stuff.  Most of them, I think, are written for himself.  But I like Radio 3.  I have a little bookmark in my, a bookmark lit  in my toolbar and my browsers to Radio3.io.  And this is now how I tweet.  So you can, and by the way, notice 280 characters.  He's of course fixed it.  You could put titles, links, enclosures.  Your tweet will appear in this box.  You can also have a cross post as I do  to Facebook as well as Twitter.  You get a, as a result, you get a feed  so you can see my, in effect, a link blog.  I mean, this was what blogs originally were, right?  Just lists of links.  And so this has automatically become a link blog.  These are all the things I've posted at Radio3.  And most, and what they are basically  is mostly news stories.  Very useful tool.  I have an if this, then that script  that automatically takes what I post here,  puts it on our pin board,  automatically imports our pin board  into a Google spreadsheet for our producers use  so we can build the rundowns.  It's kind of a nice little workflow.  And it's, I get up in the morning  and I just read through all the news sources.  And I click Radio3 whenever I want to save it.  It does a very nice job.  And-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, Ohm, you gotta tell Ohm,  because this is-  Ohm would love this.  When I, when we were at Giga Ohm,  probably three times in the eight years I was there,  he tried to start basically stuff we're reading,  just like a link blog.  Yeah, he still, he does that every weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He has weekendreads.ohm.co, which I love.  But yeah, he should have a link blog.  Oh my, wait a minute, ohm.co, not .com.  That scared me.  I saw ohm.com is for sale and I thought, oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He went to .co because the .co guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So I don't know if he still does it.  I think he might not, but he used to do weekend reads,  which I really liked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He does it off and on.  He's a venture capitalist now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's writing about you.  He says-  Oh yes, he does that.  He says, my new link blog.  Back in the day, I used to publish the daily Ohm.  So now he's gonna do what, another link blog?  I don't know.  I don't know.  This was November 7th, so.  Yeah, and let's see what's there.  Ohm.blog, let's see if he did it.  Did he do it?  Well, it looks just like ohm.co.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so you should tell him about this  because Ohm reads-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will, he needs something easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, he reads a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, I think he's on WordPress.  This also posts to WordPress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yes, he is.  So it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It will post to Twitter, Facebook, Slack,  and a WordPress blog.  So it really is the easiest way to do a link blog.  And it supports kind of these sophisticated things  like the web links and all of that stuff  that I don't really understand,  but that What's His Name is always talking about,  Kevin Marks.  Well, that is it.  I hope you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  It was so much fun.  As always, to spend a couple of hours  with you on a Wednesday,  Stacey Higginbotham.
