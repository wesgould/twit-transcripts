He's back in his office in New York City at the City University of New York.  I'm home today, actually.  Oh, you're home.  All right.  Great.  Yes, I'm home.  And that's right.  You are home.  You were just in Ottawa this morning.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes.  Have a nice visit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's always pleasant.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I love Canadians.  Were you speaking up there?  Yeah, I spoke about the future of Canadian media.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you, are you, that's interesting as opposed to other media.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, actually they're in better shape than America.  Oh, interesting.  That's a whole other podcast.  Canadians are literate.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They are.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And nice.  Oh, they're so nice.  That's always, you know, the story is you bump into a Canadian, he apologizes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The joke on Twitter today when I said something about this is somebody said the way you got  a Canadian to apologize is by stepping on his foot.  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Also here from Moscow, well, San Francisco, just down the road, a piece from Moscone Center.  She's actually in the Pixelcore offices today.  The author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave, Gina Trapani.  Hi, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hey, how's it going?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's great.  You were at the keynote today.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was.  I was.  I was in a nerd filled room.  It was very exciting.  Good.  For hours.  We have much to talk about.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Many hours.  It seemed to go on a long time.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It did go on a bit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Also here to comment on Google I.O., Kevin Marks, who's in his office at British Telecom  at BT.  He's a part of Ribbit.com and a great commentator, a man who's been at Google.  Were you an evangelist, social advocate?  Advocate.  Advocate.  There's a better word.  Better word than evangelist.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Where's the hierarchy there?  Advocate is two-way.  Evangelism is one-way.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  There you go.  Oh, I like it.  I like it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Kevin is the proto-podcaster.  He was the first to show the use of an iPod with podcasts when he was working at Apple,  worked on QuickTime and iChat.  It's so great to have you all here to talk about Google I.O.  So what was this?  Since you were in the audience, Gina, give us a little painting.  Since you were in the audience, Gina, give us a little painting picture of what it was  like this morning.  First of all, I have to say this keynote is not the only keynote, is it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, it isn't.  There's one tomorrow morning as well at 8.30 a.m.  I don't know what they were thinking about that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Developers, people.  Developers.  Is it you who said, oh, that must mean Vic got a hotel room in San Francisco?  Yeah, that's pretty funny.  He's not driving up from Mountain View, that's for sure.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, there are a couple of announcements that I thought were going to happen today  that didn't.  So I'm kind of holding out hope for tomorrow.  So I actually am going to be there at 8.30 in the morning.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess it means we have to do our live coverage again because what was missing in the talk?  What did you expect that you did not hear?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I expected to hear a lot more about Android.  We didn't hear too much about Android.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There was zero Chrome OS and Android talk.  Zero.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, there was some Chrome talk, right?  So they announced the Chrome Web Store.  So that was something Chromium related.  But yeah, no, not as much Chrome or Chrome OS as I expected.  But the Chrome Web Store is probably the most exciting thing I thought for developers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So we'll hold off.  We can speculate on what Android announcements there might be.  Apparently, Tim Ray says tomorrow is Android Day at the keynote.  So it'll be worth getting up at 8.30.  Okay.  Oh, God.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Especially since you all got the phones, there's got to be a payoff here.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, they gave everybody who came to the conference from the US, they gave a Motorola  Droid.  And because that's CDMA, they gave the GSM Nexus One to the international developers who  came.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And still no 2.2 pushed out, I was hoping.  I was looking for Froyo.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Froyo.  Maybe tomorrow.  Froyo, where are you?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right.  Well, let's talk about how big a crew was it in there?  Was it a large audience?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So I think it was 5,000 developers in attendance.  Holy cow.  In total, I don't know that all those developers were in that room, but it was packed.  It was pretty packed.  I was there fairly early and didn't get a seat anywhere really near the front.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's no Fritos left in San Francisco.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Not to mention Mountain Dew.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It was shoulder to shoulder.  And I definitely, I got to the coffee table and everything but the decaf was already gone.  Oh.  It's pretty.  They serve breakfast in the morning.  Burge.  Yeah.  I got there pretty early.  This is my first I.O. and I was all worried about being late.  But checking in was, you scan a barcode.  I had the email from Google on my phone and I scanned that barcode in the email and printed out my badge and it was done.  There was no line.  That was great.  But actually filing into the exhibit hall.  It was exciting.  It's a lot of guys in t-shirts, as one would expect at a developer conference.  Yeah.  Kind of shoulder to shoulder with their laptops and iPads and Nexus 1s.  I was trying really hard to snap pictures with my Nexus 1 and just upload them to Picasa but the reception wasn't great in there.  And the Wi-Fi was very, very spotty which became apparent during one of their demos.  I think that was kind of embarrassing for them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They were doing an HTML5 demo of, I guess it was Clicker and he said, I can't get online.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then later they did another developer demo of a new app that they built with Google Web Toolkit.  It had an iPad and Nexus 1 side by side and wanted to show like, hey, when you add this record, it just pops up automatically on this other device.  And it didn't.  And it was painful.  And it was embarrassing.  Like everybody in the room really wanted it to work and it wasn't quite working.  They had to try it once or twice.  And there was like nervous laughter.  Everyone applauded when it finally did work.  But it's one of those things where you're just like, this shouldn't happen.  And they have speaker specific Wi-Fi but still even that was kind of spotty.  So that was a bit painful.  But the rest was very fun.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It became pretty clear.  I mean, we covered it live as part of our new initiative to do more live coverage on Twitter.  We covered it live here.  Tom and I were watching and watching your wave as you and Kevin and Adam Pash waved what was going on in there.  And it became pretty clear right away that Google did not see this as Apple, for instance, sees as WWDC keynote as a big public event.  They were talking developers, weren't they?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It was very developer heavy.  And I was saying this earlier, you know, like Apple, for better or for worse, Apple set this precedent, you know, that their developer conference involves this like big exciting consumer product launch.  You know, so it's, you know, so you go to something like I.O. and I was hoping for something like, you know, big Google TV launch today.  Or I was thinking that something as sort of big as the iPad or the iPhone was going to happen.  And, you know, there was a lot of really great news for developers, but it was very, very developer specific.  I mean, at one point they were running, you know, they had like the command lineup on a Ubuntu desktop and like was, you know, we were watching text output kind of fly by on the big screens.  And I was like, wow, this wouldn't ever happen at WWDC keynote ever in a million years.  So in a way, I was like, oh, yes, this is wonderful.  These are my people.  But at the same time, I was like, oh, this is boring.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you think, Jeff, that that Google missed an opportunity?  I mean, here's a chance to speak to the world.  I mean, I at first thought, oh, well, maybe nobody's watching.  But then all the Twitter trending topics in the US were about Google.  I know there are people were watching.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think I think that the future to Google success is the developer community.  And so doing something just aimed at them, I think makes a lot of sense.  What it does say is what they have to do to is a consumer piece.  They had they had Zeitgeist in London last week.  And as I tweeted, what do I have to do to get invited to this writer friggin book?  But that's aimed at a very high end community, the developer event.  I think when you look at the future of Chrome and the future of Android, it rests entirely on developers shoulders.  So I think making really nice with developers and talking directly to them about the things that matter to them, I think makes a lot of sense.  But they also need they're becoming more.  They are consumer brand.  They're the number one consumer brand in the world.  For God's sakes, they've got to speak to consumers.  And they don't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There is no event that they could do that.  I mean, this is their event.  There is no other event.  They could make an event.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think they could make it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They could make an event.  And I think they should make it another event for consumers, for product launches for consumers.  This didn't feel like this wasn't the right stage to expect a big consumer launch.  And that was probably partially partially my mistake.  It was great for developers.  But I think for the public watching, you know, for people who are just kind of interested in Google, I think that it probably was a disappointment, although I'm not sure.  I mean, what was the reception like?  I didn't get to watch Twitter too closely.  You know, I was watching it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But, you know, they were just bullet pointing at Kevin Marx.  You're a developer as well.  I mean, you develop a little bit.  But you do it.  Ribbit is a plugin for Wave.  What did you get the message message received from Google?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it was I think what you're saying is right.  I think the second half of the keynote was was a very dense thing that was aimed at the in-house developers who work with a particular tool set.  And it was very interesting for them.  But the rest of us were like, where's the if we're waiting for Android, we're killing the wrong keynote.  And the stuff they announced earlier on in the upfront stuff was was interesting.  The VP announcement is obviously very interesting.  Yes, getting the commitments to HTML5 from a bunch of other people was also good.  And the other stuff was, you know, I think they were covering different set of audiences with different bits of the keynote.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You said that you noted that in the way.  You said, OK, now this is apparently this is we've gone to corporate developers.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, you know, they were talking about hosting Java applications.  We're talking about App Engine.  What do they call it?  App Engine professional or something like that?  App Engine for Business.  And they were and then they were saying and we can second source this with VMware and Spring and deploy it to more than one place.  So it's a whole bunch of stuff that corporate developers think, oh, that's really important.  I was second sourcing.  I can write stuff in Java and it's great.  And all the web people are going, huh, Java, do we have to write that again?  So it's it's it's a slightly different set of communities.  So they were addressing two communities in the two halves of the thing.  The first half was the sort of the web people, the people who are who are building all the websites, who are building front end stuff and back end stuff in the dynamic languages.  And then the second half was clearly a bunch of people who targeted the Java programmers who were, you know, a lot of them are writing in housings.  They were saying, look, here's our expense reporting app.  That's our example application.  You should be excited about this.  And everyone's going, what?  Is that exactly?  Yes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And the expense report was like for one hundred and fifty dollar dinner.  And you're kind of like, I was thinking, when's the last time I expense at one hundred fifty dollar dinner?  Clearly, I'm working on doing the wrong.  I'm working for the wrong company.  I need to be working for a big company.  You know, developers actually started to leave toward the end.  People were getting up and leaving.  Not it wasn't a mass exodus, but it was certainly like several developers are getting up and leaving, which surprised me because I was I had this thing in my mind like there's going to be one last big thing.  And there really wasn't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There were there were at least two things that could have been the last big thing.  I thought there would be a Google TV announcement, Froyo or something having to do with Android seem to be on the dock.  And maybe tomorrow that's when they'll announce those two things.  Was there anything else missing that we expect?  Oh, everybody said that Google was going to do an S3 competitor.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Google Storage.  Yeah.  I mean, they did.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, they announced it on the blog and they did it for developers, not not for end users as S3 kind of is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And is Google Storage part of App Engine for Business?  Well, maybe it's a separate.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was, you know, it just shows kind of a little disjointedness in terms of Google's messaging because the while the keynotes going on, their blog post goes live about this storage for developers and they tweet about it.  And I'm watching Twitter going.  There's a Google I.O. tweet that has nothing to do with the keynote that we're watching right now.  I can't figure it out.  Are they out of order?  What happened?  It's it's it's it was just surprising.  It's not really a criticism.  You're right, Gina.  In some ways, it's kind of refreshing.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I think probably is is that they've this is their big bang to announce a lot of stuff and some stuff makes to the keynote and some stuff is going out in sessions.  Right.  So they announced the Google font and the Google font directory in the font API stuff, which is which is a nice project.  And it's a whole bunch of other stuff that will be rolling out.  You know, they'll be talking about buzz APIs and things.  And some stuff got put into the keynote because they thought that was that was a core message.  But because there any webcasting a bit of the conference, the rest of the rest of these announcements seem a bit fuzzy.  But basically, it's just like everyone inside Google has been lining stuff up to talk about it this week and they want to announce it there so they can show the developers it and have the conversation with the developers in the building.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So they should just have a summary of what else is going on.  They're not thinking like media, oddly.  It is odd.  Right.  They just had a blog post saying, here's everything that happened today.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I'm sure they'll do roundups, but you know, it's Google is very distributed.  There's lots of teams working on different things and they all get a little slot time slot here and actually putting that together is going to be hard for them.  This is one big message type company.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, it's true.  But I think you could hire one producer for the day who says, OK, let's get it all together.  Anyway, anyway, it's here we are criticizing the showbiz of it.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's kind of fine because it just shows, you know, a slick Google might scare me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  To be honest, it kind of makes you happy that they're just a little kind of disorganized or a little bit like engineer.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's like it's like the federal government.  We're kind of glad they're a little inept because the last thing you want is a super efficient Google like they really know what they're doing.  God, that would be scary.  All right.  Well, let's talk about we do have there were some I think significant announcements and I want to parse those in just a second.  I think something really big to talk about.  But but first, before we do that, I would like to welcome a brand new sponsor to the show and the network.  They sponsored for the first time are breaking coverage this morning.  And we're really thrilled to have them because I use them.  I know, Jeff, you use them as well.  We're talking about sling box.  It's a way to watch your favorite TV shows when you're away from home.  And if you haven't yet tried a sling box, you're going to love this.  Now, here's the deal.  It's very simple.  There are three steps.  You buy a sling box, you connect it to your DVR or your cable, whatever TV inputs you have at home, and you connect it to the Internet.  That's it.  There's no step for now.  You can on almost any device, your Blackberry, your iPhone, your iPod touch with Wi-Fi, Mac or Windows, log on and see what's coming out of your cable box anywhere you are in the world.  As long as you get Internet access, the quality is fantastic.  You can you know, you have a remote control that lets you control these devices, reset recordings and so forth.  So here's my suggestion.  Go to Best Buy, buy a sling box, bring it home, hook it up.  Within a minute, five minutes, you'll be able to watch sling box.  And, you know, the new iPhone application is great because you can do it on Wi-Fi or 3G.  There is there are applications coming for other platforms like the Android is just around the corner.  I'm playing with the beta.  I'm sure they've got an iPad app coming.  That's going to be the killer app.  Sling box on the iPad will be.  Bing Presto.  In fact, it's not just when you travel just anywhere in the house.  If you've got a sling box hooked up, you'll be able to walk around and watch TV.  Check out sling box at a Best Buy near you.  Go to sling box dot com for more information.  And we thank sling box not only for supporting the network, but also for helping us do more breaking news,  because that's really one of the things I really wanted to do with the network in general is when stories when there's tech news out there,  I want to be able to cover it.  And sling is making that possible.  So thank you, sling box, sling box dot com for more information or just head out to a Best Buy near you.  So there were some announcements.  In fact, I think nothing that we didn't expect.  I think the VPA announcement was expected.  Kevin, as the guy who did QuickTime, I think you're probably best able to explain what this means.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  OK, I'll give it a go.  So there's been a long running battle over video formats, audio and video formats on the Web.  And back in the 90s and 2000s, we had basically QuickTime and Microsoft and Real fighting over this.  And if you want to play video, you had to pick one or put more than one format up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And if you want if you wanted to do it in a browser, you had to download the software.  You had to put a plug in it.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  It's a download a plug in.  Yeah, you put a plug in to do that.  So when Flash added video because Flash, I wrote about this a couple of years ago.  So when Flash added video to Flash, the value that they had was that Flash was already installed in 90, 95 percent of browsers.  Not to playback video.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think a lot of people think of Flash as a video player, but not to playback video.  No, no, it was interactivity.  It was widgets and stuff.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  It was originally Future Splash in 1993 or whatever it was.  And it was vectors.  And it was a vector system.  And then it was and then they added more features over time and made it more of an interactive programming system.  Sure.  And then they added video.  I can't remember exactly when 2002, 2001, something like that.  And they they picked a sort of fairly old and not great codec video codec for it.  And but because they were broadly installed and they'd actually focused on getting installed in as many browsers possible and not being annoying.  Whereas everyone else seemed to have some second order agenda that.  Oh, God. Real networks was a time of abomination.  And destroyed themselves.  Microsoft and real were about getting to download the player and selling ads in the player.  And there was always some kind of annoyance there.  And whereas Flash focused really well on getting it everywhere.  So they became the thing that you used to play video.  Now, their codec wasn't very good.  Was it Sorensen?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Was that what they were using?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  They were using the Sorensen one and then they were using VP3.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they do VP6 now is the kind of default.  Yeah.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, no, no.  What they switched to what they switched to was so there was then there was so then there's H264.  Now, H264 is the successor to MPEG video.  MPEG video was what we used for video back in.  Yeah.  But no, we had a whole pile of weird.  That's right.  A bunch of them.  And they were standardized.  So MPEG4 was like the iteration of the standardized video.  We use MPEG2 for broadcast TV, for example.  Right.  So MPEG4 was an iteration of that.  And one of the codecs in that was H264.  And that was standardized by Apple was Apple worked to help standardize that and get that in there.  And it was standardized as part of a Blu-ray format.  And it's been built into a lot of cameras and there's chipsets for it.  So H264 is the day factor stand for video now.  And it's what everyone will now play.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it's a good codec.  It has a lot of features.  I mean, it scales beautifully depending on your bandwidth.  It works at almost any bandwidth.  It gives you something.  Yeah.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So it's there and it works.  But it has expensive licensing, which means you can't distribute it with an open source browser.  You can't distribute open source versions of it.  Or rather, that's not strictly true because the way the licensing works.  You can distribute open source versions as long as you don't distribute many.  It is kind of weird.  Basically, what happened was that Apple held a gun to the head of the MPEG LA a while back.  And got them to agree this license that was a per unit royalty, but with a floor and a ceiling.  So below a certain number you didn't pay.  And above a certain number, you just paid a flat fee.  Which means that if you're a large company, you can pay the five million a year or so and license it.  Which means that Apple and Adobe and Microsoft.  No big deal.  And Google and anyone else who adds to that scale has a known amount they pay per year.  So that makes sense.  They'll do that compared to...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But Mozilla might not want to.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  But Mozilla doesn't want to.  So Mozilla didn't want to do that.  So the current battle over video and HTML5 was there's now a way to express, I want to embed a video here.  We just put video.  Here's the file.  That's it.  Like embedding an image.  Which seems like a great thing, except getting people to agree on the format of the video is this sort of...  Brings in all these giant standards and patent war.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now how analogous is this to the image tag?  Because the image tag doesn't specify JPEG, GIF or PING.  The browser renders it.  Now as we know, JPEG and GIF are encumbered.  PING is not.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  JPEG isn't anymore.  JPEG's not.  And GIF has expired now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So they're all encumbered and the browser renders them all.  There was a time when Unisys said, well, we want royalties for GIF.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah, no, and when I was at Apple, a friend of mine had one of those Millennium Countdown clocks.  He adjusted to when the GIF patent expires so that he can then ship it.  Oh, how interesting.  Oh, how funny.  Because Apple wouldn't pay the royalty.  But in the same way, we've got this issue with audio.  With MP3, you have to pay money to...  It's encumbered as well.  Front-Half-Royalty.  It's encumbered too.  But all the browsers have dealt with that.  So what happened is Mozilla stuck their heels in and said, we're not going to pay the money.  We're not going to ship 264.  And then it got into a patents are evil type thing.  It also got into a warning that these patents have some time to run.  And although the fees are set at that rate at the moment, they're going to go up.  Their potential can go up in the future.  They've only agreed the fees for the next two years.  And clearly, if everyone does sign on H.264, then the MPEG-LA can suddenly go, haha, now we can raise our prices on you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, Microsoft and Apple are both members of MPEG-LA.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yes, but that's just because they have a few video patents.  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The bulk of the...  So who determines the course of action that MPEG-LA chooses?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  A combination of the members.  So Apple and Microsoft will have some votes on that.  They'll have a vote, but not all the votes.  But I think they're both paying in more than they get out from it.  That's right.  Yeah.  And part of the point of the patent pool is it's a demilitarized zone.  It stops you suing each other.  So they get enough of the patents together that Panasonic and Sony and everyone else who's got patents in that pool, Phillips, will basically agree not to sue each other.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's mutually assured destruction.  You sue me, I'm going to sue you and the whole thing.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah, we're seeing that in the phone market at the moment.  But there's a sort of patent fight going on there.  But the video stuff has been fairly messy over the years.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So H.264 is technically very good, but it's patented.  It's patent-encumbered.  There was some thought about Ogtheora, which is an open source.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So Ogtheora is based on an earlier version of the codec from this group that Google just bought.  VP3.  And this is VP8.  And basically they added one each time they came up with a new way of doing it.  It was addable.  So it's pretty old.  VP3 is fairly old.  The quality was...  It's okay.  It's not terrible quality.  And the other thing is there's this sort of weird thing about codecs where you agree the decoding model first and then over time the encoders get better because they get better at adjusting things to fit that decoding model.  So a bunch of people have shown stuff with theodora that looks pretty good and works quite well.  And there's always a trade-off in quality and bandwidth.  And to some extent, there's not a huge difference in how these codecs work.  There's just some subtleties there.  Microsoft has VC1, which basically they took H.264 and then iterated on it a bit more and tuned it more for their processors.  And that is actually a bit nicer than H.264.  And Microsoft will give it away free, but they won't give you a source.  You've got to do a source license.  So that sort of founded on their inability to open source it as well, if you like.  So what we have with VP8 is something that Google has bought the IP to.  They brought the engineers to work on it.  And now they said they're going to open source that and build it into this WebM project, which is at webmproject.org, which is the idea is they're going to use the Matroska media container.  You're kidding. It's using Matroska?  Yeah.  Oh, dear.  Vorbis Audio and VP8 Video.  I didn't hear the Matroska part. Huh.  I haven't actually looked at the Matroska containers, but that's that they did with them.  It's widely used on pirated video.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's how I know about it.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I haven't actually looked. I don't know the data structure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the only reason I'm very aware of it is because it's very difficult to play back on some hardware.  Apple TV, for instance, you have to unwrap the Matroska wrapper to get to the underlying MP4 so you could play it back.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Are those MKV files?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's MKV.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, those are always a pain.  They're ugly.  Yeah, they're ugly.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  But maybe but it's all about implementation.  I haven't looked at the inside of it, so I can't comment on the ugliness.  It's interesting that they didn't pick OGG as the format, because I have some issues with OGG, but I haven't looked at Matroska enough to.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Apple made noise that, remember Steve Jobs' email and Microsoft has said the same thing, that Theora is not as unencumbered as one might think.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So there was this issue of what they call submarine patents.  So when I was at Apple, I spent a chunk of time working on QuickTime.  I was trying to get them to ship Vorbis as part of QuickTime because I thought it was an interesting codec.  It's an audio only codec, right?  It's an audio only codec. It's a nice codec.  It has some slight weirdnesses to it, but it's because it's not...  I can go into details.  It's quite clever in that it has variable size chunks, depending on whether it's trying to encode something that's percussive or something that's tonal.  And so most audio codecs have fixed size chunks and it has variable size chunks and it can use different bits for that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's VBR, but it's even VBR within the packet.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  It's VBR, but it's VBR at a low level, structural level, which makes it quite hard to write code to deal with.  Anyway, we could have worked around that.  But I ran into the same thing. I went to the Apple guy and said, I want to ship this.  And they said, well, OK, let's talk about the, you know, can we license from someone?  I said, no, no, it's open source. We can ship it.  And they said, well, no, you can't because if you do, we could get sued.  And if we get sued by the MPA LA, we won't be able to play DVDs anymore.  And we're shipping machines that play DVDs.  Thank you very much. If you get that, you stop us doing that, then I'm going to be in trouble.  And so their whole, you know, their worry was because they've signed up to the patent pools,  multiple of these patent pools, and they're a big enough target to sue.  They didn't they didn't want this to happen.  And they've still said this consistently in the HTML5 discussions about there may be submarine patents.  We may get sued by Dolby. We may get sued by Fraunhofer Labs.  We may get sued by somebody else over Vorbis.  We may get sued over the video patents that that could happen, too.  And we're not willing to take this risk.  And basically, Google today has said we're willing to take that risk.  We're going to ship this thing. We're going to open source it.  If you have submarine patents, hi, we're a big target. Come sue us.  Not in quite so many words, but effectively, they've said we're going to call the bluff of this sort of fear about submarine patents  because this is this is a good thing to do.  I think it is a good thing to do.  I suspect we're not going to get rid of 264 or even the other older formats overnight  because we have a bunch of devices will only play those because they're hardware.  What they what they said was and it wasn't quite clear exactly what they said.  They said, you know, converting the YouTube videos to this format, starting with the 720p and up ones.  So what they may end up doing is saying, OK, we're going to do the highest bandwidth stuff using VP eight  and then the lower quality ones will use 264 for so they will still play on your your Apple devices.  But the better looking stuff will be using this new code.  And the other piece that the other sort of surrounded announcements was they had Mozilla and Opera stand up and said they supported,  which is not surprising.  This is exactly what Mozilla wanted an open source code that they can ship.  But they also had Kevin Lynch of Adobe saying that Adobe is going to ship VP eight in the next version of Flash.  And there was also a note from Microsoft saying if you install a VP codec on Windows will play VP eight to which was it is slightly disingenuous.  They didn't say if you install a Matrosk or importer and blah, blah, blah.  But they were basically saying because I delegate media playback to the to the operating system,  if you can get the operating system to play Internet Explorer will play it too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Seems like they should just bundle the damn codec.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  But there's one. Yeah.  But both halves of that are tricky.  So Safari and I basically delegate this to the US, whereas Firefox and Chrome try and embed the stuff themselves.  And they will they will call plugins in some circumstances, not others.  So I found this when I was trying to do a, you know, an audio show like this, I was using we using shoutcast,  which I thought everyone could play because it's just MP3 files stuck together in a long thing.  And Chrome wouldn't play it because Chrome wasn't delegating it back to anything.  It was just saying, don't understand.  I'm going to give you an error dialog rather than throwing it out to the flash or QuickTime or whatever else people have installed.  So that was interesting for me to see that the assumption that I was making that this is an old format,  everything can play it is now getting broken because they're tying the formats up with the actual browsers that are running them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's a really good post on x264dev.multimedia.cx in which he analyzes VP8.  And I don't I don't know if he's known or respected in the community or if he knows what he's talking about.  But he does have a lot to say about it, one of which is that the spec for VP8 is basically C code from the source code.  It's the source code. So it's not an easy spec to to to decode if it were.  He also says the Matroska. Yeah, it's it's x.264dev.multimedia.cx.  He says Matroska is actually a good container.  He says it's not even very surprising they chose it.  It's one of the most widely used quote modern container formats and is many way best suited to the task.  He says MP4, which is another container, is not very flexible.  Also, Matroska has streaming in the spec. I like to hear that.  You don't have to do the hacky chunk streaming that MP4 does.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, streaming in the spec can be a damage.  I mean, that's basically why all is bad because they assume you were streaming and they basically encoded packet sizes into the spec, which makes it quite hard to generalize it.  OK, I should read up more.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would love to get your take on this.  He says one possible problem is that since almost nobody currently uses Matroska for live streaming purposes, very few existing Matroska implementations support what is necessary to play streamed files.  He also says that the VP8 spec itself and again, I'm quoting his his bottom line is significantly weaker than H.264 compression wise.  He says it is as good as H.264 baseline or VC1 probably better, but not as good as H.264 main.  So technically, it may not be as good a codec, but it might be good enough.  The choice of Vorbis makes a lot of sense for the audio since AAC is encumbered and MP3 is encumbered.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Vorbis is quite a different audio codec, but it's quite interesting and its quality is good.  Certainly, people know the complaints about Vorbis have never been the quality is bad.  It's like it's slightly off.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We put out Vorbis versions of a number of our shows, including our open source show.  We stopped doing that except for the open source show, which there was literally hundreds of people listening, not thousands.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Sure, everyone uses MP3s for audio.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  MP3 is kind of a lingua franca, but the Orbus files were roughly the same size and sounded just as good.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  They actually sound better than MP3 in stuff with high dynamic range.  If you've got classical music, then Vorbis tends to sound a bit better because it has that short long packet thing going on.  But yeah, it's nuanced. MP3 is pretty old now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So there in a nutshell, coconut shell anyway, is the history of VP8 and the codecs.  Google adopting or promoting an open source codec is a good thing if everybody goes for it.  They had Opera there and they had Mozilla there, so obviously they're going to go for it.  There are two big question marks. One is hardware support.  Almost all machines now have hardware H.264 encoding built in either through the GPU or the CPU.  That makes a big difference in playback and the amount of CPU cycles used and the size of the device.  They did show a slide, which I quickly tried to parse, that showed ATI and NVIDIA on the team,  as well as Qualcomm, which makes a Snapdragon chip that's used in a lot of phones, a lot of the Google phones.  Apple, I didn't see anything. I didn't see ARM, but I might have missed it.  And I definitely didn't see Intel. I was looking hard to see Intel in there.  So there will be possibly some hardware support down the road.  And then the other big question mark is what will Apple and Microsoft do?  Because of course they make two very important browsers.  Microsoft says they're going to, as you said, going to include support if you have the codec on IE9.  Apple's silent on all of this.  I think Apple's going to have to get behind it if it's going to take off.  Don't you think that it'll have to be supported on the iPhone and the iPad if it's going to take off?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I think you don't have to at Apple.  I think Apple may end up doing it at some point.  I'm not sure how religious they are about it, but they've made a commitment to a particular set of specs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is there any reason they wouldn't? I mean, they promote HTML5.  And if this becomes the HTML5 video standard, which, by the way, that hasn't happened yet either, has it?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, as I say, HTML5 video doesn't define the codex.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So there's no body that would say W3C is not going to say, good, we endorse VPA?  No, no, that's more of a practice thing.  So that's what the browsers do, not what W3C does?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah, that's more of an install-based thing.  So I think the issue for Apple is that they've got portable devices with low-power CPUs with hardware acceleration to do this stuff.  And they've designed that with 264 in mind and its particular profiles of 264 and so on.  And the question is, could you adapt those to do this? And if so, how? And then how would you deploy that?  So it's certainly not impossible they could do that. They can make that work.  And it may be that the chipsets will pick up on that in the future, but they've still got the issue of do they want to put that effort in or will people keep doing 264 for them?  Right.  Because you've got to remember that YouTube supporting 264 was originally them and Apple working together so they could supply something that the iPhones could play.  At that point, YouTube was still primarily using the older flash codec for most of their stuff because of various issues, because it had the broadest install base.  It took a while for the 264 stuff to swap over on YouTube.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I'm sorry, Gina and Jeff, if you've fallen asleep.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, that's okay. Video streaming video is important to Twitter.  It kind of matters to me a little bit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I think it's important in general. I mean, this is a big part of the web these days. And YouTube may be the biggest player of all. It is the biggest player of all. So what YouTube does.  It's the biggest player of video, yeah.  Yeah, YouTube does.  But you already have Apple not saying YouTube.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So where does that go here? If Apple refuses to play along, what does that mean?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they could. On the iPhone and the iPad, right, it launches a YouTube app, right? So it doesn't have to play inside the mobile phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it plays it basically, in my understanding, it plays it within QuickTime, right? On the iPad and the iPhone, the QuickTime player launches.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  The iPad doesn't launch an app necessarily. The iPad can do embedded. I think for YouTube it does launch an app.  But if you embed video in the web on an iPad, it can play in the window.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it's using the QuickTime code.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yes. Well, it's some piece of QuickTime. I'm not sure it plays everything QuickTime can play.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But here's what I'm asking. Does this become an everybody against Apple thing potentially? If Adobe is now playing along and Microsoft is...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought it was interesting that Flash, Adobe was there on stage.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the F in Steve.  Yeah.  Fine. We'll play with the Steve. We'll go play with the bigger brother over here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I called it the axis of not evil.  I like that.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  From Flash's point of view, they want to remain relevant and useful system for playing stuff back.  And so if you say, here's a codec, we'll do with the IP, you can have it.  Why wouldn't they?  They're going to go, yeah, that's nice. That's cheaper than the 264.  They've got the same issues as Google and everyone else has with the MPEG-LA, which is if they become totally reliant on that, MPEG-LA can then hold them to ransom and say, right, this year the patent license fee is $50 million.  Not $5 million. No.  So there is an interest for these guys to come up with something like this.  The challenge has always been, can we stand up to this in court legally?  And effectively, that's the sort of bet that Google is taking.  That's the kind of big bet they took when they bought YouTube and got the Viacom lawsuit shortly afterwards.  The bet they took with Google Books where they took the publisher's lawsuit and said, OK, we'll fight this.  Or the bet they did when they invested $5 billion in potentially buying a mobile license to try and get better terms out of that.  So it's the kind of sort of high-level calculation that Google will make to say, we will invest some of our treasure, if you like, in doing something like this that will change the environment of the web.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think that was the main message of Google I.O. in general, was just open standards, promoting innovation using open standards, keeping the web open.  So Colleen made this point earlier.  I mean, this is Google investing a lot of money into buying something and making it open for everyone to use to make the web better in general for everyone.  Because when the web is better for everyone in general, it's better for Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Isn't that flipping the bird at Apple then? Don't we get to a closed versus open world here?  And that's the vifification we're seeing. Apple closed, high quality, no porn, all that stuff.  And Google says that the weapon against that is openness.  Right. Definitely.  So where does Apple go? So what happens in Apple today?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So Vic was doing a bit of that at the beginning where he was having a slight poke at Apple.  And it's not that fair when you're talking about HTML5, because actually Apple did this visionary thing a few years ago of building WebKit and open sourcing it.  And Google is able to build on that too.  And you want to give them credit for doing that, because that is what's really transformed the browser market.  And they clearly had the motive for doing it because they wanted it to run on their devices.  But they were good enough to open source that such that it's running on the Android devices too.  And that does actually broaden up the whole thing.  So it's the same classic commoditize your compliments thing of Apple wants to sell hardware, therefore they want to make sure people can have stuff running on their hardware.  So they have an interest in open source. Google wants to sell advertisements.  So they want to make sure that the Web is open enough that it's viable, can be used across all platforms and no one else can gatekeep that piece from them.  So they have a strong interest in it not being locked down in any way that's going to restrict them.  So there are tensions at the edges there.  But the value in the long run is that we get open source technologies that we can use in many other environments.  And that is encouraging.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is interesting, though, that Google, rumored in Froyo and 2.2, maybe, Gino, you can comment on this.  When you launch the browser pushes you to a Flash 10.1 site where Flash enabled websites are featured that Google is there may be a little tit for tat here.  Adobe may have been on stage today in gratitude to Google for really pushing the fact that Android supports Flash.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Have you seen this, Leo? Or has someone written up like an early build for you?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a write up. Let me see if I could.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So does this mean that my Android phone's battery is going to go down?  Yeah, that's a good question. They're really pushing 10.1 on Froyo.  I worry about the Flash thing. It's like I want I hope that it's just not a matter of lower standards.  You know, I mean, the fact that the job said, you know, Adobe hasn't been able to provide a handheld device running Flash that performed in an adequate, you know, to our level.  I just I just hope that Google isn't lowering their standards just to be able to flip the bird at Apple and say, well, you know, we're going to work with Adobe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would hope that too. And maybe though they can rationalize it in their mind because they've also opened this codec up and they're giving it away.  So Google may be just saying, look, we don't care. Well, you know, open means not just open source. It means open. It means everything.  Yeah, we don't say no to anything.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Right. You know, you said earlier something about, you know, Google wanting to sell ads with the Chrome Web Store.  I mean, they're not just going to be selling ads now. I mean, they're going to be selling web apps.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's talk about that. That's next. That's our next topic.  I think these are the two big announcements so far today at Google I.O. was VP8 and the Chrome Web Store.  We're going to talk about the Web Store in just a little bit. Gina Trapani is here.  She's actually in San Francisco for Google I.O. and has very kindly decamped from the conference center to next door in the Pixelcore studios.  Thanks to Pixelcore for letting us use their studios. I hope you're not missing anything important, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Miss Twig? Something important? Not possible. Twig is my something important.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'll get this over with and you can go back. I know we were hoping to do a Twig a little bit earlier, but you did go to the Wave session.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I had to go to the Wave fireside chat because I just had to, you know, I had to see the Wave team in person.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That was really fun. And I can't leave that out. There was also a big wave announcement.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There was. It'll be my tip. Which made Gina smile.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Also with us, of course, Jeff Jarvis. He's in his home, but he's back in the States after a trip to Canada.  And he's at the website BuzzMachine.com. Great to have you, Jeff and Kevin Marks from British Telecom and Ribbit.com.  Or to come in just a moment before we go much further, though, I would like to say hello to our friends at Citrix and the folks who give you a go to meeting, go to my PC, and the ultimate tool for people who have to help others.  And if you listen to this show, chances are you're the tech support person for quite a few people, family, friends, maybe even work in the business.  You ought to know about GoToAssist Express. I've been using it since the screensavers days to fix people's computers.  The latest version of GoToAssist Express is incredible. Fast, effective, secure, works on Macs and PCs, so you can support anybody, anywhere.  In fact, recently named the worldwide market leader in remote support by Frost and Sullivan.  It's the number one remote support solution because it's easy to use, it's affordable, it's secure.  You don't have to pre-install software on your customers' computers either.  You just send them a link and within less than a minute, they're ready to go.  They can set it up so you have unattended access. You can run up to eight sessions at once, which means you can get an install going or a fix and go to the next machine, the next machine, so you waste no time waiting.  You can get an assay of what software is running on that machine, including the operating system and any security software running in the background.  It's just a really handy tool. They have day passes. That's what I do. I stack up all my support requests and then I do a day pass.  But a month to month is good too if you do a lot of support.  From Citrix, everything you do, 128-bit SSL encrypted, 24-7 customer support, try it right now free for 30 days.  You know, this might be enough to get it all done. Just go to gotoassist.com slash twig and it's yours for free for 30 days.  Go to assist.com slash twig. We thank them so much. Citrix is such a great supporter of the Twitter network. We thank you Citrix for all you do for us.  So tell us Gina about the web app store. I thought this was very interesting, but I wasn't sure I quite understood it. For instance, it's in Chrome. Does it require Chrome?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There are many questions, so it's not available yet. It's going to come out in the developer preview.  Okay, that's good. So it's just going to show up in the new tab in Chrome, I think, by default. I think that's what they're saying.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So if I'm running Safari or Firefox, do I go to a site that's chrome.google.com slash web apps and then buy stuff there? I don't understand.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, most likely, yeah, you'd hit a URL. I wasn't clear on this. They didn't get into real deep detail about how this is going to work.  But my understanding was that you, you know, you'd have to sign in to. So you open Chrome or you go to this page and it has featured apps with reviews and ratings and with the ability with prices.  Some could have prices. Yes, I say showed plants versus zombies, which is not a free program. It's in Flash. Right. It's in Flash.  So it's basically like buying a mobile app or buying a game. So I assume that you would purchase license or rights to use it through Google checkout.  And I assume that you'd probably have to be signed in to your Google account in order to say, hey, I have access to this app or not.  But I actually haven't had a chance to watch the demo. If you go, if you web store, I said it wrong.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, the chrome.google.com blog slash web store says that because web apps listed in the Chrome Web Store are regular web apps built in standard web tools that can be used by anyone using a quote modern browser that supports these technologies.  HTML5 or.  The advantage of installing an app from a Chrome Web Store when you install quotes around that a web application in the store can be a shortcut is added for quickly accessing the app.  Install web apps can also request advanced HTML5 permissions. So I'm guessing what you're doing is you're buying access to the app the way you buy access to I don't know the Wall Street Journal.  Right. But in Chrome, you get a shortcut to it and it's always there.  And then I guess with HTML5, I've got to believe that you go back to the gears view that there's offline use of an app you bought.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Well, you know, Chrome has this concept of native code where you can write code that actually interacts with your desktop with with libraries on your desktop.  And probably Kevin knows more about this. But you can you can actually build you can build extensions that sort of bridge that gap between your desktop and the browser.  So I'm thinking that maybe those apps will be Chrome only and maybe those apps, you know, things like image editors and maybe really rich games.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What might be might be Chrome only. But is this really though all about Chrome OS?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, remember about the architecture of that where you have a browser based functionality and application world and Google is just jumpstarting it.  So I can get rid of my Adobe Photoshop and I can use the photo application that was demonstrated today and I can pay for it.  And Google's enabling that. So it gets more web development, which gets us away from Apple and Microsoft world.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No. Yeah. And I mean, it's just a way to find kind of a curated or ranked or like this one place to find good web apps.  And it's also a way also for developers to build web apps that generate revenue without relying solely on ads.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it's not but it's not a closed ecosystem as Apple's app stories. It's a wide it sounds like it's a wide open ecosystem. Right. Wide open.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And they're going to invite developers to do it and find out how to prepare. I guess wide open to the extent that it's still curated, as Gina said.  But they keep on saying that that it's a it's just regular web applications that are built for modern browsers. Period.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. And when I say curated, I think it's just rated by users. I think it's totally crowdsourced.  I don't think that there's going to be an editor at Google saying yes. I mean, I think that things are just going to get rated kind of dig style. Right. From what I understand.  They showed this an HTML5 version of TweetDeck, which is my favorite, my Twitter client of my desktop Twitter client. It looked beautiful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was very nicely done and drag and drop everything. Yeah. Yeah. So what are these advanced HTML5 permissions? What are those?  Does anybody know anything about those?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Sorry, where is it? Where's the quote?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It said this. This is in the FAQ. If you go to chrome.google.com slash web store.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm wondering if that has anything to do with native code extensions.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's right here. What is the advantage of installing an app from the Chrome Web Store?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So Blaine was talking about this. You know, my colleague Blaine Cook, one of the founders of Twitter, has been looking at building web applications.  And he's saying HTML5 apps don't quite do everything you want yet.  So you can get some permissions, but you're missing the ability to add a web protocol handler.  So you can't handle a special kind of URL like iTunes does, for example.  And it's very hard for you to access arbitrary websites from a locally installed app.  And because that's not well structured by the browsers have this same origin policy, which means that you can't call code.  Sandboxing.  You can't call code that isn't on the same site that you're running on.  The problem is when you've got a local application, that means that you can't call code anywhere on the web easily.  Because of the same origin policy.  And so you need a way of getting around that.  And the way around that is you proxy through a server somewhere, which is what we do now.  And that means you're building dependency on a particular server into your application, which Google is happy about because that's the way they build apps.  They're running the servers.  If you're trying to build a standalone app that could deal with a series of different sites, Blaine's example is he's built an e-book reader.  So he wants to be able to fetch an e-book from any site and display that.  Doing that on the client side app is actually quite difficult at the moment.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So it's end to end for the developer.  You can create it.  You can run it on Google Apps.  You can get it paid for through Google.  It becomes an app version of the web, kind of.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, but it can run offline.  I mean, you can build a serverless app.  It strikes me, I mean, I may be wrong, but it strikes me that this is really all about making Chrome OS be a full fledged OS.  If you can't install apps in Chrome OS easily, then you got nothing.  Yeah.  But there's still sandbox in the sense that do apps have access to the file system?  I think some.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Again, it's still slightly messy.  Resolving this stuff is under debate at the moment of what they should have and what they shouldn't have.  Because you're trading functionality for security at that point.  Kind of, but it's more that we have a security model that was built for one environment,  and we're trying to apply it in another environment and work out what makes sense there.  The other part of this is we're talking about Google App stores.  They've got four of these already, or three or four of these already.  If you think about iGoogle...  That's a widget store, I guess.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a widget store.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  You can add things to the list.  You can search and put stuff in.  There's no payment involved.  But it has a huge install base of people doing that.  They have the Android App Store, which I'm hoping they're going to make better tomorrow.  On the Android, it works very nicely.  But there's these weird things that if I search it on the web, I want to install on the Android,  the way I'm supposed to do that is by taking a photograph of a thing with my Android  and then pressing a button there rather than just saying,  okay, yeah, I'll log in here, put it in the queue to download on my Android.  So there's some weirdness about that.  And you can't easily link into the App Store.  Vic in the keynote said, we've got a great app for the schedule at Google I.O.  Go to the App Store and search for Google Conference to find it.  It's like, yeah.  That's a marker that you've got something slightly broken there.  And then the other one that they released a few months ago,  which is the apps for Google Apps for your domain store.  What's that called?  I can't remember the name of it.  You know what I mean, Gina?  The Apps Marketplace.  Apps Marketplace.  That's it.  So that one is similar to this, except that you're installing apps into your Google Apps infrastructure.  That can be paid for.  And the system then can install an app for the whole company with that.  So it's clear that they've been thinking about this and building different versions over time.  And that's a Google way.  They have four ways of doing the same thing by different teams.  So it's interesting to see which of those facets this one will pick up.  And the challenge is getting people to pay for web apps.  Dario Bessangio described this as, this is the iGoogle Apps for rich people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Or at least people with disposable income.  It's $4.99.  It's not a whole lot of money.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is this new?  I just see a lot of chatter coming up about the Latitude API.  Was that announced?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We talked about that a little bit yesterday.  I mean last week.  That was last week.  That's the fact that Google has three million Latitude users.  I think they announced the API last week.  Okay, never mind.  Maybe I'm wrong.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  No, they announced them today.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay, so what are the APIs?  So Google has more location information about people than anybody, much more so than any of these.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  If you go to the Google Code blog, they have a list of a bunch of announcements.  And one of those is the Latitude one.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  GoogleCode.blogspot.com  GoogleMobile

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Man, fragmented much.  Hey, wait a minute.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They've also announced a Buzz API.  When did that happen?  Whoa.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the thing.  They're petering these things out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because I wanted to see some more Buzz stuff.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, that was the talks were going on.  Oh, there we go.  Yeah, there's a whole social track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Excellent.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  That's good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's have a look.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So now we're going to read this API in the middle of the show.  But with the new Google Latitude API build.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  We need to read a website to you now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Build Latitude and location into your app.  That's very interesting.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Right.  So the previous Latitude API was very naive.  It didn't actually have any auth in it.  So you had to say, I will publish my location to the whole web.  And then there was a way to do that.  It was very frustrating.  Yeah.  And so they've added one that actually has some auth in it now,  which could make it more useful.  Again, I'm not sure how many people are actually using Latitude.  I know I still use it now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Three million people use it because it happens kind of without your knowledge  and you forget that you turned it on.  Which has some issues right there.  Yeah.  I mean, I've got it.  It runs.  You know, for instance, if...

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah, I can see you on it, but I can't see anyone else on it.  Yeah, you're the only person I...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I can see.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, but you can easily accidentally turn it on or turn it on  and forget that you've turned it on, although they do, I guess, occasionally remind you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you go to redeye.firstround.com, Charlie O'Donnell,  who's a VC friend of mine, said that his view,  rather than having dozens of applications each ask for your location,  Google Latitude asks your permission and then puts it in the cloud.  And then anybody can access it.  Right.  Right?  So he said, imagine linking your ATM or credit card with Google Latitude.  You want to make a big withdrawal or charge something big.  Your bank can check with Google Latitude and say, are you in the same place as your card?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's not a great use case for me.  I agree with you.  You know, Fire Eagle was that.  And that was the whole point of Fire Eagle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Honestly, Yahoo's location thing, yeah.  Fire Eagle just left this week, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Tom has left, yes, but Fire Eagle carries on.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Did you see that a TechCrunch writer said he has proof that Google TV will make its debut tomorrow?  I saw that.  Because on the press site, someone had written,  insert TV press release here on sort of a rogue page.  That's what makes it so cuddly.  This is what I love about Google, right?  Didn't Read Write Web kind of track down a YouTube video that they had uploaded sort of early.  And they were like, oh my gosh, Google's going to make this announcement.  And Google was like, yep.  Whoops. We uploaded it a little early.  Apple loses phones and bars and it's a whole big thing.  But Google accidentally leaked some information.  And they're like, yep, you'll hear about that this week.  But that's, you know, that's the point.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Because if you're selling hardware and people stop buying the current one, you lose money.  That's true.  I could dribble it out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So this is interesting.  I don't know if this is new, but here's a site, Buzz Z, B-U-Z-Z-Z-Y dot com.  That's a Buzz search.  Which was something that was oddly enough missing from Buzz, even though Google's in the search business.  And a third party has implemented it.  I'm glad to see that in terms of popular searches, Robert Scoble and I are right there on the front page.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But you might want to find Scoble.  Would that be found by him?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Search for him.  But don't let him see you.  Don't let him see you coming.  So that's the API is, I think, enhanced, it looks like.  And there's they've got a number of new partners, including Boxxy and Plancast, Mebo, Seismic, TweetDeck.  Be very one of the things that's been lacking with Buzz is third party applications.  Be great if you could add.  Wouldn't you like that, Gina, if you could add Buzz to your TweetDeck?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Get it out of Gmail and I'm happier.  Yes.  The whole Gmail connection was just nonsensical, as it turns out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Looks like they have an OAuth setup for doing that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you're low weekly mirror looking at this, you're saying, oh, good.  Maybe I have some hope after Twitter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's somewhere else to be. Yeah.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Seismic and Ping FM are in the list of already built apps.  So, yeah, right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And a great opportunity for them.  So they've been obviously previewing this API to other people.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So the API is the open standard stuff that we've been talking about for a while.  Sure, activity streams.  Activity streams, Adam Pub, PubSub, HubBub, and OAuth.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But that stuff wasn't yet implemented in the original Buzz API?  No, it wasn't.  Just hinted at?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  It was hinted at. It was implied that there were some little bits of it, but there wasn't really API endpoints.  So now they've got proper read write support.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's really great.  Good. Maybe Buzz will rise up from second class citizen.  Although I just.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  But also, I mean, the other thing is, for me, the stronger thing is this same part of coming up with standards that lots of people can implement.  The point of the activity streams work that a bunch of us have been involved with is to try and say, OK, there's a whole bunch of stuff that's really similar here.  Why don't we agree on the names for it so that we can move it between science more easily?  So Buzz doing that should hopefully wake people up to this.  At the moment, Microsoft already ships some great support for it.  Facebook is doing activity stream support.  MySpace is doing activity stream support.  But for Google to say, yes, this is how you do it with Buzz, that may wake people up to and actually get them to say, OK, that's big enough that we'll spend some time on it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There was some other Google news this week.  Google bought global IP solutions for a VoIP codec.  You're in the VoIP business, Kevin.  I'm going to have to go to you again for our codec explanation.  What do they gain with global IP solutions?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  The exact details of it, but broadly, they've got existing technology for doing audio-video codecs.  So there are basically different domains for video.  I sort of divide it into three.  There's I'm playing back pre-recorded video.  So that's the domain that VPA and H264, all of those ones, are in.  Their primary thing is I'm encoding this file once and then distributing the file.  Lots of people watch the file.  So that's YouTube, that's DVDs, Netflix, those kinds of applications.  The second case is the kind of thing we're doing now for the people watching where we're all, or the I.O. stream this morning, where there's something like 15 seconds buffering.  So it doesn't matter to some extent how long it takes to encode.  You can add some delay there, a small amount of delay.  And then the third case is when you're actually having a two-way conversation like we're having over Skype or like when you're having a cell phone conversation.  And there, the amount of time it takes to encode and transmit becomes very significant because if that gets above about half a second, it makes the conversation really hard.  Right, right.  So the difference between the VPA guys is they were in the first domain and the codecs and the VoIP stuff is in the third domain.  Latency is the key.  So it's sort of a latency focus, yeah.  And there's different...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Gips does a good job of this?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  But yeah, there's something that lots of people have been using for a while.  So it's a sensible buy for them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yahoo, AOL, WebEx, Lotus, Conferencing all use it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm going to save one other Google I.O. announcement so that Gina can do it in her tip.  Just want you to know I didn't forget you, Gina.  Was there other Google I.O. stuff that...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I want to say that I'm delighted that Sports Illustrated, which had this video up for ages about, oh, the wonders in the tablet, what we can do on the tablet, and God bless them.  I've always said they can do the same thing on the web.  And indeed, they demonstrated that HTML5 will do all the wonders of tablet stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they seemed equally as excited as Rupert Murdoch is and everybody else about the iPad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's great just watching these old content guys.  And he made a few sports jokes that the Googlers just went, baseball, Shaq?  I don't know.  I've never...  You could have heard a pin drop in that room.  And the poor guy, because I could tell that he thought, he expected these were big applause lines and...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And nothing.  Yeah, I felt bad for him.  He's so pure-talk.  In fact, it went over my head that I had missed the sports joke.  So I didn't know what was going on, but I was like, why is he so kind of stuttery?  And he seems kind of awkward.  Like, he got a little more awkward.  I think he realized that he was not among sports fans.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's a real man in a room filled with...  With the...  Basty face geeks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Basty face geeks.  Yeah.  I mean, I'll go to baseball games.  The sun is there.  That fiery ball in the sky.  I hate it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Terry's reputation has always been that, as a friend of mine said a long time ago, that he hunts for his lunch.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He hunts for lunch.  Wow.  He's a real sportsman.  Apparently, Google is going to do a Volt application for OnStar.  I can't figure out if it's an Android...  Because there is an iPhone Volt application for the Chevy Volt, because I played with it.  That you could turn on your car from your iPhone.  I presume the Android will get that.  But I'm wondering if Android will actually be in the car.  It sounds like they're going to...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It syncs up so that you can tell your car before you get to where you're going.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it sounds like there's some competition for Microsoft's auto stuff, the Ford sync stuff.  Well, this makes sense.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  It was inevitable.  I had a rental car that had a GPS in it the other week, and it was like, this is really annoying.  The graphics are like 10 years old.  And I've got to try and turn this little knob thing and use it.  I end up picking up the droid and just sticking it on top of the screen in the car and using this instead.  Because actually, it does the nav thing much better.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I talked to somebody yesterday who still uses his iPhone.  He uses his Nexus One only as a GPS now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a good GPS.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  It is a very good GPS.  Well, except that, yeah, it's a very good GPS if you talk to it.  If you actually have to try and type something into it, you better park.  Yes.  Impossible.  The in-car ones have all this stuff that comes up and says, do not use this while moving and actually lock you out while you're moving.  Someone is going to kill themselves trying to change nav on an Nexus.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Everybody needs a navigator as well as a driver.  That's all I can say.  Somebody in the second seat.  I call shotgun and phone.  Yeah, shotgun and phone.  That's exactly right.  But I think that's interesting.  The Volt's going to be an interesting car.  It comes out this fall.  The electric car has a small gas engine to keep it charged.  I drove one at South by Southwest and they had an iPhone app that let you turn on the car from the house and all sorts of stuff.  I think there will be an Android app to do that, but it sounds like there will be Android in the OnStar, which is very intriguing.  A real opportunity for Google, since they can give away the operating system and some even pointed out that with the freemium model, they could pay people like Chevrolet to use it.  Pay General Motors to use it.  Yeah.  Kindle for Android is on the way.  Amazon has, yay, announced that not only will they make a Kindle app for Android, but you'll be able to buy from within the app.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Amazing.  Yay.  Crazy idea.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Speaking of Android apps, really important for me is the New York Times now has its Android app.  Oh, I have to download it right now.  No fanfare whatsoever.  It looks a little bit different, but that's really that and my phone number are the last two reasons I keep using the iPhone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I tell you, NPD's numbers that the Android handsets outsold the iPhone in the last quarter, hugely up worldwide even.  Android is really on a roll in terms of the handsets and partly it's because of so many good, it's not just one, it's not just the Nexus One or the Droid.  It's also the incredible and the Evo from Sprint's coming out June 4th now, and that also is an HTC handset based on Android.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, one of the Android developer sessions is how to develop for multiple versions across multiple handsets just like dealing with that presentation.  Well, you've got all these different screens.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, the Evo is a 4.3 inch screen, so it's a huge.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And you've got the Dell 5 inch now, I think announced for June.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. And I think it's just a matter of time before there's Android tablets. There's already some in the works.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, the German one is now for sale at the Amazon German.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They changed the name from the Wepad.  What's it called now? It's not the Wepad.  A MeTab.  MeTab, OK.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Wait for the Wepad to the MeTab, OK.  Yeah.  I guess the Wepad did sound sort of like I have a puppy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Did you hear Bill Maher's joke about the pad brand?  No, what did he say?  I want to get over saying this.  It was Bill Maher. He said that he was making fun of Obama for acting like he's just, I don't do technology stuff.  And then he said the boy McCain is that much more so.  And it's really that so.  And he thinks the Xbox is something you put on.  Sorry, the iPad is something you put on your Xbox.  Sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, dear.  Sorry, I had to think about that for a moment.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I brought that up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Apparently Google's going to just, we're just going to change the subject now.  Google is no longer going to sell the Nexus One online.  And I don't think anybody's going to sell it in the store.  So I think the Nexus One may be headed for the junkie.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was sad and went into denial immediately about that announcement because I really liked the Nexus One.  I didn't really know what that meant.  I mean, it sounded like they were saying the Web Store didn't really work out.  We got early adopters, but not really anyone else.  But does that mean that...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They said the phone worked, but the store didn't work.  People want to touch it.  But here's the problem.  The T-Mobile is going to have it in the store.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's only T-Mobile because Sprint says we're not going to do it.  Verizon says we're not going to do it.  So it's only going to be T-Mobile.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  AT&T only does it for retail.  No subsidy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that this phone is sad to say, but it's going to be eclipsed by the Incredible, which is this phone better, and the Evo, and maybe the Motorola Droid, which everybody now who went to Google I.O. has one of.  You were saying, Gina, that there are a lot of in the audience you could hear, drawing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  People are booting them up.  We'll boot it up.  Drawing.  Like all around you.  Drawing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I still do not understand what Motorola was doing.  Aliens in Toy Story.  Drawing.  Why did they make it so scary?  The ads are still scary.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  My friend was telling me that and his three-year-old daughter is like, Daddy, why is the scary robot punching the screen again?  Like when the commercial comes on.  Horrible.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's the red eye of Sora and I don't understand it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, the red eye when you boot it up.  And the iPhone commercials are like, happy humans in shiny, sunlit places, like having great lives.  And the Droid commercial is like this dark, rainy, stormy robot.  And it's for the gadget guys.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  It is.  It's true.  That's dumb because you know what?  I'm not saying it isn't dumb, but it's not as dumb as those pre-ads with the scary, not quite human woman.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it's right there, though.  And you saw what it did to the pre.  I just want to say.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They have lots of extra ones because they give them away pretty.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  The drop of a hat.  A few extra pre's lying around.  One last story, then we'll get to our tip tool and number of the week.  Google had to admit right when Facebook was getting all this privacy issue and, you know, we talked a lot about.  We talked almost exclusively about Facebook last week.  Notice not one mention this week.  Google admits that the roving vans it was using to collect Street View information and Wi-Fi data, all of which, you know, like Skyhook, all of which was kind of kosher.  It had some old code in there, which was also saving data.  It's a pretty serious issue.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I got some email from listeners who were like, well, do you trust them now?  And which I thought was a reasonable thing to ask because we've been talking about trust and Facebook.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know.  Maybe I'm just a total unapologetic fan girl, but it's like that blog post was like we made a mistake.  Here's how it happened.  We failed badly.  We're really sorry.  We're separating the data.  We're deleting the data.  We're figuring out the best ways to do that and had us not do this again.  I mean, they posted it.  It was like late on us Friday night, right?  Or Friday afternoon.  So it was Friday night, Eastern time.  I mean, it was a big mistake, but I felt like they treated it with the right kind of tone and.  I think that they were pretty transparent about it.  So it was a PR disaster in that sense.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But in terms of reality, the thing is, all the conspiracy theorists, especially in Germany, come out like crazy now.  And I say, try to tell me what the business benefit is of a random, occasional bit of data from browsing on one moment in time on one street in Hamburg.  Yeah, it's true.  What can you possibly do with that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I know people kept their headlines like mistakenly, you know, with quotes around it is like, what would they have done with that?  What what good would that data have been to them?  I mean, you know, these cars were driving down the street.  They were maybe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They were not only driving, but they were changing channels.  Boom, boom, boom.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, changing channels several times per second or per minute.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I just saw some some coverage at Spiegel in German.  I'll spare you the link.  But along with any future jokes.  And thank you.  They finally got some sanity about it.  They finally said, listen, there have been early reports that Google is lasering buildings to get the dimensions of early reports that Google was was doing what Skyhook was doing.  What can they really do with this was the first saying coverage I've seen in in a long time about Google in Germany.  But with this, now there's a criminal investigation going on about this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was going to say I thought Google over apologized, but you can't over apologize in a climate in which now you're getting investigated criminally.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, here's the irony to me is that is that you fear government getting data and now government is going to Google saying give us the data.  Well, let's give it to everybody.  Yeah.  Right.  Back from Ottawa, one of the things that shocked me there that I learned there is that the Canadians, I'm told I asked people about this and said, oh, yeah, that's the way it is.  Their major fear about piracy about privacy rather right now is the Patriot Act.  And they don't trust the cloud in Canada because of what can be done, what Americans can do worse to Canadian data on Canadian soil, even in American soil.  And so there's this paranoia about privacy and the cloud going on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's a state fear.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the sort of weird thing about the EU because the EU has data retention laws that says ISPs have to keep information for six months that identifies your internet traffic so the government can can snoop through it later.  And then and then Google putting the odd packet here and there.  So I'm hoping the Germans will be consistent about this and help vote down the data retention laws that August campaign against in the UK.  The other bit, I think 2005, in 2005, I think it was a research on my next book.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The government was going to demand that Google hold on to all Gmail data and Google threatened to pull Gmail out of Germany and not do it there.  And you think that the German government would understand that this is not the best thing for the government there to be doing.  And they were deaf to the irony of it.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, this is this is the same thing as like the the UK where they have, you know, video cameras on every street corner that is being recorded and you've no idea where it's going.  But they all got upset about Google Street View driving around and publishing on the web because they could see the results.  And it's it there's there's some there's some very odd stuff there.  The thing that I didn't like about the Google's announcement on that was Alan Eustace basically saying, oh, you should secure your Wi Fi networks anyway, which is like, no, that isn't the right answer.  Because the Internet in general, anyone who's who's transferring packets and that can be anyone because the way routing works gets to see the contents of them.  So Wi Fi is not is not some sort of magic edge case here.  Actually, the whole Internet is like that.  And if you really care about security, you want to encrypt the channel that you're sending it over, you want to use HTTPS or you want to use PGP or something like that.  You don't want to say, oh, I'm going to do some boundary security and then just root this over the Internet anyway.  And guess what?  AT&T is sniffing every packet that passes through.  So there is this issue of understanding where the actual security problems in this stuff lie.  But it all ends up being very obfuscated.  And I'm worried that there is there seems to be this campaign that says having an open Wi Fi network is a terrible sin against society now, as opposed to providing a public benefit, which seems very odd to me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Let's hear from phone.  Leo, explain to me what's because you said before in the show, but it just give me ammunition when this discussion comes up.  So for my future reference, what does Skyhook do with that data?  Why is it beneficial to gather that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, it's really useful.  A lot of companies, I think I don't know if Apple uses the Skyhook data, but a lot of companies use the data so that when you're on Wi Fi, but you don't have a GPS, as in the first generation iPad, it can identify where you are.  What Skyhook does, what Google was doing is as they go through mapping GPS coordinates, they also map SS IDs and MAC addresses of access points.  And this stuff is being broadcasted the air anyway.  It does it for both encrypted and unencrypted access points because it's going through the air anyway.  And by collecting that information, they can then say when they when you see an access point on a Wi Fi enabled device.  Oh, you're you're 100 meters from this and you're 20 meters from this, you must be here and they could do a pretty good job.  So that's why if you had an early iPad, you could actually use Google Maps because of Skyhook.  And it made sense for Google to collect that information.  I hope they don't stop collecting that information.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They did in Germany.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah, they said they could stop in future.  Yeah, in Germany.  But they've they've got GOIP guessing anyway.  This just makes it more accurate.  I mean, Google has been guessing where you are based on your IP and getting it embarrassing you wrong sometimes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, because your IP address alone is pretty it's not very granular.  It's through your Internet service provider.  So if I use Comcast, it might get it within 100 miles.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah, it depends on you're proxying and weird things.  But but they had this thing where they the thing is they were using this weird way where they would then default you into a different Google front end,  which means that if you're American, you went to Paris, they decided you wanted to Google in French, which is like, that's right.  You're slightly missing the point here.  Geography is not destiny.  I'd like I'd like to find out.  I don't actually want you to give me the results in French.  That's a good point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, that happened to me in China all of a sudden.  And now in French, I could at least figure out how to get the English page in China.  I was lost.  I guess I won't be using Google today.  Anyway, any other.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was going to say, you know, when I realized they were doing that, like collecting SSIDs for location awareness for Wi Fi devices, it just seems like, I don't know,  the images, the Street View images by my home are so old.  I mean, don't SSIDs.  I mean, don't don't access points move so often and come up and go down.  It just it seemed like it's surprising that the results that they get are as good as they are because I imagine that that data changes so much, much more than if you have more than one, you're in pretty good shape.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you're right.  Occasionally, you'll be positioned out in the ocean or something.  But yeah, if you have a couple or more in any urban area, you're going to have many more.  Plus, you can see his you can triangulate.  Exactly. You can do a very good job.  If you ever use a Wi Fi only device and it knows where you are, it's kind of spooky, to be honest with you.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, if I popped up on my MacBook and just started, I mean, Firefox and Chrome, they all have location.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. And they know where you are. And that's why that's how they do it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think probably the feed API, which I kind of mentioned quickly earlier, is probably worth mentioning because it's based on Pub Sub Hub Hub, which we talked about like several episodes ago, a long time ago.  This is this is the video that read right web had seen before it got announced.  But there's this new feed API or the speed API upgrade that lets they announced today that lets developers embed feeds on their websites and they get pushed.  They get updated automatically.  And so new new feed items show up without refreshing the page.  That's very cool. I really like that. Yeah. Yeah.  Really sweet. So you get a little little taste of real time very easily.  And it's literally just like whatever five, six lines of JavaScript.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We just move closer and closer to this notion that everything's real time, that the idea of a static web page is just meaningless, that everything is updating all the time.  And I think that I think that's great. That's how I how I like to consume content.  The future of news, folks. Sure. Sure.  The future of communication. Everything's a ticker.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's what Marissa Meyer has been saying. I got crap in the chat room for saying it too often for a while, but it's the hyper personal news stream. Right.  It's all your stuff. Where is that API, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's on the Google the Ajax APIs blog.  Of course. Google Ajax search API dot blogs about dot com.  I love it. I love it.  I had no idea Google had so many blogs.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Google code as well. So if you go to Google code dot blogs dot com, the buzz stuff is linked from there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's it. That's it. It's a buzz the same as the API.  I mean, the API is that the same API?  No, the feed is different. Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Google dot com slash API's slash Ajax feeds.  Yeah, you're not going to type that in right now. That's OK.  Just Google feed API and you'll get the idea.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So this could feed. This enables me to put any content to feed it out to sites all around. Right.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  It's the same as RSS or Adam feeds you've already got, except that this means that when they change, your site can change rapidly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Will it work with any Adam or RSS feed? I mean, do I have to have a special kind of feed?  Any feed. Any feed. Yep. Any feed.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Here's what I've always wanted. Not always. Last few years I wanted.  Is that when I post a blog post, I want people who link to it to be able to basically subscribe to any corrections that I make.  Is this getting there? No. Ah, OK.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You could have a corrections feed and then they'd have to at their end, they'd have to subscribe to it using the API.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  That's tricky because that's a merge case. So the problem, you know, we had you have, you know, I had this with Tegnerati where people would complain they were seeing the same post twice.  And that's because someone had corrected a typo in it. So there's there's there's upsides and downsides to that.  What happens? Create a corrections feed. Yeah.  But there's there's like a small thing where I'm correcting a transposed letter and then there's an update that's got, you know, oh, damn, I actually got something badly wrong here.  Here's my correction. Here's my retraction. So, you know, there's there's there's nuances to how you do that.  Now, if it's actually just modifying the thing that next time you view it, that's OK.  But, you know, the bars had this problem where everything would then propagate back to the top again and then it then it gets annoying.  And when Wave has a bit of that, too, doesn't it, Gina, where every tiny edit pulls it back up to the top and suddenly it's like, I've read this thing three times.  Where are you? What are you on about? And you have at least hit the space key to sort of go through and see where the change was.  But if there's lots of them, it's not that helpful. Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I want to what are you on about button instead of Mark.  What are you on about? I always thought every web page would have a huh button.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You click that and explains what the hell's going on.  We actually implement that at Twitter TV, but it did not become a standard.  No, actually, we are new. We're doing a redesign.  And one of the things that we're doing in the redesign is making everything real time.  So they'll be streaming text.  And this is this actually makes it very much easier for us to create widgets that will update in real time on the Web page.  So it's good. They also announced a font API. This is kind of interesting.  There's there already is in a CSS tag that allows you to use real fonts.  I'm not sure if this is the CSS three font face standard or if this is something different, but they're going to support this is based on that.  Good, because I don't think we need another one.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So the point of this is there is that but it's very hard to actually get hold of fonts because embedding fonts on the Web is difficult.  And there's Jeff Bean startup that's been doing this for a while.  I can't find any ways to license this. Right.  And what this is is is a bunch of fonts that are in the public domain that you can cross the web and you can count on Google servers being there.  Google will also keep them up. And I assume they're going to let other PD fonts be submitted to this and host them as well.  This is great. So these are all free of getting into them that way.  But they've got the they've got the droid fonts and they've got a got a few some reasonably nice looking and seraphic ones there.  Yeah. And obviously it's not as rich as what's the name of Typekit? Typekit?  Something like that. Yeah. Typekit. Typekit is a much more ambitious effort for this that's designed to work with the founders and that you that you license them.  And I know that they work together to get this working. So that's good. It means that we should.  I'm glad it's support. It's a standard. That's great.  It's like did you see this the Scribd stuff?  No, what did Scribd do?  So Scribd's Scribd's announcement was that they will they will convert your documents into HTML5 now and they will embed them with the real font.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whoa. Lovely.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  If you've seen seen that. So basically they've gone from being an embedded weird thing to you upload a document and they munch it and give you an HTML5 document.  They link to the real fonts and make those work as well. So it suddenly becomes this all the type is selectable in this in this in these complicated documents.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So even the. Let me guess this. This is the beginning of a new open word processing standard.  Which would HTML5. Yeah. Yeah. Right. This this this then carries that on.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I hope. Yeah. I mean I hope that Google Docs will stick with that because Google Docs started out being our format as HTML and it got twisted a little bit since then.  I hope they're going to sort of realize that this is this is the right answer. I think they're smart enough to do that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So this is neat. I'm very excited about this.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So we're starting to see that this stuff the sports illustrated thing that the guy showed, although like slightly cheesy, was basically saying we can do this rich complicated beautiful stuff in HTML5.  Now we're not having to render it in weird ways.  And the you know the Kevin Lynn showing off Dreamweaver and saying we're publishing HTML5 properly now and give you edit tools to edit that.  But this is all encouraging because we're seeing the tools catch up to the technology, which is nice.  But the script the script stuff is really nice because they've done a really nice job of you upload your document and they work out the complicated the complicated weirdness of turning it into a nice web page.  Wow, that's really neat. Yeah, very useful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What an interesting way to publish now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Does this maybe kill the PDF someday? Oh, God, that'd be wonderful.  Wonderful.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Don't be really good haters today.  We want to put you out of business Adobe.  PDF is a is a print oriented format really it's it's it's a fidelity or mid oriented format, but it's it's post script which means it's like this thing tell digital editors that right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's all they do. Yeah.  Yeah.  It's an eagle format. I don't think that the Cape I think there are more capabilities in in right now in PDF but maybe not in the long run with if HTML5 really develops along the lines it's going to you'd have animation you'd have video you'd have, and especially if there's tools to do the automatic

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  conversion like script that's the thing that's that's that's script is has done.  Yeah, they've sat down, reimagine their product and said okay we're going to place the big bet on HTML5 as a document format. Brilliant.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm really impressed with that. Very exciting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Script is always cool but if I publish my newspaper using the API font fonts.  I could present things I could I could produce and present things on the web and in paper kind of same time right. Yes. Yes.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  And then the other thing is that, you know, the fallback was means if you look at it on a degrades grace. Yeah, it degrades gracefully and gives you a textual view. So if you look at it on, you know, a pre smartphone browser, you will see something there because the HTML still makes sense they just won't read the new fonts.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm working with a guy named John Payton a journal register company, which is an oft bankrupted newspaper company that he's making go digital first print last. And we sat talking about he had he has inherited this technology there we took over CEO that I haven't heard this phrase this in years he said well they still had VDT's.  Remember that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, video display terminals.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly. I hadn't heard that in years.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is why I went to the doctor. That's every newsroom had a VDT. Right. Yeah. So if it was modern.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What he had to spend on this and I said, you know, I think you can produce an entire newspaper using free tools and by God, good for him.  And he used nothing but free tools up to the point of the press. And and and he showed me last week the piece of paper he had in his hand that came off the press was produced by nothing but free tools.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Very cool. Very nice. Good for script because they really, unfortunately they were turning into a platform for piracy.  And there was real and there were real issues about all of the trademark material that was on script. This is a really good direction for them to go I think this is fantastic. And then the non trivial thing to do as well.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah, no, and it's putting down the market for Microsoft docs.com and Google Docs. Okay, you know, this can be done. Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it would be a simple thing to publish. It should be a simple thing to publish to HTML5.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yes, they suddenly they generate an HTML5 version.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what office should do. Office should publish HTML5. I wonder.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So let's do the countdown clock. How long before Google buys script?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, all right. Hey, this has really been fun. Let's get our tool tip and number of the week and we can go home.  But I think I can say safely now that I'm going to have to be back here at 830 tomorrow morning because it seems like they saved the best for tomorrow.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Looks that way. 830 man.  You'll be at the cottage, Leo. I'll be here. I'll be at the cottage. You can come up if you want.  But I think you're going to be going to the conference. I'll be trying to stay awake in front of a decaf coffee.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You did it. Gina and Adam Pash and Kevin and I were in a live wave during the I.O. and that was fun.  Yeah, we should do that again tomorrow. Let's do it tomorrow again. What do you say?  Yeah. And this time I'll have an icon because Dan on the wave team sent me a note saying, you know, you.  But in the old days, it took the icon from your profile, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, at some point it did. And then that and then that's changed. Wave has changed a lot. They changed my wave.  They keep changing that way. They're moving target to write a book about. That's for sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, good for you. I figured it out and I have added a an image. Thank you. Oh, excellent. Yeah.  So, Gina, let's start with your tips and since it's I think wave appropriate. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So my tip is really simple today. Wave opened up to everyone. So no one you don't need an invite.  Just great. You don't have to request an invite. You have to ask friends. You don't have to post on Twitter.  Who has invites? You don't have to wait some indefinite amount of time.  If you have a Google account, a vanilla Google account, you can sign you can sign right in and have wave.  And if you do that, your wave address will be your username at Google wave dot com.  It's mapped to your Gmail address. If you are a Google apps user and you have Google apps for your domain like I do,  you can enable the wave on your domain and have your your name at your domain dot com will be your wave address,  which is also really exciting because the wave the wave team found that, you know, wave really got used with groups of people who had kind of,  you know, groups of people try to get things done right. Not public chats or or journalists or, you know, mostly that was that was the best use case.  There was there was a bunch of other cool wave announcements for developers. They created a data API which will make it really easy to use.  And it's really easy for people to make wave clients. So I'm sure we're going to we're going to see an Android app, possibly an iPhone app,  other good wave clients that work other than the website. And you can build robots and host them on your own web server.  Now you have to do it on App Engine. They open source the rich text editor, which is really good.  So those are all really developer announcements. My tip is just to enable wave on your Google Apps account or just sign in if you didn't never got an invite.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wave dot Google dot com. Is that all you have to do? Yeah, that's all you got to do.  And I am impressed with a number of new robots or widgets that they've added to wave, which will I think make it a much more useful tool.  I think that's the kind of thing that they needed to do to really. Yeah, there's a lot of really good ones. You can export waves to Google Docs.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You can you know, you got that there's like this brainstorming back of napkin sketching wave. There's video conferencing, you know, the Ribbit the Ribbit gadget is awesome.  So so yeah, and they have the extensions. They have featured extensions in the sidebar now so you can explore those.  So a lot has changed in wave in the past few months. So if you haven't logged in since since you know a few months ago when when people were talking about a lot more, you know, log back in and check it out.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And how much do you have to update the book to you? The book's change log is getting lengthy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Let's say that, but I'm handling it like a software product. I have a change log page on the website. I tried to future proof the text and you know, pointed to the change log.  So so yeah, there's been quite a bit of editing and rewriting going on on the wiki and the book.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And now I've been full because I've been saving my invitations and I guess I didn't need to.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's good though. It'll be someday. It'll be like in the in the Google Museum. You can see the screenshot of way back when I had 14 invitations.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I hope that's not your number, Jeff Jarvis. What is your what is your number of my number is 117 percent.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That was Vic's slide today at the keynote that TechCrunch highlighted.  That's in Forrest who says between 2004 and 2009 web usage increased 117 percent. No surprise there.  The interesting thing is is that listening to the radio is down 18 percent reading newspapers is down 17 percent reading magazines is down 6 percent and watching TV is zero growth.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, zero is better than nothing. Zero is better than down. I'm surprised it's down. It's not zero. I thought more people were watching more TV.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I thought so too. But according to Forrest, so so I mean no great surprise here, obviously.  You know, as my tweet on this was that like soldiers, the old ones don't die. They just fade away.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. The old media just fades away.  My toy of the week and it really is a toy is for Google reader users. It's called Play. It's kind of a new way to look at Google reader items.  And it's kind of thing you might want to have just running on a machine in the background. If you go to Google.com slash reader slash play, it essentially creates a slideshow of your with images of your Google reader items.  And so it's just a fun way to look at it. You can still star them and like them and share them as you go.  There's a few oddball controls over here on the side that you could take a look at and play with. Choose categories and so forth. It's kind of fun.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That is really fun. Is that really good ones? Yeah. This is based on my subscriptions.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it is. I'm not signed in right now, so it's just it's giving me kind of a best of thing.  Sign in will be your subscriptions. Yeah. So in fact, it might be fun to sign out just to see. Probably this is what's hot. What's hot on Google reader, which I read religiously because people are crazy.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I love this stuff. That's hot on Google. There's that recommendations tab. I think it's that one. Right. Okay. Because these are really good.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  These are just really good. Better than my feed. Who are these people? I want to follow them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, my stuff is just full with tech news. It's boring. Right. Exactly. That's it. That's a thing. There's too many goofy kitten pictures.  Yeah, I want more kitten pictures. So if you want kitten pictures, sign out of your Google reader account and go to google.com slash reader slash play.  Thank you for playing with us, Kevin Marks. Boy, I'm glad you were here to explain the codec situation and so forth.  Sorry if that was a bit long. No, no, no, no. Really, really, really valuable. And that's the, you know, that's the thing I really like to do on all of our shows is get the actual stuff.  Not the short, you know, popular version, but the actual stuff. And I think it's great to have you. Couldn't have a better person on to talk about that.  Kevin Marks is at Ribbit.com. And anything else you want to plug these days, Kevin?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  The point of Ribbit is its web APIs for doing telephony stuff. So if you're building a web app and think, oh, it'd be really nice to send an SMS, make a phone call, that's what Ribbit's for.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And there's a Ribbit robot in Google Wave. Yeah, it is. Do you call it a widget, a bot? What do you call it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There's gadgets and there's bots. It's a gadget. It's a gadget. So it's a gadget. Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Gina Trapani, it's been, again, another good person to have on a show like this. I can't think of a better person, a developer, but also an expert on Google Wave and on productivity.  She writes at SmarterWear.org. And I'm sure there'll be lots of posts there from Google I.O. Come up and visit us. You're in the neighborhood.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, I'm so close. So close, but so far. I've got to get to the cottage.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, thank you for being on the show. I know you want to get back to the conference, so we'll let you go.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So here's one more I just saw. Yes. This one launched a prediction API where you give it data and then it tells you what to think about it.  Oh, what the future will hold. Is it April 1st? No, this is real. I saw this.  It's machine learning. So you give it like, this text is in French, this text is in English, whatever. And then you say, here's some text. What is it?  French. That sounds like fun. And it's really interesting things to do with that with her projects.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I think in a way think tank might really benefit or something like this.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I definitely am going to check this out. I'm looking at it now. It looks really interesting.  This is why sentiment analysis. Yeah.  Is that interesting? Yeah.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Did you see the sarcasm analysis paper this week?  Because this is the problem with sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis cannot detect sarcasm. And somebody has written an academic paper of how can we find sarcasm?  And we look for sarcasm and marked it up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The problem with sarcasm is it's fundamentally a lie. And computers don't understand lying.  Right.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So they were looking for sarcasm. It's a really amusing thing.  That's fascinating. Yeah.  Indeed.  Or Twitter uses it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I'm trying to think of something sarcastic to say, but I can't.  So I will just say thank you for being here, Mr. Jeff Jarvis. Jeff is at BuzzMachine.com.  And we really always appreciate your comments too. We've got such a great panel for discussing this.  You know, Google is so widespread now, but the areas of expertise we got here really makes it fun. So thank you guys.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I, however, need a Kodak to be Kodak talk for me. I'm completely useless.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I hope we didn't put you in too much pain.  No, no, no. I just, I just, I had nothing to add.  Thank you all for being here. Thank you for joining us.  I guess we will go back live tomorrow morning, 8.30 Pacific, 11.30 Eastern Time, 15.30 UTC, for the second part of Google's I.O. announcements, in which we expect to hear more about Google TV, Android.  Anything else, Gina, you think we're going to get?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think it's going to be mostly Android.  Yeah. Look forward to that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So we'll, we'll go live at 8.30 AM with breaking news. And then of course, we're back to our regular schedule.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Team coverage, as they say on TV.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Team coverage. Well, I think, I think I'm going to be the team tomorrow.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'll be live waving. I'll be live waving.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'll watch your wave. That'll make it a team.  Thank you all for joining us. We do twig every Wednesday afternoon at 4 PM Eastern, 1 PM Pacific, 18, I'm sorry, 2100 UTC, no, 2000 UTC, at live.twit.tv.  So you can watch us do it live. But easiest thing probably do is download the podcast available.  Everywhere better podcasts are given away absolutely free.  We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
