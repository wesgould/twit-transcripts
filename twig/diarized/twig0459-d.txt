Welcome back. We missed you.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm happy to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But now that you're here, Jeff's gone. So you can't win.  You can't win. But the good news is we've replaced Jeff with somebody even more wonderful.  Joan Donovan is here. We always like to get Joan on.  She is a researcher at data and society dot net.  Her official area is media manipulation. Love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep. Hi Joan. Business is booming. Business is good. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every day. You actually have a good article that came out earlier this year.  I guess this is one of your reports on algorithmic accountability.  And it's funny because I've just this morning was thinking about the problem with the algorithm.  We were talking about how, gosh darn it, they ruined Instagram because it's no longer chronological.  It's algorithmic. And then I think it was Anthony Nielsen, one of our producers, who said,  well, the real problem is companies now optimize for engagement, optimize for time spent, not optimize for user happiness.  They're not trying to make users happy. They're just trying to optimize for time spent.  We were talking about how YouTube now, if you subscribe, the subscriptions are all broken.  You can't, you know, you go to your YouTube subscription, you don't get notifications.  Your subscriptions, part of them are in the subscription list. Some of them aren't.  Mostly it's recommendations. It's all algorithmic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think when we were writing that we were very concerned with more even proprietary algorithms.  So how do companies learn to sort something as simple as job applications?  One company we found had been optimizing for location.  And as a result, their hiring pool became extremely homogeneous because they were in a very white neighborhood.  And so they didn't realize that even by optimizing for something as simple as short commutes was going to have this like really broad effect on the kinds of people that then got selected out.  Right. So it's even...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cathy O'Neill has been talking a lot about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. Yeah. And she's someone that we look to quite a bit for advising on that report.  And as far as the Instagram thing, I really miss having a chronological feed because it's just, you know, you know where...  Well, I mean, I'm going to out myself as sort of someone who enjoys surveillance, right?  But you know where people are and you know what they're doing and you can say, oh, I wish I was doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Instagram is made for stalking. Of course it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I mean, but it's like I served someone's birthday party, you know, from three days later.  And I look like, you know, I wasn't paying any attention because I didn't see their post, you know, but it's just that it didn't optimize for that.  And as a result, I, you know, I look like someone who's really behind the times when I comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The first thing you talked about is much more important in the long run, how we're letting big data make a kind of unconsciously make decisions,  often with improper or incorrect or you've just not thought about algorithms.  And that's certainly bad. But it's related. It's the same.  It's a sort of a religious faith in the algorithm that is ill founded.  And I think AI shouldn't stand for artificial intelligence. It's just stand for algorithmic idiocy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've had this for. Oh, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead. I was going to say that was the great book out right now called Automating Inequality.  And yeah, so just to play on the AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's what Cathy O'Neill, the math babe, talks about in her book Weapons of Math Destruction, how big data increases inequality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead. We've been doing this for a while.  We just haven't been doing it quite at the scale and without as much and across as many products or things that people touch in their day to day lives.  We've been using data to cherry pick. We've been cherry picking data forever.  But when we hand it over to computers, there's so much better at it and they don't have the same social inputs or mores or goals or aspirations even that we have  that we don't think to program them with. So, of course, I mean, this is going to happen.  And I write about this a lot as it ties to business transformation and industrial Internet type things because companies really have to think about what they're optimizing for.  Because a lot of times if you optimize for revenue, you're going to either cut down on your workforce happiness, your product quality.  And those are things that actually matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually dumb. It seems like it's the smart thing to do. BI, business intelligence. It's a smart thing to do.  And Jeff Jarvis hates it when I use the term weaponized. But that's what we've done. We've weaponized it.  We've always had it. But now we've got so much computation and so much data that we can use it in a deadly way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, even in the advertising field, they talk about it as targets and waste. Right.  And that's just like weird ways to bucket people. But one of the things that we are you a target or are you waste or you waste?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wasted my ad spend on you, buddy boy. Exactly. Right. And, you know, conversion into action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But one of the things that we found really helpful in that, which is really just a very broad literature review that piece.  But we found those ProPublica studies of Facebook's advertising algorithm to be really, really helpful because one of the things that ProPublica was able to show is how you can't just you don't have to just target in.  You can also target out different groups. And there's certain housing laws, certain non-discrimination places that people were using advertising that it was really clear that they were using racially biased or age biased advertising targeting.  And so there's other ways of thinking about how the social media platforms do become weaponized in this sense.  And I think it's really important that we like, you know, treat them with the same expectations that we would someone placing an ad in a newspaper would at that, you know, with that level of discernment and discretion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You're talking about the ProPublica study where they complained about Facebook doing this.  Facebook said we're not going to do it anymore. Then ProPublica went back and they still were being able to buy ads on Facebook that targeted whites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And they had changed like categories from, you know, to I think they're now called multicultural affinity categories.  But if you actually look at your own, one thing that I always point out is I am categorized as African American according to race Facebook's racial programming.  And I think it has something to do with the kinds of friends that I have, the kinds of stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's your likes. Your likes give you away.  We saw that Cambridge Analytica was basing its work on a study that showed that they can determine your gender, your race, your sexual orientation from, you know, give me 52 likes and I could tell you you're black, except you're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm not. I'm, you know, I'm often a man. If it makes you feel better, Joan.  Well, it's probably, you know, the kind of stuff that you study, right?  Right.  Not a lot of women are in the business world in that capacity studying tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we should really, I mean, I really, I don't understand why companies don't, they think they're being smart. They're actually being dumb.  And I think they're, you know, they're optimizing.  They think they're optimizing for engagement or sales or revenue.  But when it has a consequence that in the long run doesn't improve any of that, they don't pay attention to it because they said, well, no, we have the algorithms. We have the computers.  I'm telling you, I'm calling it algorithmic idiocy. That's going to be the name of my book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Get on that, Leo.  Yeah, I know. Right. Now you've burned it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Too late. I gave it away.  Yeah, it's a movement now.  It's a hashtag, not a title. It is. It's a hashtag.  All right. We could start. We started off because I saw that and I thought that was a great thing that Joan before coming on said, well, I tried to go through all 294 of Mary Meeker's slides, but I'm afraid I just can't do it.  Every year Mary Meeker does her Internet Trends report.  She became quite famous for this, didn't she?  This is how she got her job at Kleiner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, not solely this. She became famous originally in, you were around then, Leo, come on, 2000, predicting the top companies that were going to come out of the dot com era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was an analyst at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, for Morgan Stanley?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Morgan Stanley, maybe. Yeah, that sounds about right. Yeah.  So now, of course, she now works for KP, but does the same slideshow, this time at the Code Conference, Internet Trends 2018.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's always been at the Code Conference.  Has it?  I mean, not always.  It would have been recode, but then before that, D, all things D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  2017 was the first year in which smartphone unit shipments did not grow at all.  Saturation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is what that is.  But never fear.  They're putting cellular subscriptions in your car, in your dog tracking collar, possibly some baby thing.  You know, we're going to be fine.  Or rather, the cellular carrier.  Same goes for Internet user growth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rose 7% in 2017.  It was 12% the year before.  That means it's slowing.  But half the world is now online.  That was the other interesting number.  49% of the world, of the world's population, is now able to get online.  I don't know what the standard for getting online is, but that was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It depends.  You know, the FCC for a long time had 512 kilobits per second.  That was up until like 2010.  That's broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the broadband.  Let's see what else.  There's so many stats here.  People are increasing the amount of time they spend online.  US adults spent 5.9 hours a day on digital media in 2017.  That's up from 5.6.  3.3 of the almost six hours, more than half, on mobile.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And was there these...  There was a lovely slide showing media consumption.  I think it was like number 11 or 15, very early on.  And that was eye-opening to me just because so much content is being watched on mobile  compared to TV and other things from even a few years ago.  Daily hours spent.  Slide 11.  Hey, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good get.  Good brains.  Daily hours spent with digital media per adult user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why are we spending so much on our phones?  Because it's there?  Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook.  Oh.  Right?  Those are the sticky ones.  I don't know.  I'm not on the...  I bet, but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can...  There is an option on your phone to look at how long you look at apps.  It's a built-in feature to...  Both iPhone and Android has it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it is telling because there is...  Yeah.  I mean, we're watching now movies online.  I know as a New York commuter, it's really easy to download something and listen to it  or watch it on the Metro rather than watch some of the other things that happen on the Metro.  I think you're unusual though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's...  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that a...  That's a very urban use case.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if that's...  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So...  I think it's...  If you're sitting there, I mean, I'm not proud of this, but sometimes I would just be so  lazy and maybe my Amazon integration with my television isn't working and I'll just be  laying on the couch and I'm like, oh, screw it.  I'll just watch it on my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I never, ever watch movies on phone, tablet or laptop, except if I'm not home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh.  Every now and then.  And my daughter actually...  Let me ask the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chat room, how many of you at home...  You don't, John.  You're watching your TV.  Carson says he'll watch on a tablet.  You have kids.  That might be why.  Not Chromecast, Prawn, because that means you're watching on the big screen.  I don't mean controlling it with your phone.  I mean, actually looking on your small screen on your mobile.  Ant Pruitt says he does it all the time.  So, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Ant just gave me the best information in the chat room explaining that apparently  today is National Donut Day.  Is that true?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Donuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Donuts.  If it was, I missed it.  No, it is not too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you in a different time zone, Joan?  It's not too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know.  I know.  Yeah, you're right.  And I do live...  You live in the city that never sleeps, Joan.  Oh, it's tomorrow.  And tomorrow.  We're all okay, you guys.  It's the week now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know how I find this stuff out?  Do you know about this site?  I should make this my tip of the week.  Forecast with a K.com.  This is a crowd-sourced event calendar that does all the days.  But it also does all the days.  All the days.  Like the National Spelling Bee final is today, or tomorrow rather.  Friday is National.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody from my daughter's school is going to be in it.  I'm very excited for them.  I get to root for a person.  I'm very excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Restigitation.  P-R-E-S.  They actually, they're really hard.  They give you really hard words that you don't...  Oh, and those kids, man.  Wow.  They're amazing.  They've memorized them.  So, not only is Friday National Donut Day, but Kanye's solo album comes out.  And Hurricane Season starts.  So, this is a great...  I love this because there's a lot of geek stuff on it, but it's crowd-sourced.  So, you know, like tomorrow, SpaceX launch.  It's also World No Tobacco Day.  James Bond novel comes out in the UK.  The new James Bond novel.  See stuff, Expedition 56 launches on June 6th.  I don't even know what that is.  Ocean's 8 premieres on June 8th.  World Ocean's Day.  So yeah, National Donut Day is Friday.  So plenty of time, Joan.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just keeps moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  We've decided to move it back for those of you who missed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I could celebrate it today, tomorrow, and on Friday, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get a donut free at Dunkin' Donuts, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have Dunkin' Donuts.  Plus, those are terrible donuts.  No.  Oh, yes.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't at me, people.  You just made an enemy out of the entire Northeast.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't get it myself.  I grew up in the Northeast.  I never had a Dunkin' Donut.  They finally put a Dunkin' Donut in Petaluma, and I had my first Dunkin' just a couple  of days ago.  Oh, my goodness.  And they aren't good.  They're not as good as Krispy Kreme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're not as good as Krispy Kreme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like if you ate them as a kid, though, it's a nostalgia thing.  The flavors never change.  They all have the same texture.  It's just like, but you remember them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, they're like those Italian cookies you get in the tin.  They all taste exactly the same, but they just have different shapes.  It's like that.  What is it?  The Stelladuro cookies?  They all taste exactly the same.  Oh, those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  They're just different.  And they have the sugar crust on the top.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sugar crust.  Yeah.  But you would go, the thing is you'd go with like your dad or something, you know, you  get a coffee, you know, or they give you a munchkin or something.  It's a memory.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  I wouldn't tell you, you know, IHOP is the best breakfast, but there is a kind of nostalgia  zone that you can hit, you know, when you're traveling.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, new smartphone shipments, it's actually worse than she said on this slide.  It looks like they've been tumbling for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you move into the enterprise, there's a couple noteworthy slides.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wi-Fi network, good Wi-Fi adoption is rising.  Look at that.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't believe that we had anywhere to go but up.  But hey, who's.  But slide 201.  Oh, wow.  So way in there, we're talking about enterprising IT projects, which will see the largest spend  increase in 2018.  And this is from last, the beginning of the first quarter of this year to the beginning  of the second quarter of this year.  Networking equipment, which I thought was really interesting.  More even than artificial intelligence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Algorithmic idiocy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what it was like.  I was like, oh.  So I'm assuming that is Wi-Fi.  Like, it doesn't really describe what kind of networking equipment.  Obviously, in the data center, you've got so much more network traffic that you've got  to manage both East-West.  So within the data center and across it.  So I wonder if that's happening or if that's like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and other like networks  for enterprise networks.  I'm not sure what that entails.  So I'm very curious about that slide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So you're converged infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is when you mush everything else.  Storage, networking and compute all into one kind of thing.  Cisco's had it.  It's kind of like the answer that a lot of corporate companies offer for cloud.  And by corporate, I mean like server vendors.  It's kind of the last vestige of their profit margins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's Moore's law at work.  $1,000 worth of computer equipment from the analytic.  It goes way back to the analytical engine in 1900.  But we should probably start looking around 1975, which is about the middle of the chart.  But it is not, it is interestingly not exponential as one would expect with Moore's law.  It's linear, but it's definitely a steep curve.  How many calculations per second for $1,000 worth of computer equipment.  And this is the other one, the storage price versus hard drive capacity.  Wow.  It's an even steeper downward curve.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My first computer had 256.  Yup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Megs.  Megs.  Not gigs, kids.  Not gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember buying, like, was it a Pentium had 400 megahertz of processing power?  Maybe?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I remember.  So the early Pentiums were 90 megahertz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  It was a slightly.  You had a fast one.  Yeah.  My dad and I built a computer and we built several computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you go to Dunkin' Donuts afterwards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We did not.  We went to Shipley's because we're in the South.  Oh, Shipley's.  But I've switched, I've since switched my donut loyalty to Krispy Kreme because they're  lighter and fluffier and Shipley's are a little heavy.  I will eat them though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're going to kill us.  That's worse than not liking Chipotle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's not Jeff here to arbitrate, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we need Jeff for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We would defend one of those to the death.  I know we would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's so many slides, Mary.  It's fun to look at, but it's kind of overwhelming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some other interesting slides I'll offer you a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've already extracted the information.  You're so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It talks about consumer data sharing.  So starting on 205, I was actually kind of surprised that almost 80% of us are willing  to share our personal data for benefits.  Doesn't surprise me, no.  Okay.  But then it talks, this I feel is Mary Meeker being a little bit in the Silicon Valley bubble,  but she makes it sound like we're actually taking a lot of action to protect our data.  I can see this kind of chart being used to self-regulate in a highly ineffective way.  But talking about making consumer privacy tools more accessible.  I don't agree with all of this really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She says 64% of the respondents, this is to a Deloitte and Touche survey, said they had  deleted or avoided certain apps to protect privacy.  I think they're just Deloitte now.  Oh, there's no Touche?  They got rid of the Touche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That went a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm really dating myself on that one.  You know, back when the Edison light bulb company was in charge, things were better.  28% of disabled cookies, as if that does anything at all.  27% didn't visit or close certain websites.  26%, this is a complete lie from the respondents.  26% say, oh yeah, I closely read privacy agreements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my God, no way.  I'm still reading my GDPR agreements and I'm tired.  Liar, liar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why you can't trust surveys for stuff like this.  You really can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, here, you want to survey?  This is going to get us off Meri Meeker for a minute, so I can bring us back though if we need to.  How many people, or you guys, did you reboot your router?  Yes.  I do it every day anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, there are those people.  So the FBI, we've been talking about this a lot.  VPN filter is a malware created by Fancy Bear.  You may remember them from the hack of the DNC some years ago.  They have infected, the FBI estimates, half a million consumer routers made by Linksys, Netgear, TP-Link, Microtik with this VPN filter.  And the FBI this week said everybody should reboot.  Because now they had a way, you couldn't reboot before because rebooting would just reload the malware.  But the FBI thinks that they stopped that because they shut down the photo bucket images that were one way the malware was reloading.  And they also shut down a website to knowall.com.  But Steve Gibson's looked a little deeper into the Cisco analysis of VPN filter.  He said even if you reboot your router, your router is still beaconing to the malware servers.  So this is the Talos, not Cisco, the Talos report.  So he says the geeks amongst us would do best to rewrite their firmware.  No, reset won't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dude, that is hardcore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A reset will not do it.  You have to. Well, it's not that hardcore because most routers, you know, you can download and update firmware.  If you don't update it, actually update it if you can.  But if you can't update it, just reinstall the existing firmware will overwrite the malware, the little stub of the malware that loaded in all the other stuff.  So even though the FBI's advice was probably appropriate given the audience, because it certainly took those routers off the botnet, but they are still beaconing.  And it's not clear that that means they've been that they're no longer at risk.  It might be that there's another method that Fancy Bear has figured out for getting the malware on the routers again.  So best thing to do would be to get a weight of all traces of VPN filter.  And to do that, you need to overwrite your firmware.  Can I ask you a super technical question? Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, OK. Go ahead, Stacey.  If you so I run I bridge my Eero routers in my cable to my cable modem.  So my router is the Eero. My modem, though, also could act as a router.  It just doesn't. So in my case, am I safe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, your modem. No, your cable modem has a router in it.  Right. So it doesn't. It's not the routing that's doing the bad stuff.  It's merely using that router as a computer. Got it.  That can be joined on the on the botnet.  So even if you've disabled the routing features of that router, it could still be misused with VPN filter.  So and if you're not even if you're not on the affected router list, you should everybody should probably just reboot.  It's harmless. It just takes you off the Internet for a minute or two as you read as you go back.  Harmless. Good Lord. Mostly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, most of us have our routers like shoved behind a cable box and underneath a kitchen table.  It's like, oh, that's a terrible place for your router.  It can't be right now. That's just it. This is a New York apartment.  It's very small. It is what it is.  It is what it is. And it works.  Yeah. If I can get the Wi-Fi throughout the apartment, that's what matters.  I was going to say when I lived in L.A., we would often I was working at the Institute for Society and Genetics and we had a few techie type people and we would come up with screenplays.  Best case like worst case dystopian scenarios about how we would.  This was when Malcolm Nance's book came out, The Plot to Hack America, and we would often talk about what we would do.  And I was like the router attack. The movie would be called Status Update Terror.  Take over all the routers.  And then on a single day, it would like update everybody's social media status with some kind of horrible thing like go outside.  You know, your job is canceled. I don't know.  But yeah, this was the germ of my idea, which was that the best like if you were really going to take over the router is the most poorly understood piece of technical infrastructure that is also in everybody's home and necessary.  And then when I moved to New York, I saw all of these Wi-Fi stations, these link systems.  And I just thought, oh, it's bound to happen, you know, because it's like the public infrastructure Wi-Fi just seems to be, you know, such such a easy space to think about.  Like if you were going to do something crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Stacy's basically become an expert on this as an IOT expert.  I mean, that's the router is one of many IOT devices.  Any device that's on the Internet is, you know, I don't consider the router an IOT device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.  This is why I get so upset with these.  For what you talk about, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But for the purposes of this discussion, any device in your house that's on the Internet is an IOT device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And routers are particularly problematic because they have access to all the bandwidth and usually have strong enough computers that they can actually do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. You're not going to put VPN filter on a Hue light bulb.  Hope not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they are powered.  They're powered and they have some firmware and they have some processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just depends what you need.  Most of the time, these botnets don't need a lot of processing power.  The speculation from Talos is that Fancy Bear was creating this massive botnet and 500,000 soldiers in your botnets.  A pretty damn big botnet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If there were light bulbs, though, they would do nothing because they'd be limited by Zigbee.  They would have no bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, did you see that there is a Z-Wave hack?  We will talk about that in a bit.  Steve says it's not as bad as it sounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not as bad as it sounds.  I'm going to echo Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But to echo the book you were talking about, Status Update Terror.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a screenplay.  We'll see if it ever gets made.  Netflix, call me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, if not Netflix, Funny or Die, it's going to be one of the two.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just even listening to you explain to people, oh, this is how you might update it, but the notion that you would actually have to get to the firmware and do something significant.  The router is such an important thing, but there's no helpline, really.  There's no...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is why I actually, Stacey, you said this and I give you credit because this is actually the right thing.  And this is why I lump routers in with IoT devices.  Do not buy any device in your house that goes on the Internet that is not being kept up to date by its manufacturer and does not have pushed firmware updates.  Because to your point, Joe, no one should have to go around and figure out if there's an update for your oven, doorbell, light bulbs, cameras or routers.  They should just be updated.  Unfortunately, there are not a lot of routers that do this.  All the mesh routers do, fortunately.  For now.  Well, right, because how long are they?  When does the life cycle end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that is a good question.  Although, I mean, I replace my routers probably every five years.  Oh, yeah, you should for sure.  Three, probably three, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they get burned out.  So the Talos says that what Fancy Bear was up to with this botnet was a Ukraine attack and probably to bring down the grid again.  The Russians brought down the Ukrainian grid for several hours last year.  And it's not that they don't particularly like the Ukrainians.  It's that they're a very good test bed for what they want to do to the West when the time comes.  So this is all cyber warfare.  I don't think they do like Ukraine.  Well, they don't like the Ukrainians either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was like, wait, I think they're actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're their favorite whipping boys.  Well, no, well, I don't...  That's a long tale for another day.  So this is cyber warfare.  And that's why the FBI, rightly, should be involved.  This is not a hack to get into your system so they can get your credit card numbers.  This is not a hack to take...  Some kid wants to take down a Twitch streamer.  This is cyber warfare.  This is aimed directly, ultimately, at the West and probably at the grid, although there are other things they could use it against as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You guys will probably know the answer to this.  Did we ever get to the bottom of why there was an internet blackout a few years ago?  I remember seeing that IoT was somehow involved.  Yes, that was the Mirai botnet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Same exact thing, except this time it was two kids from...  Where were they? Duke? Rutgers.  It wasn't Fancy Bear.  It was Fancy Pants.  But otherwise, exactly the same.  It was the Mirai infected routers.  Didn't they attack...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They attacked Netflix and...  No, they attacked...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  DYN was the one that...  DYN is who they...  That was a big DNS server for a lot of companies and it had the effect of taking a bunch of them down, including Netflix.  But the irony of that, and this is how this is quantifiably different, certainly qualitatively different, and actually, yes, quantifiably different,  is that that was two college kids who were trying to make a DDoS network for taking down, I think it was Twitch accounts,  that they could sell. You could take your favorite streamer offline.  But it got out of control. That's what that was.  This is a nation state harnessing a massive army in order to target another nation state.  This is serious stuff.  Minecraft servers, you're right, thank you.  The geek reminds me in the chat room.  It was Minecraft servers that these Rutgers kids were trying to bring down with Mirai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If it makes money, why not try?  I think the thing that scares me the most about hearing about botnets like this,  as well as the big talk last year about fake accounts online and impersonation and sock puppets,  and then the wars around automated amplification through bots,  is that we have to start to think about these as multi-frontal attacks.  The idea isn't that they're really focusing on one specific sector of the internet,  but they're thinking across the spectrum of platforms, software, hardware,  which is definitely something much harder to take control of,  but also could be much more effective in causing a really big blackout  or putting people up for putting State Department resources up for ransom.  I mean, so much of the internet has left us vulnerable to these open-ended attacks  that I think that you're right to say that this is different than people messing around,  but when I hear about it, I think about all of these other ways in which we are insecure  in our information ecosphere as well as insecure in our networks,  and I wonder how these things are eventually going to fit together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is right up your... I mean, this is what you do.  This is the stuff you research, but I've actually been wanting to ask you this  because what has become more and more clear, I think initially the simplistic interpretation of it was,  oh, the Russians did not want Hillary Clinton to win the election.  It wasn't so much they wanted Donald Trump, they just didn't want Hillary Clinton because they didn't like her,  and so they did some stuff, bought ads on Facebook and created fake accounts in order to swing the election.  That turns out to have been a very simplistic view of what was going on,  and it's, I think, very clear now. It's a highly coordinated attack.  It's an attempt to attack the West in not just fake news, but with routers and with everything else to disrupt the West.  It has nothing to do with disrupting the election. That was just part of an overall thing.  So it's not just the memes, it's not just Pepe the Frog, it's everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and we've been thinking about this in the office a lot because we're trying to understand the effect that this has had  large scale across multiple institutions, right?  We're looking at now reports of military-style attacks on information  in the sense that there are battles that never happened, shots that never took place that are getting reported.  We're seeing climate reports that were untrue, right?  But they're getting reported as real events or like fake storms or fake chemical spills.  And we're trying to understand what is a test and what is a scenario that they're trying to run,  and then how would they scale those scenarios?  And for me, I think when people start messing with democracy or the press, those are very open systems.  They're open social institutions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're very vulnerable as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're very vulnerable. But then we have to think about how might the techniques learn to their scale to law, economy?  And so we have to be really careful as we move forward with our policies about infrastructure  and how we're going to moderate the Internet because I've already hearing people talk about splinter nets  and people are thinking about maybe it's the right time for one Internet over here to lock up the Internet borders.  And part of me wonders what the damage we're going to do holistically to what makes the net great  by trying to lock down all of these different problems.  But I think the economy right now is very, very vulnerable to attack, especially because so much information  that flows through platforms is about when and what to purchase related to stock.  And there have been attempts to manipulate the information about stocks to get people to either buy or sell.  That's as old as the stock market itself.  But I'm wondering about how might that scale and how?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an interesting vector, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is, but it's a hard, it's a really hard system to crack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You attack the grid, you attack the economy, the markets.  I mean, and we attack the press.  So I guess really the question that really the larger question is, what does Putin want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, and I don't know if it's only him that is at the forefront of some of this, right?  There's just, there's so much of this that we study is just in the name of chaos itself.  And so there's a lot of fellow travelers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that certainly a lot of the players, especially the American players are in it for the lulls.  But the puppet master, there's a goal, I would think.  Putin wins maybe if there's chaos in the West, but I think that there's got to be a larger goal.  I mean, he does, clearly the West is a threat to him.  The European economic zone was a massive threat to Russia.  A strong US is, and its sanctions are a threat to Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, and oil and gas is still an important industry there.  And there was all that, all those problems with Tillerson, which was supposed to be, he's supposed to be a peacemaker.  And so I think that Putin maybe anticipated having stronger ties and better connections with the government that's in place.  But also, I mean, you can only set up and stage and strategize so much.  But usually it's hard to predict what people in power want when they're multi-billionaires as well, because they have everything that they could possibly want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You also don't want a destabilized West because that's your market.  I mean, that's one of the reasons I don't worry about China so much.  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I was just going to say Putin and there is a certain might makes right kind of category.  And the concept of a liberal democracy where you look out for people, I know we're not quite living it,  but the idea of looking out for people and not letting strongmen take over, that is very threatening to both his worldview, but also the way his country is currently run.  So it makes a lot of sense that getting us to a point of chaos where authoritarianism looks good.  I mean, that would be awesome.  It would be a win for his worldview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you Google what does Putin want, you'll find about 8,000 different points of view.  And I don't know.  It's certainly not our.  We're not experts in this.  That's not going to be scientific.  But what is interesting to us is I think it's become very clear now that a lot of that there's starting to take shape.  I mean, and I think this botnet, this VPN filter, is just the latest piece in the puzzle.  It's starting to take shape that there is a concerted effort in a lot of different spheres.  And a lot of the things that we are talking about all the time on this show, fake news, viruses, security, privacy, I hate to have a scapegoat, right?  I hate to say, oh, it's the Russkies.  We did that for a whole generation.  It's the Soviet Union.  Maybe it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think a lot of us are abdicating our responsibility to look out for each other and to take as much responsibility as we can for our situations and those of our neighbors and our friends and our citizens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yes, I agree 100 percent.  It's too easy to blame Putin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that he taps into a certain level of lousy chaos that he does exploit for gain in terms of like the kind of media that they run, the state-run media.  It's definitely preferable to have a narrative about America being in chaos and being able to show that and have that also reflected in the media in America that says we don't know how to fix our systems.  And as you start to look across all these important sectors of institutions, you start to see many, many more instances of polarization.  And so this demonstrates, I think, to someone who's a very authoritative ruler is that if you can keep a hold on your country's narrative, other countries look like the state is going to fail in a big way because they've chosen this economic route, these cultural values.  And so there's a little there's, you know, there's much to be won in terms of like creating a narrative of propaganda for your state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's fascinating.  Okay, like, I don't know if we want to keep talking about Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We went down. We went down a rabbit hole on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I will say California, their Senate just passed 23 to 12, a net neutrality bill.  I don't know if you guys care about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I live in California, so I do.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot of your people might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although California, by the nature of its the size of its economy, does definitely influence the nation as a whole, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. So now it will go to your state assembly and it will be voted on hopefully in early fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can a state restore net neutrality?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It can restore aspects of it in that state.  Using its economic plow.  Yeah, people who buy it.  Yeah.  So I don't know.  I'm glad that passed.  So it'll be interesting if it does pass, it'll be interesting to see.  Like if your state decides, I mean, are you really going to get AT&T to?  Yeah, I don't know.  We'll see what happens.  Here's the good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AT&T and Comcast and two major industry trade groups spent a million dollars lobbying Sacramento and it failed.  So there's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hold on, only a million dollars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, that seems so low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Guys, come on.  Let me see what Uber spent in Austin when they were trying to get us to not keep them out.  Oh, a lot more than a million dollars.  I think it was like 10 million spent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, but you're right.  It does have to, it's got to get through both houses.  It passed the Senate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it topped 10 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Comcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was just in the state.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Comcast, you're letting us down here.  So the Senate has passed it.  That's very good news.  I don't know what the prospects are in the assembly, but if you're in California, call your state assembly member and say, pass SB 822.  SB 822, that's good.  We like it.  We like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It won't be SB 822 when it gets to the assembly, right?  It'll be whatever it is, AB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Sorry.  They'll know.  If you say SB 822, they'll know which one you mean.  Shut up, Stacey.  Actually, you can probably say that net neutrality law.  You know, that thing.  There you go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to, actually, let's take a break because I think I need some coffee.  Do you need some coffee?  Stacey, do you drink coffee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not anymore.  I'm trying so hard.  It's so hard.  I would love to drink coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think that it might be related to the?  The migraines.  The migraines.  But medicine works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought caffeine is used.  The first thing coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's good.  I thought caffeine was sometimes used to treat migraines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is, but apparently, regular caffeine use for certain kinds of people with certain kinds  of migraines, it can be a trigger.  It also becomes less effective if you're automatically, if you're...  Oh, save it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Save it for when you need it.  Yes.  I need it every day.  Sometimes several times a day.  And fortunately, we have found the best coffee, our official coffee of Twitter, comes from  a single family farm in Brazil, Três Pontas.  Now I know in Portuguese it would be Três Pontas, but I'm saying Três Pontas because  I want you to be able to spell it because I want you to go to Três Pontas, T-R-E-S,  P-O-N-T-A-S dot com slash twig and get some of this amazing premium coffee, non-GMO.  It's a single family farm.  They've never sold in the U.S. before, but the race family thought, hey, you know, let's  try this.  So they arranged to have their coffee shipped, green beans shipped to the U.S., fresh roasted  in the U.S. for quick shipping to you.  These beans, we got five days after they were roasted.  They were roasted on May 21st.  So they're still very fresh.  Let me open it.  Actually, before I open the bag, I want to show you the coolest thing.  On every bag of Três Pontas, and this is the, this is from the Ninas Jerez farm in Brazil.  This is a French roast.  It's the smoothest cup of coffee you ever had.  Actually, there's a reason for that.  Coffee grown on the race family farm.  So it's pulped natural, not washed.  That means the pulp is still on it.  That makes a smoother cup.  Most other coffees, equatorially grown coffees, they have to wash them because of mold problems.  They don't have that problem at the high mountains in Brazil.  See, here it is pulped natural.  Now watch this.  This is so fun.  There it is.  Oh, I have to do it again now so you can see it.  So I take a picture of the QR code on the bag.  And then look, here's the Google Maps.  You can actually see the bush where the bean, there it is.  Here's where the bean was grown.  Right there.  That's the race family farm on the hillside there on Três Pontas.  Let me open this up though.  You got to smell this.  I'm sorry, Stacey and Joan, you can't.  But I guess no one can except me.  It's so good.  It's the best coffee you ever had.  So smooth.  Now here's the deal.  We're going to get you a special offer.  If you go right now and subscribe at trespontas.com slash twig.  You got to see these beans.  Oh.  Drove Andy and Ako crazy yesterday because he wanted to smell them.  Look at those beans.  They're fresh, pulped natural, just delicious.  So good you just might want to eat them right out of the bag.  Here's the deal.  If you go to trespontas.com slash twig, you're going to get 10% off your service.  10% off your subscription.  You can have them every one, two or four weeks.  12 ounces of beans.  I like the idea of a smaller bag mailed on a more regular basis because then it's always fresh.  You can choose from light, medium, dark and French roast.  This is the French roast.  Shipping is free in the US.  When you subscribe, you get 10% off.  But if you do it at trespontas.com slash twig, another 10% off when you use the offer code twig.  For a total of 20% off your subscription every month.  20% off.  This would be an awesome Father's Day gift.  You could tell dad the whole story about the farm.  Say, dad, take the picture of the QR code.  trespontas.com slash twig.  Use the offer code twig for 20% off every bag of coffee in your subscription.  Ah, you can also order on Amazon if you just wanted to do it easily.  But you don't get the 20% off.  You gotta go to trespontas.com slash twig.  Alright, Stacey, you can uncover your ears.  We're done talking about coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, but are you still drinking it?  Because just watching someone drink it, I'm like, oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh man.  Yeah, I don't know if I could give up the brew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's honestly not that I've ever kicked a drug habit or anything super hard,  but it is one of the harder things I've ever done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, if I don't drink coffee, I get a headache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and I did a slow taper.  And believe me, I end up going back on the caffeine right now.  I'm back on the...  I'm coming off the wagon, back on the...  I don't know which wagon I'm on.  It's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're on and off the wagon all the time.  It's terrible.  Chrome 67 is out.  I want to show you something kind of cool with the new Chrome.  There are a number, apparently a number of new features.  But first of all, this is what you need to do is go to settings  and under settings about Chrome.  And you see I'm on 66.  So it's going to download and it does it pretty quickly, 67.  I think it eventually just does it automatically, right?  Updates Chrome automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think I've ever manually updated Chrome yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You might want to on this one.  If you're interested in among other things,  and I know you are, progressive web apps.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, so it's downloaded.  I'll relaunch.  And then the first thing you do after you relaunch is chrome colon slash slash flags.  So these are the kind of experimental settings in Chrome.  Let me make this a little bit bigger so you can read.  I was like, wow, what's happening?  It's tiny.  Experiments.  Type in PWA in the search and you're going to enable all three of these.  Enable full code cache.  PWA is this progressive web app that gives you the capability of going to a site.  We'll go to mobile Twitter.  There are a lot of progressive web apps.  And install it basically as a Chrome app.  Oh, cool.  And you're going to be able to do this also on iOS and Android.  So, okay, I've done that.  I'm going to relaunch one more time and go back to Chrome flags and I'm going to type app.  Here it is.  What was it?  It was app.  Banners.  Here we go.  Enable display progressive web app banners.  And experimental.  Yeah, let's do those.  We're going to turn those on.  This for now is an experimental feature, is the progressive web apps.  But let's go to, all right, Travago.  We'll do this one.  Travago.in.  So this is, if I go to Travago.in, it looks like a website.  But if I go to settings, you'll see I...  Huh.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This makes me feel a lot better, Leo, because this is me installing every IoT device.  This happens and oh, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  I did this on Windows Weekly minutes ago.  And partly because I'm on, I have Edge as the default browser here, which is probably part of the problem.  Let's try it with M.Twitter.  That's the Twitter progressive web app.  Go to the menu.  Yeah, open in Twitter Lite.  So I guess, oh, you know what?  I know why, because I did it on the other computer.  It was already installed.  What you will see is install Twitter Lite.  This is a PWA.  Now, this is going to show up in your folder, your Chrome apps folder, as a progressive web app.  So this is the new hotness, the idea that websites...  It looks like a website, but in fact, it's code that you can download and make kind of semi-permanent.  Let's do...  Here's another one.  Let's try that.  I guess the Travago.  It's only because I have it open.  Oops.  Here I've...  Yeah, geo.  .in.  And again, I'm going to open it in Travago.  This is a standalone PWA progressive web app.  So if you want to play with those, Chrome still has to launch kind of like the Chrome apps, but it's a different model entirely.  And it is now enabled in 67.  And I'm sure there's other great reasons to get 67.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Doesn't it have the automatic stopping of...  Yes.  Or automatic muting of...  That was my big excitement.  Yeah, of noisy tabs.  It's like, that's worth it, you know, no matter what you feel about web apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  Go for the noisy tabs, but stay for the web apps.  That's my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the glitz that'll get you in the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It gets you in the door.  All right.  Now, that process, I've closed my rundowns.  Let me go back to that.  There was a lot more in the Mary Meeker slideshow about internet advertising, but we don't need to cover that.  We don't really care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's only Google's core business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you want to...  Because actually there are some interesting slides in there I could show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait.  I'm like, let me go back and pick up some Google.  I feel like we haven't talked about Google very much.  Let me finish the Chrome thing.  Let me finish this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I forgot to mention this.  There is also a generic sense...  Now, this may be a bad thing.  A generic sensors API.  It exposes data from device sensors to public websites.  So your accelerometer, your gyroscope, your orientation, your motion sensors can now be read by apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait.  The ones in our sensors or in our phones can be read by how?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Using this API.  They're not in this...  Not in your iPhone probably, I bet you.  But if you're using Chrome on Android...  On my phone?  On your phone.  Oh, okay.  Then for instance, you could have...  If you use a VR headset like the Google Gear, I mean the Daydream or the Samsung Gear,  the phone sensors now can be read by the app that's running in Chrome to monitor head movement, things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was thinking you were talking about all of the sensors that I have around my house with accelerometers.  No, not those.  Just your phone.  How does that happen?

Transcript:  How could it?  I can't read those.  More...  A lot more security.  Strict site isolation.  That's I think what you were talking about.  That actually will help with Meltdown Inspector.  Passwordless authentication via WebAuthn.  They've dropped support for public key pinning.  And then the support for PWAs is in there.  So there's a lot of new stuff.  And this is a big update to Chrome 67.  Just came out.  Do I see the new Chrome UI?  We can do that too.  Let me go to Chrome.  Colon slash slash flags.  Do this one more time.  Search for UI.  UI layout for the browser's top Chrome.  Is that the one?  I don't know.  Let me go back to this page.  Let's see what the flag is.  UI layout for the browser's top Chrome.  UI layout for the browser's top Chrome.  And what do I choose?  You want the refresh design.  Okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Refresh.  You ready?  Let's see what the new layout looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  It's exactly the same.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Thank goodness for that.  So much for that.  I'm going to go ahead and do the refresh.  I'm going to go ahead and do the refresh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to go ahead and do the refresh.  Okay.  Thank goodness for that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So much for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Toggles between normal for clamshell devices.  Hybrid, previously touch for devices with a touch screen.  That's probably what I should put on here.  Touchable.  New user interface.  Unified interface for touch and convertibles.  And material design refresh.  That's the new one.  It's now more.  It is a little more material.  It's a little prettier.  I'm glad I wasted five minutes doing that.  It's okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should we go back to the meeker slides?  You want to know what men who aren't in jobs spend most of their time doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do.  What do men who aren't working spend most of their time doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It appears, well, more of them, I guess, spend, they spend three more hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this a week daily watching television?  Yes, I agree.  But only.  An additional point six hours sleeping.  That's other including sleep.  So I'm kind of like, dang.  And even less.  Doing household activities and services.  So that we knew too.  Here's another slide for something that you knew.  Locomotive jobs versus aircraft jobs.  Why is this in here?  It's not.  It's not.  It's not.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not.  It's not.  It's not.  It's not.  It's not.  It's not.  It's not.  It's not.  It's not.  It's not.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not.  It's not.  So if the change doesn't kill jobs, it brings them in new places.  So the next couple slides discuss farm work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Agricultural versus service.  It's the point being the rise in service jobs more than made up for the loss of agricultural  jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And maybe I'm just becoming more cynical with old age, but looking at this, these slides,  I'm actually kind of stunned at how it glosses over a lot of the inequalities of things like  the Airbnb housing, like how it increases rents in cities, how it glosses over things  like the flexibility offered by the economy, but how that's not necessarily offset by having  a job that you can depend on.  So I'm getting kind of frustrated as I look through this.  I'm like, hey, your worldview that is looking cracked and kind of not egalitarian is showing,  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's technologists, right?  And I would guess that the kind of reason that she doesn't spend time on it is the underlying  assumption almost just a given that, well, it all works out in the end.  That's the point, right?  So yeah, there's dislocations here, but then there's improvements here and it all is going  to work out.  For instance, you talk about gig economy, has technology made it easier to find freelance  work?  Yes, it has.  77% say yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, I look at this.  So yeah, on demand jobs, filling needs for workers who want extra income flexibility,  et cetera.  And there's a whole section on Etsy and Airbnb and Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think you're right that there is among technologists this just kind of basic assumption  that, well, you're going to have disruption, but it's all going to work out in the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess.  Sometimes it feels tone deaf right now.  Yeah, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sometimes with a mystery variable, like we're going to throw in, oh, I know, basic income.  There, that'll fix it.  That'll make the equations balance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have either of you been following any of the storyline around the taxi medallions in New  York and the rise of Uber, Lyft and other ride sharing apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yes, but I am so skeptical of that as a quote unquote storyline.  I understand the narrative.  I understand how these things play into it.  I really have a lot of questions about is it just Uber or is it the lack overall of  a safety net?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In a thumbnail, what is the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's been on the news a lot.  There's been five cab driver suicides related to having purchased these medallions where  they were over a million dollars in some cases just a few years ago.  But that the city knew or they're speculating that the city knew that these ride sharing  apps were coming and there wasn't anything done to ease the market.  And there's all these laws and regulations about the standardization of the cabby schedules  and the standardization of how much it costs.  So everybody gets the same rate, right?  And that's supposed to be a virtue in this economy is that you don't get into the cab  and they can just name their price.  But as a result, a lot of people are feeling both that they were scammed, but also that  there's really no way out of this debt.  And there's this I've been seeing videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is the medallion price set market set completely?  It's market based?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're generally auctioned, but many of them went on the market, you know, decades ago,  and people bought them and they get passed down through families or they get sold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But somebody must have some point done a calculation saying, well, it's going to cost  a million dollars, but I will pay it off in X number of years.  Right. Or wouldn't make sense to buy it.  You know, in other words, the taxis going to earn this much to make it up.  So what you're saying is that it feels to me like, well, I'm sorry that these guys got  screwed, but a million dollars for a medallion is a lot.  Well, it used to be worth that before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It used to be worth it. And you would buy it like you would pay.  You would pay it like you'd pay down a mortgage.  It would be a 30 year span.  And the belief was that the city would enforce such regulation so that the ride sharing  apps couldn't take over such a high proportion of the market.  Similarly, in London, there were, you know, it's very, very expensive to get a  cabbie license in London.  And you have to memorize 600 points of interest.  And it's really like a ride sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You live in New York, right, Joan?  Yep. So have you noticed?  I've heard all sorts of anecdotal stuff like, well, the reason the traffic is so bad  in Manhattan is because you've got, you know, half of the traffic is Ubers and lifts.  Somebody in the chat room is saying that this is Hell's Kitchen NYC.  So I take it he lives in the city.  Taxi medallions in New York were awarded during the Depression to stop exactly what  these ride sharing people are doing.  My street near the theater district, just a bunch of Uber X cars sitting double parked  waiting for a call, which they never get.  I go and I easily get a cab.  He says the medallion system may be broken, but it was better than what's going on right  now. So maybe maybe the upset is that they should that the city should never have  allowed, as Austin tried to, never allowed ride sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we so know we allowed ride sharing.  We just didn't allow those who didn't have background checks.  We were not against right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are many cities, though, who just don't want ride sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's I mean, there was a definite problem, not necessarily in New York so much as  like in San Francisco.  You know, you can never get a cab in San Francisco prior to Uber launching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. That's why Uber is out here.  Uber is beloved.  Same thing with L.A. It's beloved because it's the only way you can get a ride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there are definitely people it helps.  I mean, I look at my mother-in-law who can't really drive anymore, but has and again,  has the income to pay for people.  And, you know, other than calling a cab every time she wants to go someplace and hoping  it shows up right now, she just it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My mom stopped, you know, got rid of her car a few years ago.  She's 86, which was a good thing safety wise for her and everybody on the road.  And she took cabs, but she never liked taking cabs.  She was always afraid of the cabby.  But I had to persuade her so she would wait till my sister could drive her, which often  was inconvenient for my sister and not great for mom either.  I had to I set up Uber and Lyft on her phone and I had set up with my credit card and I  said, now, mom, you know, just do this.  And she was very nervous about using that.  Very because she'd heard all the bad stories about Uber drivers and so forth.  But once she started using it and she pretty much gets, you know, the same two or three  guys every time she loves it now.  It's for her. It's real freedom.  Right. Of course, I'm paying for it.  Well, but I but I.  Very good son.  Well, it's frankly, I would do the same for my kids.  I would much prefer they take Uber because it's more expensive to have a car.  In many cases, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think in New York, a lot of people rely on it because, yeah, it's it's crazy  to try to have a car and do all the parking.  But there is a level of congestion.  And then there's just the there's certain basic rules about surge pricing and things  that I think do need to get dealt with so that there's some predictability as well.  One of the things that I've been noticing in the discourse from the cabbies is that  there's no ADA access with Uber.  So any time anybody with some kind of mobility or disability issue that would need a  wheelchair lift and things, they aren't able to call and have access to those services  equally. And I think that when we see broad changes to regulation, it's going to have  to take account of some of these discrepancies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the other issue, of course, with medallions is there's a lot of corruption, isn't  there? I mean, it wasn't the taxi king just indicted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that I mean, I have it's very hard for me to conjure sympathy for, you know,  an industry that has generally, you know, I mean, it's it's like anything you have,  you know, the garbage men, if they decide that they're not going to pick up your garbage,  there's not a lot of options.  Right. And if the taxi lobby had decided, you know, that people, you know, like, for  instance, the idea that they wouldn't come pick you up.  I mean, I've been through this many times when I was living in L.A.  If you were to call a taxi service and it was, you know, we were going to the airport at  four o'clock in the morning.  You were really rolling the dice.  But the the apps like they provide other services that are useful, like the tracking and  the mapping and the cancellation and things that you don't get from just making a phone  call and crossing your fingers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Here's a slide that I can't wait to see next year's version of it, the post GDPR  version. This is the Internet advertising ad spend up 21 percent year over year.  And look at the Graybar is mobile.  Look at how mobile is growing.  But I bet you next year we're already hearing that programmatic ad sales in Europe have  plummeted after GDPR.  It's only been a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That makes sense. But something so so there's a really interesting macro thing to think  about. We we are talking about, oh, my God, you can't get the L.A.  Times or USA Today in Europe without going through a VPN.  OK, but this is what we're trying to do.  We're trying to regain our privacy on the Internet.  The challenge is, will we there will be disruption.  Will we come through on the other side with a sustainable business model that doesn't  traffic in our data? And it could be a hugely positive thing.  And maybe I'm naive. And yes, I am sort of.  But I am optimistic. We could take this as an opportunity to say, hey, engagement doesn't  matter because we don't want all these people.  We're less of an ad generated model.  And maybe we go more towards a value model on some platforms and then people will pay  for things. Yes, it does mean we have to pay for things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For some reason, I hear Jeff's voice in my head at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, I know. And I'm not I'm not going to say, you know, there's.  This is an opportunity to rethink some of the things, the assumptions that we've let  big companies build the Web on.  And I don't think we've all realized that.  And as we realize that, this is a good chance to see it laid bare.  And I think we're going to start in a few, hopefully weeks, seeing stories that  that talk about what data is actually out there.  And I honestly can't wait.  So I we need to have this reckoning, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is always coming.  Well, I don't know if it's always coming, but I think it is.  It's been a long time coming. Let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm glad it's here. And because we've gotten so far without it, I think we're  actually going to go further in the realm of sharing our data than we might have  otherwise done. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's one of the things Meeker says, that tech companies are in a privacy  paradox. They're caught between using data to provide better consumer experiences  like Google and violating consumer privacy and different companies choose  different points on that balance.  Obviously, Apple's, you know, tilted toward privacy.  Google's tilted towards better quote, better consumer experiences.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We talk about that a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting to me, too, though, when I was talking to some students about

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  data and privacy and asking about, you know, how they get, you know, how they end  up seeing the ads that they wanted to see.  And I like, you know, the notion of they didn't really like have a notion of what  they didn't see. Right.  You know, and so I often wonder about if if advertising was less personalized,  would it open up a different set of options for people?  I know for me, like the kind of advertising that I hate is, you know, when I  make a one time purchase, right, when I moved to New York, we had to buy a bed.  And for months I was getting Target marketed mattress ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's because they knew you moved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was I know I had searched for mattresses.  Searched for it. Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I know. I did it to myself.  But at the same time, you did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think what's more interesting, I don't know if you guys saw the Ars Technica  story. It was based on a it was about personal injury lawyers targeting ads to  people in emergency rooms.  OK, so this this came out yesterday.  It was based on reporting from the Philadelphia W.  H.  Y.  Y.  Affiliate.  And basically what happened is marketers were taking data from phone data.  So it was it was well, it wasn't always location data.  So they were using geofencing, but they were using either your Wi-Fi data.  So like you can't.  Euclid is a company that keeps data on phones in their Wi-Fi networks and where  they are, that sort of thing, GPS data and or cellular data.  So your cellular carrier might give this to them.  And then they were saying, hey, when you're in the ER and for a while afterwards,  you would get ads from personally.  What's even more wild is in was it Connecticut?  I think they if I don't know if it was in here or in the original story, they  were one of the state attorneys generals had come down on this practice for.  Pro anti-abortion groups targeting ads towards people who are waiting in planned  parenthood and other reproductive health organizations.  So if you were in one of those places, you would start getting like those ads  that are like a fetus is a baby kind of those kind of things.  And they were like, yeah, that's not cool.  You guys.  But that's where like, I think we're headed if we're not careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much, how much harm though is there really in getting, I mean, you're going  to get ads on your phone when you're in that emergency room is how much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, is it wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's not like you're going to get more ads.  You're going to get ads one way or the other.  So maybe you're going to get ads for something.  Yeah, I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's like when Target was like, hey, that chick is pregnant before anyone  realized it, that's that's the creepy line.  And when you cross it, you know, people are like, in that case, that that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's you know, that maybe that pregnancy could be revealed to somebody before the  person who was pregnant was willing to reveal it or whatever.  But so you get ads that are targeted, your geolocation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't people like if.  What is your name?  What's creepy?  What's creepy is because these people know where you are.  Some weird strangers.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  One knows where you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the perception, but it's not the reality.  The reality is the lawyers bought ads from Facebook or whatever.  It says, well, it's what anybody's there.  Please show them that ad.  They don't have your information here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  The middleman is Google.  Google has all that information.  Or Facebook either way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, whoever, whoever your middleman programs.  Right.  But the perception, it's people wake up to the fact that they are literally  carrying something around in their pocket that people, that can be used to track  them in all kinds of ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if we explain to them, well, it's not that the lawyer knows where you are.  The lawyer bought ads based on people's location.  Uh, Facebook and Google know where you are.  Did you know that Facebook knows where you are?  Well, yeah, I knew that.  Did you know that Google knows where you are?  Maybe they didn't know that.  So now they know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What if, what happens when the cops start subpoenaing that data from companies?  What if that digital ad broker is not reputable?  We know that because we know that Securus was selling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  This is geolocation information from phones to law enforcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what if this company is terrible at practicing good IT hygiene and  security and they're, they get breached.  So then someone else does know.  They should, we should worry about that.  People are people get, they realize that they've got these things.  They don't understand the network of information and they don't understand  how it can be abused or not abused.  That's a really fun thing.  And they should be upset.  I think they should be upset.  Yes.  Look at like things like Experian, Experian, Equifax, whichever one.  Equifax.  You've got massive collections of individual data that are, they're like icebergs.  You don't, you don't know what all's underneath the surface and you don't  know who has access to it and you will never see it.  That's one of the exciting things about GDPR is it tries to make that  visible to the end user or the consumer, the person whose data it is.  And I think that's really important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I do.  In principle, I love that idea.  But if the impact of it is it undermines something that isn't in fact creepy,  it's just selling ad space in your location.  How do we know it's creepy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We taught, we started off the show talking about algorithmic bias.  This data can be used in all kinds of different ways and we have no sense of that.  Yeah.  And I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we should limit how it's used and we should have strong protections about,  you know, where it goes and so forth.  We can't limit how it's used if we don't understand who's using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We need to have transparency over what data is shared to whom and then how it  gets, how that middleman puts things together.  Maybe it's okay that only Google has this information because they already had it  anyway and the lawyers don't know, but people need to understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think people should, should be fully informed.  I don't disagree with that.  In fact, I think if they are fully informed, they won't find it as creepy.  And then I think there should be strong laws against, as there are in GDPR data,  you know, data breaches need to be revealed.  Companies have a higher burden of protecting your private data and all of that.  But I don't think the, that the actual transaction itself of buying an ad based  on location is inherently creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  What if you, I mean, I think the abortion provider ads are pretty, that's a pretty,  especially because it's such a vulnerable time in someone's life.  And again, in the ER, it's a vulnerable time.  It's you're, I mean, it's, it's, it's  it's virtual ambulance chasing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you, so do you want to block all geofencing?  Cause you could also be, Oh, I see you're at orchard supply.  Let me give you some coupons.  Do we want to block all of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you want to block all of that?  I want the choice to block.  I want to, I want the choice to block all of that.  I really do.  I hate how Google is constantly like, I see you're at this place.  We need some help.  Oh, would you provide us a photo or even if you want to offer me a 20 cent  discount on a cup of coffee, cause I'm outside your coffee shop.  Yeah, no thanks.  I'd rather, I'd rather not.  Cause now everybody in the world has the potential to know that I was outside of  that coffee shop, depending on your lack of security, would everyone in the world care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I want to separate that, that out though.  I mean, I think you're right.  We, we're going to protect that has to be, there should be strong laws and you should  get punished if you have data breaches.  You need to be, have a higher duty of protecting that information.  I, I agree with that.  I'll stipulate that, but I want to separate that out from just, just  geofenced ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want the choice and to say, can I, should I opt into a geofenced ad?  Yes.  I want that choice.  I want to say no or yay.  And I want it to be an informed choice.  And that's, I don't see that that's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I, I think I, I think I agree.  I don't love going into certain stores and getting notification after notification.  That's, you know, you can get 20% off here, 20% off there.  Did you know that this is on sale?  It gets very annoying, especially when I'm dealing with, you know, like at this point,  I'm dealing with hundreds of notifications a day and it's like highly distracting.  And, you know, the opt-in thing is also, you know, something that I wish every time  my phone updates for some reason, all of the notifications that I've set, like get  erased and I'm stuck back with all these banner ads and it's, it's a problem that  plagues me, but I did want to talk just for a second about one of the researchers at  Data and Society did this really cool project in 2013 where he target marketed  Shaquille O'Neal specifically with a set, with a piece of artwork and they were using,  so they were calling it like this artisanal data mining project and they had identified  all of these.  I would think it'd be impossible because that's as an individual as opposed to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  geofencing.  So that's, I want to hear about this.  That's interesting.  Yeah.  So there's an article on Gizmodo called bizarre new art project stock, Shaquille

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  O'Neal for custom dunk rig.  And so the idea behind it and the artist is a researcher named Matt Gertzen at Data  and Society and the idea was a bit of a lark, right?  But they were like, if we can learn enough about Shaquille O'Neal, can we target  market him and then from proof of concept, sell this notion of data mining?  And, you know, one of the things that we think about at Data and Society related to  art is really about how these targeted art projects or these kind of like ambitious  art projects that try to do one thing really well, open up for us another way of  thinking about technology.  And so one of the things that Matt is very, very good at is thinking about, well,  what is the constellation of things that we need to know about a person, place or  thing in order to grab the kind of keywords and to make the, you know, in order to get  to the bottom of stuff.  And so, yeah, it was a beautiful project.  Unfortunately, Shaquille O'Neal didn't, you know, come to them to buy this.  It didn't work.  It didn't work, but it.  Well, this would have been a lot more interesting if it had worked.  Well, OK, so a couple of problems here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First of all, the reason they target Shaq is because he's a sitting duck.  He's, you know, unlike you and me, Stacey and Joan, he, you know, he's got maybe me,  but I mean, he's there was you could target Shaq because he's so public about everything.  He's an avowed narcissist was one of the reasons.  So they actually identified keywords.  They bought this phrase Shaq is the best because it had a low search volume, probably most  likely Shaq himself.  So, I mean, this is something highly targeted and it didn't work or maybe Shaq was immune.  Or maybe he wasn't interested in the art once he saw it.  But the point was this is 2013, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we have artists showing us the.  I'm glad they said it was an art project anyway.  Yeah.  And and how AdSense could be used.  And I think that's a good point.  And I had remembered reading maybe a year and a half ago, a 2600 magazine excerpt about  someone that was targeting police departments with geo fence data and advertising and trying  to get trying to influence the kinds of advertising that police officers saw when they  searched for things online.  And so there are other kinds of targets that we can use to target Shaq.  And so there are other kinds of targets that we might think about in terms of the way that  this might play out, whether it's highly targeted marketing to certain celebrities in order to  gain attention or, you know, government buildings.  I even heard I don't know if it's true.  I can't substantiate this, but I heard that someone had been targeting Donald Trump's  set of phones because he uses a very particular older model Android phone when he's tweeting.  And so they were using that kind of data to to target market to that very specific level of the  phone itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's almost certainly by now been hacked because he insists on using two older phones that are not  secured in the White House.  And we know we talked last week about how many stingrays there are in the D.C. area.  Oh, goodness.  It would be an easy thing to hack him.  I will give you I will give you, Stacey, that you everyone should have the right to turn off that  location information and to say, don't don't follow me.  And I think for the most part you do in most phones, you can say, don't track me to almost  everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, but you're giving up services like maps.  I mean, if I want to know where I am in a city, I have to actually share this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I point out the absence of fabulous free product?  And what you're saying is I want it, but I don't want to pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would pay for it.  I would pay for always on access to Google Maps and directions easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the argument with Facebook, too, is that Facebook could offer an ad free  location free experience if they charged you.  There's a couple of problems.  One, it's to anti-democratic.  You'd have to be able to afford to spend hundreds of dollars a month on a variety of services that  you get for free now.  The other is that none of these services are built on that model.  And that's maybe not as easy to do as it sounds to say, well, okay, well, let's put up a pay  wall.  There's another problem, which is it's not just Google and Facebook, AT&T and Verizon both

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  want to set up networks.  Everybody's getting in on this.  And I would also say let's also expose the fact that we are being tracked.  Those like I could afford to pay for all of this.  Thus, I am probably a more attractive target for a lot of ads.  Whereas someone who can afford to pay for it probably is a less attractive target for  certain ads.  Not all ads.  But so that's a I don't know.  It's like the insurance model meets the ad networks.  It's gross.  Gross, gross.  So, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, all right, I will grant you.  I think that that would be a good goal is to have both disclosure and control.  And that's, I think, GDPR's mission as well.  I worry about unintended consequences.  As I said, we're already seeing a huge drop in ad sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We can fix unintended consequences if we decide we don't like them.  This is the same argument that people had in the US about like health care.  Right.  And now people are like, oh, wait, that was actually okay.  We probably could fix a lot of things that weren't right about it.  But, you know, this is there's a whole entrenched lobby of people who pay to make sure that we  don't think about this stuff.  Right.  So, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you yawning?  Wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm agreeing with you.  No.  Oh, I was like, how good is this coffee?  I just I needed some oxygen.  I just need a little oxygen.  That's all.  I think we can pretty much wrap this up.  Is there any other stories that we really want to mention today?  I think we did a good job of covering Mary Meeker's slideshow.  Samsung has to pay Apple half a billion dollars according to a jury, but it will be appealed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, Samsung's getting to three nanometers?  No way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  Techspot says, so current Intel processors at 14 nanometers.  Qualcomm has some 10 nanometers.  Nobody I think that I know of is going below 10, except Samsung is now saying that they  can make processors, ARM-based processors, at three.  That's got to be.  What?  Not yet?  Not yet.  This is a roadmap to 2019.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So their next, no, in 2019, they're going to be using EUV lithography for seven nanometers,  which is really impressive.  And tough, because your yields go down tremendously.  But they're targeting four nanometer low power, early and low power, low power plus.  And four is the last generation to use FinFET, which is the differentials in-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it will be a few years before Samsung and any or any of its competitors are able  to scale process technologies all the way down.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is not real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't believe it's real.  Yeah.  What we don't know is what that will look like and whether quantum effects will make  them completely useless because-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not, well, quantum computing, because it's not quantum effects.  Leakage is your big issue when you start cramming them that close together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leakage, but also if, I mean, I don't know, I'm not a physicist, but I thought once you  get to that scale that you are actually in the quantum realm, but maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, sure.  Electrons don't act as-  They don't act like they're supposed to.  I don't know.  I'm not a physicist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Multi-bridge channel effects.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my gosh.  If you are in the UK and you're watching TV, especially if you're watching TV during  Coronation Street or The Simpsons, you may be surprised you see a Samsung ad and your  TV goes dark for five seconds.  Oh, can you imagine the upset this is going to cause?  The screens will, this is a Samsung ad, screens will buzz with static interference before  going blank and entirely silent for five seconds.  That's enough time to freak out.  The darkness ends with text emerging, which reads, this is your TV screen most of the  time, a void full of nothing.  And then talks about the ambient mode in Samsung's QLED TVs, which means you'll never  see a blank screen again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, that was a big deal at CDIA last year.  There were so many well-framed TVs that were very pretty.  So at the high end, they are definitely pushing TVs that have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like digital art frames kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, yes, framed for digital arts, but also they look, they're pretty TVs.  And then yes, they have whatever, if you want giant pictures, great.  If not, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'd be so pissed off.  I'd be so pissed off.  Five seconds is an infinitude.  You mean, you just assume, oh my God, the cables failed.  Did you want to talk about, you want to put to rest...  I did say we would talk about this.  This Z-Wave, 100 million Z-Wave devices that are going to be hackable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If we're all freaked out about it, just calm down, folks.  Calm the F down.  So what this is, it's a rehash of a hack that was in 2013.  And I think again, in 2016, we all discussed this and we're like, ah.  So in April of 2017, the Z-Wave Alliance introduced a new concept called S2 Security.  So what this new hack does is it rolls back your S2 Security to S0,  which is the one that was hacked in 13 and 16.  Now, a couple things to know about it.  The hack itself is pretty tough.  You've got to be within Z-Wave range, which is like...  Z-Wave range?  Z-Wave range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've got to be within Z-Wave range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, you've got to be really close.  And then you've got a very limited amount of time to catch...  Much like if you're going trying to hack someone's Wi-Fi by sitting outside  and trying to get their credentials and then cracking the credentials.  This is a similar effort.  So you've got to be close.  You've got to catch a...  It's not exactly a handoff, but you've got to catch that.  Then you can, in a secure S2 device, roll it back to S0 and try to hack it.  But if you have S2 Security on a device, it will actually notify the users  when that security gets rolled back to S0.  So the one thing that you might want to worry about, again,  if you have someone who's really technically savvy trying to hack your particular door locks,  is that not a lot of devices out on the market actually use S2 Security yet.  August locks do, but not like a lot of smart home hubs don't.  There's about 15 of them with S2, but some of the big ones like Wink and SmartThings don't yet.  So that's kind of all you should really know about that.  I have a lot of Z-Wave stuff.  I'll just tell you, I'm not really worried.  If you want to come in and break in my door locks,  you're so, it's going to be so much easier just to break a window and to hack my door.  Right.  This is an issue if your hotel uses it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that would be an issue.  Absolutely.  But a lot of hotels use Bluetooth.  You should only have, if you're going to have an automatic door lock,  you should get one that is automatically updated.  This would be software fixable, I presume?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This particular thing, I don't think it's software fixable.  It's a fundamental, it is a fundamental flaw in Z-Wave.  And yes, the Z-Wave Alliance does say that this was a conscious decision  that they made that this should be allowed.  I imagine it has to do with backwards compatibility  because they are really sticklers about that.  But, and again, S0 is the same.  To hack at the S0 level, you have to be in physical proximity to the device.  You have to have the same quick reaction, like quick grab of the handoff.  So again, there's a lot of easier ways from an individual level.  If it's at a corporate or like a hotel, like a larger target, maybe it makes sense.  So, but an individual, I wouldn't stress it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you for the clarification.  Steve Gibson agrees with you.  We talked about it yesterday as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh man, we are just like on the same page this whole show.  Same wavelength.  Same wavelength.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Joan Donovan is at Data and Society where you can read her great stuff, datasociety.net.  She's a researcher in media manipulation.  That never happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like I said, business is booming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a good time to be a researcher.  If you got to pay the bills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anything else you want to plug?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess, are we doing picks?  You want me to?  Yeah, you want to do a pick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's do a pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, because I mentioned at the beginning, but I didn't mention her name.  Virginia Eubanks is the one who wrote the book Automating Inequality and I highly recommend it.  Came out recently.  She's been doing a bunch of book tours as well as doing the organizational circuit,  like just really spreading the knowledge and the love around.  And so it's a very well written book, very easy to understand,  and really gets to the heart of how inequality is going to show up in our  online and high tech life.  And I think it's really, she spent years researching and working with people all over  America to get the data.  So it's really rich storytelling, but also I think that even though it took her a long time  and she always felt like she was running behind, I think the time is now that people read that book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sounds like somebody we should get on triangulation, Karsten.  Make a note of it.  Thank you, Joan.  Great recommendation.  Virginia Eubanks, Automating Inequality.  Stacey, what are you looking at these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  I am following up on a pick because I gave you a headphone pick way back in, I don't know,  November, December, after I bought these cheap, but perfectly serviceable Bluetooth headphones.  They were like $30 Senso headphones and they died.  They lasted about six months, so it's fair, but they are now dead.  So I decided just to just go all in.  It was Mother's Day.  I got the Jabra Elite 65T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have Jabras as well.  I love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are really good, you guys.  They were $170.  So let's show you my headphones.  I feel kind of silly, but this is the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They sound good too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll take one earphone out so you can see it in my ear.  Let's get the right one.  So this is the little bitty black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The case is a charging case like the AirPods.  You already have headphones in.  Don't jam.  Oh, okay.  So, and this is...  Look at that.  That looks like a clever jewelry artifact.  And Amazon Echo is built in.  You can echo it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did not.  So I have not put in the app because I need another app on my phone like I need a hole in my head.  But here you are.  They've lasted, for me, I've had them about two weeks.  They've lasted about a week with regular use, just charging,  putting them back in the charging case and then charging them.  If I press it on this side, I can get access to Google Assistant or possibly Siri.  I don't use them with an iPhone.  And then they have fast forward volume up controls on this ear.  And they're really good.  And I have really small ears and the smallest setting does work for me.  So I don't know.  I really like them so far.  Yeah, I have...  We'll see if they last longer than six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have the Sport Elite and I imagine it's true with these as well.  They come with so many different tips and they're really clear.  You've got to get the tip that fits the best for the best sound,  but also in the Sport Elite for heart rate measurements.  And so they do all...  You have to shake your head.  They have an app and you have to shake your head and go like this  and make sure it's not going to fall out.  But once you get the fit right, the sound quality is superb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The sound quality is good.  So there's a two-year dust and water resistance warranty.  And they do actually touch with Madam A.  I will have to check that out.  And Siri.  They sound good on calls.  My other ones did not sound good when I was on phone calls,  which is really important to me.  My music sounds good.  I can wear them during a sweaty workout.  I've worn them a couple of times during a sweaty workout and they're still alive.  So I wouldn't say they're waterproof, but it's a hundred degrees here.  So they're definitely sweat proof.  I am petrified about losing them.  And yeah, I don't know how they relate to the iPod things,  but I will say they have the one feature that the AirPods have that I really like  is when you take them out of your ears, they're like, oh, we're no longer being used.  So they pause the music and then they take it out.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you said you agree with their five-hour battery life.  Is that about right?  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think they'll...  Oh no, because I've had them on a plane.  So I wore them on the plane.  I didn't realize I had...  I'm a space cadet, but I didn't put my noise canceling headphones on.  I just left these in.  It was a four and a half hour flight.  So yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Close to five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know, you don't need noise cancellation as much if they really isolate.  And I think those...  Yeah, they really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You cannot hear a lot.  That is a downside that...  And I don't know if they have like a true hearer or some sort of like...  You can hear ambient noises, but I'm okay with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't want to hear ambient noises on the plane.  If we're going down, I don't need to know.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, people are asking me about the Wyze camera on the thing.  So can I give you a second pick?  Yeah.  It's really good.  Yes.  So Wyze Cam, I think it's wyzecam.com?  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wyzecam.com, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So they just launched today.  The Pan Cam, a $30 Pan Cam.  I know.  What?  I ordered one because for $30, why wouldn't you order this thing?  What the what?  The what?  I know.  The horizontal range, horizontal, horizontal this way is 360.  So woo, and vertical is just 93 degrees, but that's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it has a patrol route.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the Wyze Cam itself is really good.  The $20 HD Wyze Cam, Kevin actually reviewed it on our site.  And I used to have the version one of it.  I love these things.  They're pretty sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it can tag animals.  Look at see it sees the dog.  Oh, this is really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a company that's founded by people from Amazon.  It's hosted on AWS.  The software is built in the US.  The hardware is made in China.  So they license hardware from a Chinese camera maker.  They say that all the data goes to you.  I don't know.  You can store it on an SD card.  Oh, free rolling 14 day cloud storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't even have to subscribe.  Right.  Yes, there's lots of things.  What?  Oh no, this is I'm buying it before they're sold out.  How can they do this, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they talk to me because they're they basically say their model is just like Amazon's business  model, which is razor thin margins that you make up for by selling a butt ton of devices.  I don't know if this is really a credible business model, but this is what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought they must be making it up in subscriptions.  Wow.  I'm buying three right now.  Dear Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why buy three?  It has it pans all around the room, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I have two rooms, three rooms.  I have several rooms in my home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't want to put it in your bedroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Tell them.  Oh, yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't do that.  Or your bathroom.  You're right.  Don't do that to us.  What a nice like treat for any hacker who hacks into your camera.  You're like, ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you is it like pan tilt zoom that you control or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Through the app?  It looks like it.  Yes.  I don't have it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it also you can set it up for a patrol so it can look there, stay there for a few seconds,  look there, look there, look there up to four points and then go back.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  At that price, buy it by a dozen.  All right.  So we'll have your review when you get yours.  Very nice.  Yeah.  It says you can pan tilt and zoom in the Wyse app.  Up to for 360 degree live view.  Up to 110 degrees a second.  Three seconds, in other words, to go all the way around.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I should tell you, I should clarify for you guys,  the guy when I talked to the founders at Wyse, they're saying their contention is that you could  make a Nest Cam with the $30 bomb that they've got basically and Nest is just doesn't.  So I don't know how much material costs there are in the Nest so I can't verify that statement.  But that's what they're touting.  I don't necessarily believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're putting their money where their mouth is.  They're selling this thing for 30 bucks with no subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I've read their terms of service.  They're not like pulling your camera data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the Wyse Cam 2?  Oh yeah, that's the original Wyse Cam.  Oh, this is the original one.  I don't know if it's the original.  They look the same.  It's the second one.  It's the second one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not the new one though.  The new one is called the Go or the Pan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this doesn't pan.  It just sits there.  And how much was this?  20 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  20 bucks.  That's the one Kevin reviewed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I could just put this on my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We had ours by our fish tank for a while just to see if they didn't die like we were on vacation.  I mean.  And did they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  How about the camera?  Did it die?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It did not die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's impressive.  Are we reviewing this?  Is that why we...  We already did.  Who did it?  Make it on the new screensavers.  Oh, I did.  I remember that.  Yeah.  I wasn't here.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can send people to Stacy on IoT to Kevin's review if you want that camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacy on IoT.com.  Read Kevin Toffle's thorough in-depth review of the Wyzecam 2.  And stay tuned.  Sometime in the next few weeks, Stacy and I will have our Wyzecam pans.  We can have dueling panos.
