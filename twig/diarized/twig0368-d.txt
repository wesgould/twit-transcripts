I'm surprised at 1.6 million daily users, but there are at least  So the new features you can now have richer conversations by adding links and photos to your comments. I like that  That's one of the things I like about Facebook. You know, you could put a picture in the comment  Usually a GIF showing your actual reaction  to the post  We're also offering community owners and monitors more control over who posts what with approving posts with approved posting who posts what?  With approved posting finally, we're launching a new notification center on the web where you can see and manage  See, this is one of the problems people have been complaining about Google Plus the notifications is all just hey  You got 8 million spam posts, right?  But but maybe not I do not want any more spaces notifications, thank you  These features will become will be available across the web Android and iOS in the coming week. So right now these are  web only second if you haven't previewed the new Google Plus over the next few days, we're gonna upgrade you anyway  But you will be able to toggle back for the time being  Finally businesses have told us they found Google Plus to be a valuable way to help employees.

I think it's finally time to just go ahead and move it over  It's like five people are there anymore right the same guys well

Transcript:  Maybe it was it was pretty all of his Google stuff. Is there any history?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That any evidence historical evidence that could point to the idea that you can revive a failing social network  Like I don't think there's any time in the history of mankind or could  Oh, yeah, there you go you can make money off it wouldn't that be amazing if Google sold it  No, don't sell it Google  You I don't think you can revive a social network because it's the reverse network effect it snowballs  Yep in the reverse direction just as it snowballs in the forward direction. I don't know you can bring back

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just trying to think you could bring back shopping centers. You could bring back  There's I mean social networks haven't been around long enough to really think about there to figure this out. So it's hard to say but I  Mean you can bring back failing brands

Transcript:  I know but it was great sit in the corner and see everything Karsten's not rotating anymore. He's just over there in the back

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's all right. This is more like a traditional TV studio. If you come in here you go. Yeah, I recognize a television studio  So it's kind of like Google Plus  It says if I went over there and painted the wall and said hey welcome back to the new Brickhouse studio  No, no, I am gonna make an effort to use Google Plus. I yeah, I should to promise is twig  But but also what else?  What else is there? I'm not I think Twitter  Twitter's fine. If you want to send  brief  Communications, I know it feels more and more as I go back there that all the communications are very self-serving  What do you think Stacy you want to go back to the new Brickhouse studio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You defend Twitter, don't you? I do I like Twitter. I usually use it to link back to things. I've created elsewhere. It's promotional  But well, no, I mean I have really great conversations with people on Twitter as well  so, I don't know I even use it to reach out to people and  again, it that's it. I think it's just the community you build up in  The community I felt up is for the most part. They know who I am  I've met most of them or we argue about like cloud architectures, which it's really hard to get upset

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have much argument on Twitter though. It's so disjointed and it is, you know, and I also I miss Lauren Weinstein and  He's and he is on Google Plus very he's the best. He is the last man standing. God bless you  He's always good. So I do follow him and thank goodness. He's put so look. Let me just look at my my Twitter feed  Jenna Wortham  Should I buy a mesh bomber? Yes or no, don't even know what that is. It's a jacket. She should not okay  See, maybe I just am not hip enough Ellen DeGeneres. I don't know who done it, but they already does it for fingerprints  I don't care. Don't want to see it. Here's a fake, you know, Will McAvoy account Renee Richie  I've written over 30,000 words on iOS 10 already. None of this stuff is that useful to me? You know I'm saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Well now I've got to go look at my Twitter feed if you really think of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you think of it, it's it's it's quips. It's bull mo. It's promotional  It's I think it prom it prom it promotes kind of a fragmented way of thinking  I want long form and I think Google Plus was good about long form

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is but you know, you know, but I'll say this and Twitter's been driving me nuts for a lot of reasons  but last night when Trump announced he was going to Mexico and  I just said I  Put a tweet up that said  Okay, here's the deal  We'll build the wall real quick while you got him and then you keep him  I saw your tweet and but the great thing about that was I mean it was it spread in Spanish like crazy  Right that can happen on Twitter. Yeah, and so what I  Know what makes me feel like I'm yeah, Jeff. Jeff feels good about that  Stacy just said that as if well and he doesn't have much reason to feel good. So give him that Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, come on Leo. No, okay. So here's here's how I use Twitter  I follow an amazing array of people like I follow a bunch of like particle physicists  I follow people who are into NASA. I follow people who follow FCC filings and argue about like radio stuff  I follow a bunch of satellite nerds and like basically if you are smarter than me  I probably follow you or if you're a journalist friend explains why you don't follow me or Jeff  Leo you say you're not on Twitter. Why would I follow you? I just now I'm really not on Twitter. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I might actually oh, I don't care

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She does anything looking up and see if she follows you follow you I follow you and you follow me see

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway, so what if I tore down should I tear down all of my my feet and start over? Oh, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Delete everyone and start over with only really awesome people like people who are genuine

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just gonna you know what I'm gonna do is I think there's a way to follow just Stacy's feed, right? That's my feet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's called my login. I follow I follow  2571 people that's too many. Oh, I follow I think I follow like a thousand people. I'm crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know use the only thing I read is my media walks list

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you can do that with lists so I don't have to actually delete people I could create a list and just read the list

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I don't I don't look at my home feed at all. I haven't ages. That's maybe the way to do it. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just feel like the conversation  on  Google plus always was better. That was more long form true true true  I love it that I can now put content into my comments. I  Don't know I've oh, you know what I'm I  I left I've left Twitter more times than I can count. Yes, you have I've I've I've promoted Jaiku  Pounce and so many of these Twitter clones. I said these are better Jaiku was better was threaded conversation  None of them survived Twitter will go forever Twitter's like the cockroach that's gonna survive nuclear wind indeed  It's gonna bring it's gonna simultaneously bring on nuclear winter and survive it  meanwhile Kim Kardashian's making  187 thousand dollars for every picture she posts  She's good for her

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm sorry good for her. She has made  crazy amounts of money by being famous and  Mark like seeing the social media zeitgeist and being like, you know what? I'm good at this. I can monetize it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know Twitter is Twitter is the match game of our generation  Howard Stern was talking about that the other day that  He always wondered about celebrities on match game because none of them were famous for any good reason  So that's what Twitter is like with Kim Kardashian. She's not famous for a good reason I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so here's here's where I'm gonna disagree with you. Okay, she is aspirational  She's famous because she has made it her business to be seen and she does a really good job of quote-unquote being seen  And in social media in famous right in a social media era, that's what you mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. Okay, that's interesting. All right. All right. All right  Look, please so so well on the match game days you had people or was a Peggy  Carlisle was famous for nothing  But Peggy was getting Carlisle and Peggy Cass Peggy Cass right people who did absolutely know the match

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Orson Bean, but most of them was so but so Kitty Carlisle was who was she was somebody's wife, right?  What was her claim to fate? What was the match game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry you guys. I'm like, wait a second. I don't know what you're talking about. We're too old. We're too old

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There I guess here's the point  Even okay John, you remember you know who Johnny Carson is  I do know there were people who were famous just because they appeared on The Tonight Show and  That was what they not as comics or anything. They just went on as guests  However, it was somewhat like in France are people for famous who are just appearing on shows. They're called public intellectuals  Yes, and you're a public intellectual Jeff. I mean that's kind of what you are  so  We don't do public intellectuals in the United States because we're anti intellectual fundamentally ever since the days when Adlai Stevenson was called an egghead  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have other types, right? But I would go to Stacy's point, right? I  Guess we always mocked Peggy Cass and such because all because the show made them famous  They were famous because they were on the show and it was it was a cycle, right?  But there was nothing they did never did anything what Stacy I think just said is that in a social media era  They're different from a show or a network knowing how to become famous is itself the reward

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right Carlisle was here. This is gonna really make this is gonna be a reference  Nobody except you and I will get was married was married  Her claim to fame was she was married to Moss Hart's heart. All right  And then she became a kind of a spokesperson for the arts  If she did Peggy Cass was was she not an actress or comedian or something?  So I do think more about Kim Kardashian I do think well no here. Yeah, she was a comedian  I do think that what happens still to this day is people are I mean  The nerds talk about the nerdist  He's he you know, he's a comedian he's a working comedian  But he's really better known for being a pun, you know a guy who's you see on TV and stuff. I mean, what is  What is what's-his-name's-town now? I can't remember his name. He's such a non-entity, but he's everywhere. He was even at the Olympics

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's such an entity can't remember his name Ryan Seacrest, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's faceless, but he's kind of benignly faceless. So he's a talk about famous

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He is he is not again, I think we're underestimating a couple things Ryan Seacrest  Works hard. I mean he he's I mean, I don't I don't I'm sure Kim Kardashian works hard. Exactly these people I mean  There's nothing that says  Okay, but they're at least trolls are tearing people down I would I would argue

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hard work alone is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But people give her crap because they don't necessarily value the things she's famous for it's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if she were a man, I don't think like I don't think you like Ryan Seacrest. Yeah, sure Ryan Seacrest or yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean right Ryan Seacrest is a wonderful MC and host

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was a DJ still is a DJ I think yeah, so I mean  That's famous because her father was it was OJ Simpson's buddy and lawyer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's famous because she had a sex tape and she used to be Paris Hilton's assistant. She was  Kardashian but she also I mean she's also famous now and she's gained so much credibility because she's parlayed those two things into  This crazy empire that's connected with lots of young women who value her lifestyle  She is like a Martha Stewart, you know, what's more the Stewart good at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Amazing yeah, she's at the top tier  But in the second tier there are a dozen or a hundred YouTube hosts like Michelle Phan who are similarly successful and famous  Because of the platform it's a social platform it does very well for some people anyway, this all started because the San Francisco  Talent agency captivate and by the way, it's captive with an eight the number eight at the end  Cuz  Internet said that internet influencers with a following of three to seven million people could make  $75,000 on average for a promotional post on Instagram on YouTube  187,000 we're not talking about YouTube ads we're talking about  Exactly the kind of thing PewDiePie got in trouble for basically native content  So Kim Kardashian published a video clip on Instagram  Hashtag ad because the FTC requires this  Excited to be partnering with sugar bear hair to share their amazing hair vitamins with you these chewy  gummy vitamins are delicious and a favorite part of my hair care routine and  Put a video clip up and  Presumably made, you know, $75,000 or more for it just for that  Someone with three to let's see  75 is the average Instagram or snapchat if you've got enough followers  $30,000 on Twitter which shows you that Twitter followers are not perhaps as accurate a measure  But if you have 50 to 500 thousand followers on on YouTube  You can make $2,500 for a native content or a thousand dollars for an Instagram post  Isn't that amazing and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't I mean if you look at so my daughter is huge into YouTube stuff and right now and she's she's only 10  So she's not doing anything crazy  but like there is a blogger called Stacey plays who has a dog that looks like our dog and  My daughter loves watching her Minecraft videos and she wants a shirt just like Stacey place  she's been looking for a blue striped shirt now forever because she loves this lady so much and I mean  That kind of influences is so powerful and when you start applying it directly and Stacey's not even selling things if you look at  someone like a beauty blogger who's like  right, it's crazy and  Yeah, I'd want a piece of that too, except I don't because ethics

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's interesting  It's an interesting question because first of all  The you know a ten-year-old  Ten-year-old  Well a it's illegal to advertise to ten-year-olds

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, she says in fairness Stacey plays is not advertising  She is she just happens to wear my daughter just loves her so much for all you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's she's paid to wear those blue striped shirts  I apologize. I don't I don't mean to slander her  But  That is one of the issues and Jeff and I've talked about this a lot of native content is that it's not always

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Obvious who's getting paid to do what we talked about this last week that the numbers that I found  I wrote about a week ago that the renewal rate for native advertising is running according to one study 20% another study 40%  Oh, that's low  And and you know the reasons for this become fairly obvious one is huge competition because anybody can make content  It's not that special skill  And two I've always doubted what the ROI really is  advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Content but not everybody can get out 1.3 million subscribers like Stacey plays has right so that you could there are very clear metrics  Much clearer than in broadcasting almost well  I'm not much clearer because broadcasting has ratings  But there are clear metrics that would direct you where to invest your dollar if you're going but the problem is that cognitive advertising I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mean Kim Kardashian has really pretty hair well well the kind you're talking about there is  An ROI to sales yeah the kind that you know the the Dell executives essay in the New York Times

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and that's the issue is

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why the renewal rate seems low. I think that's low. I don't I'd have to compare it to renewal rates  Oh, that is traditional high-trust. Yeah  So that means people are trying it and not getting the results they're hoping for or they're going to somebody else to make it  Or they're moving around on the other the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Problem is that what's happening a lot of media companies is that fine?  I make the ad I charge for that, but it's very expensive and hard to make and then I have to buy media to drive  Traffic to the app it's like the old SEM  Or I have to pay to place this stuff elsewhere because it's not getting viral  Elsewhere because it's not getting viral so I got to put it there myself

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So here's the Kim Kardashian and by the way Instagram now gives you  View information to clearly aimed at this exact kind of advertising 12.3 million views of this  Instagram doesn't get any kind of her. That's what's weird. Yeah, it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Understand how hair vitamins work is it like prenatal vitamins because when you take those your hair gets super long

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you actually asking that question yeah, you're scaring both of us here you're actually saying oh, I believe this ad  I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he has all the all the specs you need except for touchscreen that come out the later. It's very expensive  There's a balance  Thousand bucks what I think look at the HP Chromebook 13 get great reviews

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it can't be that much. Really? I only see two you get the high end. Are you sure? I only see two Chromebooks  I see an 11 inch for HP Chromebook 13

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not there I think you're I think you're fantasizing no, I'm not I've got it on my screen look at my screen I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  can't  It just was announced. That's why oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, this one's been out for a while. All right, let me look at that long, but it's been out

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it is pretty it's brushed aluminum. Yeah  It's too small screen executive level style  It is it looks just like an it MacBook Air quad HD plus panel

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But  The one they reviewed at Forbes went for 800 and then there's a thousand dollar one  I think golly that is a lot of money that is that's a fancy Chromebook. Let me let me let me

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Juice it up 1299 the highest level is 1299, which is the pixel was what 1300 you'd have to really go crazy though to get it to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's why it's my primary machine is my only machine. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can get it all the way up to 1600 bucks  If I have a  M7 i7 mobile  running at 3.1 gigahertz 16 gigs of RAM  She don't need I think for day really need that it should have a touchscreen of this quad HD screen probably is very nice  Wi-Fi yeah, you can get it up. I've got it up to 2,000 bucks. No do not buy a $2,000 Chromebook  No, even I will say don't tell me also. I want to get one for me for Christmas  I'll be happy to I would get a bigger screen or is 13 the right size for you 13  Here's Dell's 13 inch Chromebook  Similarly priced it's also aluminum unibody and all that this is must be aiming at the  the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Executive market executive the two things they don't have are one touchscreen, right? This one doesn't either right? Yeah, too  Yes, you know, I always complain about no LTE

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's weird. I would get a touchscreen  Absolutely get a touchscreen  Just especially the Android's gonna be coming on to it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely need touchscreen on a Chromebook going forward

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I it may be it may be that Google says we don't need to do the pixel anymore because there are these really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want to hear that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can get up to 15 inches so Acer makes a 15 inch Chromebook if you want big size I live lovey to Google  You know, I really you know, here's what I want Google to do really  Is the part of the problem with the Chromebook is you can't really I would like to be able to install Chrome OS  Like I install Linux to pick the hardware I want and then put Chrome OS on it and make it into a Chromebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, that's why what what is the hardware spec that doesn't make that just obviously it's an open source project

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Could the chromium OS just like Chrome's analog in the open source world is chromium  But it isn't it isn't really  Really  Designed to put on a machine I think that may be because of the security  Code  Remember you can't it's assigned OS. You cannot modify the OS on a Chromebook without  Triggering a warning it won't even boot  Right you have to really you know  So I've looked and there are some companies that say we can put Chrome OS  But it's limited like I wanted there there there's companies that could put Chrome OS on Macs on Mac laptops  That's funny, but it's kind of limited  The hardware it'll support and I even wonder how you know, you have to turn off the secure boot and stuff. So  This never wears the company. I think yeah never where  Turns any it's never where w are e.com. They have something called crowd ready  They've modified it in such a way that you can install it on a PC  Right, but it's hardware compatibility is a little  Limited I wasn't able to get it on but so I guess this is pretty close. This is pretty close  So you could I guess we could find you a nice a nice laptop and put Chrome OS on it or dual boot it  I think that'd be a good way to do it. Mm-hmm  Hiroshi Lockheimer is this is something for you Stacey Higginbotham. Oh, yes. I'm excited about that piece  The news and one other so so all the nest develop. What does this mean for nest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  man, that is what you know, Kevin and I were talking about this this morning because  it so the story is a little bit vague and I I trust these people because I used to work with them and they're just  Like total awesome reporters. So Dan and Lena discovered that  Google is moving their software platform people for nest over to the Google  Team and they're under Hiroshi Lockheimer who's in charge of all of Android  so  Brings up a couple questions one  Does nest is it just going to be like selling hardware and?  Is it just the existing nest hardware because it sounds like the nest software people are going to go into Google's kind of Google  Home and some of the Google  IOT hardware and we should see actually some cool stuff coming out from them  And then the other question I have is man. What does this mean for alphabet in this whole subsidiary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly my thought if they could just poach  The best talent from one of the alphabet companies and put it in another alphabet company

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's well good. Well, maybe that they're saving it. So think about what we've heard. We've heard fiber having issues

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've got they fire half of the staff at Google fiber  They cut down to 500 employees and basically they're looking at wireless. They're abandoning it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so if you look at that you look at the costs that you know  I'm trying to remember the revenue and then the costs was at one point two billion that other has cost them in the last year  Was it the last quarter? I have to go look at the financials  It's been a lot of money  The moonshots the Google X and stuff. Well, so moonshot there was complaints about moonshot Astro Teller went on saying look  It's really difficult  So if you take all of these pieces together it feels very much like  Ruth Porat's efforts to like bring financial accountability some to some of Google's craziness  It's possibly working but not in a way that feels good to the traditional Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ethos are the bean counters in charge?  So  There's a lot so you we've a lot of points here. Let's start there's a lot happening. Let's start with nest itself  so the nest platform team is now part of Google and  the senior vice president of Android Hiroshi Lockheimer is  Now running it a combined group that will work on Google Home  Google what do they that's the that's the echo. That's the echo, right? That's the echo and  Maybe more  You know Google home stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think that makes sense because when nest back in 2014 when Google bought nest the idea in  The smart home was all about like these individual devices and making them smart and having them eventually work together  independent kind of of people and  What's been the reality and that didn't that failed for a number of reasons  The reality now that everyone's glomming on to is personal assistance and voice control for the home  So if you think that way you're like, well screw this everything else is smart. That's not working out for us  Let's pull everybody in we need to combine smart connected devices with the personal assistant  Because if you don't have any connected devices  You still want to have the value of a personal assistant and people will still buy into that product and then they'll gradually add

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Connected devices. That's my I agree. I think that's a it's a wedge into the  Automated home because it's so hard to do everybody, you know  You and I have both spent a lot of time banging our heads against these systems that don't talk to each other  They they have security issues. It just isn't easy to do it. You have to be a mains main a big enthusiast to do it  So you can just say insane. Here's a wedge. Yeah, but here's a wedge. In fact, maybe that's why  Sonos made that big announcement. We'll get to that though. I don't want I know I know I know I know  But you see we're squirrel we're being bad. Yes, let's get back to okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  God you know what I need I need a stack. I'm gonna push that on the stack  But I need a I need a  Life o stack no a FIFO stack because it's all out of order now. All right, so  That's what's going on with nest  The speculation is maybe is it over for nest or maybe I mean if you don't if you don't have your developers  What do you got? What do they pay for?  3.2 billion. Yeah. Yep, and  You got the developers you got the brand

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I  Google wanted to buy drop cam so much of the so there and that was a separate deal  But so much of that hardware makes sense still so Google with drop cam  For example got a lot of imagery that it can use to do  Artificial intelligence and machine learning around computer vision  So that's a good deal  if it it could also divorce the hardware and ship that into the world but if you really buy into the value of the internet of  things being software then  They basically spent three point two billion dollars and they just bought brought the people they spent that money on in-house

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was an acquire little did we know  Yeah  Alright fiber we had a by the way a really good triangulation on Monday with Dane Jasper  Who's the CEO and founder of Sonic net which is one of the best?  Independent internet service providers. They are putting gigabit in a lot of places. They put 10 gigabit into our studio  He was talking about Google fiber and the fact that Google's backed off it looks like a Google fiber  It's very expensive  To put the the fiber in the ground, you know $500 a foot something like that  It's hard to make enough money to make it worthwhile  Google bought webpass. That's one way to make more money because web pass wires office buildings or I'm sorry  Not office buildings apartment buildings, which means it's a lot less expensive and you get a higher density of potential customers  He said though, which I thought was interesting  Because there's  Sonic is spending money to trench and put in fiber. There's they're they're fibering San Francisco  And he said all we need to do  We obviously need to do it in a fairly populous area  But let's say an example would be San Francisco if we can get  20 to 30 percent of the people were going by we're passing by with a fiber to sign up. It's economically viable  It's a long-term bet takes you years to amortize  But what his other bet is which I think is very interesting is it's more than internet TV and telephone  That really the fiber is going to empower a huge  Growth of new technologies all kinds of new technologies. We don't even know about and he's betting on that such as

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Such as AR VR  You're gonna need the low latency of fiber  You're gonna need I think what's gonna happen is we're once we have better connectivity out to the very edge will have  Much more peer-to-peer network architectures. Now. This is a grand technology shift. This is not gonna happen tomorrow

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where you make money though and he's willing to make a long bet on this kind of grand technology shift  IOT is another one, of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's lower data rates  But yeah lots of it in its services in being and this so the question then becomes though  What happens with net neutrality when you start thinking along these lines, right?  and I am a huge net neutrality band not because  Only because we live in a duopoly kind of right now exactly and that's what we talked about

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Competition heals these problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right because you are gonna need specific you're going to need defined levels of service for different

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Applications he says the way to do this if we were to go start from scratch and you know  I mean, there's lots of barriers to this is to have  Municipalities put in infrastructure put in fiber  Just as they put in you know water and power and gas lines  He says we've done this before with rural areas with rural electrification and telephones  but but have federal and local government put in the infrastructure and then make it open and  Say anybody who wants to use this infrastructure  Can and the hope is you'd have many many internet service providers many other providers  Sitting on top of these does that happen anywhere in the United States? Oh, yes, it happens in  Chattanooga and then Amsterdam actually check is a bad example because they're a municipal monopoly. Yes, that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there a municipality in Stockholm as well Sweden does it too and the BT BT in a sense is like that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Install but open I think there are yes small towns this whole concept of municipal internet  The problem is of course this, you know municipal Wi-Fi shot down  And I mean this is but it does solve  I think it's the only solution that I can get my get behind because government involvement in the internet is fraught with peril  That's the only way you can enforce net neutrality  what would be ideal is a situation where you didn't have to worry about net neutrality because  So many competitors, you know, you wouldn't have to worry about bandwidth caps. You wouldn't have to worry about zero rating  You just had any cut you need true competition the fact that we have a duopoly  In this country in almost every case monopoly in many situations is not good and that's really the problem  Well, okay. So I was hoping Google would do this  I was hoping it's in Google's interest that we Google was never going to open it up though

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So back all the way back when they announced Kansas City  They said they were gonna open it up and people like Dane got really excited  I remember talking to him about this and then like probably eight months later. They were like, you know what?  We're not gonna open it up. It cost them to be ours. It cost them too much. I  Don't know if it cost them too much or they just realized that  This was a huge undertaking and they weren't gonna get there. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it comes down to Google deciding is this a business we want to make money in or is this another one of those?  Things we do that promote internet usage free and open internet usage because we make money on the internet in general  And the more people use it the better we do and I think that they went at some point from oh  This is just good for us in general too. We got to make this a business and this is the latest blow  The bean counters once again said it's not a business  Fire half your staff and stop looking at trenching and start looking at wireless

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So an alternative point of view I'm not saying this is right  But Google achieved a lot of their what they went after when they did fiber. So when they launched fiber  It was not like some  Utopian vision of better internet everywhere. It was a calculated shot across the bow of the right cable providers. And so  from just from them offering free  50 megabit per second service  In Kansas City to people maybe it was 50. I can't remember  Their lower tier  Comcast boosts their Internet Essentials program for poor people. So you saw that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Definitely a public benefit. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean, but you saw them push the providers to boost their speed  So Comcast is now, you know gonna offer gigabit everywhere  Which that was a that was really a doubt to see if that was gonna happen and how long it was gonna take

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but they really only  Cut prices to match Google and markets where Google's in competition with them, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the pricing is not gonna be like they're still gonna have some insane pricing, but  We're gonna have the actual physical network still so right now you and I might have to pay a lot more like  $150 for a gigabit whereas Google's charging 70  But some of us are gonna pay and because of network effects  We're gonna drive new applications that we need those gigabit speeds and then other people will pay to upgrade, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way Dane said that that's part of the problem is  Adoption rates in fact Google's rate in Kansas City was so low  They they had hoped to get 5 million subscribers in the first five years in six years  They only got a couple hundred thousand  That's according to the information which had a great scoop on this  And it's costing them a ton  You mentioned that 1.6 billion dollars that Google lost on other bets that was by the way in the first six months of this year  Okay, most of that was cap most of the capital costs were going to Ruth poor at Google Fiber  So it's it's an expensive proposition that's not turning around  And I was rooting for my know  Well, and there's people. Oh, so here's what Dane says  Geeks want it most people just go I got what I got internet. I don't I'm fine. I know you know, I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a marketing problem it's not just a market I mean that so people would have signed up in some cases for Google Fiber, but  your telco operator or your cable operator also was like  We're gonna lock you in we're gonna give you this great rate 12 month contract, right?  Contracts are kind of a way to get about that  Yeah  but also I  Mean I'm the champion for like futuristic causes that are gonna fail in the first time and then come back around in five years  And gigabit is definitely one of those things we need it  Yeah, we do but you're right. Most of us are like, I mean  Most of us don't have Wi-Fi internet that can go up to a gig  I mean I talked to people who are like man my cable provider promised me 300 megabits, but I'm only getting 50  I'm like my god. What Wi-Fi are you on? They're like, you know  B

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah  According and this is a great article by Kevin McLaughlin and the information which is a subscription only it's paywall  But I subscribe to Jessica lessons great stuff the takeaway alphabets decision has shifted school  Go fiber rollout to one based on wireless reflects a compromise  among senior executives at the company the founders  This apparently came from Larry page had grown unhappy about the cost  fiber chief Craig Barrett  contemplated leaving  Because the alphabet restructuring  He felt really hurt  Barrett was told to bring the current cost of Google fiber to customers homes to one-tenth its current level  One-tenth it would take him at the rate. They're going the six cities  They're in 40 years to make back this the cost of putting the fiber in 40 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it depends on how you handle the debt on that stuff  I mean right cable cable companies are never profitable their cash flow. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Think if there weren't wireless options, this might be a different story  But I think it's also that Larry said well look why are we digging trenches?  Wireless technology is really coming along  Just as we used to say when you take when you have build a house put in cable put in Ethernet  Now we just say that was waste right because it turns out wireless. Everybody wants Wi-Fi  So maybe that you should still hardwire your TV. I agree. I hardwire everything I can  It is a lot better, but  Maybe that's what's going on. Maybe but there be this thing  Well, okay, but Wi-Fi is gonna be good enough and boy a lot less expensive and the next generation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what's happening with the spectrum above?  24 gigahertz that Google's playing with for some others some drone stuff and some other the loon is it loon is that Facebook's I always  Get those two computers. No  So that's cheap  It comes in these massive hunks massive megahertz chunks so you can send a lot of data over it  So it it makes sense. I mean this is relatively new technology  Why would you ignore it Google would never ignore new technology just because fibers cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You want to get geeky listen to the triangulation with ding because it really got geeky  One of the things you talked about is some of these some of these new technologies are at six to sixty gigahertz sixty six  Mm-hmm, and the problem with that is at that  At that frequency the oxygen in the air yes kills you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you can't bushes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just a oxygen just a hair so  so there's all sorts of  but I  you know any we talked about 5g as you've talked about on this show and how it's a marketing basket of a lot of different technologies and  I but I do think that progress is being made in those areas  But I agree with you sure would be better to have glass if we could get it well, we'll get it out there because to deliver

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to take advantage of those  upper giga upper megahertz and gigahertz  spectrum  They're actually you have to do fiber to like  Access points is basically what there are some if you're a cellular network. It's like a femtocell or picocell  Or a DAS those are all you have to have fiber capacity for backhaul because you  Eventually everything has to come back to the internet and eventually it's got to go over a pipe  So we're gonna see it get deeper and deeper into the to the edge, but just not all the way yet because that's too expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know I feel bad for is people who lived at places like Portland, Oregon  Who were told they were gonna get Google Fiber?  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they pulled the rug out from under them. I'm in Austin. I don't have Google Fiber yet. I never will

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you know Verizon did the same thing Fios is not rolling out new homes. I mean, I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm telling you this gigabit wireless  Fingers crossed. Yeah, it's gonna be good. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know why I'm I'm reluctant to jump up and down is because I've been burned before WiMAX promised  Much the same thing we that was gonna be the new  Hotness it was gonna replace wires and it turned out to be a horrible flop and so I just I was just always skeptical about

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know what she's saying lately  But I know as of you know roughly a year ago Susan Crawford was dismissing the idea that wireless was the salvation that right  You know we have to fight for the for the wired line

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Susan is dismissing wireless because of you still have to have fiber capacity  That's right and WiMAX their problem was there was a couple problems, but the big problem was the economics  We're never gonna work out with the tower sighting. Yeah, no, I understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just saying that it's not unusual when new technologies come along to that  They're touted as a savior the Messiah and then turns out. Yeah  Just another John the Baptist  I don't know. I don't know if that's an apt analogy or not to be honest. I have to check my Bible  Let's see anything else to say did we pop the whole stack on that cuz that really tree. Oh no Sonos. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So exciting I've been waiting  Me too, except we're gonna wait some more cuz it's not till 2017. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I thought you meant on the show I was like I can't talk about it yet Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you can talk about it, but but it just don't get your hopes up too high yet  Sonos is going to work better with Spotify. Although it's been my experience  It works pretty well with Spotify now when I'm listening to Spotify and Sonos  I can't already go to my Sonos my Spotify app and control it. So I thought it might look like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's hold on  Because I if I play something on Spotify  I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just gonna play a handoff so you can be listening in your car and then say hey play it on my Sonos now  I'm home. That'll be nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right here  Let me let me make my okay. I'm sucking terribly at this y'all

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All my buttons are in a different spot. All demos fail. That's the problem with demos  Okay, I did say 2017 but I guess if you're a beta Spotify beta tester, which I was I mean a Sonos beta tester  Which I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You might get that sooner. I'm not sure it's gonna happen in October. Okay, so if you let's find oh, here's my camera  So can y'all oh no, you can see my yeah, see how yeah, so you're gonna see your sonos

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You see your sonos. Yeah, right. So that's I mean, I think that's actually really handy  And I currently get get it the other way and I guess everybody using Sonos does  If I'm using if I'm listening to Spotify and so so it's just recently added the cape by the way  We should say Sonos is a it is a speaker system wireless powered speaker system  That's designed to bring music and audio to your whole home. They sell a variety of different speakers subwoofers and  Sound bars as well as the one of three and the five which are varying expense and the whole idea of these is  That you can put them in every room  They connect wirelessly to each other and then to your internet and it brings audio  synchronized audio to every room in your house or any individual room or separate audio in each room and  people who spend a lot of money on Sonos as I did and apparently Stacey did are deeply in love with it and  Want it to become the next Amazon echo frankly, we want to talk to our Sonos

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right and have it be the voice of our home because a lot of us have it in each individual room

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, if there's one thing wrong with the echo, it doesn't have a great speaker

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well that and you can't multicast it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, mostly that is there any reason that Amazon doesn't API that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They did they have there are  It's out there you can do Alexa  There's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a little web test for it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could put it on a Raspberry Pi they've open source software you could totally do it and I presume that they're I mean echoes  I mean Amazon's probably working with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sonos on this. Oh, yeah, this is a strategic deal. Now. What would be super so the Spotify stuff comes in  October with official in 2017. Oh, I thought the the Spotify was in

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  According to wired the public that was a terrible article  Yeah, the the public beta update to the Spotify app comes in October not to the Sonos  But to the Spotify app with the official launch in 2017 and then the echo  Update will come as a free echo device update in 2017 that will allow you to control your  Sonos via the echo echo dot or Amazon tap you'll have voice commands to tell echo what's to ask echo?  What's playing to navigate tracks to pause and play they don't I note say to get it to start playing  I'm hoping that that will be also there and we have mentioned before the play five speaker  The newest play five speaker has a microphone in it, but Sonos said no that microphones not good enough  It's not as echo as an amazing microphone array  The one in the play five speaker is just for the configuration tool that lets you set up your speakers to match your room

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which if you have an iPhone you should do yeah, the true play is really cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it mean because often in a lot of cases certainly mind the Sonos speakers are on the floor sometimes on their own shelf  They're all over the place. So you do want to tune them if you can I  Don't know though. Did they say you I'm sure watch this more carefully. I've only seen the wired article  Did they say that I would be able to say hey echo?  play  Elvis Presley on my Sonos

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe so. Okay. Yes. Okay. I believe that's part of the plan and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, because that's what I want that's what I want

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, that's I mean, that's what everybody wants. I want to be able to say  You know play Kanye West

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Amazing on my kitchen and it'll happen. I like Elvis you like Kanye. It's pretty much the same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  very close

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kanye is the Elvis of our generation  I think so. He's the late Elvis at this point. He's late. He's fat Elvis. Yeah fat Elvis  Late Elvis is that dead? I mean, yeah, that's the late late  So good. I'm excited. I I mean, I hope that that's the case. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Am kind of upset that it's taking this long though. I'll be honest. I'm like really guys  But it sounds like they're gonna make a whole new set of commands which is good and  Hopefully if they actually open that up it creates a lexicon for you to play other things as well  because  Right now they've got the API for like lights and that sort of thing. So here's the video. This is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dane Wilberding

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a joyful life and  We think it's about the notion that there is a flow of feel-good moments and Sonos exists to enhance each one of those moments  And we want listeners to feel good. We want to bring okay get to the point  Just to cut to the music. Okay, and we think the playing music ought to be super easy  Yes, shouldn't necessarily involve your phone or your laptop and that's what's so great about voice control  Ah is when you can use your voice to bring joy to those moments to play music  Then you can do it without breaking the flow of everyday life. She's talking to her Amazon and Sonos share one very  We created echo and Alexa and when we did it we created this extraordinarily magical experience of far-field voice  We committed to adding voice to Sonos in a way that is meaningful to people at home  It's really about innovating for everyday life  Alexa play the music here are your recently added songs and they're coming through the Sonos

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's coming through the soundbar. I  Like this this is what you want  So what's interesting is if you do those commands today the  Alexa will play the music the echo play the music  it's looked like they didn't even have to say anything about Sonos you're just you're just using a  To play to Sonos

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why do you even need the Amazon hardware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because you need the very sophisticated array microphones built into is that it okay? Yes. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But so there's no reason Sonos couldn't build that microphone in and then just use the API. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's an interesting  Problem is there people like Stacey and me who spent thousands of dollars on our systems

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm gonna run out so they have to make it backwards compatible enough for us

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is perfect, right?  Because you know we also happen to have a few echoes lying around  The dot see I use the dot right now with a Bluetooth a very nice pair of Bluetooth speakers and that works great  You pair to the point to the dot  Into the Sonos play five that I had right and that worked so you could do that  So it's just a little step more to controlling the whole system  I  Wonder if it will have access to all of that because the other thing that Sonos does really well is integrate with  You know Apple you can't you do Apple music on an echo it integrates  Music it integrates with all of the you know Pandora well, I guess Pan or in Spotify  You could do with the echo, but you'll be able to I hope  Do all the other services that that Sonos has done a very good job of lining up. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't know about that that feels like a bigger strategic alliance than I would think  I mean cuz why don't you  well  they have in because Sonos works very closely with Apple for things like the  bringing Apple into the Sonos app for example, and I can't see  Amazon being able to circumvent those kind of deals just by being like Amazon just makes a deal to control the Sonos

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then the Sonos does what it does

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you have to choose on your Sonos  The way most of the Sonos controls in the homework right now, they only control like your Sonos playlist for example, so  It's unclear to me is if I could play  Spotify like  So physically controlling the Sonos and telling it to do something is different than saying  Sonos go out through the web and find this particular music service that I've linked you to  Okay  I'm optimistic that I can control Spotify and Pandora because I can already do those through both, right?  But I don't know if I could do it through

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll be nice to do Apple music and title and Deezer and all the other services Sonos has every I mean they have all you know  Just amazing variety of services you can use with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean their goal is to be an internet connected speaker. So that's a lot of people listen to our shows

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Via the echo  Saying using tune-in it'd be really nice if we could have that then go I bet you could do that  You think it'll go anything we could do on the echo we could do on the Sonos. You're saying not the other way. It's right  Okay  We'll see. Hey, it's better than nothing. I  Love it. You could say now play that in the living room. That is cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so knows also so I'm just gonna say this because I'm a huge fan of Sonos so just deal with it  They also did a bunch of deals with a bunch of connected home companies like Crestron Lutron  Control for all those fancy ones and there's gonna be like new controllers for Sonos and I wanted to show you  Because I love the Lutron stuff and they're gonna have a Lutron controller for Sonos and it's gonna look okay  This is actually a light switch. I can't tell if you all can see it. Yeah  So take the light switch thing away from it and in the middle  This will be like a little audio remote for your Sonos and I think that's kind of fun  Because you could have it by your bed and like just be like stop pause whatever and those will be like 50 bucks as opposed to  Originally Sonos had like 350 dollar controllers. What's great is this is all competition driven, especially because Google announced its home

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's it's all about like, okay quickly  Let's get this deal with Sonos going before Google's home does  Now the on hub router can control your your hue lights. I'm glad they finally gave the on hub something to do  First step into the autumn home automation. We thought it was all about in the first place  I thought you'd enjoy the  The news Jeff that the our favorite  Margarita Vestager  European commissioner has decided that Ireland undercharged apple  And oh by the way apple you owe us 13 billion euros. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I've argued all along in these tax fights that they're having is it's up to the governments to set to to negotiate and figure it out  Oh my and leaving the companies in the middle is unfair to the company and you know, whatever  One company owes another company she owes there shouldn't be anything special just because you're a technology company or an american company  If somebody gives you a great deal  And then you take your business there as a result and you don't like that then negotiate with that government  But there shouldn't be a retro. I mean if if the EU wants to fine ireland

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fine, but to go back and say oh by the way apple your deal with ireland is null and void because we say so and you owe us 14  That's the EU 14 billion euros  So and you owe us 14 that's the EU for you  By the way, let's get her pronunciation right here. This is how you pronounce it  According to a danish person  Oh, it's not playing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Could you say that again?  No, that's wrong how come how come she says

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, there we go

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's really become the face  Of the anti-trust of the antitrust stuff at the eu and I got a good email from  One of our viewers george wood who lives in who's a norwegian despite his strange name  And he said you got it all wrong, let me see if I can launch this oh I gotta log in I never get those emails never

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't get everybody. Nobody complains. No, no, they never disagree. They never  Just send me send me tweets to say you're you're right jeff you're completely right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  in fact jeff takes those fights to the street because and and and and and to facebook  Because I see a lot of a facebook post from jeff. I don't see the original  I see I see jeff going. Yeah, uh suck it  No, not that bad no, no  Actually, what you do is you gently mock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The doubters. Well, if no, no what I mock what I have to admit when when they really when my critics can't spell. I love that  Bad grammar  Can't I can't spell jeff. I went in through like a five round with this guy who made a different grammatical error every single time  And it was obnoxious of me, but I enjoyed it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, let's see apple's tax bill  uh  Let's see if I can find this  I was a bit disappointed in your initial response on macbreak weekly to the uu's enforcement of its tax laws  I grew up in the u.s. Love my iPhone and ipad, but i'm also a citizen of sweden  I'm, sorry not norway and I don't think you always understand how the eu works  I hear a lot of  Perishment of the eu on twig and I would certainly agree the right to be forgotten is just about the most idiotic idea  Okay, so it wins me over there. All right  But as far as this tax thing  The concern is about member state corporate tax rate dumping  If ireland can drop its tax rate then everyone else will do the same ultimately and everyone will end up the same  But at a much lower level in our welfare systems which require higher taxation than the u.s. Will be underfunded now  Presumably how did it take them this long to get this well  But also ireland made that decision because they made a calculus. I think  That we're going to get  employees employees and taxes  Yes, eight billions in taxes  That we wouldn't get otherwise that would go somewhere else. So we're giving them a cut it happens here  It happens in petaluma. Well, you want to move your business to petaluma? We'll give you a tax break

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I was going to say though it feels kind of like stadium financing back in the day for here which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's me. That's a proven  Uh boondoggle boondoggle. Yeah, it is it is because you can argue the money back. That's the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that that's kind of I mean, I know that ireland what were they like the green tiger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was that what they were? It was the irish miracle. They turned themselves around

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they got because they they also they were low cost spoke english with a lilting wonderful accent  And had a good tax structure. They got  Employment and that's the way tax structure works. That's your tool to do that. Now if you join the eu  Then there ought to be one  Clear law for anybody in the eu and you can figure it out  But to come out I agree to come back after the fact  Um  And and and go after in essence so far one company now if you're no

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apparently not offices there. This is not the first company that they've gone after on this  so, uh  The other companies have also been uh, uh ding starbucks was the first  Oh, yes amazon and google are probably next in line. So  This is and and he's george says this comes out of a major scandal about luxembourg  actively helping companies from from other eu countries get out of paying their taxes  And this was especially embarrassing because the ec president was john claw junker who had been prime minister of luxembourg  Who was very controversial in many sense?  So there's a sensitivity to this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I my view here is very simple  It is the government's job to set tax rates. It is government's job to negotiate among countries  And it is company's job to reduce  their costs for their shareholders  um  and so  Yeah, if they find tricks to get money  I also wish that these companies didn't leave their money offshore that it came to the u.s that they can pay their taxes here as american  But it's a lot of what to me on wrong. It feels wrong. Well, but but that's not it's not up to the company to decide  What's right wrong? That's what laws are for. That's right. The governments have to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh george concludes with and I and I've now come around to his point of view if ireland was wrong giving apple a lower tax rate  Rather than retroactively taxing apple. I think the eu should fine ireland for not following eu regulations  And going forward apple should be forced to follow the same tax rate as everyone else

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and apple might well decide that it doesn't make any sense anymore to be in ireland  And that's something for ireland to then fight about with the eu  Well, and that's why you give them the breaks to get them into ireland in the first place

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or bahamas or delaware or the double dutch sandwich believe the bahamas would give them a tax break lots of people use the bahamas as haven

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Canary islands, right? I was gonna isn't uh jersey. There's some tax havens right off the coast of britain

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hamilton everything's legal in jersey. Yeah the other jersey  The isle of jersey isle of jersey where all the cool data centers are and by the way excellent fudge  Really?  Mm-hmm. We have a we in jersey. We have a because they have excellent cows jersey's a dairy very well known for its dairy  we have a  Fan who's handled in the chat room is jersey fudge  And he brings us  He brings us fudge from jersey

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the channel islands does jersey do chocolate too?  I don't know if you have great cows like switzerland. You have great chocolate well

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The jersey's great chocolate years though. That's true. There's more to chocolate than just the cows  There's the cocoa beans  Well, there's fudge has cocoa in it too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some of it does yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I well i'm now craving some real jersey fudge to be honest with you  I'm getting cheese. I would I would kill for some peanut butter fudge

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Peanut butter fudge, you know, there's a there's a problem. There aren't enough peanut butter cookies  in the world  Because I think they crumble too easily  And so in the jars you very rarely see peanut butter cookies. They're right. That's my great weakness

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're hard to find they're rare. You need to get mrs. Jarvis to make some for you because  You can make yours

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not hard  It isn't i have a connected device that could help. Oh stacy. You don't know me  Jeff my first cooking disaster was with peanut butter cookies really and I overcame that really. Yes. Tell us about it  it I instead of doing like a teaspoon full of baking soda I read a  I think there's a quarter quarter teaspoon or something. I read a quarter cup  So I dumped it in oh and i'm like going and cooking and  Then I ate the batter and I was like, oh, this does not taste right  But I baked it anyway, and let me tell you a lot of baking soda those cookies they get big it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was it was not a good thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So stacy, I've got a very similar story. I was trying to  appeal to the heart of a young woman through her stomach  And my mother used to make pumpkin chiffon pie  So I figured I would make pumpkin chiffon pie and I get the recipe from her  And it says, you know one and one quarter c period canned pumpkin and I thought well that's how inaccurate is that one?  One and a quarter cans of pumpkin  Who says the cans are all the same size? But I said all right, you know mother knows  I put in a can I put in a quarter can and then of course at that moment I said  duh  cups cups not can  Can  Pumpkin so then I had to go through all kinds of mathematical calculations  This is before google folks to figure out how much and luckily the pumpkin of course congealed as a lump  So I could calculate how much I had to measure to take out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Well jeff, I have the best product. That'll be my thing next week. It's a cooking thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a cooking thing. Okay. Watch this jeff. Watch this. It's not hard  You get some butter butter you get some sugar some packed brown sugar

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And of course peanut butter and i'm using the cream style you can use chunky if you want  By the way, you don't want any fancy peanut butter here  I don't want to give the brand of the one i'm using but it's really fast to find in the supermarket. In fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know that wasn't really a pun. Anyway, you see how easy that is and then you mush it up  And then you and then you bake it and you and you know, there's one trick  You use a fork  On the top oh chill it before you bake it. Yes, and then you use a fork on the top  To mush it  And then you know, that's how you know  It's a peanut butter cookie  And to do you know why you know why you can't find them because they're everybody ate them  Yeah, they're delicious. They're the best. They're the best  Not a fan  But if you're not now if you want to make some molasses cookies, i'll eat those

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, those are delicious, too. I love cookies. I do too. What's your favorite kind stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh chocolate chip cookies  Oh, I like regular oatmeal  With raisins? With raisins and walnuts. I just trust raisins. I like walnuts  I know people don't like raisins and walnuts, but I like raisins and walnuts

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My wife acts as if raisins are our conspiracy from some evil force

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They are! She's right! They're dried grapes. They're delicious

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're fine on their own, but in a baked good they're like biting in the head of a cockroach or something  No, they're great. They add a chewy texture to a crunchy chewy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh my god  Oh, no a cookie. Well that raisins is like a kiss without a mustache  I'm okay with that, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like oh I see your problem, Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're gonna do a new show this week in cookies  Ah  All right, uh, what else do you want to talk about you want to talk about facebook and whatsapp whatsapp  Pleged promised swore when facebook bought them before facebook bought them even yang kum the founder of whatsapp  We don't know anything about you. We don't want to know anything about you. Your privacy is safe with us now  Well, maybe not so much  It was a dumb promise to make  It was yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although i'll bring it back to the nest thing for a minute because nest was separate from google in part because people were worried about the data privacy  And they promised the same thing good point. So good point when those guys come over what's gonna happen?  But on this one, did you also see infusion cashmere hill wrote a really interesting story about a psychiatrist?  Who's a good story whose friends were or whose patients were being submitted as her friends? Yeah, that was so weird  Yeah  And they they were  One of the thesis was it was either location based or it was based on phone numbers  And if it's based on phone numbers, all those whatsapp numbers could be really  Scary actually it was the the thing that was really scary wasn't so much that facebook was suggesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That her patients friend her or that she friend her patients, but that they friend each other  And of course one of the really kind of fundamental tenets of  Of psychiatry is psychotherapy is that you know, the most therapist's office  They have separate entrances and exits so that patients don't have to go to the hospital  So they have separate entrances and exits so that patients don't see one another so you have an anonymity  So this is terrible. I mean, I wonder if that could be a HIPAA violation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be an interesting way to like enforce privacy around stuff like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She says I haven't this is cash mingles article. I haven't shared my email  Or phone contacts with facebook  So it wasn't any matching somehow  Well could be I mean they all live near each other but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could be they all end up at the same place once a week

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Most of her patients are senior citizens or people with serious health or developmental issues  But she has one outlier a 30 something snowboarder  Usually facebook would recommend he friend people his own age who snowboard and jump out of planes  But lisa told me he'd started seeing older infirm people  Such as a 70 year old gentleman with a walker and someone with cerebral palsy in his  Friends suggestions. He laughed and said I don't know any of these people showed up on my list  I'm guessing he's they see you  He showed me the list of friend recommendations. And yes, I recognize some of my patients  She sat there awkwardly and silently to let him know that his suspicion was correct  Would violate her duty to protect her patients privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So  Yeah, and if it's if it's location, I think there's a story related to that about it is a small town

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She lives in a small town  But I think it's more than a story  Go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no. No, I was just thinking if it's location based  I think there have been complaints in the past about people like at a a meetings getting  Friend requests from other people who were at the meetings because they attend them, you know once a week together

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She says I have patients with hiv people have attempted suicide women and coercive and violent relationships. This is absolutely  horrific  Um she these people are being outed and it's more than just being outed one of her patients said  Yeah, I was suggested somebody I know he's your patient because I see him in the elevator  But that's all she knew she didn't have his name and phone number now. She does  Oh  She had not friended as appropriately she's a therapist she had not friended any of her patients on facebook's  She haven't even hadn't even looked up their profiles  She doesn't have a guest wi-fi network at the office. They're not all using the same network

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It could be because facebook is using location information from the smartphone  In fact the therapist could be right the therapist thinks this because they all were at the  using their facebook on their phone at her office  And then so was she or maybe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She does facebook just has to have your phone number because then it can use that to find out where you like

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Facebook says it only briefly used location for friend recommendations in a test and it was just at the city level  I mean, there's so many issues with doing this kind of granular location as a suggestion

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So facebook saying they didn't do this. How else could they not? Yep  How else could they? Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They didn't tell her  well part of the problem is because the therapist can't put  her patients in touch with  Uh cashmere right she says i've tried to help lisa figure out what could be causing this  And reached out to facebook about the case unfortunately due to health privacy reasons lisa was not able to put me in touch with her  patients directly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If with the patient's permission you could

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, she could she could ask or would you mind if this report? I don't know  I that I wouldn't do it if i were a therapist. Would you mind if this reporter talks to you?  I wouldn't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, as long as the conditions were anonymity, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and lisa's name has changed too. Here's what right so here's what cashmere thinks and I think she might be right  Uh, she says this is my guess all the patients probably have the therapist's number in their phones  So an algorithm analyzing this network of phone contacts  Might reasonably assume all these people are connected a phone by phone number  So you you know if 10 people have the same phone number, maybe those 10 people know each other  We should see if they want to be friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you're facebook, let's say that's true just for the sake of it. Let's say it's true and usually it works dandy  What kind of rule set do you come up with inside facebook to prevent this kind of thing from happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I don't think it would work dandy. I mean like if i'm in austin i've got my heb pharmacy number programmed into my phone and probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  600 other people who live in my neighborhood have the same thing rule number one is no businesses no business phones  Okay, right eliminate that  Clear because for that very reason and for this reason  Uh, if it's a if it's a business phone number then it that should not show and what if you have your shrinks cell phone number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a phone number because a doctor I mean  So therapists watch or my what about your sources like all my sources have my phone number, right?  And that's a bad if you started outing them

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That would be terrible  How do you stacy well I leaked you some information about google. Oh, I think there's some information about intel. Oh, isn't that sweet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  small world small world

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go inky dink

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't I don't run facebook on my phone. So I don't have the app on my phone and I don't go to it on my phone  but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's you are so anti-social stacy. No google plus no facebook. Geez  Well, you see now nice on twitter  Twitter's safe like I said, you're so anti-social

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Twitter's safe lisa's medical lisa's the therapist pseudonym for the therapist lisa's medical community has started recommending that patients concerned about privacy  Not log into facebook or other social media accounts at medical offices or even leave their phones in their cars during appointments  What in other words don't bring the phone into the waiting room?  But well, that'd be horrible. That's likely good advice. Are they guessing?  We don't know that and the reason this is really germane  And I think the reason cashmere hill did the story is because whatsapp is tied to you by your phone number  So if whatsapp starts telling facebook your phone number even if you've hidden it from facebook, oh now we got problems  Good cashmere hills does such great work. She's so good. She's better than the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate it when people say on twitter. Well, I don't usually agree with jarvis, but he's right this case  uh, you know, I don't always agree with cashmere but but uh, uh, she's really good. We'll get her on the show if you want  Yeah, she she yeah you ought to yeah because she's she does good work in privacy. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't have a carpet square. Jarvis told my darvids where I do have this though. This is the automatic

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the new automatic pro very exciting  We talked about the automatic before it's a device that plugs into your obd2 port. What's that you say?  Well, every car built since 1996 has a diagnostic port. That's what obd stands for onboard diagnostics right below the um,  steering wheel on most cars  On your driver's side you probably looked at it and said oh that's just the technician that the dealership plugs into that  No, you can too. It's completely legal. It's  It's great  You get all sorts of information from the car and the automatic shares that information via bluetooth to your phone  So you pair your phone you get the automatic app and now when a check engine light comes on you can check the app  And it'll tell you what's wrong and even shows you nearby repair facilities  So when stacy got her fender better this morning the automatic could have said  I know where you could get that fixed actually if you get in an accident  You're going to want this new automatic pro because this is this is the same automatic with an additional feature  They've built in 3g  connectivity  And I mean this is something jeff's chromebook doesn't even have and here's the best part  It's free  Five for five years no subscription fees  Five years free connectivity over 3g  So what does that mean?  Well your car can tell you where it is at all times not just when you're in the car with the app but at all times  Got a teenager driving your car. You'll know exactly where they are  The car also can help you in a crash  The automatic pro detects severe accidents and trained responders can call for help even if you can't  This is really sweet all the features of the existing automatic  But now with 3g, oh so much more you can even link it to your nest thermostat  Or your echo you can actually ask your echo. Where did I park my car?  It will you can do that. It will tell you  Oh, man, I love this  Uh, I I all my cars have automatics  On the obd2 port yours should too and right now we're going to make this  Particularly appealing because the automatic pro which really is nice. They didn't really up the price as much  It's only 129.95  But you could take 20 bucks off right now when you use the offer code twit  20 bucks off but do use the offer code at checkout twit  And uh, then you're gonna get a great deal on this and every car should have one if you've got teenagers  So many valuable ways you can use the automatic  When stacey when your daughter gets a little older, she's gonna be driving. It's only she's not gonna be driving because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Automatic cars will be there or automatic six years you think in six years  She'll be 20 21 by then. Yeah, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my god  I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spit it out stacey spit it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, so this is ifa week

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why aren't you in berlin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why am I not because I I decided to spend a week with you guys  No, i've been traveling so much. I wanted to stay home because i'm a home buddy  And my house might fall apart while i'm gone. Who knows?  Okay, so ifa is now like I feel like ifa is about to be like the mobile world congress  um  Mobile world congress used to be like this huge mobile show  And then the internet guys kind of came in ifa used to be this huge home appliance show and now the internet guys are  Kind of coming in if it was a radio show

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  telefunken  ifa was originally a show for  radios  Like like cathode ray tubes and stuff. Yeah, it was started in the 20s in berlin. It's a very old show  And it was uh for radio sets, you know listening to the radio before television

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't even imagine. I know  Yeah, but as my daughter says about radio wait, you mean you have to listen to something when it's on  So  A bunch of people have been making really cool news. So for the next couple weeks  I'm going to bring you lots of cool devices. You're going to love it. This this week's device is  Philips hue who makes the light bulbs they're connected light bulbs. They've announced some new light bulbs  So you can now buy a normal a19 which is your normal light bulb  You can buy that in a tunable white in a color  and you can now buy  a br 30 which is the down light the can light in a  Color which was always the case and in tunable white for 40 and i've been waiting for those for a month  But they also introduced this it's a motion sensor and it also has an ambient light sensor in it  So I have now here they come I have this way to control my philips hue lights  I have this way, which is a little button tracker or a button switch that is by my couch and then I also have  A little light switch. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it comes out. Can you use them all at the same time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I have to pick one but if I turn it on with this I can turn it off with this  so  The reason there are so many is because when you start getting into the crazy world of connected lights  You're suddenly faced with like holy cow if I turn my lights off at the switch and i've got connected bulbs  They no longer work  So you have to have a lot of different ways to control them that makes sense for you  So this is the wall switch you can screw this in on your wall and it's nice or you can use just the remote  And the motion sensor is cool for rooms like i'm going to probably  Put this in my closet or my little bathroom that has a hue light in it and you can set rules. So  If I go into my bathroom during the day the motion sensor picks it up and is like bright light  But at night after i've gone to bed, it'll be like that's smart. That's so smart  so  You can do it with the philips hue  Or you can do it with another product from a company called stack lighting which has all of those sensors integrated into a light bulb

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so  See, okay  So I have a lot of philips hues and I have the base station. I haven't ever hooked them up again  Should I replace this with stack lighting?  Would it be better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is this is the case both hue and stack require a hub. So I didn't want to do two  You know two hubs. That's just right. I mean, that's got like eight crazy. That's crazy for normal people  So if you're already a hue fan  I would do this  Okay  But you have to be careful in any room that you put the motion sensor in  You either have to have a connected light switch or you cannot touch the light switch again  Oh, and yeah, and that means you have to train your family  Unless you do this and this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought three ways were hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why the internet of things is so fun don't touch that switch  So so yes  But if you have the on hub because on hub just did the deal with philips and I don't have an on hub  So I haven't played with that  But now you don't actually have to have  You don't have to have the hue router. No, the on hub replaces the  The base which means I bet in someone with an on hub. Let me know I should get one  It's well kevin has one i'll i'll make him go look at it  Because it's zigbee  Light link profile. So if you've got anything using zigbee light link theoretically, you should be able to control it from the odd hub  But I don't know if that's the case without testing it because sometimes they're not all copacetic but  Did that make sense or was I just speaking in weird was I speaking in tongues again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's right on the edge of what I can understand  Sorry every every third or fourth word makes sense  I'm sorry you guys there was something about zigbee and on hub and it sounds like baby words babies. It's it's so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It means that the on hub router speaks the same radio protocol

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right that the hue router speaks or the hue hubs. We thought it had zigbee in it. What's that? 802.1114?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something yes, but zigbee is weird because  A zigbee radio does not necessarily it's not like a wi-fi radio because zigbee runs software on top of it for like  Lights and security and sensors and god only knows what so zigbee is no guarantee that something will work together

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have this vision that your your husband and your daughter have a room a safe room in your house that mom can't touch  I'm not allowed everything in here works. Okay, the actual physical switches  dials  Mom can't ruin this room

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, so if you do no, well my daughter do you do this stuff throughout the house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Wow. It's my my husband is really patient  patient and long-suffering but  Yeah, it's fun. He he actually likes like the motion sensor in the bathroom, dude. That's awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's like, yeah, I do like that. But you know, i've had that for years. I mean that's  That's a motion sensor. That's called a motion sensor. It's not that complicated

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The fact you can dim the light because I had been playing with it before he released

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like it that it knows what time it is and doesn't blind you in the middle of the night. I like that  Yes, we had we had a hotel room. Where are we staying?  Uh, oh in san diego at the coronado and we had a hotel room with a motion sensor  Bathroom light and it would just randomly turn out in the middle of the night big bright light  It's like this is not a good solution  Yeah, but if it were like a kind of a  Muted be a little light blue is not a good choice should make it sunset red red is a good choice  Yeah, blue wakes you up red would be good. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So those are those are my things. Um, I like it  So if in you can see them and this guy makes a really satisfying click ready?  Oh, yeah, I love that. Oh and it's pisio it powers itself. Okay, that's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, so you don't have to have batteries or plug it in it just generates its own electricity every time this one generates its own electricity  Didn't phillips do something like that for the hue didn't they have a that's what this is. This is a tap

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I basically showed you all three ways now that I got to yeah, I have a phillips tap too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have that at home. Yeah, I have it. You know what? This is how valuable all of that is  I i've had it in the new house for three years without screwing them in  It's like man, i'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love my hues. I used to have a light in here that would flash when my garage door opened  So I knew when my husband was coming home. Oh, that's cool. Okay, you just you gotta get creative and I think that's  That people you gotta have to be kind of insane. I guess you also have to have a garage door opener that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  internet of things enabled and you have to have it  You must have a very elaborate if this than that recipe file. I well I have a lot but I also

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have done robots and stuff through other hubs and I mean in part not all of this stays up it  like  Things move around and recipes fail and go away. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah  Okay, I like that idea of a light flickering  when the garage door opens

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I I had I had if someone if a certain person texted me my lights would flash different colors

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room said i'm not an early adopter. I'm an early buyer  Okay, that's actually pretty accurate I buy this stuff I try it and then I go. Yeah. Well, okay  I'm gonna okay. I make a pledge to you tonight. I will put the hue light bulbs in my office light bulbs

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And okay, and they're great there. Yeah, you can use it for an amp. Are they colored? Yeah. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have the right. Oh, yeah. I don't have the new hues. I have the old hues the original rgb

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what happened here a question  If I got the hues, I know this is all about me. You can't program them to to do lighting in your office

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well would it make a difference with how awful I look on this camera? Yeah, you could take you could tell them

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What color to make it? Oh, so I could I could do the daylight thing with them. Yeah, you could do the daylight thing

Well, for instance, the gear is not lit  So we have to put the brick we have bricks to put up behind the gear  And then we can light the front of the gear right now. It just bounces off the back wall. It's so bright  We can't use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so  We could set up a thing. So when people tweet something  The gear could light different colors

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, it's using twitter you hate it I know that no I could do that we actually we made and we have probably still  a uh annunciator that would have tweets  Going across so you don't have that that's risky  Don't like that. I realized  That is not going to work very well. No, no  I mean if you took my notifications are fine. People are very nice until you put them on the show on an annunciator  Then they wouldn't be nice anymore. Yeah, that may be true. Don't don't tempt fate or my friend. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not tempting. I mean like

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no. Yeah, just yeah  Yeah  We can have it rotate and the more tweets we get the faster it goes. How about that?  I'm telling you the table should just rise. I think that would really just be awesome
