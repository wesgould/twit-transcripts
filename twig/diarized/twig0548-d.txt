He's got a new computer, that's pretty.  You gotta bet backwards.  It's like a-  It's not backwards, it is a flip.  It's doing the downward dog.  Some strange yoga posture.  Yeah, it is sort of a yoga pose.  That's an HP flip.  And what I really like is the magnetic pencil  is just adhering to the screen.  Yes, this has a stylus.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you know how I love to use a stylus.  He's our creative guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jeff Jarvis is also here.  Mr. Jarvis is blah-dee-dah-dah,  bah-de-dah, professor blah, blah, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would shake your hand,  but I'm not gonna shake your hand anymore.  I'm not gonna do fist bumps.  We're just gonna wave.  Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the whole thing, as far as I'm concerned,  this whole coronavirus thing is BS.  And I, I for what?  Actually, I have this in my pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you getting ready to go mow the lawn or something?  Because that's about how that's good for it.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an N95 mask.  This is approved by the CDC.  How did you get it?  I had it from the fires.  Very carefully.  Because it does have, it is for particular filtering.  So if you're doing a lot of sanding,  but I think it's also, I mean,  it's on the list of approved masks for coronavirus.  San Francisco today declared an emergency  due to coronavirus. Really?  But yeah, but it's not because we have any cases.  It's because they want, they want to get the money now.  By the way, in the great white North  where there is no virus,  because no virus can survive, Matthew Ingram is here.  Filling in for Stacy, who is off doing a job today.  Hello, Matthew.  Hello.  Yeah, San Francisco.  Well, and one of the things that concerns me a little bit  is the big RSA conference is going on in the city right now.  IBM bailed, big, big booth.  They were a platinum sponsor, they bailed.  Lisa was going to go today.  I talked her out of it.  But we are going to after party for last pass this evening.  In fact, if you're going to be in the Bay area  and you're not infected,  you might want to head over to  Bernd and Branch. Thanks for that qualifier.  Actually, before you go, go to twit.tv slash blog.  Because there's a form to fill out.  It's Speakeasy, that's the coolest old bar in San Francisco.  And you need a password to get in.  They're doing the whole Speakeasy thing.  So that starts at seven o'clock tonight,  if you're in the city for RSA, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am going to go get some Chinese food tonight.  Just to show solidarity,  because what's happening all around.  People aren't going to Chinese restaurants?  Right?  Like that's the problem?  Yes, it is.  We had a session at New Mark J School.  For community media and yes,  restaurants and stores are empty.  It's a huge problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, the CDC is saying it's probably pandemic.  It's spreading out to a number of countries.  It qualifies to be a pandemic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, there was a really good letter today from the,  or speech, talk from the head of WHO that said no.  I tweeted it, it's up near high in my Twitter feed.  That said no, it's not a pandemic yet.  And use of the word pandemic causes panic,  potentially has more implications, economic and otherwise.  People can go overboard and no, they're not ready to use it.  They will use it when they need to.  But he also pointed out that there were some number  of countries where they have not had a new case in a week  and some where they haven't had a new case in two weeks.  Oh, that's good news.  For discontainment.  So take a deep breath behind the mask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, Italy had 100 cases in the last 24 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they canceled Carnival in Venice.  That's good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Matthew, you're going this year, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  I'm gonna go unless they cancel it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So who is the WHO director general said the epidemic peaked  and plateaued in China between the 23rd of January  and the 2nd of February has been declining ever since.  So this is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If we believe the Chinese authorities,  which is always the issue.  Well, but the WHO is in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The WHO is there.  Yeah, the WHO is there, yes.  The World Health Organization.  14 countries that have had cases have not reported  a new case for more than a week.  And nine countries have not reported new cases  for two weeks.  So it does sound like maybe the worst is over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's hope so.  Sudden increases in Italy, Iran, and Korea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're deeply concerning.  So yeah, I don't know.  The what there-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a very good, so I just read this obviously  when I tweeted it, but it's a really,  it's sobering, but it's also sober.  Yeah.  It's a good letter from the expert  I would trust above all else.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says, don't mistake me.  I'm not downplaying the seriousness of the situation,  the potential for this to become a pandemic.  It has that potential, but potential doesn't mean  it is a pandemic at this point.  Oh, I've seen other virologists say it's time to admit it.  It's a pandemic.  And not to scare people, that's always the fear,  but to get people to be prepared, which is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tweeted another piece that said that if the top 10  airports in the world would, I don't know how you do this,  markedly increase their hand washing hygiene,  it would increase, it would decrease spread  by a quarter to two thirds.  Wow.  I don't know how you do that.  Do you put sinks out of the airport?  You do it like you do it on cruise ships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's what they do on cruise ships  because of course they've had lots of problems  with norovirus as a cruise ship.  It's a contained environment.  What do they do on cruise ships?  People are touching food.  They put hand sanitizing stations everywhere.  They stand out in front of the restaurant  and they say you sanitize.  Some cruise ships have been on cruise ships  that have sinks and special areas for washing your hands  at the entrance to the dining room.  Really?  Yeah.  So they take that seriously and then-  Doesn't this give you pause  when you're on that cruise ship thing?  I've never been sick, not once.  Never got sick on a cruise ship.  In fact-  Who would give me pause if they didn't do that?  Right.  That's a point.  And when you first leave on the cruise,  most ships, they will serve food.  They won't let you touch anything.  Sometimes that changes after you've been out  to sea for a few days.  I suspect now because of coronavirus,  that's the case across the board.  Just the whole trip, they don't let you touch the food.  There's ways to do it.  I wash my hands like crazy.  I very rarely get sick, so maybe that's-  I wash my hands like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't use hand sanitizer, right?  I think I'm gonna starve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, in fact, well, they say washing's better  than hand sanitizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is, absolutely.  But just in that moment.  I don't like shaking hands.  I'm not Howard Stern-like.  But after I shake someone's hands,  I just kind of think, what's on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It never crosses my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what else?  And I've talked about this before,  and I learned this in Japan.  You're a much more sane man than I am.  Because in Japan, they don't have paper towels  in the men's room, so everybody carries a handkerchief.  I carry handkerchiefs with me, and I don't touch anything.  I wash my hands, I dry on the handkerchief to save trees,  but then I use the handkerchief to open all the doors  and get out, and I don't really, I never touch anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't have paper towels?  What do they have?  Nothing.  Lid and towels?  You're expected to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're expected to carry a handkerchief.  It's eco-friendly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Separate from the one you blow your nose into, I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the other pocket,  even though he just reached out the same side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this side, the right side is the washing hand.  Color-coded.  It is color-coded.  The white one is for either blowing your nose  or giving to damsels in distress,  because these are really cheap.  You can see that it's actually coming apart.  When you stay in hotels,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  do you put towels along the carpet on the way?  No, no, no, I'm not Howard Hughes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or Howie Mandel.  Yeah, or Howie Mandel.  No, I'm not that crazy.  I try not to think about what hotel rooms are like,  and I never ever do that ultraviolet light thing.  That's just crazy talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember reading the number one contact surface  is handrails.  Yeah.  Yeah, in airplanes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In subways.  Who is it?  Naomi Campbell, who basically wears a mask and bunny suits,  I guess she flies a lot,  and then she brings with her a seat cover  for the airplane seat.  You can't sanitize cloth,  but she does wipe all the surface down.  And the key when you wipe surfaces down  is to leave it wet for 30 seconds.  And Johnny Jed, who's germaphobic,  he says you gotta wipe the luggage,  the overhead luggage handle.  Everybody's touching that.  And he says never touch remote controls in hotel rooms.  I said, what are you nuts?  You're a germaphobe.  He says never, I never, I put it in a plastic bag.  And I said, oh stop it.  And so he did, and he got sick.  Oh man.  This is my fault.  Don't listen to me, ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I've been to cheaper hotels  where they have remote controls  that are advertised as germ resistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  What's it made of?  If you gotta say that.  Everything should be made of silver.  Anyway.  Silver?  That was actually, yeah silver's German.  Don't they put silver in your underwear?  I didn't know that.  Didn't Mack Weldon, our sponsor, have silver?  Not mine, I don't think.  They use silver threads,  because it's handy.  I see I keep touching my face.  Don't touch your face, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ever.  At least not for now.  Until maybe after you wash your hands,  you can touch your face,  but then you have to wash your hands again.  And your face.  And your face.  In the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who's on first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's a...  It's my new mask, the Bane mask.  Actually there is an IndieGoGo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder whether Skype will be able to take the load.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see the masks where you can print your face  the lower part of your face?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because I'll verify this,  when I wear this N95 mask,  I can't unlock my phone, but it's on.  You just enter the thing.  You touch your phone?  Yeah, nobody else is touching it.  It's just me.  My Android has pressure.  Don't touch the surface and then touch your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, the Android gestures will be,  you hold your phone three feet away from you,  and your gesture, it'll be okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at this.  This is an IndieGoGo for...  It's a plague doctor mask.  Plague doctor masks.  Those creepy bird masks that the plague doctors wore  in the middle ages.  They would stuff them with herbs and straw,  thinking that the airborne particles  from a plague victim couldn't...  Don't joke on them,  because of course it was rat bites.  What a bunch of morons.  What a bunch of idiots.  But if you want, you can now get an N95  protective plague doctor mask.  Wear that around.  Nobody will think you're weird.  Okay, I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, while we're on the...  So China is having problems,  because everybody's working at home,  the internet's not able to take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We live in dystopian times, don't we?  Imagine if we didn't have the internet.  Yeah.  Well, I was thinking about doing all the shows  via Skype in the future.  In all seriousness,  I was asking the staff today,  should we continue to have an open studio?  Anybody can come and watch our shows.  We have people from all over the world.  People from Germany, and the UK, and Australia, yesterday.  I didn't get a strong feeling one way or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just do a heat scan before they come in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, like they do in the China airports?  Yeah, we could do that.  I don't know if those little things you aim at your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wood-fired oven to get the temperature.  I could just aim at the people.  In fact, I'm gonna bring that to the party.  The numbers are tiny.  Less than the flu.  We weren't that worried about the flu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  There was a Harvard epidemiologist was interviewed,  and I think it was an Atlantic piece,  and he said, one of the problems with this particular virus  is there are lots of people who are infected  who show no symptoms whatsoever.  Takes two weeks to show symptoms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, now 27 days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A guy got it to 27 days after exposure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe we don't have visitors for the next three weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you can come, but you have to be in quarantine  for two weeks before we let you in the studio.  Okay.  You have to live in our basement.  And wear a bunny suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, Mr. Burke wouldn't want you in our basement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not gonna worry too much about it.  I've decided if I get it, I'll get it.  Not everybody dies, right?  That's the other story.  You're all gonna get it.  That's the other story.  We're all gonna get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mortality rates under 2%.  Yeah, that was the Atlantic piece  that said you're gonna get it.  It's just people over 60.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who's, oh.  Oh.  Whoops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, Leo,  men are more susceptible to lumen.  Uh-oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think of it this way, it's a 98% survival rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  Yeah, I'm not worried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As opposed to the flu flu, which is a 99.9% survival rate.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it is a little more deadly than the flu.  It's a little more.  It's a little more.  I never get sick, I'm very healthy.  Oh, you just cheeks yourself constantly, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And here it comes.  Boy, I don't do that kind of crap, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there's no, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Knock some, Leo, for all of us.  Knock some luck, Leo.  I don't believe in that crap.  Knock some, come on.  No, I'm a scientific person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't believe in that.  I'm a superstitious. Would you go to China right now?  Yes.  Do really good deals on airfare.  And hotels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hotel rooms are really inexpensive.  But none of the restaurants are open, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I wouldn't want to go to China, but I don't know.  I would, we're going to St. Louis next week,  we're traveling on an airplane.  Airplanes are terrible for this stuff.  Yeah, it's almost like China.  It's got an arch.  It's China with an arch.  I know, with an arch.  Google is notifying Google I.O. 2020 ticket winners.  It's like the golden ticket  in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Give us a check.  Oh yeah, that too.  1,150 bucks for general admission  or academic pricing, $375.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's gone down, right?  Google is it?  Used to be a little more expensive, I thought.  Oh.  I thought it was 50 dinner right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's tied to the price of a Pixel phone.  There you go.  It's a floating index.  Google in the FAQ says all I.O. registrants  to cancel their registration,  they will allow all I.O. registrants  to cancel their registration up to April 15th  without financial penalty due to COVID-19.  Wow.  That's still three weeks from the event.  May 12th is Google I.O.'s keynote.  We will stream it, of course, live.  And this is what the invitation looks like.  Congratulations, you've been selected.  Are you going, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm not this year.  I'm going to Leipzig to give a talk.  First time I've missed in quite a long time.  Well, watch our stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will.  Yeah, we'll just stream.  I am wondering really if,  so the good news is if this has peaked  and it's going to go away,  then we could say, oh, it's like swine flu or something.  It wasn't, you know, it was a tempest in a teapot.  But eventually there's going to be something.  Yes.  And I wonder what the future of conferences holds.  Maybe this is also this impetus  that will spur telecommuting and, you know,  working at home and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I came across a,  Say again?  I came across a mention of,  I think it was journalists coming back from Asia  that are not in quarantine,  but they've been encouraged to work at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I would.  I don't think that's unreasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My wife today asked what, you know,  she's going to look up and said,  do we really need to stock up on food?  Did she go Trader Joe's and get lots of frozen stuff,  vegetables and things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, just get a bunch of beans.  You can live on beans for two weeks.  I can live on beans.  I can live on beans.  And candy bars.  And water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you allowed to eat beans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am now.  I got off the keto thing.  I noticed how happy he is.  I'm so happy again.  I'm so happy.  I don't know what to think about.  First of all, I did it for exactly a year.  Today is the one year.  And it was good for me.  All my numbers were better.  I lost weight.  I feel great.  But I have been reading increasing numbers of articles  about, oh, it's going to kill you.  You just don't know it's a silent killer  because all that meat, your arteries.  Yeah.  And bone density.  I read another study, it was a mouse study,  but the bone density declined and all sorts of stuff.  So I thought, I did it for a year.  I've got the benefit.  I'm going to do a modified thing where I'd have.  Yeah, you just sort of changed your

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  whole grains.  Your lifestyle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, how was that first piece of bread?  I started making bread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But because I wanted whole wheat.  I don't want any refined.  Okay, okay.  So there's no white flour.  So I'm making my own whole wheat bread,  but I ate the whole loaf.  And it was so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God.  It's not how that's supposed to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, sweet mystery of life.  I found you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was so good.  That is the one recommendation for going keto.  Man, that first slice of bread,  you are going to enjoy yourself.  I have, I did the sourdough too.  Cause so my bread is just literally just flour,  starter, sourdough and water.  There's nothing else in it.  No yeast, no.  Where'd you get the starter?  I made it.  With a little bit of yeast, little flour, little water.  And I just fermented it over a period of time.  We're in wine country.  So there's a lot of natural yeast coming through the air.  And so am I, so I made two starters.  One was named Bernie and one was named Liz.  And I've been watching them go up and down.  Are you serious?  Bernie kind of went crazy.  Did you notice?  Just God bless America.  So no, these starters are great.  They're living things on your counter.  You add flour and water in the morning, you feed them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The old, that's why gold miners got called sourdough.  Cause they would keep a little starter in a leather pouch  around their neck.  You don't need yeast.  You don't need commercial yeast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, there are sourdough starters.  I think Boudin in San Francisco  is 167 year old sourdough starter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a guy who has a museum of sourdough starters  and he got one from a woman who got it from her dad,  who got it from his dad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cause they gain character over time.  That's so cool.  My starter is very amazingly delicious.  It's really good.  And so that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you should be sending loaves to all of your hosts.  Are we gonna get one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't keep well.  You really, that's why I have to eat it in the first hour.  Yeah.  A whole loaf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, a whole loaf.  It makes two loaves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What did you miss most?  Was it bread or pasta or what?  I would eat it with no beans.  Beans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I would kill.  I would kill.  I love beans.  I do too.  Beans, quinoa I missed quite a bit.  There's a lot of, a lot of the, a lot of,  even brown rice is delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you don't eat it for a while, it really is quite good.  I'm so glad you're normal again.  Oh.  Well, we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is your, is your family happy too?  Yes.  Although funny, when I quit keto, Lisa went on it.  So.  Oh no.  Not that she needs it.  No, she doesn't do it.  She does what she calls modified keto.  Which means she can have some ice cream at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm on modified keto too  since I have ice cream at night.  Yeah.  Nothing better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do not eat ice cream at night.  Google removing 600 apps from the Play Store.  This is an ongoing story.  I almost don't read these anymore.  Annoying ads.  This isn't even, this isn't even a malware issue, although.  They just do it all the time, don't they?  They're constantly.  Every week is another thousand.  So why is this a story today?  I don't know.  We know?  I don't know.  Mr. Garston.  I guess the biggest, you know,  so 600 is hardly anything.  But I think what's interesting is it isn't for malware.  It's for annoying ads.  So, you know, like ads show up  when you're not actually using the device, that's annoying.  Or you get a surprise full screen ad  when you're trying to make a phone call, that's annoying.  I agree.  So they're cracking down on that.  They've removed nearly 600 apps.  Disruptive ads enforcement and our new approach.  That's why it's a story.  Yeah, if there's gonna be disruptive ads,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they should be Google ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would it be malware too?  I mean, I wonder how you'd define it.  Well, it depends on your definition.  I define.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It can be.  Yeah, I think it's malware if it's annoying you  and you didn't install it, that's a malware.  But I think technically it's not malware  if you installed something, agreed to it.  And you can uninstall it very important.  Then I think it's adware versus malware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So remember kids, back when we used to complain  about pop-ups and there were pop-up blockers.  Wasn't that annoying.  Now every damn webpage, you end up getting  that much space between the things that come down,  the things that come up, the things that come over,  the things that won't leave,  and the things that hide the Xs.  So true.  It's really awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And when I go to Stacey on IOT  and I sit there for a little while,  I get a pop-up saying,  hey, you really want to subscribe to our newsletter.  But see, I think that's okay.  Let's see if it shows.  Cause maybe it finally.  You probably already got the key.  She knows about this and she said I'm getting rid of it.  Nope, there it is.  There it is.  Hey, there we go.  So is that malware, adware, pop-up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is it?  My favorite is the one where just as your mouse  goes towards the address bar, then it pops up.  So it's on the screen.  But just as you're leaving, it's like, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a good one.  Honestly. That's clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because we're ad-supported.  Salon does that a lot.  Salon?  Yeah, Salon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anytime you start to leave their page,  they're like, oh, here's an ad.  Hey, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Before you go.  That's pretty clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really love ads.  That's what keeps us alive.  We wouldn't be able to do any of this  because we're ad-supported.  We don't ask people to give us money.  It's free.  But I think it's also really important to be responsible.  See, I don't mind Stacey's little pop-up there.  That's not a big deal.  I do, though, think what happens when you get annoying  is people run ad blockers.  And that's gonna be bad.  That's bad, as we know, that's bad for the whole ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, and a lot of pages will warn you  about the whole ad blocker usage.  Oh, they say you're using an ad blocker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know you're taking money out of my kid's mouth.  Yeah, and I get that.  Because Google has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then if you turn the ad blocker off  and it just starts to bombard you,  I'm like, come on, man.  I know you need to run your ad services or what have you,  but there's a better way, right?  There's gotta be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matthew, what do you think?  I think Google's got ad blocking built into Chrome, right?  Now it does, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's a story in the rundown, in the change log  that I actually think is above change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should I take it out of the change log  and do it for reals?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's the one where Google AI is going to stop recognizing  and labeling gender in photos.  Good, right?  I think it's great, yes.  It's gonna what?  Stop labeling gender in photos.  To avoid bias.  To avoid bias, and I also think it just says something  about where society is right now.  We have many non-binary students at our school,  the whole notion of gender and of pronoun  cannot be intuited for people.  So it's time that we just let people be  whoever the hell they are.  Now that's the good news part.  The bad news part is I saw just now,  just minutes ago on Twitter, a woman in the UK,  a black woman who was trying to submit her passport photo.  And it kept telling her that her lips were open  violating the rules.  Oh, jeez.  Her lips were not open.  Oh, God.  And so this is one good step in the right direction  from Google, but boy.  AI is terrible at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  AI is terrible at that.  All you can do is laugh at this.  I know.  It's so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And actually that's not overtly racist.  It's just really bad AI.  It's just bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really bad coding, yeah.  It's a feature too far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it is, frankly, likely that the AI was trained  with a lot of white people.  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what it all boils down to.  Yeah, it does.  The problem is not the AI, as far as the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not enough people trained in that AI.  Yep.  Not enough diverse people.  I thought it was really interesting.  Diverse people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  But the Google story I thought was just really interesting  because it's done for one purpose,  but it has another comment on where we are in society.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why, Google's point is, well, you can't identify  somebody's gender by how they look, obviously.  And why would you try to?  I think that, say they're a person is fine.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Human versus animal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And some people, I can't tell whether an animal or human.  I don't know.  I've had my moments.  You know this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some people do call me a beast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are, you're in beast mode, that's for sure.  I've seen you at the gym.  That's good, good for Google.  That's the right thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of-  I thought that was actually an important story,  so thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of funny though that they're making such,  it's such a big deal.  It's like, well, that's obvious.  If you can't identify something by how it looks, then don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think that not many years ago at all,  advertisers would say, no, no, no, no,  we have to know gender.  We're paying for it, right?  Yeah, because that's marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Right.  And they want to know, they want,  show me a picture of a woman that, you know,  in the kitchen that I can use from my ad  so they need to know,  because that's who they're marketing to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe we should have fewer pictures of women in kitchens.  You think?  In ads.  In ads.  You know?  And honestly, that's a mistake on advertisers' parts.  They shouldn't assume by gender, you know,  what, who they advertise to.  That's just a mistake.  Just a mistake.  But you know, that's going to be the problem  because these aren't necessarily biases.  These may be driven by data.  Well, we just know, Leo,  that 48% of women don't buy our products  so we don't want to advertise to them  or whatever it is.  That's data driven and yet it comes off poorly.  But you can understand the advertisers saying, well.  But it's still business is business.  Right.  Business is business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's building the rates now.  Is it?  What's that?  Yeah, if you buy an ad in people,  which was a predominantly female readership  by the research,  and you're advertising a product that only women will buy,  they kind of discount on that base.  They give you a CPM based on the women you reach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, but again, that the underlying assumption is,  well, I only want to reach women or I don't want to.  Well, much of this is sexist, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  In the old days of newspapers,  there were no real endemic,  that is to say, category ads in sports.  The thing that appeared in sports sections was tire ads  under the assumption that men buy the tires.  And B, men buy tires, both of which are wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So maybe we're doing an advertiser a favor by saying,  it's better you don't know.  They're just people.  They're just people and people buy your products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Advertisers have to put things into buckets, right?  And they want sort of standardized bucket.  That's right.  Just easier.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When I was making ads to show in Costco's and Walmarts,  we only made ads specifically designed for women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?  You made ads?  This is Carson, our producer,  who is now you know why he likes working here.  You used to make ads for Costco?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.  Yeah, we worked at a place a lot of tech TV people  ended up at that made in-house ads for Costco  and other places like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was at a gas station once,  I saw Patrick Norton on the screen over the pump.  Was that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but I have used Luria Petrucci in it  in a couple of ads for Costco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Callie, woman formerly known as Callie.  Yeah, she was Callie Lewis then.  This just seems like it's a trivial day for news.  It just feels like that.  A little bit.  It's just this trivia.  We'll do trying to fool, like this seems to me trivial,  trying to fool Amazon with a banana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So.  That was not my story.  That was mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, let me get a rant out of the way first.  I hate headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon made a bigger camera spying store.  It's not spying.  So we tried to steal its fruit.  So, and this is Sam Moshkovich, by the way,  who's a good friend of the network, been on our shows.  So.  Funny story.  There is an interesting story,  which is that Amazon is going to build  a 7,000 square foot Amazon Go store in Seattle.  It's gonna be a full-size grocery store.  You go in, you scan your phone,  you take whatever you want off the shelf.  They actually have a sign on the cart  that says bag it as you buy it.  You get to the end of the shopping spree,  you pick up the bags out of the cart, and you go.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My first thought was, what about produce?  So that's what he investigated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, ironically, the thing is there's plenty of humans  because who's putting the produce out, right?  But there's just no,  the one thing you're eliminating is check stand.  But that is a bottleneck at grocery stores.  That's when you're done shopping,  you have to wait in line at the check stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a bottleneck in the grocery stores,  but dadgummit, I don't work in the grocery store.  Stop forcing me to check out my own groceries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this one, you don't even have to do that now.  See, we're not gonna make you do that.  You don't check out.  Yeah, you don't scan anything.  We just spy on you.  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm cool with that.  The research shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Grab my stuff, scan in and out.  I'm cool with that, but the whole notion of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Research shows that most people,  most people agree with you,  and most people do not want, like those self-checkouts,  no one uses that.  Yeah.  Yo, I hate them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can get it if I'm just in there to grab a pack of,  I don't know, a deck of cards or something,  and I can just scan it and walk on out and do my thing.  Inevitably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Inevitably, why is a deck of cards in the grocery store?  And?  Okay, a bad example, Mr. Charles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you know, they may sell them.  Bag of chips.  They sell them in Vegas.  They sell them in the grocery store.  There you go.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I clearly have the casino on my brain, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm old enough to remember when people objected to UPC.  I mean-  Those barcodes.  Barcodes and standards.  They didn't trust them at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  But they're so much better than the end human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course, but you'd stand there,  you'd check to make sure.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Folks would check to make sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they put that on the screen so you can look,  and they go so fast.  How can you?  You can't.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you missed it.  Two dollars off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, sure looks fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is it.  This is the Amazon Go store.  Grab a cart, bag as you shop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tries to hide a banana,  which is probably a joke, but I'm not going-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's just a joke.  But here's the interesting thing.  It is true that they have cameras.  There's cameras in the ceilings up here.  I don't know if there's sensors on the shelves.  There might be.  They are looking, you know,  obviously they're going to charge you  for whatever you put in your cart.  But I have to say, I think a lot of the value of this  is the data about what you look at and don't buy.  Or what you pick up and put back.  Don't you think if you're a potato chip company  and Amazon could say, you know,  43% of the people who picked up your bag of chips,  put it back on the shelf, you'd like to know that?  They looked at the nutrition label.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  They said nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's data here beyond what you're buying.  So I think when Sam says surveillance,  obviously that's a loaded word, but in a way it is.  I mean, see, there's the cameras.  They're surveilling the products, not you.  Well, they're surveilling your behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you agree to anything before you go in the store?  Wow, look at all these inference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Matthew, you download the app specific to these stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  And I bet you there is a...  I did it so fast, I didn't even know.  Click through to the list that nobody reads, right?  Right, there's a 56 page...  Amazon Go, let me see if it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So despite the scandalous headline,  which I'm sure Sam did not write,  this actually is really interesting because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, in the story he calls it creepy.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wanna know what grocery stores you guys are going to  that don't have cameras on you at all times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good point, but I don't know if there is...  Good point, Karsten, good point.  Petaluma Market wouldn't be checking out  what I'm buying in the back.  Petaluma Market is constantly surveilling me.  They're surveilling me so I don't steal stuff off the shelf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's different from this.  I guess, yeah, if you didn't wanna be on camera at all,  you wouldn't go to a grocery store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's the store tutorial when you get there.  That's a little diagram.  So they went, not do, and it tells you,  don't pick up anything for anyone else.  Oh, yeah, because you'll get charged.  You'll get charged.  Good point.  And he goes to the restroom.  So this is kind of, you know,  that was really kind of cheating, the test here.  You know, does he hide the fruit in his backpack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like Sam did this last time too, didn't he?  He did.  He did.  He's a serial banana stealer.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they should have him on some kind of list.  He's on the list, buddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's got control groups, what it sounds like.  Yeah, like Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he also found, I almost don't wanna say this  because he had a coat on.  He went into the restroom.  He put the coat into his backpack  and it didn't recognize him when he came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, don't try to fake.  Look, this is a convenience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is, which is.  I give him some credit for trying to do a little bit  of R&D to hopefully make this experience better  and more efficient.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know.  He left an avocado on the table outside of the restroom  and he was pretty sure there were no cameras  in the restroom, by the way.  I'm glad he did that.  And, but left it there.  So he did get charged for that because only fair game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, if you take an avocado  and leave it on a table somewhere,  you should be charged for it.  Well, robots have to go get it, put it in the bag.  Responsible for that avocado.  That's your avocado, buddy.  What you wanna do with it after you pick it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How does it know, how does it know,  like how many, how many,  there we got a picture on the screen now of cookies.  How many strudels you pick up?  Albert doesn't know how many cookies.  So the cookies are in a stack.  There's three cookies high, right?  You take one or two.  How the, is it the weight?  How the hell does it know how many cookies you took?  There's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's gotta be a camera.  That's pretty, that's pretty.  I'm sure there's like a plato card inside there  melting the camera.  There's still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He also said that in some cases  when he had a complicated thing,  most times the receipt comes in immediately.  Sometimes it took two hours.  So you imagine there's some room somewhere on earth.  Somebody's looking at it.  Where people are replaying the video.  Oh, you're reviewing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, at least initially for sure.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said it took four hours for him to get the notification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a good, thank you, Sam,  for doing the, during the work.  Skynet above the stroopwafels.  Don't you love stroopwafels?  I love those things.  Holy cow.  We started buying stroopwafels for our staff.  I was gonna say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't seen them here in a little while.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a special little Dutch thing.  The little chocolate cookie wafers thing  that you put over your coffee when it's hot  and it kind of softens it and the caramel softens  and you eat it with your coffee.  Oh man.  I have not had a stroopwafel by the way.  It's.  Ever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've been missing it.  All that pleasure comes next to this.  No, no.  There they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Not doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're a little bit of goo.  Not gonna do it.  Not gonna do it.  I don't think it's chocolate.  I think it's caramel.  It's caramel.  It's caramel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  Well, you see my ignorance.  Speculos.  Oh, I do like speculos.  Okay, I admit I had a little speculose butter the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speculos.  If you're ever in New York.  Mr. Kevin, you're killing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  United is changing its cookies.  And people are mad.  I am too.  Who is?  They're gonna keep the stroopwafel,  but there's another cookie that I like  that they're getting rid of.  And Twitter is enraged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How is it that I'm the fattest guy in the panel?  And you guys are eating all this.  I just, I think I got a bad roll of the dice.  I got some damn good genes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know that.  CNA.  Gosh darn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Minor Hugo Boss.  If you go to New York,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  go to a place called Waffles and Dingy's.  Hugo Boss.  What's a dingy?  So a dingy is a thing that you put on the waffle.  It's not a dingy?  It's a Dutch word for whatever you put on the waffle.  I hadn't heard that word.  So you can put speculos on there.  You can put Nutella on there.  You name it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, you know what?  This price for avocados, 49 cents.  That's a good deal.  19 cents for the stolen banana?  That's only if you leave it outside the bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They charge you more if you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, he says, this is what they say I bought.  But it's not the point of it.  He left it around the, he left it by the way.  He bought a banana and avocado?  He's on a list, buddy.  That's how you get on a list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  19 cents for a banana is not bad, though.  That's a great deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, and half a step.  That's about normal, but that's a dang cheap avocado.  That's a real cheap avocado.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think at Starbucks,  they charge you a buck for each banana, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, something like that.  So what you should do is buy them here  and walk them over to Starbucks  and sell them to Starbucks.  Sell them back.  Or have a little standout front.  25 cent bananas here.  Get your 25 cent bananas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's always been money in the banana stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's banana arbitrage.  It's banana arbitrage.  Buy low, sell high.  Oh my God, what are these people doing to themselves?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How did you pronounce that, Matthew?  Waffles and what?  Dinges.  Dinges.  Oh, dinges?  I thought it was dingus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's something else.  Oh my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dinges, yeah, it's highly recommended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It feels like.  If it's Dutch and it's a G, isn't it?  Deges.  Deges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Deges.  Not in that particular word, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not in that spot, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dismiculant linguistics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I honestly think, as soon as he said it, I felt like,  Matthew's saying this with such confidence,  he's actually gone to Holland to get the words.  He was saying it with confidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  He's going off the accent of a New Yorker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, true.  I feel like he asked somebody on one of the canals  in Amsterdam, he said, how do you say dingy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the trustee in Canadian just believed him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook is going to ban something, thank God.  They have standards misleading coronavirus ads.  They're not gonna allow people to sell cures.  Oh wow, now they've got some standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come on, that's freedom of speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Freedom of speech.  Freedom of speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now we've got another story on that farther down.  That's not breaking the first,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's not breaking the first amendment  because it's commercial speech or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  True that, well, they have a right to have one,  they should decide to take one down, in my view.  They're not the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they can actually do whatever they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They can do whatever the hell they want.  Tech platforms are not bound by the First Amendment  and the appeals court rules,  the obvious ruling, the First Amendment  and the first of the government.  We've always known that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  PragerU lost one, yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  PragerU sued saying you can't.  Jesus.  Yeah, it was YouTube.  Oh, YouTube took him down and PragerU said,  first amendment.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's for show, so they can act like victims.  Trump campaigned just this afternoon  and sued the New York Times over a column.  Oh really?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a ridiculous lawsuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I'd be the judge, I'd be so upset.  Is there any recourse for a judge for frivolous lawsuits?  Oh yeah.  Oh sure, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just like slap.  And I don't know, you can make them pay  the other party's legal expenses.  I don't know if there's anything any further.  I think you can go out to the lawyer too  and their certification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can strongly reprimand them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a XKCD on this.  Of course there is.  There's an XKCD on everything.  This one, yeah, I was gonna say,  it seems like it has everything covered.  Russell Monroe leaves no stone unturned.  Here is his cartoon on free speech,  public service announcement.  This is funny, they actually had to go to court  to find this out.  The right to free speech means the government  can't arrest you for what you say.  It doesn't mean that anyone else has to listen to your BS  or host you while you share it.  The first amendment does not shield you  from criticism or consequences.  If you yell that, boycott it,  have your show canceled, pray for you,  or get banned from an internet community,  your free speech rights are not being violated.  It's just the people listening think you're an a-hole.  They don't wanna hear it.  And they're showing you the door.  Is there an XKCD on section,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that explains section 230 in four boxes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can ask Russell, Randall to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the alt text on that one?  The alt text.  The alt text is always funny.  I can't.  Oh, I never knew that.  Oh, wow, you know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, hold on, I'm trying to get.  Yeah, there's a joke.  There's a hidden joke in the alt text almost every time.  It popped up and then it went away.  What do I do?  Hold the mouse over.  I'm so impatient.  Stand on your left leg.  I'm so impatient that I can't leave the mouse alone  long enough for the alt text to pop up.  It's not popping up now.  It popped up a second ago.  Let's try it.  Let's go out and come back in.  I can't remember where I heard this,  but someone once said that defending a position  by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession.  You're saying the most compelling thing  you can say for your position  is that it's not literally illegal to express.  It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not good yet.  I didn't know about the alt text.  I didn't know that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had no idea, Matthew.  Did you find that by accident or by a trick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's probably well known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, someone told me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's fantastic.  I interviewed him on the late Lamented Triangulation  last year and he is great.  He has a wonderful book.  Was it called What If?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, Tim, is his name.  Is he funny or just wry?  Wry.  And funny.  Is he funny?  I was gonna say, I thought he was funny.  Did he make jokes?  Mm-hmm.  Did he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  Speaking of funny, another Facebook story,  the one next up, I put that one in.  I giggled for quite a while.  Which one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook quietly cuts off.  No.  The filters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A reporter accidentally,  TV reporter unwittingly turns on Facebook filters  before going live.  Oh, jeez.  Well, what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty funny.  Oh!  Oh, jeez.  He got the stock face.  So, he thinks he's streaming to the channel.  A dumb weather report.  Because he didn't wanna use.  So, he's got a hat and sunglasses that aren't real.  He's got a barbell.  He's got a space on it.  You think he didn't know it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My dad is brilliant.  You think he didn't know it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  That says WLOS.  That says WLOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that Greenfield?  I don't wanna believe, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wanna believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, I know.  It's almost too good to be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  WLOS is near home.  Is it Greenfield?  Is it near home?  ABC 13.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe that's Greenville, Sacreville.  He's got googly eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's definitely snow.  We know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, you think he's like, he put on,  so can you do this by accident?  Like you put on Facebook Live,  you go stand on the other side of the camera  and accidentally you hit the face mask thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Considering it's happened to a Pakistani government,  Oh, I remember that.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Committee meeting.  Yes, yes you can.  This is hysterical.  Isn't that beautiful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wouldn't someone have told him?  Like, did he not have an earpiece?  He's responding at the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's saying, did I have something on my face?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, but like the first time it happened  when somebody did not have a head.  I love the dumbbells.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's staring at the phone just doing his reports,  saying, oh, snow, it collects on the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's lifted dumbbells.  And then a hat comes on him and then a beard.  The wizard one is the best.  The wizard one's definitely the best.  I like the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Follow up to the story.  Why so serious?  Mistakes were made, but news 13's Justin Hinton  reminds us to laugh it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Well, at least he's only a weatherman.  Only a weatherman.  Oh, I love this.  He's got a, they darken him and have a flashlight.  A flashlight, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you imagine-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They should do that all the time.  Viewers at home would love this.  Oh, I'd watch.  It's much more watchable.  I'd watch this all the time.  Carson, can you push that button for the rest of the show?  Is there a, do we have-  I really do not have that button yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're working on that.  Mr. Kavan has something over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want that button.  I can do the face mask button.  I got that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that is the news cat, the station from back home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.  You should ask your mom if she saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I will be following up.  Do you know Justin?  I know she knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The hidden guy?  We mentioned, I think, did we mention that  the Oracle-Google battle has finally got,  made its way to the Supreme Court on appeal.  And shortly before the president tweeted about it,  oh boy, Larry Ellison had a fundraising dinner party,  he raised a bunch of money from Silicon Valley.  Guess who was there.  Yeah, the president was there.  And the next day he says, you know, Supreme Court,  you know my buddy Larry Ellison in Oracle?  I think he should win.  I think he should win that one.  Now I normally would say, oh, the Supreme Court  would not read Twitter and pay attention  to what the Twitter chief says,  except then Justice Sotomayor said,  well, in fact they do.  She wrote it in dissent.  The Supreme Court ruled in favor of means testing  of immigrants before they come to the United States  in a party line vote.  And Sotomayor, who was in the minority,  wrote a dissent that said,  hey, I just want to let you know.  They're just, they're doing what the president,  the president told them what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well then she should recuse herself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, the other ones should recuse themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Trump told her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trump said recuse yourself  because you're not under my influence?  Yes.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Brilliant.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know we laugh, but it's.  We laugh because we're not crying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing is I stopped, I don't read his tweets anymore  and now I didn't even know, I missed that.  I missed that follow-up tweet.  I don't know, where do we stand with Huawei these days?  How does the president feel about Huawei?  Do we know?  Not a fan.  Not a fan?  Does he know them?  Google is telling Huawei,  okay, you can sell your phones with Android,  but do not side load Gmail and YouTube  onto your Huawei phone.  They say it poses a significant security risk.  We were talking about whether we should get  the new Huawei Mate Foldable phone for review  and I said, well, let's not  because you can't buy it in the US.  But on the other hand,  it actually looks like a really nice foldable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That thing that, heck, last year  is the Mate X was very, very nice.  Very nice.  Goodness, that's so nice.  Huawei makes great phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had a P20, I thought this was the nicest thing ever.  I did notice that when I first booted it up,  it said, can we send all your data to China?  I thought that was a little odd.  I'm not joking.  It does, in fact, have a kind of blanket.  You know, we have access to everything on your phone thing.  I did ask the Huawei people.  I saw the Huawei PR person and I said,  hey, what about that?  She said, no, it all goes through Boston.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they said Germany.  It goes through Boston.  Goes through Boston to Germany.  Great, Germany to China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who doesn't get it?  So Huawei, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huawei can't use the Google version of Android  thanks to trade restrictions.  And Google is prohibited from working with Huawei  on new device models.  This is actually a Google support article  or providing Google's apps, including Gmail, Maps,  YouTube, the Play Store and others.  Is that you?  Yes, so Ray is telling me about Huawei.  Thank you, I didn't mean to.  Nice work.  Yeah.  I have a story about that, by the way,  we'll get to in a second.  The Play Store and others who preloaded download  on these devices,  but Google says we've received a number of questions  about the new Huawei devices launching  and whether Google apps and services can be used.  We want to provide clear guidance.  They say it's a security issue.  Side-loaded apps will not work reliably  because we do not allow these services  to run on uncertified devices  where security may be compromised.  So they say we're not gonna let it run  because we don't know what the security status is of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Once you turn off the guard, then you're vulnerable.  Who's the, we did a story I think two weeks ago,  the game guy who wouldn't put the game up.  That's the same thing with Fortnite and Epic.  Fortnite, yeah, thank you.  So he was arguing that Google was all evil  because Google was warning people not to load it.  Well, because Google always says don't side-load.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is going a step further.  They're saying don't side-load our stuff.  Yeah, that's a difference.  I mean, Gmail's safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, because again, it's the act of side-loading.  Once you turn on the ability to side-load, it's on.  And anything can come in.  So you've ruined the protections that the phone has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm glad my phone just went off because there was, yes.  Because there was an interesting study  just done by Northeastern University  and the Imperial College of London  about speakers, smart speakers.  When speakers are all ears,  understanding when smart speakers  mistakenly record conversations.  They took all the major smart speakers, including Cortana.  Nobody uses it.  What's Cortana?  That's the...  Microsoft, that's the video game.  Oh, that was sad.  Oh, that was sad.  He's a Windows guy.  Is that the video game?  He knows, he's seasoned.  It's in Halo.  And it's in Halo, yes.  I thought so.  That is sexy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So there's a Google Mini, there's a Harman Kardon Invoke  which runs Cortana, there's the Apple HomePod,  and an Echo device, a couple Echo devices.  They did the second and third generation.  And then they put them in a box  with a really hot light pointed at them and a camera.  And then they played 125 hours of Netflix TV shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The interrogation light.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They played Gilmore Girls.  By the way, the two shows that really triggered  a lot of activity with the assistants  were the Gilmore Girls and The Office.  And they think it's because there's a lot of dialogue.  Mm-hmm.  So they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People talk over each other too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So one of the things they said is,  look, key findings.  These devices, we found no evidence  that these devices are constantly recording conversations.  So rest assured, they're not always listening.  The devices do wake up frequently  but often for short intervals with some exceptions.  The average rate of activations.  Again, this is not because you said the wake word  but because they were watching TV.  Is between 1.5 and 19 times in a 24 hour day.  HomePod and Cortana devices activate the most,  followed by the Echo Dot Series 2,  the Google Home Mini and the Echo Dot Series 3.  So roughly once an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're not recording your conversation.  They're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just waking up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they are recording when they activate  and whatever conversation follows the activation.  And they said several cases,  the Echo Second Generation and the Invoke  would activate for 20 to 43 seconds  after hearing, thinking they heard the activation phrase.  For the HomePod and the majority  of the other Echo devices, six seconds.  That's a huge difference.  Here's the pattern on wake words.  The Google Mini activations occur  when the dialogue includes words rhyming with hey,  like a or they,  followed by something that starts with a hard G  or that contains all, like cold or told.  Examples include AP girl, okay, and what?  I can work.  What kind of, okay, but not?  I can spare and I don't like the cold.  All of that makes perfect sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can spare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why I love researchers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All of that makes perfect so much fun.  I say AP girl multiple times a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AP girl, well, but apparently the gossip girl,  that happens, I guess.  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  For the HomePod, of course, with hey or hi,  followed by something that starts with an S  and a vowel or something that rhymes with re as in Siri.  Faith's funeral?  Faith's funeral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  So if you were gonna invent a human sound  that doesn't sound like a word  that would trigger these things to turn on more reliably,  can you imagine what that sound might sound like?  What?  German?  It sounded like a cough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  German.  Unless you're in Germany, in which case.  I got it, I got it.  Yeah, unless you're in Germany.  Like, shouldn't you, correct?  I can't even say it.  So this, I just, it baffles me  why these companies don't let us say  what our own activation words could be.  We should get to say our own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, why not?  Because they've gotta have 87 versions of them.  Because they wanna control them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did it on the Modo X five years ago.  Yeah, that's right.  Because they wanna control it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Facebook is now paying people, it's on there,  they'll pay you a big $5.  It's too powerful.  To record your voice  because they're trying to get a larger audience out.  I would pay good money if I could tell my Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to say, okay, Struppwaffel.  I love our chat room.  That would be awesome.  And unless you're in Holland,  I don't think it's gonna come up a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nope, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe you could say Struppwaffel Funeral.  That would be good.  Nobody would ever say it.  Credit to MashedPotato in the German.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  MashedPotato, you got it.  So funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, I mean, researchers, right?  I just liked it that they had to watch  125 hours of Netflix and then they repeated it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.  No, I was just gonna say I appreciate them doing it  because here in the Google side of things,  it makes perfect sense when I look at scenarios in the house  and those little chimes just pop up  in the middle of a random conversation that we're all having.  All the time, it just happened here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and he's so raised reading me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm thinking like, well, what did it?  And I think back to what one of us said  and it did sort of sound like the trigger word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember a story, I think it was a while back  and I think it was Siri,  but it somehow recorded a conversation  between a woman and her husband  and then emailed it or texted it to someone.  Do you remember that?  And when they explained it, they said,  yeah, it misheard the trigger word,  then misheard record this,  then misheard send a message,  then misheard, it was literally like five commands.  It's not highly likely,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but if there's millions of activations every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Each one of those case statements failed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like stroopwafel, that would be a very good.  That's awesome, well done chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sympotical pineapple, that would be another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ginges.  That's why you should be allowed to do your own  because you could make up something  you know would not get heard.  A Google bomb.  Maybe they don't think people would be good at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's also like setting,  how many people actually do change settings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, but they could have it in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've mentioned this before,  my Modo X was help me, I'll be one, Kenobi,  and that was a really good trigger word.  It never got false.  You just did the test

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and okay stroopwafel doesn't work,  but hey stroopwafel does work.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Hey stroopwafel.  Hey stroopwafel.  Hey stroopwafel.  Oh goodness.  Hey stroopwafel.  Dang, you know what stopped working?  I think we got a new chip.  Karsten and I discovered this.  I said okay boomer and it triggered Google,  but that stopped.  I think they've actually took that out.  Okay boomer.  That was good.  Okay boomer.  It worked, it worked.  Did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Both.  Worked on his, didn't work on mine, thank goodness.  Thank goodness.  All three.  Sounds like a Nickelback song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey stroopwafel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Watch out, you got a Canadian on the show.  You gotta be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is some classic research we're conducting here.  Good stuff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Verizon, there was a funny rumor going around  that Verizon didn't like the Pixel phones  and we're not gonna take the new one,  the Pixel 5 or the 4A.  Verizon was quick to say no.  That's not, that's wrong.  I don't know where these things come from.  So who reported that in the first place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's probably a Twitter.  I saw it first I believe, nine to five Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We did not repeat it.  Nope, we did not.  And I'm glad we didn't, sometimes I.  Yeah, no Android police.  No Android police, that's where I saw it first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then as you read down,  they stuck an update in there to say hey no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, update and retraction.  Good, you know what?  There's a word you don't hear a lot in modern journalism.  Good on you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Retraction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, good for them.  They said our report, our source was working,  we believe, with inaccurate, unreliable  or outdated information.  That's not, you know what?  I give them credit, because you can get stories wrong,  but if you properly update and retract it,  you don't bury it, but you put it right there in the headlong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This increases your credibility.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It came in my newsfeed, whatever newsfeed I was reading,  the original headline, so I clicked on it  and read through it, but I got about two thirds through it  and saw that there was an update in the bottom  of the article that said hey, our sources  don't seem to be reliable, yada yada yada.  Good.  But it's nice to see today updated ahead too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bravo, Android police, that's the right way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, because of Brexit,  I was looking at that story, I don't know how to.  Google is shifting your data out of the UK,  into the US, because they're not gonna be under GDPR  necessarily, and they don't know what is gonna happen  in the UK, so they gotta go to a place  where they actually know what the law is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, that's gonna be a lot of data, right?  How do they just move it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On a ship, I think.  I do see a picture of a ship, but I can't believe.  Is that the ship with the data?  How can I do that?  It's full of data.  It sank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What were those old, oh god, what were the brands  of those carts you used to put in the machine,  those square?  Not the zip drives.  Zip drives, zip drive, yeah.  Eight million zip drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember a guy from NASA at a gigaohm conference  saying that the only way that they could share data  from some of the telescopes was to put hard drives  in a box and put them on a UPS truck  and ship them to someone, because there was no bandwidth  fast enough to transmit petabytes of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do what you gotta do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, the sneaker net.  Reed Hastings, the founder of Netflix,  tells the story that his college computer science professor  asked him, which has more bandwidth?  A fiber optic cable across the country  or a truck carrying 20,000 DVDs.  And when they did the math, it was the truck.  It was the truck, oh yeah, for sure.  And he had the insight, oh, maybe we should mail DVDs  instead of them making people download them.  However, however, that's changed.  Because now everybody's got enough bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not NASA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But not NASA, of all people.  Yeah.  It's kind of a cute story, actually, apparently,  the story's changed over the years,  so I don't know how accurate it is.  It's a good story, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a good story.  Shouldn't let facts get in the way of a good story.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  What else?  Gosh, I don't know why.  Maybe it's me, maybe I'm getting ready for coronavirus.  Oh, here's the one I like.  Okay, maybe I need some carbs, I don't know what.  Twitter is real life.  Carbs.  Twitter is real life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Charlie Worsles' column.  Yeah.  A rare moment of tech positivism in the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Clickbait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't even click it, I'm typing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As someone who wrote an optimistic book,  I can tell you that optimism never sells.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's Bernie.  So, for the better part of a year,  I've been hearing the same refrain, he writes.  Friends, colleagues, peers,  and respected pollsters have cautioned.  Twitter is not real life.  I think I'm one of them.  I've been saying that for a long time.  I disagree with this, Charlie says,  in one reading, the Twitter isn't real life mantra  is perhaps a laudable attempt at self-reflection  by the media and the political elite,  but there's also a separate,  less charitable reading of the phrase  as it's deployed by the pundit class  as a clever bit of misdirection  intended to make elites seem in touch  while they protect their power.  Exactamundal.  What you're saying to me, that I'm just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're a scared elite trying protectionism  for your great power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the nicest thing you've ever said, Jeff.  Wow, if only it were true.  That's the thing you ever said.  So, yeah, we've seen other pieces,  even in the New York Times saying,  the Arab Spring, there's lots of giving.  Farhat Manjoo.  Black Twitter, giving people who don't normally have voices  a chance to speak is important.  And yes, and there are lots of people  on the other side as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing is, it's both.  It's both, I think that's right.  That's the problem with, yeah.  It's like anything the internet touches,  it enables all the good stuff  and all the bad stuff at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other problem with the analysis  is that people try to act like,  they use a media analysis to act as if  the total usage of Twitter reflects something.  It's not.  It's a bunch of individual voices you can finally hear.  The agglomeration is meaningless.  But it's which individual voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that what the media often does,  which is say, oh my gosh, people are really upset  about the red dress versus the blue dress  when it's just a bunch of yeehaws on Twitter.  All right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you remember when.  It's a buzz.  Do you remember when they would write,  people would say, oh, the word such and such  has been searched this many times on Google,  or if you search it, you get this many results  like that showed anything.  Right.  There's a million pages about this word.  Yeah.  I love it when our local TV, they'll put a video on  that they got off like College Humor or Reddit or something.  And they'll say, it's gone viral.  And it'll have like 3,200 views or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This piece, I'm guessing, and I haven't read it yet.  So correct me if I'm wrong, Jeff,  is really a defense of Bernie Sanders, right?  And if his grassroots movement on Twitter  and the media elites rejection of Bernie Sanders saying,  oh, well, don't believe the fact that he's got  all this grassroots support on Twitter,  doesn't mean he's gonna get a lot of votes.  That's kind of a subtweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's partly that.  I think it's partly that.  He's also saying that there are lots of influential people  who are on Twitter and they help shape the discussion  that then actually makes things happen.  So in a real way, it is real life.  Fair assessment.  That's why it's both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is media elites saying Bernie is overblown.  And then there's a lot of Bernie supporters saying,  no, Bernie's the greatest thing ever.  It's all of that.  Right, yeah.  I think it's a mistake, especially because you only see  the things you follow on Twitter to be safe.  I'm putting my finger on the pulse of America.  That's clearly not true.  It's not even the pulse of Twitter  because it's just who you follow.  Well, then again, even if it's Twitter,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you still have that trending column or whatever it is  that they're constantly trying to put in your face  when you open up the app.  So I don't necessarily follow that stuff,  but I'm always being...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was just going to say the algorithm,  unless you constantly tell it  to only show you the latest tweets,  which you have to do over and over and over,  the algorithm takes over and it starts showing you things  that it thinks you'll be interested in.  So you're not even deciding what to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's an interesting thing.  I just went to my Twitter stream  and instead of just showing general trends now,  it's showing trends for me.  Trends for you, yeah.  So now I see a gear too.  So can I...  Just based on your location, I think.  So I can uncheck that and who I follow.  So I'll uncheck that.  And now what I want is...  It gives me the NBA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have never in my life read a story about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly, that's what I'm talking about.  I have things muted and blocked or whatever.  So I made a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said I wanted global trends and all I'm getting is soccer.  That's global.  Literally, it sounds like I'm making a joke.  That's global.  Soccer, soccer, soccer, soccer.  And then a thing saying you should call it football.  That's all that's important.  Apparently, let me go to what other country?  Jeez, that's the big worldwide trend.  Let me go...  I would wanna follow the United States trends, right?  And not trends just for you.  Soccer, soccer, Major League Baseball,  and the coronavirus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Coronavirus.  The coronavirus is number four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do these, in your opinion, gentlemen,  are these actual statistical trends  or is it somewhat curated and curried?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm betting they're pushing some of them.  Like they may even have a deal  with the Champions League, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't report the trend.  This trend is about soccer.  Why don't I have that?  Okay, well maybe I do wanna go back to tweets trends for me.  This seems new though,  because I used to see just a list of trends by geography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every time I open the mobile app,  it pops up with that mess.  And I'm like, I don't care about any of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trends for me, see they know me better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're just trying to help.  A shooting in Milwaukee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not helping when I actually have a mute word, Trump.  Do you get Trump in your trends?  And Trump is the thing that pops up.  Like, come on, who's reading this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter, I've come around to the point of...  Of you that it's just, this is an amusement.  This is just an amusement.  Don't take it seriously.  Sometimes I read and I go, people are awful.  But most of the time...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still have a handful of people  that I care about on Twitter.  You have great conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see what you...  And you're going back and forth.  He's always fist bumping and going on.  Because he's a nice man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What am I, Chops Lemon?  People respond to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you're like me, you're an A-hole.  I'm not, you're a crazy lover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're more like a pork chop.  I don't actually, I long ago learned  never to say anything on Twitter.  Like just...  I'm completely anodyne on Twitter.  It's like, oh yeah.  Maybe that's why, I don't know.  There's nothing you can't...  There's nothing you can do.  No, no, you tweet too much, they drop you.  You tweet too little,  at least they don't know you're there.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I came across a great essay actually at Ribbon Farm,  which is a blog you should check out.  And it was about how Twitter is an example  of what this guy calls the internet of beefs.  And all it is is people who have a beef.  And unless you are 100% in alignment with them,  then that's a moral failing on your part  and they need to attack you.  So there's no room for nuance.  There's also...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's people looking for a fight.  Yeah, and also the activist champions  of Twitter.  There's a whole lot of activism on there, but no action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hashtag I'm upset.  But then there's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I used to say the classic Twitter was,  I would say, I love pancakes.  And the first response is, why do you hate waffles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There it is.  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then there's this, turn on my audio.  All the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh man, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, we're gonna get pulled off of YouTube for this,  but it's worth it.  It is apparently a sea otter.  It looks like he's actually eating the phone,  but instead they're saying he's playing the saxophone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's awesome.  Hairless whisper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why does someone have a sea otter in their living room?  Sea otter, what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is this animal?  It looks like a sea otter.  It does look like an otter.  It's an otter.  Is it an otter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's clearly an otter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's okay to own otters.  Shouldn't it be in water?  Maybe it's not a sea otter.  Maybe it's a land otter.  There's no such thing as a land otter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a sea otter.  There are river otters.  Where is the sea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a land otter in this picture.  All right, call the SPCA.  So yeah, that's a sea otter.  There, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I look up on Google and I see, is otter a good pet?  Answer, otters are frequently described as ferrets on crack.  And for good reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The chat room says it's a river otter.  That is our otter.  It's still, it's not a living room otter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a suburban.  It's not a living room otter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it does play a mean saxophone.  All right.  Otters are frequently described as ferrets on crack  and for good reason.  So you can't even legally own a ferret in California.  So an otter must be right out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They must be really mean  because ferrets are pretty mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, am I, so we have a Super Tuesdays this coming Tuesday.  We're voting in California.  And I have, I can't vote.  I'm waiting to see, I just,  I wanna see what happens until Tuesday.  Normally I have a mail-in ballot.  I wanna see what happens in South Carolina.  Is that stupid?  I'm like, I wanna vote for the winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have my Kamala hat with black mourning around it.  And then I have my Corey hat with black mourning around it.  Now I have my Warren hat.  Right now, I'm gonna get ratioed for this.  The person I do not want to win the nomination is Bernie.  So Biden, who I had no enthusiasm for whatsoever,  I might end up voting for Biden in your case.  To make sure there's some kind of-  I'm voting for Bernie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I decided I'm just gonna get over it.  I'm gonna like Bernie.  That's just the way it is.  And it is what it is.  It is what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not just about liking.  It's about fearing what else happens.  Chris Hughes, Chris Hayes had a really good piece  the other night on his show,  trying to argue that the data doesn't back up these fears,  but I still hope I have-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Bernie is saying is weird.  You know, it's the word socialist, unfortunately.  That that's really, people say, oh, he's a communist.  He's a socialist.  He's Fidel Castro in a ill-fitting suit.  And everything he said,  well, he kind of does look like Larry David.  Everything he says is perfectly legitimate.  It's not like he's advocating the over,  he's not even saying, let's take over AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which I might support, to be honest with you.  It's just public health care, for Christ's sake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but it's a question, the question now is winning.  So this whole argument about likeability.  That's where I feel guilty.  They use that against women.  They only use that word against women.  Likeability.  You should smile more.  Likeability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, likeability too, but no.  All right, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to get all political on you.  I just wanted to get-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You brought it up.  Let's let the record show.  No, I did, because I want to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if I'm being craven by waiting.  See how everybody else, oh, that's what we always do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the risk, but the risk is that you're playing  a sort of horse race game where you're trying to like  gain the results and then you want to vote for the winner,  not the person that you actually support.  No, I want to vote for Amy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which I'm not sure is-  But I don't want to throw away my vote.  And I think at this point, after the debate last night  where everybody was at each other's throat,  I thought it might be good if we just got rid of  all these other people, pick one person,  doesn't matter who, and just all get behind  that one person.  There was a debate last night?  Yeah, you're glad you didn't see it.  It was savaging.  It was a Twitter debate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter debate.  And there's a great picture of Amy standing here  while Tom Steyer's screaming at Joe Biden,  they're screaming at each other,  she's like in between going like this,  and it's, oh, it's depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This should just be a big cage match.  Like they should just all get in a cage.  It is.  That's another one of mine.  You know, six politicians enter, one leaves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's literally what it is.  There's no cage, but it's a virtual cage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's another one of my mute words, debate.  Debate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you don't mind, you wanna know anything about it, huh?  Don't you want information?  What's left?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like when I go in and order the burger without this,  and without that, without that, and watch this.  Is your Twitter just basically kittens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Almost.  There's a couple dogs too.  That's the people who always say how much they love Twitter,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  people like you, basically you're not seeing Twitter.  Google, oh, I already did that one.  Only reason I'm bringing this stuff up,  I got nothing to say.  I got nothing here.  Andrew, are you well?  That's not true.  Oh, I got coronavirus.  Are you well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on, you, nothing to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got the plague.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was another good Twitter one there actually  about them trying to test new ways to fight misinformation.  Yeah.  They're thinking about not just badges  on things that are misleading,  but a kind of community-based point system.  I'm not sure any of this is gonna work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's my, you know,  so there's a story like this every freaking week.  Twitter's thinking of all the text being upside down.  I know, I know.  And it never happens.  It usually never happens.  I know, that's a fair point.  It's like, I don't even,  we're exploring a number of ways to address misinformation  and provide more context for tweets on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I almost- I actually saw a comment  from someone who studies disinformation,  and they said this would actually be the worst thing  that when you flag something  and show that it's misinformation,  it actually makes the problem worse.  We know that, because Facebook tried it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we know that.  And what got shared the most?  Misinformation.  Misinformation did.  Twitter's rolling out, supposedly,  the new continue thread option.  So you don't have to use that stupid spool of thread.  Plus sign or whatever.  No.  Jeff is of the opinion that lots of people  put a spool of thread on their tweet  before they do a thread.  I've never seen it, but he says it happens.  All the time.  Because I'm a leader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're a thought leader.  I've never seen that.  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you, Matthew.  You're coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't, actually, this is an interesting-  First of all, I feel like Twitter  should not encourage these massive tweet storms.  They're not a good way to post your thoughts.  Oh, I've seen brilliant-  No, that's what a blog post is for.  Yes, but put them on Medium or something.  That's what a blog post is for.  That's where the people are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But nobody does that.  Nobody does that.  Jeez, you gotta control the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You gotta put it where people are.  That's the worst possible platform  for a long-form thought.  I think once it gets to 100 or 200 tweets in a thread,  I think that's probably a little over the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's an essay.  That's a book, yeah.  You're right, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's only, what, 28,000 words.  Yeah, that's an essay.  So you like this idea to have a button.  So what happens is if you post a tweet  and then you post another tweet,  referring to that tweet,  they'll give you a button that says,  continue the thread.  Do you like that, Jeff?  Is that a good idea?  Tweet deck already-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, you don't know because you quit Twitter  before the threads were invented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I quit Twitter before the hashtag.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There weren't even any at symbols.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does Chris Messina still get,  he gets credit for creating the hashtag, doesn't he?  I think he should.  Yes.  Well.  No.  Who?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a real range of reactions.  Yes.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well.  Who?  No, the name you said, I didn't hear the name you said.  Chris used to work at Google, Chris Messina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He is the first to use the hashtag.  But he repurposed the hashtag.  I thought it was someone else, though.  From like IRC, right?  So he didn't invent it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but he was the first to use it on Twitter  and Twitter incorporated it.  He was, yeah.  He was.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought it was someone else.  Did you love that?  I remember when Ev Williams got so mad at me,  I wrote something about Twitter  and I said that all the best ideas had come from users.  Like the ad symbol.  That's really true.  And the retweet and the.  That's a good thing.  I was going to say, is that a bad thing?  No, no, no, it's a great thing.  But I was saying that Twitter didn't actually come up  with a lot of the great things about the service,  that it was users that came up with it.  And then Twitter just implemented them  and he got all mad.  Because it was like I was saying,  he wasn't smart enough to come up with good ideas  about Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Insecure much, Ev Williams?  Jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Crap, I forgot the ads.  All right, let me do a break.  That's why I'm a little at sea.  Because we haven't had ads in so long  and then I forgot to do them.  Sorry about that.  We'll be back.  Smoke them if you get them.  You know how I know it?  Yeah, the chat room wants to go to the bathroom.  Brought to you by ExpressVPN.  You can only go to the bathroom  if you're already using ExpressVPN.  The rest of you sit in your seats.  You need to know this.  This is how you protect yourself online.  Privacy and security.  ExpressVPN, a virtual private network encrypts your traffic  from your computer to the ExpressVPN server.  So your ISP can't spy on you.  The guy in the coffee shop in the hoodie can't spy on you.  People can't inject ads into your stream.  No man in the middle.  It's a really good technology.  A longstanding good technology.  But there is a caveat.  Maybe you're just kicking the can down the road.  Maybe the guy in the coffee shop can't spy on you.  Your ISP can't spy on you.  But you've got to trust  where your traffic emerges on the internet.  They have the same access that all those other people have.  That's why it's so important  you choose the right VPN provider.  Well, here's what you want.  And we've talked about this on security now.  Steve Gibson said this.  You want a VPN,  besides one that obviously is using the latest technology  that's secure, that doesn't log your data.  They're not keeping track of it.  And honestly, that's how those cheap  and free VPN providers make money.  They log your data.  They sell it to the ad companies.  ExpressVPN does not.  In fact, they are so committed to your privacy.  They developed a technology called Trusted Server.  When you press the button,  you can express VPN up on Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, Linux,  wherever you are, there's a great big button on the app.  You press the button, you're now going to a VPN server.  It spins up.  It spins up a new copy of the VPN server.  You use it.  As soon as you log out, it spins it down.  The whole time that server's running,  they call it the Trusted Server technology.  It cannot write to the disk.  It cannot write to the disk.  So even if somebody wanted to log your behavior  on ExpressVPN, they couldn't.  They couldn't.  The other thing that's great about ExpressVPN, it's fast.  So fast you can use it.  And I know a lot of people do.  I've tried this, it really works,  to log into another country.  So let's say you're a Netflix customer in the US.  You wanna use Netflix in Japan.  So you choose the ExpressVPN server in Japan.  Now you can watch Japanese Netflix.  You're not stealing it.  You're a subscriber, but you can watch Japanese Netflix  because there's no geographic restriction anymore.  Fast enough you can actually watch HD video.  And I've tried it again and again.  Many other VPNs are too slow to watch video,  not ExpressVPN.  So you can eliminate geographic restrictions,  protect your privacy, protect your security,  stream HD quality video.  And it's just so easy.  You fire up the app, you click the button.  Normally it'll pick the server nearest you,  but if you wanna be in another country,  you wanna watch Netflix in Canada,  I'm not the only one who loves ExpressVPN.  TechRadar, The Verge, CNET, many other tech experts  are great ExpressVPN, number one in the world.  In every respect, this is a great service,  30 day money back guarantee.  Give it a try.  We actually have a great deal for you.  Go to expressvpn.com slash twig.  You'll get a three extra months free on a one year package.  Expressvpn.com slash twig to learn more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chrome OS is really easy to set up on there too.  It is great.  I use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ExpressVPN.  That's kind of neat that you can do that on a Chromebook.  I love that.  It's pretty slick.  Expressvpn.com slash twig.  So this is an example of why,  you know, we were talking about Clearview AI,  how they have been scraping faces  from Facebook and everywhere else.  That old chestnut.  Yeah, and then offering face recognition technology  to law enforcement.  And they said, no, no, no, no, we don't.  We only give it to law enforcement.  It's only legitimate law enforcement.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's secure.  Right.  An intruder accessed its entire list of customers.  And someone got access to,  I mean, this is why you can say, oh, no, we're secure.  The servers were not breached,  but they did get all the customers.  The number of user accounts those customers have set up.  The number of searches the customers have connected.  Viral law enforcement, I might be a little miffed.  Clearview, security is Clearview's top priority,  said Tor Eklund, an attorney for the company.  Unfortunately, data breaches are part of life.  Oh, this is the new defense.  That's normal.  Oh, this happens.  It just happens.  These things happen.  You know, what can you do?  Well, Leo.  There's nothing you can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're gonna get attacked.  Deal with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing you can do.  Things happen.  So maybe there's a good reason  why you wouldn't want a company to have six billion pictures  of everybody in the United States.  Three billion pictures of everybody in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe there's a reason.  They also said they worked with a bunch of law enforcement  that it turned out they didn't.  So they were in their marketing,  and then someone called them and were like,  did you use this?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And who was it?  Was it Cashmere Hill?  It was a good piece on the Daily.  They interviewed her about her coverage.  The New York Times of Clearview.  And among other things, apparently they have a flag.  So she had a friend in law enforcement,  and she said, here's my image, search for it.  And they couldn't find her.  Right.  And eventually she talked to the founder,  and she said, you know, what?  Oh, not only could it not find her,  Clearview then contacted that law enforcement officer  and killed his account for letting a reporter use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I remember.  Oh, we don't know who you are.  It was for searching for reporters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Searching for reporters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  Oh yeah, that's it.  So he said, the founder said, that was a bug.  That was a bug, couldn't find you.  And so she gave him her picture and found her.  Lots of them.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  A bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a bug.  Samsung has admitted there was a data breach.  A number of us got weird unsolicited texts  with a number one on our phone, a mystery push.  What's the frequency, Kenneth?  Isn't that weird?  In this case, we found out, in fact, Samsung says,  a small number of users could read  other people's personal data following last week's  unexplained Find My Mobile notification.  That's weird.  Was it about 150 or so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a small number, but still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not good.  So Samsung said, a technical error.  Shocking.  Yeah, this is what happens in the 21st century.  It's what happens.  Just kidding, nothing you can do about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing you could do.  We had a case of the Mondays, that's all.  I love that, that's my new defense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, it's the 21st century, get over it.  What do you expect?  Things happen.  Breaches happen.  It's digital now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're all digital.  It's an imperfect world.  Yeah.  Things break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have news, you seem a little down, Leo.  So I have news that's gonna brighten your day.  That would've brightened your day a lot more  when you were still on the keto diet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Today, today, Duncan Donuts.  Does it have to do with stroopwafels?  Oh, even better.  Has released a bag of bacon.  Yes, yes, I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Duncan bag of bacon.  The Duncan bag of bacon.  Eight half strips, which they point out to you  as equivalent to four full strips.  Yeah.  It's in a bag?  Yes.  It's in a little bag, there it is.  That doesn't look like good bacon.  No, because it wasn't just fried.  You know, it was fried about three months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll be fine.  I'd take it.  What are those flakes?  I'd take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ant reveals his standards.  If it's bacon, what more do you need to know, Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll bet why you're eating it,  if you eat part of the bag as well,  you wouldn't notice.  Nope.  Oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Still good though, Dan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think that's just for arms?  Like, Timmy's is gonna be any better.  They should deep fry the whole bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To get the keto people in the door?  Maybe.  Have eight pieces of bacon.  Maybe.  Yeah, I imagine that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they're not coming in for the doughnuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do we get the keto people back?  Oh my God, what can we give them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The bag of bacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about a doughnut, but it's made out of meat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ooh, a meat doughnut.  Now you're cooking with, oh, that's pepper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a lot of pepper.  Well, no, that's just for product photography.  There's something to get flavor about, too.  That's just for product photography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's probably like copper flakes.  It's not even meat, it's made out of cardboard.  All thing.  You should do a hands-on photography,  your great show about photography,  you should do one on food style.  Do it.  And the things that they do,  like instead of maple syrup, they use motor oil.  Yeah, motor oil, yeah, motor oil.  That would be a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because actual food doesn't really look that tasty.  It actually doesn't look very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does, it takes a nice process of nice lighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's an oracle sleeve for on-the-go snacking ease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, of course.  You don't want to get your hands all shiny and greasy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Swaddle Tim Hortons takes over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there anything wrong with Mike Bloomberg?  He's got a lot of money hiring people  for $2,500 a month to post on Twitter.  And now apparently he's hired a comedian  to write a material.  Yeah, I hope we get Gilbert Gottfried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh man, yes.  I'm Mike, I'm Mike Bloomberg, and I approved his visit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And worse.  It's interesting that Twitter took down 70 accounts  because it said it was basically coordinated  in authentic behavior.  I have so much coordinated in authentic behavior.  Is Facebook 100% totally fine with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I've reached my free article limit.  Uh-oh.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, but with him hiring influencers though,  I guess that's no different from them hiring somebody else  just to do the marketing campaign,  but they just happen to hire the best of the best,  if you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you gotta be transparent about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, just be upfront about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Especially if they're all tweeting exactly the same phrase,  as you can see, they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was one guy, I think it was on Instagram maybe,  and he posted something positive about Bloomberg,  and then the very next message was,  just ignore that, vote for Bernie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The check cleared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ads made by influencers on behalf of politicians,  says Facebook, will be allowed on the platform  so long as they're labeled as ads.  But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they don't go in the ad library.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. They don't go in the ad.  So you can't review them as you can  all the other election ads.  Apparently they have no policy on influencer marketing.  Of course they don't.  Oh no, I'm sorry,  the Federal Elections Commission has no policy.  It's even worse.  So the FTC has rules about it.  If I tweet something.  If you get a free lipstick, you gotta say something.  Yeah, or if I tweet something about ExpressVPN,  you're gonna have to have the hashtag sponsor,  or hashtag ad, or say our sponsor ExpressVPN,  which I always do.  Yeah, I usually do.  Yeah, if you forget, okay.  But the FTC will fuck you all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm almost perfect, I'm telling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If there is an FTC, fine for that and all that.  So we instruct all of our people about that.  But the FEC, the Federal Elections Commission,  has no policy.  Influencer posts can be fact checked on Facebook  unless they contain the speech of a politician,  in which case, of course, they can't.  They can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so this gets further interesting today.  That's so clear, yeah, that's so clear.  Yeah, this is kind of a ridiculous, I will confess.  Though, let me stay on this for a second.  So in the ads database, everybody is very frustrated  that they don't give you the targeting criteria  that were you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, but that's what you'd really like, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly, well, so then I heard a discussion that said,  well, problem is, if Mr. and Mrs. Pruitt comments  or interacts with a given ad, and I can see that,  and then we know what targeting was used for that ad,  then it identifies those criteria to Mr. Pruitt.  Oh.  And as a privacy problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Data, data, data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the other story today is that Obama is trying  to get the networks to stop airing a Trump ad  that is misleading, but the networks do not  censor, wrong verb, but on the flip.  Yeah, they're not allowed.  They're not allowed to.  So you have the former president telling the network,  asking the networks to take something down,  and it's gonna be very interesting to see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they do, in some cases, take them down,  but it has to be really, really extreme.  So it'd be interesting to see whether this is gonna  make them be extreme enough for them to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cable networks can take them down.  They're not under the rules, but broadcast networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then there's this Swiss court that says,  clicking a like button could be a crime  if it's to spread hateful or defamatory content.  Ooh.  What do you think about that?  This is a little scary.  They're too far in the other direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It seems to be.  They're technically right.  You distribute it by liking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you bump it up in the algorithm?  Yeah.  Well, technically, you don't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook does it, but.  Oh, based on the signal.  Got it, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've got to grapple with freedom of expression.  It's challenging.  And in fact, so today, Toby Young,  who's a very controversial media figure in the UK,  he's conservative, pro-Brexit, all that,  he started something called the Free Speech Union.  And The Guardian had a rip-roaring laugh at this,  and I get why.  So you pay money, and 49 pounds regular rate,  250 pounds full rate, and he says that they will,  if somebody goes to your boss and says,  Jeff shouldn't have tweeted that, as has happened,  they will send letters to the boss saying,  remember, Jeff has freedom of expression, and that matters.  So it's a weird kind of service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seems like there's so much gray area around a lot of this  stuff, too, one way or another.  It's all gray areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the complaints about the right wing saying  that their speech is being violated.  Sometimes it comes off as rather disingenuous,  but on the other hand, we've got to get used to speech.  I was at a conference in Maine, a great conference,  the Camden Conference in Camden, Maine,  this weekend speaking, and one of the people on stage,  someone at a major university in the United States,  said that the First Amendment is outmoded,  which made me want to just scream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do they propose in its place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I see this in other academics these days.  Do we have too much speech?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Be careful what you wish for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going through my Lutheran,  so one thing I mentioned up there,  in 15 something, a printer had his right hand  cut off because he had dared to print a criticism  of the Queen's marriage.  Wow.  His name, unfortunately, was Mr. Stubb.  Terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not going to laugh at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rim shot.  That's terrible.  It's true.  So I have been for, recently, it's last year saying,  because I was a big proponent of PGP and encrypting email,  but I think I've got, saw the light finally  that after a number of exploits took advantage  of poorly designed PGP implementations and so forth,  that the whole notion of email just cannot be secure,  that you should always think of email  as potentially exposed.  And so what I've been telling people who ask me,  in fact, I just didn't ask the tech guy about this,  the guy had a BlackBerry, said,  okay, now that BlackBerry's gone,  what else can I use for secure email?  And I said, well, I don't know if it was ever that secure,  and email has its own problems,  and I recommended Signal Messenger.  Said, if you really, the only easy way  to have secure messaging is not email,  because metadata leaks, there's no forward secrecy,  there's all sorts of problems with it.  But Signal, and there are others like it.  Keybase, is that another one?  Keybase is very good.  Signal is open source, uses perfect forward secrecy,  does everything right, Moxie, Molly, and Spike  is very trustworthy, and actually, it's kind of funny,  Brian Acton, who was the founder of WhatsApp,  sold it for $22 billion to Facebook,  and then left Facebook,  because he didn't like the commercialization  they were coming up with.  And he put money into Signal.  He put about half a billion into Signal.  Oh, and I didn't know that.  Yeah, and they're hiring staff.  He was on a different page from Facebook.  They put stickers in,  they're trying to make it more appealing to real people.  I would say Signal's the best.  I love Signal.  The only negative, and there's Edward Snowden,  he loves it too.  Snowden, of course.  The only, and as well as Bruce Schneier,  another great security guru,  and Matthew Green, this cryptographer at Johns Hopkins.  So that's a pretty good, and Laura Pincus,  who is of course Snowden's biographer, I guess,  or documentarian.  Poitras.  Poitras, did I say?  Yeah, Poitras.  The only bad thing about Signal  is it's tied to your phone number.  Now you could get an anonymous phone number,  but I don't like it that it does it that way.  There are other choices, perhaps, to look at.  But the EU has just told its staff, the EU Commission,  switch to Signal.  Signal's been selected as the recommended application  for public instant messaging.  I wish they would say for all messaging, including email.  So that's very encouraging.  I think it's very encouraging.  I'm glad to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't recall Signal having a web interface  the way Keybase does.  You can use Keybase on your mobile device,  but you can also download and install an actual app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Signal has a desktop app,  but you still have to unfortunately tie it to your phone  and you can only have five devices besides your phone.  And I think that has to do with the security.  Security, yeah, that makes sense.  But you can't, I do have Signal on my desktop,  as the ones I use most of the time, as well as on my phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've used Keybase over the last six months or so.  I've been getting a ton of spam.  Oh really?  They had a problem which they fixed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because they were giving away their cryptocurrency  or a cryptocurrency they're affiliated with called Lumens.  Lumens.  A lot of people suddenly joined Keybase trying to get Lumens.  So I think they fixed that.  It seems a lot better.  Keybase is an interesting story  because it's free, it's open source.  It has a lot of nice features, encrypted chat,  but also team messaging, encrypted Git.  It was originally conceived of as a way  to store your crypto keys, either have them generate  or for more security, generate them yourself and store them,  which I do, store your public key on Keybase  so it's a directory and you could follow people  if their key changes, you'll get a notification.  There's a lot of nice features.  I really like Keybase.  But I think I am probably using Signal for,  but I also use Keybase and I have a number of people  I chat with on Keybase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, just have a small group in there just to,  it's private, but it's about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For a while I was thinking about making it our team,  instead of Slack, our team messaging is free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's free, locked down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really well designed.  I'm trying to remember the guys who founded it.  We were gonna do an interview on triangulation  and right before we canceled it.  But the guys who founded it made a lot of money in,  with a startup, I can't remember the name.  And so now I think they're just paying back,  they're paying it forward.  As far as I can tell, they may have a long-term  monetization strategy, but there's currently no way  to give them money.  So anyway, I think this is pretty clearly,  this is a better choice.  And not TikTok.  TikTok's right out.  TSA has banned employees from using TikTok  for their social media posts.  Chuck Schumer actually wrote a letter  to the TSA administrator saying,  stop using TikTok.  They'd been using it to create and post videos  explaining boarding processes and rules.  Why not?  Why not use TikTok to tell, to help people?  To keep people safe.  Yeah, for information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are people there, yeah.  A lot of people.  Don't do it on the head of the TSA's phone.  Right.  But then again, social media matters  because we have the head of the coronavirus efforts  going to Twitter to ask for help.  As he should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As he should.  Right, right.  The TSA has never itself published content to TikTok  or sent people to TikTok.  It's just individual employees on their personal devices  for their social media outreach.  The Homeland Security, which houses the TSA,  banned the use of TikTok from government-issued devices  last month.  In December, the US Army banned soldiers  from using the device.  The parent company, ByteDance, is in China.  Although, they're making attempts to move their servers  out of China and they're looking to hire an American CEO  and based in Washington, DC.  They're not dumb.  Are they though?  If you've got a company, even if you're in China  and you want to make money,  it's not helpful to be seen as a spy company.  I feel like both Huawei and TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some is going to be doing just fine though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you also do what the government tells you to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the problem.  So if you can, move out.  But you know, I...  But you can't.  And as an American, you probably shouldn't trust it.  But what are you putting on TikTok?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I just lurk on there.  I have nothing to share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah, it's hard for me to imagine  that I have much of value to the Chinese government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Translate.  Oh, let's do the changelog.  Play the thing, the drums, the trumpets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The River Otter.  Do something.  That's River Otter saxophone.  Google Translate now supports,  get ready for this, five more languages.  Actually, pretty big number of people though.  That's cool.  75 million people.  So they've...  I can't even pronounce these languages.  Kenya, Kenyawanda, Odia, Tartar, Turkmen and Uyghur.  75 million people.  108 languages in total.  That's pretty cool.  And you know, if you're going to the steps,  it's nice to be able to speak a little Tartar.  Or is it Tatar?  No idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Must be saucy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No idea.  Quick share button in Google's Chrome's toolbar.  What do you think?  Quickly share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so you, because some sites, believe it or not,  don't have a share button on it.  So this would be on everything.  I like that.  Yeah, so you see how it's on the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is in mobile, I guess.  But you can only share it through Google+.  Oh, yay.  You can turn it on if you want,  going to chrome colon slash slash flags.  Search for share button in the top toolbar.  Enable it, restart the browser,  and you can do it yourself.  This is in Chrome Canary on Android.  I like that idea.  This is one of the advantages where Apple has it.  Well, actually, no.  Android has a share sheet, just like Apple.  Yeah, okay, so I'll take it back.  In fact, the nice thing about Android's share sheet,  unlike Apple's, is any developer can put their app on it.  So, yeah, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually one of the things,  when I switched to Android from Apple,  that's one of the things I like the best about it,  was when I wanted to share things,  Apple gave you this incredibly restricted group of things  you could, and most of them were Apple's, of course.  Apple's also seems a little random.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like this app, but not that app.  So annoying.  Yeah.  Google Stadia has four new games from SteamWorld.  Do you know what this is, Karsten?  Are you a Steam?  It seems like this is something you would like.  SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Dig 2, SteamWorld Heist,  and SteamWorld Quest, the Hand of Gilgamesh.  I'm sorry, Gilgamesh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do not know these games, but they do look interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this seems like your kind of thing.  Interesting or fun?  Both.  They are a style of gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does Karsten really have fun?  No.  Karsten has lots of fun.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He thinks tying a bow tie is fun.  Yeah.  Just to put it in perspective.  These are-  Hobbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He has fun at the expense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are games in a style called Metroidvania.  Yes.  Which means they're kind of like Metroid  and kind of like Castlevania, right?  Eight bit.  16 bit.  16 bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lots of side scrolling.  Side scrollers.  Yeah.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Puzzles.  Whips and chains and knives.  Labyrinth design, yes.  Labyrinths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like this kind of thing.  I have no idea what y'all just said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, these are just games.  You're sitting there in front of this high end gaming laptop.  You don't game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is not a gaming laptop.  Okay.  This is not a gaming laptop.  It's kind of like a platformer with weapons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A platformer with weapons.  Okay.  Google details its IO 2020 sustainability goals.  I think this is so good.  They're gonna buy carbon offsets  for all the attendees air travel.  Oh nice.  What does that cost for a  Cheap.  It's like 1%.  Coast to coast flight.  It's 1%.  I get mine from the Good Traveler.  Let me go there right now so I could show you.  In fact, we could figure it out.  Good Traveler, thegoodtraveler.org.  Let's say you're gonna,  yeah, let's do a coast to coast flight.  Let's say you're gonna do domestic.  You're gonna go from JFK to SFO.  And there we go.  San Francisco.  I guess I have to do the JFK.  Click this.  And I'm gonna calculate the offsets.  Your trip was 5,248 miles around trip.  Buy six offsets.  Oh, two bucks?  Two dollars.  That's awesome.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, wait a minute.  Oh, round it up.  Make it 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, offsets the carbon you're releasing 1,000 miles.  So you need to buy six of them.  So $12.  Oh, oh, I see.  But still.  Still.  Yeah, still.  You know, that's,  so I've been doing that.  And I just love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seems like you spent like $20 or so  for your last vacation, right?  Yeah, it was cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it makes you feel good.  You gotta pick carefully.  I used, I picked this one.  It's from the Rocky Mountain Institute  because the Yale School of Forestry,  I read that that's what the students there use.  So I figured they did their research.  So I'll have to.  And then there's another one.  Which we're looking at for our company.  So Google's doing some of this too.  Where you can, for a business,  you can just buy offsets,  which can be carbon offsets,  renewable energy credits,  water restoration certificates for your business.  And so we're looking,  Lisa and I are looking at the cost of that.  It's not too expensive.  And you know what?  It's probably one of those things  that makes you feel good.  It's kind of like that social activism on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You may be helping out some of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Better than nothing.  So Google's gonna be doing this.  They're gonna do,  they wanna do zero waste,  net zero emissions model.  While not a perfect process,  they say carbon offsetting helps for every mile flown.  We help fund high quality offset projects  that reduce emissions,  like methane reclamation at landfills.  That's where the money goes by the way.  To plant trees, carbon sequestration.  You know, the kinds of things  that would reverse the amount of carbon  you put into the air.  So that's good.  They-  It's an effort.  Yep.  So the venue at Shoreline has a big parking lot,  but they're going to,  it's a no parking event.  They did that last year too.  Yeah, we'll have to arrive via shuttles or public transit.  This also-  Or if you're press, of course,  we get a lot of old people.  Yeah, we get a special lot.  So that's fine.  I'll be driving my Hummer.  Uh.  I'll buy carbon offsets from my Hummer.  They're making electric.  I know, I like that idea.  Although let's not forget,  it's still a massive waste of resources for the-  Of energy.  All the other stuff, yeah.  Local materials to create the tents for Google I.O.  with low invested energy, fewer virgin materials,  more clean grid power.  I think it's a good thing.  I like seeing companies do this.  I know it's not perfect,  but at least they're doing something, right?  Yeah.  More sustainable I.O.  Okay, Google, charge my car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somewhere at Tesla's having problems right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Assistant is adding native control  for chargers and batteries, for your iRobot,  for a lot of, anything that uses a battery.  I don't know what it means, but I'm just saying it.  The actions associated include starting or stopping a charge,  asking about the current capacity,  and checking how much time is left  until something is fully charged.  So that would be very handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Maybe this is because I don't have an EV  and not well versed on these matters,  but why do I need Google Assistant  to tell me to charge my car  when I'm plugging a daggum thing into the car manually myself?  You don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, all right.  You do that to impress other people.  So you go in their living room and you say,  okay, Google, charge my car.  And then they know that you have an electric car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I would hope someone would look at me,  dude, you were just out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some chargers allow you to defer,  most chargers allow you to defer charging.  So it doesn't mean that it's gonna charge  when you plug it in, unlike your computer,  because you might wanna charge it when rates are lower  in the middle of the night.  So a lot of cars are set to defer charging.  So you might be sitting in the living room thinking,  oh crud, I forgot, I have to go down to Sunnyvale tomorrow.  Okay, Google, charge my car now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, well, this is why I ask,  because I don't own an EV and I have some ignorance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's also valuable to know what the level of charging is  before you go out to the garage,  or is it fully charged, things like that.  It's not huge, like most of the things Assistant does.  Is it sunny out?  Open the daggum window, you can see.  Open the daggum window.  Google Contacts, I don't understand this.  Google Contacts can now find people  you haven't saved to your account.  Oh, so Contacts can go through.  It'll just go through your email.  Your email.  Right.  What could possibly go wrong?  Well, they're already in there.  Yeah, you might as well.  I don't know if it has to be Gmail.  This is not yet available,  but it'll be an update soon, apparently.  So, oh, that's good.  Okay.  That was Contacts app on Android.  Oh, so there is apparently, if you use Google Contacts,  on the web at Contacts.Google.com slash other,  a list of people that you have received email from on Gmail.  I didn't know that.  But you don't see that normally on Android.  So the next time you get an Android Contacts update,  it will see that.  It's pretty cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Handy.  I didn't even know it was on Android.  I'm really bad at putting Contacts in, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I always have thought of mail in general  as being a database of Contacts, agreements,  documents, all that stuff.  I hate to delete mail.  But I don't use Gmail anymore,  so this isn't much good to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love being able to tag people,  and this seems like it'd be good for the PR standpoint.  The PR connects.  So I don't want them necessarily as a personal contact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I made the mistake over the years of adding PR people  back when I was foolish and young.  And now I have such a giant contact list.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, gotta get it.  And there's nothing older than the contact information  from a PR person that's 10 years ago, right?  They haven't been there in years.  Yeah.  But it's fun sometimes to go through my list  and see people I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I periodically look at my Google Contacts,  and then I give up.  It's like, you go into your garage,  and you think, I should organize some of this.  But it's just, yeah, it would take weeks.  And the good news is it's just there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't take any space.  Yeah.  It's not like you look for contacts  by going through your contact list.  Nope, you just type it in, or yell at your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking for someone to pull up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google now makes the Titan security keys  available across Europe.  I didn't know they hadn't.  I am now using Google Advanced Protection,  because I just feel like there is some disadvantages,  but I just feel like I don't wanna risk  my losing my Google account.  Using your phone or with a key or what?  I use, you have to have, yeah, I use a Yuba key.  You have to have two keys just for backup  in case you lose one.  They recommend one be a Bluetooth.  I don't do that.  In fact, I just got the new Yuba keys  that have both a type C and a lightning connector,  one on each end.  Can't you use your phone now?  Yeah.  So the phone, yeah, that's another thing  where the phone will pop up a pop-up saying, is that you?  And you can do that with the iPhone now as well.  But I also think it's handy to have a physical dongle.  You'd have to, there it is.  Ask the tech guy about Yuba key.  You'd have to tear these keys out of my pride,  out of my cold.  Go ahead and just try to take my keys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't wanna break your finger, sir.  I like you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you could, you could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what makes people think that's so secure.  Soto speakers can now be your default playback option  for Google Assistant.  That's good.  Google Image Search now tells you a little bit more  about the results you get,  including whether clicking on it's gonna send you  to a e-commerce site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Logos, or little icons, I mean.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's, yeah, see the little,  there's a little tag.  That's a good idea, I like that.  Later this week, Google Images will show new icons  on desktop that provide useful information  to indicate if the images lead to products,  pages with products for sale, recipes.  That's useful.  Yeah, recipes has a little fork and knife.  Or video content has a little play button.  Mousing over the icons expands them  to show the icons with text or the length of the video.  That's nice.  Yeah.  That's a good use.  That makes search even more useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The next one is one may not be new,  but I didn't know about it, so I put it in here.  The old days of the anchor tag.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  You could link directly to right in the middle of the story.  Now you can put in a text snippet  and it will link directly to that text.  Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now to be doing that, you have to be doing HTML?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, well, just when you put the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you could do it in Markdown or Wiki or BB,  edit whatever it is that you're,  BB code, whatever you're using, I guess.  If the link has, so you use,  you use, you do pound colon tilde colon text equals.  Wow.  And then the snippet.  That's so easy to remember.  Oh yeah, sure.  I'll be doing that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many people know what a tilde is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's that thing above the tick.  Right.  Under the escape, over the river and through the woods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought that was Heidi's dog in that.  Tilde.  Swedish movie.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey tilde, Gmail is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just, I don't know.  Maybe I'm confusing this,  but I thought the anchor was just, you know, a bracket.  It's a hashtag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, a ref and then a hashtag.  A ref, that's it.  That's what I was thinking.  Well, but see the end,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so this article is showing it using a Wiki text.  Yeah, so I know what a tilde is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he's just, everybody's type of tilde is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, this, okay, so what you get is  wikipeda.org slash wiki slash cat.  That loads the cat page.  But then if you do  hash colon tilde colon text equals,  and then some text,  it will highlight the text and go right to it.  Is that only in Chrome?  I guess so.  Is it a W3C?  So let's try it.  Well, I can't because it's not, that's not,  well, let's try it.  Yeah, see, it's not,  they didn't do it right in there.  Demo.  It's the chromestatus.com.  Chrome platform status, huh.  WIC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, the next link is down there.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, let's try another link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, we're right down.  Yeah, that one.  Senses.  Well, that's the old anchor tag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the old anchor tag.  No, is it?  Yeah, because it pulls it to this.  This is a senses.  Well, maybe it's not a,  if that looks like the anchor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I should do is just.  Can you look at the source?  Let me, you'll need to just load this.  F12.  No, that's,  it's not in the anchor tag.  It's not?  So it's doing a text search of the page.  Yeah, this, of course I'm not using Chrome, so.  Look at the kitty cats though.  I didn't know you could go to the internet  and find kitty cat pictures.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google is getting better at finding.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  No, don't do that.  Midnight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All alone in the moonlight.  Gmail is catching more malicious attachments  than ever before.  I don't know how widely known this is,  but this is a very good thing to know.  If you are fortunate, as we are here at Twitter,  we have a good IT department and lots of security.  All of our email goes through a variety of services  that look for malicious attachments,  chiefly ransomware, that's a big threat to any enterprise,  and make sure that those attachments don't get through.  So I don't have to worry so much  about employees clicking attachments  because it does a pretty good job.  But the other thing we do is we use G Suite.  That means all our mail goes through Gmail,  and Gmail actually does a fantastic job  of blocking malicious attachments.  Hicks spam, even.  It does a good job with spam,  but it also blocks malware.  Users of Gmail get 300 billion attachments every week,  and they are now using AI.  I suspect they've always used a little bit of AI  in their spam and filtering,  but this was at RSA on Tuesday.  Ellie Burstein is presenting findings  about how the new deep learning scanner for documents  is fairing against the 300 billion attachments  that it has to process each week.  63% of the malicious documents it blocks each day  are different than the ones  its system flagged the day before.  So it's not a system like the spam system.  It's a moving target.  And spam, you saw spam yesterday, you block it today.  You gotta know it's malicious now.  Man.  Apparently deep learning is very good at this.  56% of malware threats against Gmail users  come from Microsoft Office documents,  only 2% from PDFs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it would have been the other way around, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it has something to do with the fact  that if you get a Microsoft Office document  from someone purporting to be your boss,  you're more likely to open it.  Okay, yeah.  Oh, that's safe.  What could go wrong there?  Boss has this, you know.  And here's that spreadsheet.  I really want you to update this.  Yep.  You're gonna update it.  Because you can't update the PDF, more likely.  Yeah.  Scanner has increased its daily  malicious Office document detection by 10%.  I mean, it'd like to be 100%, but it's not that easy.  The scanner is particularly good  at Microsoft Excel documents.  And that's hard to do, because apparently,  according to Wired, Excel documents are complicated,  difficult to assess.  So, you know, even if you can't afford fancy, you know,  filtering at your place of work,  just using Gmail for your email.  It's working for you.  Gmail is trying to work for you.  I feel pretty good.  Now, this one, I am in a knock on wood.  We have, we've never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not the virus, huh?  This one, we have, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, now, coronavirus doesn't scare me  as nearly as much as ransomware.  That scares me, man.  That's, well, it should.  We could be brought to our knees.  This is true.  I ask every time I see Russell, our IT guy, I say,  we're safe, right?  He says, yeah, we're safe.  He says, should we train people?  We're safe.  We're safe.  Is it safe?  It's safe, it's safe.  What's the frequency, Kenneth?  Wasn't it the running man?  No.  Yeah, yeah, the marathon man.  Is it safe?  Yeah, Laurence Olivier with the dental drill.  Yeah.  Ah, is it safe?  I don't know what you're talking about, man.  No drill on me, man.  Is it safe?  Ah!  That's my little.  I don't think that's gonna get pulled down on YouTube.  I'm just guessing.  Yep.  We're, that's from now on, everything we do  is gonna be a dramatization of the original  so that we won't.  I think I invented that in the show.  You did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You did.  That is my specialty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute, that's, what's his name?  That's Gandalf.  Yeah, why is he in this?  I don't think that's where is it safe comes from.  He's talking about the marathon man.  Olivier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Olivier, the dentist.  I remember a story, Dustin Hoffman for that movie  ran around the block and didn't sleep  for a couple of days because he looked tired and sweaty.  And Lawrence Olivier said,  you should try it at something, it's called acting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lawrence Olivier was not a method actor.  He always, he actually was crippled, I didn't know this,  but I read it in his biography, by paralyzing stage fright.  Wow.  Yeah, who would have thought?  One of the greatest actors of our time.  He also, he's not a method actor,  but he said putting on the costume and putting on the makeup  and or the beard or whatever the character  was always the way that he, so he did,  he was not a method actor, but he did do that.  He got it.  Sure, he got into character.  Definitely.  He knew how to do that.  It's the war paint.  The war paint, we'll do it.  And that, my friends, is the Google Change Log.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Our show today brought to you by Health IQ.  This is a life insurance agency  that was tailored for people like Ant.  Maybe people like you, are you healthy?  You make sure you get enough sleep every night,  you exercise every day, you eat right,  you understand what it takes to live healthier.  Good news, you're probably gonna live longer.  And from the point of view of a health insurance company,  that's gold.  You should be paying less.  The problem is health insurance companies  are not that smart.  They use numbers, they use things like the body mass index.  It's a very brute force system.  What you really need is a life insurance agency  that goes to bat for you, that does,  basically becomes a concierge.  And that's what Health IQ specializes in.  They specialize in the health conscious folks,  the people who have been overpaying  and subsidizing the less healthy people.  That's how life insurance works.  I mean, there's no judgment on that,  but Health IQ uses science and data  to secure lower life insurance rates for people like you.  And I mean lower, as much as 41% lower.  Something like, as an example,  a million dollar policy for just $36 a month.  So if you're a runner, if you're a cyclist,  if you're into CrossFit, if you lift like Ant does,  maybe you're a vegetarian or a vegan,  you shouldn't be paying as much for life insurance.  It's just simple.  Health IQ is concierge service, white glove service.  They walk you through the entire process of applying.  They're working with the top 30 insurance companies  in the United States.  These are good policies from good,  the best insurance companies, but they've negotiated rates.  These are rates you can't get from anywhere else.  You have to get through Health IQ because these companies,  no Health IQ is gonna vet you and make sure  that you're healthy before they even bring you  to the insurance company.  It all starts with a Health IQ quiz.  You can do that right now if you go to healthiq.com slash twig,  it's actually pretty quick to take the quiz.  And by the way, it's not a self-assessment.  They're not asking about you.  They're actually testing your knowledge.  Do you understand what is a healthy lifestyle?  They put this together with the nation's leading medical,  health, and fitness experts.  And then once you take the test, depending on your score,  and by the way, you can also volunteer additional information  to qualify you, and then you can save up to 41%  on your premiums, 41%.  No commitment.  You're gonna learn even more about opportunities  to be rewarded because you're committed to living healthy.  And Health IQ wants to help you get the best life insurance  money you can buy.  The Health IQ Concierge Service.  See if you qualify, go to healthiq.com slash twig,  take the quiz, healthiq.com slash twig.  If you pass, you'll talk to a Health IQ concierge.  They're great people, answer their questions.  They'll go to work for you and get you some great rates.  While you're at it,  they'll go to work for you and get you some great rates,  walk you through the whole process.  Information's king here.  Healthiq.com slash twig.  I actually am really flattered that Health IQ came to us  and said, oh, you have a healthy audience, right?  Yeah, sure.  But I understand that in fact,  our audience has been very responsive to these ads.  We do have a healthy audience, so good on you.  That's awesome.  You do take, I do take care of yourself.  That's great.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not obese anymore.  Your BMI is down to 20?  I'm finally below 30.  29.4, holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeez, Luis, what, did you stop lifting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I got sick a couple weeks ago and I lost weight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But 30 is the cutoff though, you're real close.  Have one of those bacon bags of bacon  and you're right over it.  I said man, this is crazy.  This was so clever, I love this.  Damon Real and Noah Rubin, they're musicians  and they wanted to do a good thing for the public domain.  So they generated every possible melody.  Wow.  Every possible, it's like brute forcing it.  Every possible melody within an octave.  And then they turned around  and they put it in the Creative Commons.  So that if you're, it's a lot, they don't actually say.  And by the way, these are eight note, 12 beat melody combos.  So they're not, it's not really every possible melody.  But it's every, but that's a common,  I'm not a musician, but I gather that that's common for music.  That's two bars.  The algorithm they wrote generates  300,000 melodies a second.  And once a work like this is committed to tangible format,  they put it on a hard drive, it's copyrighted.  And in MIDI format, the notes are just numbers  so they could easily fit it on a hard drive.  So isn't that great?  The data sets are-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The EFF has to get with these guys  and start suing everyone.  No, the idea is not to sue.  Yes, yes, just to prove how broken it is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I did see someone on Twitter,  Parker Higgins who works for Freedom of the Press  and who is an expert in copyright said  that this was a great-  Stunt.  Stunt, but that it doesn't actually mean  that you can't sue for copyrighted works.  I mean, he said you can't, you just,  the fact that you've simply reproduced  a whole bunch of potential melodies  doesn't make you copyrighted at the moment.  Yeah.  Matthew, I think we should start an algorithm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  going with every possible combination of words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, then every article will have been written out.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then no one would be able to copyright it.  It is about one point-  Sorry, this was based on,  or I don't know if they got the idea from it,  Quinn Norton mentioned something, I think in 2006,  that she came up with a conceptual prank  called Quinn's Symphonic Conundrum  that basically said get a computer program  to write every conceivable melody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's, you know, it's unknown  really what the impact of this would be,  but it's a great little hack,  1.2 terabytes, every melody possible.  Right, yeah.  And you can download it if you want all the melodies.  I imagine most of those melodies don't sound so good.  Yeah, I would love to have a demo of them, yeah.  No, but-  I'm downloading them, I'll play them for you.  In the right hands, though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  those things could sound good, you know?  The right arrangement. No.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, some of them will just sound off.  There are some combination of notes  that no matter Marvin Hamlisch or James Brown  could make them sound good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They also didn't include notes of different durations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but you don't have to because,  well, remember Ghostbusters, right?  Was it Niles Rodgers?  Who was it wrote Ghostbusters?  Got sued by Huey Lewis.  Oh, yeah. Because they said  Ghostbusters is the same melodic combination  as I Want a New Drug.  It isn't the same song, but that melody, right?  Even if one note's sustained longer  or maybe the rhythm's different,  the melody, the sequence of notes,  and they won, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I believe Vanilla Ice  was in a similar situation, too, for Samplin'.  He should have been.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's Samplin', that's another matter entirely.  The article quotes a more recent case.  I didn't know this, but you know,  Sam Smith Stayed With Me, which is a beautiful song.  Tom Petty claimed, that's my melody,  that's I Won't Back Down,  and eventually Smith gave Petty  co-writing credits and royalties,  which I feel bad.  I know this song sounds similar.  Do you remember what happened with The Verge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bittersweet Symphony?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  For a longest time, because they sampled something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they sampled, I think it was an orchestral track,  but it came from a Stones song,  so they actually took the songwriter's name off it  and put Mick Jagger and someone else on it,  and then eventually they-  Just a month or two ago, Mick gave it back.  Yeah, yeah, gave it back to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mick said, you know what?  In fact, he gave all the royalties back, which is, yeah.  That's pretty cool.  That's really cool.  Not that it's a great song or anything, but the beginning-  It was done that it even happened.  Well, it was a sample, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but to take the credits off it  so that someone doesn't even get paid for it,  Mick certainly didn't need any more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm guessing it wasn't Mick, probably.  It was probably the-  No, no, I don't think it was him.  Usually it isn't.  The music company that holds-  The lawyers.  Usually it isn't.  It's always the lawyers.  I thought that was kind of a neat story.  It is.  Did I leave anything out?  Intuit's gonna buy Credit Karma for $7 billion.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't even know what Credit Karma did, actually.  I just see the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I've used it.  It's great.  It gives you your credit score.  I wanna say FICO score.  Oh, that's right, that's right.  I got confused with something else.  I knew it was one of those.  Yes, yes, sorry.  And it's kinda like, you know, Intuit has Mint also,  which makes money by offering you better deals,  you know, and stuff like that,  and gives you actually a pretty darn good service.  Kind of the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the hiring of Bruce Schneier by Sertanlou.  I love that.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Schneier, who is really one of my favorite guys ever  in the security group.  So next to Steve, a security guru.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go to the article and look at the caption under the photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I'm gonna go to Schneier.  It's on Schneier's blog.  Is that where you're talking about?  No, the register.  Oh, I didn't see the registers.  Look at the caption under the photo.  All right, let's go back to the rundown.  There's so many things in the rundown.  Here it is.  Go.theregister.co.uk.  Sir Tim Swains.  HTTP colon slash slash WWW.tim.burners.lee  slash index.html.  That's the caption in the picture of TB.  I like that.  That's hysterical.  That guy should get an award.  Tim always said, I never thought humans  would ever see HTTP colon slash slash.  That was for machines.  I never intended anybody to see a URL.  But let alone say it on TV.  Let alone say it on TV.  Let alone say backslash versus forward slash.  Aren't you glad that we don't have to do that anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember in ads, in ads people would actually say that.  HTTP colon slash slash.  HTTP colon slash slash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I fought a battle at Tech TV.  Because I said, look, you're talking to geeks.  You don't have to say HTTP colon slash slash.  And you don't have to say WWW.  And they've been believing for a long time.  They put the full thing in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  WWW is twice as long to say as World Wide Web.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good choice for an abbreviation.  Anyway, so Sir Tim created something called SOLID.  Which is actually composed of social linked data.  But the notion is you have a kind of a vault  with your personal data in it.  Which you control and you only give that data  to people who offer you something you think worth a while.  So, because he was really concerned about privacy on the web  and who controls your data.  So SOLID is a brilliant idea.  They created a company called INRUPT.  We talked about it and it was kind of,  I don't know how clear I was about what its plans were.  But the idea is INRUPT is going to use the SOLID technology  to enable people to do this.  How this works, I have no idea.  You'd have to convince Facebook and Google  to give up everything they know about you  and put it in a vault and then they have to buy it back.  So that's gonna happen.  Or they could federate.  I mean, anyway, Bruce Schneier who is awesome  posted a blog post on Friday saying,  hey I just wanted to let you know  I've taken a job with INRUPT.  He is gonna be their Chief of Security Architecture.  He's actually been doing it since last summer.  He just didn't tell anybody.  I love Bruce.  He's one of my favorite geeks.  And now he's working on this project  which seems a long shot but boy,  if you've got people like Tim Berners-Lee  and Bruce Schneier behind it, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe.  I mean, what has Tim done recently though, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What have you done for us recently?  Someone knows some pretty good people are working there  but I just don't understand how you're gonna convince  the companies that right now,  their lifeblood is your data to give it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know what would be interesting?  I think there's a move, pressure I think for  people who don't necessarily wanna bust Facebook  or Google up, there's pressure to get them to open up  to federate data-wise or to make interacting with them  and getting data in and out easier.  So that might be a way that they could connect.  It's an open framework.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they must think that this is doable.  They wouldn't be, these great guys wouldn't be working on it.  I hope it is.  Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right,  BA start has left the building.  Rest easy, my man.  The Konami code was actually an unintentional cheat code  created by Kazuhisa Hashimoto.  He passed away on Tuesday, he was just 61.  He was working on a port in 1986  for the Konami arcade game, Gradius,  and he created that cheat code just for testing.  He thought, well, nobody will ever figure that one out.  It is an Easter egg that has been used in games ever since.  And I love Konami's tweet with Kazuhisa's famous quote,  up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA start.  When I worked at the Globe and Mail

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and the website wasn't that old,  some programmers and I were talking about stuff  that would be cool to do, and one of them said,  we should, I rigged up this thing  where if you type in the Konami code,  you get all these flashing graphics and little.  That's so cool.  And across the page.  So we implemented it, and then I tweeted about it.  And then someone came and told us to take it down.  What?  Because we're afraid that readers would think  that we'd been hacked.  So they basically said you have to uninstall it.  Oh man.  It was really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would like to write a program  that calculates the wasted amount of man and woman hours.  People have spent typing up, up, down, down, left, right,  left, right, BA start all the time everywhere  just to see what would happen.  Just in case, yeah.  Just in case.  Fortnite had it.  Yeah.  During their black hole event last year.  Oh, did it?  Yeah, a little special mini game.  Stadia apparently has the Konami code  on the back of the controllers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember the gamer boy of the household  bringing the Konami code to my attention.  He was just so thrilled when he found it.  And I was like, yeah, that's been around  since before you were born, son.  God, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's 1987.  It was Contra, the game that made the code known.  You got 30 lives instead of three  when you were playing.  And apparently Contra was on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Game with some of the best theme music ever.  Really?  Yes.  I don't remember it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Castlevania also used it.  Metal Gear, Dance Dance Revolution.  You see it everywhere.  Up, down, up, down, left, right, left, right, BA.  It's awesome.  Yeah.  If you type that code on our podcast.  Oh, I didn't know this.  On our website, Patrick Delahaney just told me  you can download all of our shows for free.  Unlocks all of our shows.  How many shows is that now, Patrick?  All free.  Just type it on the website.  And then all, that's an amazing amount of content.  At one point, I think it was several months  of nonstop listening.  That's just mind boggling.  Free.  Wow.  Absolutely free, too.  Don't tell anybody about that because, man,  we could, that could be a problem.  Well see, now you just opened the floodgates

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for Mr. Delahaney to have to watch the bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh-oh.  Oh no.  He's not gonna be as happy about that.  Would you like to do, I think you should.  Ant, you're gonna do your last Black History Month  pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure.  There's actually two.  Because this one was, one was unexpected  with Miss Katherine Johnson.  Unexpected, she was 101.  Yeah, 101 years old.  She, if you don't know who she is,  she was one of the key people in the Apollo mission  for mathematics and helping to handle all the calculations  for the hidden figures.  Yep, the hidden figures.  If you haven't seen that movie yet, Run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, great movie.  It is a great movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do not walk, run.  Taraji Henson, I think that's her name, plays her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That movie was so inspiring.  It was.  It made me cry, it made me laugh.  It was just such a great movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you hear about a lot of that stuff  and you think about, hey, she got that job at NASA  at the Black only side of NASA.  So sad.  So crazy.  Well, she had two strikes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because she was also a woman.  Right.  And there's a scene where they have to walk  to another building because there's no women's bathroom  in the building that they're in.  It's just crazy the times.  She was the third African American  to get a PhD in mathematics, graduated summa cum laude  from West Virginia State with degrees in mathematics  and French at the age of 18.  Brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant.  Couldn't find a job because she was Black.  So she became a school teacher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So crazy.  Did you see someone mentioned how great it was  that she had carefully calculated that she would die  at 101 so that she would die in her prime.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm glad she lived so long.  Man, wrist is nice.  Now talk about somebody who deserves a Medal of Honor.  That's amazing. Indeed.  Amazing person.  It was because of her calculations that she was,  Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong were able to set foot  on the moon in 1969.  Yeah, Buzz said if she said the numbers are good,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  then I'm gonna go.  That's right. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She said so. What a vote of confidence, right?  Because they're not doing this on a HP 99A or whatever.  They're doing this on a chalkboard.  Yeah, she's doing it all by hand.  The chalkboards were so tall they had to climb up ladders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's fascinating and just remarkable woman.  Condolences to the family,  but thank you for your contributions to the community.  And a Medal of Honor winner as you should be.  And my next one is more personal  and I wanted to ask a question to you and Mr. Jarvis  since you two are the old folks, if you will.  Hey. Hey.  Hey.  All right, so we have had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't play this because Aunt Pruitt will take it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll take it down if you play it.  No, you can play it.  But I put up a YouTube video from my channel  and it's basically just rehashing a conversation  I had with my late grandfather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't play all 10 minutes.  Where should I go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's about halfway through.  But it's just, I want you to think about when we heard  that Kobe Bryant was killed and that horrible crash  with all of those other people,  we felt a certain way.  You bet.  Now I want to think back to when more monumental,  I hate saying it that way,  people were assassinated, killed or whatever.  So think back to what you felt when Kennedy was assassinated.  I'll never forget it.  And what about you, Mr. Jarvis?  I was in third grade.  Can you remember that?  Can you remember the feeling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can remember our, I was in a friend's school,  the Quaker School in South Jersey in third grade.  And the custodian for the school was a minister  of a nearby African American church  who had to do that to earn money  because the church didn't pay enough.  I remember him coming to the little window  and looking in to tell the teacher what was happening  with tears in his eyes.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was same age and I'll never forget walking down  Thayer Street in Providence, I was walking home  and it was deserted, but all the stores had radios  and speakers and I'm walking down from store to store  hearing about the assassination.  I remember watching Lee Harvey Oswald get shot  by Jack Ruby on live TV.  I mean, remember seeing Walter Cronkite crying.  I mean, you don't, even if you're only in third grade,  you don't fully understand what's going on.  You don't forget that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  It stuck with you.  It's the type of emotion  that you're never gonna forget that.  Now, my story with my grandfather,  we talked about the assassination  of Dr. Martin Luther King.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Same thing.  Boy, I remember in 1968 waking up  and Bobby had been shot and then MLK got shot same year  in 1968, devastating.  I just felt like the world was coming to an end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you see, I'm looking at you in your eyes  and I can just see that you can feel something  with that news.  It really takes you back.  When I spoke with my grandfather about this,  he comes in, he says, I got home from work  and I walked in the house to tell my grandmother, hey.  And instead of saying, did you hear about the news  about Dr. King getting shot?  He walks in and he says, they finally got him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I've heard this story from so many African-Americans  because you knew it was gonna happen.  Even King knew it was gonna happen.  And I'm like, man, just.  You knew immediately, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What thought process is that to say,  okay, they finally got him.  That was the way he and my grandparent,  my elders was just living.  That was the life of the 60s.  And I'm so glad we don't have to deal  with that type of environment anymore.  But I just wanted to just raise awareness about that.  And we gotta continue to do good.  And if you wanna go watch that video, go watch it.  It's there.  It's just a different perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm so glad you made this.  It's called, Finally Got Him.  I'm so glad you made this.  This is Ant's personal channel on YouTube,  createanddominate, youtube.com.  Is it slash Ant Pruitt?  That's it.  P-R-U-I-A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I made that video pretty much like a year ago to the day.  It was right about this time.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But thank you for watching it.  Yeah, thank you for making that.  I think that's great.  I think that's great.  Jeff Jarvis, a number, sir?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is a whole mess of numbers.  The, and recent Horowitz put out an analysis  that they call the Marketplace 100 of online marketplaces.  And they got the gross merchandise value  from anonymized credit card receipts  from a source called Second Measure.  And they came up with 100.  And it's amazing, the list.  These are 100 what?  Biggest?  Airbnb, DoorDash, Instacart, Postmates.  Yeah, I see them, but what are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  100 what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're online marketplaces.  Like based on volume?  Based on the, I just said this a minute ago.  You gotta listen to me.  The gross merchandise value.  How much do you spend?  What does that even freaking mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You mean how much people spend with them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Companies list the list within rank  using a common industry metric,  which is extrapolated from how many total dollars  consumers are spending against each company.  This provides an approximate measure of a marketplace's  scale and its importance in the economy.  Now mind you, it says here by the way  that these things are becoming so important now.  Ride sharing platforms alone account for  roughly 1% of US household income.  There are an estimated 75 million gig workers in the US.  That's what this is about.  Now what's amazing is the first four,  Airbnb, DoorDash, Instacart, Postmates,  account for three quarters of the revenue, 76%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is in dollars spent or is there a percentage  of the total, it's just raw dollars spent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe so, they could have said that simpler, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sounds like it's a different statistical thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well see if you read it differently above that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like it's not, let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The top three are geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The companies on this list were then ranked  using a common industry metric, gross merchandise value.  So they turned to data and anonymized aggregated  US consumer spending data captured via credit cards,  debit cards, bank cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why is each of these in a, oh no,  there's just different categories.  Categories are irrelevant.  Strip up, yes.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they got the methodology all there.  What's striking is all these I've never heard of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This would be more valuable if they put a number  next to it so I would know.  It really would be.  If you go down lower you start to see the breakdown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But tons of these things, Rover, ClassPass, Zola,  Turo, Spot Hero, Goat, I've never heard of these.  They're the top hundred for what is becoming  a huge segment of the economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See this is gross market value that I don't know about.  Spot Hero is really useful.  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What Matthew?  Spot Hero is useful.  Okay.  They each count for one third of all gross market value

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in the category.  So it's by, so what it's saying I think  is how dominant any individual company is in its category.  So Airbnb has the largest share of the travel market  of any company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But two and four, DoorDash and Postmates  are both in the food and beverage category  so it's not the largest.  Well DoorDash.  Is largest relevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know it's confusing.  Yeah I don't think they're saying that Airbnb  is related in any way to DoorDash.  The comparison is their percentage of their category.  Right.  Is what I think I'm understanding  which is a very complicated weird thing.  So Airbnb owns 58% of all the spending,  all the market value in travel.  DoorDash owns 57% of all the market value  in food and beverage.  Like that.  It actually is 30, the numbers are 38%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Airbnb is 38, DoorDash 17, Instacart 15, boom you got it.  Postmates six and then goes into a long tail.  Still pretty high.  Which is to say that in that you know,  I guess Postmates, it's a top four marketplace.  It only has 6% of its category.  Then there's a lot more.  Well no, no, no, no, no.  Actually no, take that back down Leo, no.  38, 17, 15 and six.  Does that up to 76?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're in different categories.  That's what I'm so confused with this is.  I don't.  Uh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's GMV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pretty much all the numbers.  I didn't see what I was gonna read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some sort of GMV is something that,  some sort of economist.  The fastest growing marketplace categories  are celebrity engagement.  What?  I know, I don't know what that means.  Instagram.  I think this is a joke.  Ha ha ha.  It's reasonable.  I'd like to understand a little more.  I'll have to read this more closely.  Yeah, I should have.  What is a marketplace company?  Yeah, it's interesting.  What's GOAT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what means greatest of all time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  These numbers are hurting my head, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks a lot.  Yeah, for a number.  By the way, the sort of number thing was accidental.  How did you get something at the end of the show?  You don't have to do a number.  You said, oh Jeff, you can come up with a number every week.  It's actually a pain in the ass.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I go on Twitter.  A little rebellion.  And a number.  What do I do for a number?  I spend an hour looking around for freaking numbers.  By the way, GOAT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You come up with a number.  That's your job.  Get ready for this.  Every show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  GOAT, which is one of the four fastest growing companies  by year over year relative growth,  is a peer to peer marketplace for buying and selling  authenticated street wear and sneakers.  You should have known that, Matthew.  If you wanted to get your Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Earth,  you would go to GOAT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you say that shoe description again?  That's the Yeezy Boost.  You know that, the 350 V2 Earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know that.  I see you wearing Yeezy Boosts all the time.  Here's the Rui Hachimura edit.  This is, you know what Jeff, what you have brought us  is a world, a whole new world that I don't even understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's my point.  All this stuff, you can go buy things.  People are buying it.  I've never heard of some of these.  Are you fair?  Wholesale official without the hassle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pick, okay.  How much do you think it would cost for a Yeezy Boost?  Oh, they're not that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're cheap.  I was figuring at least 200, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it depends on the size.  If you're four, it's cheap.  Let's see, I'm a nine.  345 bucks.  That's not too bad.  That's crazy.  Oh wait a minute, buy new with defects?  That's asinine.  I guess they're more expensive if they have imperfections.  And then apparently the used ones are completely sold out.  I don't understand.  Yeah, because they're cheaper.  They're $100 cheaper used.  That's an ugly ass sneaker.  Would you wear that?  Negative.  That looks like a lizard.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope, that's the Yeezy Boost Marsh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's what Neil Armstrong and Buzz wore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know what this category is.  It's a Yeezy Supplies.  Yeah.  It's book a personalized video message from a celebrity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, those are very popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Debbie Gibson, 150 bucks.  Michael Rappaport, 150 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo Laporte, $2.50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Larry Thomas, the soup Nazi, 60 bucks.  What, really?  Everybody's doing it.  Jim O'Hare from Parks and Recreation, 135.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I pay a lot of money to get Ron Swanson.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Guess Gilbert Gottfried.  Gilbert?  How much does it cost to get a Gilbert Gottfried?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How perv- 150.  It's cheap.  Oh, bless his heart.  It's cheap.  It's sad.  Come on.  The saddest thing ever I bought,  the guy who did You've Got Mail.  No.  Was selling.  And I bought, it wasn't too expensive.  You've got mail, you twit.  I wish I could find that.  Derwood, his name was Derwood something.  And he was selling that online.  Literally, he didn't live long enough for this.  Maybe he's still alive, I shouldn't say that.  I think he's probably not.  For the celebrity marketplace,  he could really cash in now.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody got, somebody used that service  and got a guy from an 80s or 90s boy band  to break up with his girlfriend, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  This is sad.  This is a category.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, like Kim Kardashian, expensive?  How much did you pay for that?

Transcript:  Gilbert got.  Somebody keep up with this.  And it's an industry.  It's a frigging industry now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but I guess Gilbert probably goes in the studio,  records 10 of them, he just made 1500 bucks, right?  And he's done.  Easy cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Easy cash.  Then he goes and buys some Yeezys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem, yeah, that's a Yeezy right there.  That's just a left Yeezy.  The problem with it is you're gonna throw your voice out  because the temptation is, well, you're not gonna do 10.  If I'm gonna do 10, I might do 100.  That's a lot more money, right?  Maybe I'll do 200.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I presume there's another use for your voice these days.  You, yes.  Gilbert, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody would pay for my voice.  Sure they would.  But remember, that was the prize on Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me?  Was the, to get him to record your voice machine.  Wait, wait, don't tell me.  That was the prize.  How old is that?  They had the great announcer.  No, it's not that old.  It's NPR.  Yeah, NPR.  He passed away, but Carl Castle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I was gonna pick the guys who programmed  like every possible melody, but you guys already used that one.  I stole it.  But I did find one that I thought was amusing,  but also disturbing.  So do you remember there was an NSA program  where they could basically record phone calls  and text and capture them  and when they were searching for terrorists.  So this program cost $100 million  between 2015 and 2019.  And they just admitted that they got a single useful  piece of information out of that program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One.  This whole time they were saying,  you have no idea how valuable this is in fighting terrorism.  One.  But we won't tell you, but you have no idea.  Apparently it's not.  A single one, 100 million bucks.  Yeah.  But now they have all the recordings.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now they gotta pay to start.  They use it for, okay, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they sold them to Google.  Yeah.  And here finally, my pick, the Smithsonian has just announced  that they are going to put,  they're gonna digitize much of their collection,  put images, recordings, all sorts of stuff  from the Smithsonian up.  Millions of them in the public domain.  19 museums, nine research centers,  libraries, archives, the National Zoo.  If you're looking for, oh, and they even have remixes.  This is why you put stuff in the public domain,  because of the way people can use it and have fun with it.  All these images, all this fun stuff.  Completely free, open source.  2.8 million?  Oh, my media editors.  And they're adding more too.  Yeah, they're constantly digitizing.  This is our tax dollars at work.  This is great.  We do own this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this was announced a month or so ago, I believe.  I just saw the story.  It's been a little while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is so good.  It's good stuff.  Look at that one, Honor King and Racism.  This is a poster carried in the 1960 at Memphis March.  Outstanding.  Isn't that great?  So I thought I'd mention that,  and you can find it at si.edu, the Smithsonian Institution.  Si.edu slash open access.  Ladies and gentlemen, I think we should wrap this up,  because there's nothing better than going down  to San Francisco and catching the coronavirus  from a bunch of hopped up techies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they just announced there's a case  in Northern California.  So don't, these guys are gonna be on the air live  24 hours a day for the next 14 days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, that's a good idea.  We'll lock ourselves in the studio.  And just quarantine.  I can't look scared.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't wanna do that, you don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to find a corner I could sleep in.
