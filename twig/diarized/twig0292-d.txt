Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No doctor, not even master.  D-O-C-K-T-E-R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Master Jarvis.  Google dot com slash plus Jeff Jarvis.  He's at BuzzMachine dot com, the author of many a great book including geeks bearing  gifts.  His latest.  Good to see you Jeff.  At home, not in the soggy office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good to see you.  I was going to do an unboxing of my Pixel but I saw you did that with yours.  Well you can unbox it later if you want.  Have you used it?  Not much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's open but it's fast.  I'm reviewing it for before you buy tomorrow.  In fact I think I have some other things to show you.  We'll talk in a bit.  But let me tell you having used it for almost a week now I love it.  Really?  I am converted.  Wow.  We'll save that.  We will.  Because we have a great guest here today.  Important guest.  Very important.  I'm so glad to welcome Matthew Ingram back.  Matthew Ingram dot com of course.  Many time contributor to the show and all of our shows.  We love having him on.  And he had a referral seat at the desolation of Giga Ohm.  But you're doing okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm doing okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We just think the world of you.  We think actually the world of everybody at Giga Ohm.  That was a terrible loss.  We talked about it.  It happened while we were doing the show I think.  Wow.  I think so didn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway great to have you Matthew and just want to have your continued contribution.  You're not going back to the print.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what everybody wrote about you was how Matthew Ingram boldly made the decision  to go from a print newspaper the Globe and Mail right?  Which is Toronto's greatest newspaper.  Actually Canada's greatest newspaper.  The Toronto Metro one of two.  Toronto has two papers.  Three.  Three.  How'd that happen?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love the newspaper.  The Globe and Mail love reading it.  But you decided to go digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When did you do that?  January 2010.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was there an internet then?  There was.  And so Giga Ohm was your first gig so to speak.  It was.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I worked for the digital sort of unit of the newspaper for a few years and then made the  jump to digital only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But not back to no ink anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sort of reviewing a number of options but I would not go back to just print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you all stayed in touch with one another Kevin and Yonko?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact we still talk daily.  We use Slack.  Oh that's neat.  We just started using that a few months ago and we sort of got used to just talking all  the time so we're still doing it.  Everybody's trying to figure out what they're doing next and so it's kind of a support group  at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it was Stacey who as soon as the announcement happened, immediately was tweeting the great  talent at Giga Ohm and it's impressive to see a boss look out for her chicks and look  out for her colleagues before whining about yourself.  Stacey Higginbott?  That was Laura Owen I think.  That's right.  One of the chicks.  Yes.  Now that's the bad word to say.  I meant little birds.  One of the baby ducks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One of the baby ducks is what he's saying.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  No we're a pretty tight group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm glad to hear that actually.  That bodes well frankly in my experience.  Tech TV, the dissolution of Tech TV, same thing.  We all work tight and we've all since helped each other and created our own ventures and  so that worked out very well I think.  Having a Tech TV mafia, you'll now have the Giga Ohm mafia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the one, it's one of the things I'm going to miss.  I see the money as another thing but I'm definitely going to miss that group.  I think we all liked each other, respected each other, worked pretty well together, enjoyed  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's really honestly why Twitch started is I wanted to keep talking to my buddies.  Seriously, I missed the conversations we would have.  The motivation.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway, let's talk about, I have actually not one but two new Chromebooks and Jeff,  time for me to eat crow.  Whoa.  History book.  Yeah.  Well, you remember I was pretty dismissive.  You know, you've been nice.  We've been a shtick of it.  I've been dismissive of the Chromebook and a lot of people still are.  They say, oh, it's just a browser pretending to be a computer but a few things have happened.  One is obvious, it's become more and more capable over time and there's more and more  Chrome extensions.  There's now Chrome apps which act pretty, in fact Chrome OS has become in many respects  a full-blown OS.  You've got apps, you've got a toolbar and all that.  What was missing, I think, was decent hardware, to be frank.  Most Chromebooks, 200 to 300 dollars, they're junky.  They're net forks.  They're tinny.  Yeah.  So, now having played with the new Google, let me log into this before you show it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The new Pixel.  I have mine set up so I can log in with my watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is awesome.  If you have Android 5 on your device, your watch will do it?  I mean my phone.  God, if the watch did it, that would be really awesome.  But if you have Android 5 on your smartphone, yeah, it'll just log in automatically.  The screen is spectacular, as good as any Retina Air.  It's weird, 3.2 still.  In fact, it's in every way the same except Type-C connector now which I really like.  And there's two of them so you could put power on either side, video on either side, USB  still there.  It still has an SD card slot which is kind of a bad tease because I can't really do anything  with it.  I shoot raw so it doesn't...  There's no point in putting a card in there.  Although it does mount flush which means you could use this as extra storage.  You put a 128GB SD card in there.  That's like a second hard drive if you wish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I tried to go to Best Buy and Apple to buy a C to HDMI connector and you can't get it  yet.  Not yet.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and you can get them online.  And Apple sells a $79 dongle which really is overpriced.  So there's a couple of needed accessories.  That's certainly one is cheap Type-C interfaces.  And I'm sure Monoprice will do them because it's not proprietary.  It's not the MagSafe adapter.  You know, Intel, Google and Apple all involve the Type-C.  It's a standard.  So as far as I can tell, I've been doing a lot of inquiries, this is a standard, standard,  standard.  Power and everything.  You could, for instance, have a Type-C power adapter from another manufacturer, plug it  in and it would work fine.  Even if the wattage isn't the same, it will trickle charge it or fast charge it or not  use all the power available.  It'll work.  The other accessory that's needed is Steve Gibson came up with this and if anybody wants  to steal this idea and do a Kickstarter, I encourage you.  He says you need a Type-C condom because there is this issue that Type-C is not just power,  it's full USB data.  So the bad USB hack, which means that you can use this to modify the firmware on USB  drives and make them very potent malware transportation devices, is a potential problem here.  We could put a charging station in a coffee shop that would infect.  Now the good news about Chromebooks is there's nothing really to infect.  These are very, very secure.  But nonetheless, certainly for the MacBook you'll want this.  It would be simple enough to make a Type-C male to female cable that just carried the  power lines, not any of the data.  And you'd carry that with you, you'd use that all the time.  Then you could safely connect to anything.  So that's a good marketing.  They shouldn't be more than a buck or two.  There's no special stuff in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm figuring 59 bucks from Apple before you know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  By the way, it's March 18th today, Jason, just not March.  Good catch.  I am really impressed with the keyboard, the screen, the trackpad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everything works very well.  The hinge is more solid.  The hinge was good before, but it's really good now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't mind the screen that it's 3.2?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's weird, but you get used to it.  Yeah, no, it's fine for me.  One thing that has really improved in the Chromebook is the ability to handle different  size screens.  And I'll use that with this.  I'll use this as an example.  This is a new, this came out today.  This is a new Acer Chromebook with a 15-inch screen.  And one of the things that's made it hard for me to recommend Chromebooks to is the  natural users of Chromebooks are older people, right, who really don't need anything more  complex than a browser and email program, things like that.  Chromebooks are perfect for them.  They just can't get in trouble with them.  But the screens have been so crappy and small, it's hard to recommend it.  Even I have a hard time reading it.  Can you hide the screen real quickly while I log into my Google account on this?  This one, I'll show you what I've done.  Because you have 15 inches now, you can make this very easy to look at because you now  have two things you can change.  You can change the standard browser's zoom size and you can change the standard text  size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's not the small type problem of the other HD Chromebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is so easy to use.  You see how big that, I can make it even bigger.  See how big it is.  And on a 15 inch screen, which is a 1080p screen, potentially these could be very small,  but they're actually quite usable, I think.  So I think Google has solved a lot of the little things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And how much is that Acer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  300 bucks.  So I've customized the fonts to be very large, but you can even go more in here.  You can change the kind of font.  There's a lot of information there you can use to your heart's content to make it legible.  And then you can set the standard page zoom, which I've set to 150% on here, just kind  of as example.  Now, some of the icons on the Chrome, the user interface, are still small, but usable.  And it's not touch.  It's not nearly as good a screen as the Pixel.  The thing that's great about the Pixel is it feels so fast, so fluid, so easy, and this  isn't even the LS version, that some of the qualms about using a Chromebook go away.  It feels like it's a real computer.  The speed is already impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got the LS.  You did?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Both.  Okay, so the Acer...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's my only machine.  I might as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's where I live with.  Right.  Why not?  200 bucks, 300 bucks more?  The Acer boots in seven seconds.  This thing, let me just do a reboot.  It feels like it's almost instant, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what's so great, too, you mentioned this last week, too, is the setup is nothing.  Every time I have to change machines, it's, oh, it was a day.  It really is.  I forgot that.  And then you turn it on and give it about four minutes and it's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So let's see how fast it takes to boot.  I just shut it off.  Just tap 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004.  Did I tap it?  No, it didn't shut off yet.  It takes a second to shut off.  Okay.  Is it off?  How do you even know?  No light on the front.  1001, 1002, 1003.  I love the screen backup.  That's it.  Like almost instant, like four or five seconds.  Yeah.  This is kind of fun, too.  The rainbow little doohickey here.  You double tap it and you can see how much battery life is left, which is great.  So I'm 100% charged.  And the battery life, you haven't experienced this yet, Jeff.  Nine to 12 hours, easy.  Oh, really?  So it's legit.  Oh, it's legit.  And same thing with this Acer because it's so big.  It's all battery in the instance.  Right.  That is fabulous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These are heavier than Ares.  That's the one thing.  They're not skinny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it feels like something, it's a utilitarian air.  Yeah, it's solid.  Square edges, you know.  It's very googly.  I love it.  I'm very happy with it.  I think you're going to like yours a lot.  I'm curious what you say with the Ludicrous Speed version.  Go ahead, Bethany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's nothing you want to do on a computer that you can't do on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a few things.  I like to do computer programming.  I can't do most kinds of computer programming.  You can do app inventors and stuff like that, web-based programming, but I can't do the  stuff I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can dual boot to, not dual boot, but dual build to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I played with Linux on this.  I decided not to do that.  The one thing I have done, I have SSH on here.  And so the one thing I have done is I can SSH to my Linux box and have a Linux command  line easily.  Right.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, Matthew, the only thing is you don't edit video on it.  You can't video or photo.  I mean, you can, but...  Photo, you can't.  I mean, you don't do what Leo does with his raw files on photo.  But for what I do, for, you know, let me get a photo for a Medium post, easy as pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can also use remote desktop.  So I'm going to remote desktop into my Mac Pro at home.  And don't look.  We have a security pin, which I've just entered.  And now I can use my computer at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it one, two, three, four?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, shoot, you saw.  You saw.  So I'm having some screen issues, but this is probably because I have my computer at  home set a ridiculous screen resolution.  But basically this is, that's my computer at home I'm looking at.  This screen is my Mac Pro.  So you can, in fact, I guess do what you want.  But I think if you had, I think what you need is a desktop that can do all that stuff.  And then this could be your notebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, listen, I think when you get, if I had Google Fiber at full speed, you start  to see doing video remotely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  There is a remote video plugin.  We video will do video editing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And listen, it's always taken time to download the video to the machine.  You just upload it to the cloud instead.  And as long as you can get response there and the rendering is going to be faster up  in the cloud than it is going to be on a local machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As more stuff uses HTML5, as Chrome gets more powerful, I love this little app drawer.  And by the way, you get this on Windows and Mac now too, where you have what look, I mean,  for all intents and purposes, this looks like the taskbar on Windows with all my icons here.  Wash your mouth out.  Well, I mean, it's okay.  The dock, you have a start button where you have, you know, these are the apps I have.  I can swipe through them, which is great.  And these, you know, it's pretty much everything I want.  The speakers on this are pretty decent still.  I think the old Pixel had very good speakers.  These are still pretty good here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there is a lot of, you know, image editing and even sort of minor video editing that  you can do in the cloud.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's not like my TweetDeck app is great, you know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You think I'm pretty without any makeup on.  You think I'm funny without makeup on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just assumed it would be all about the bass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I can play that.  No, that's fine.  I hate that song.  So I think in general, this is like 90% of what most people do with their computing anyway.  Yeah.  100% in some cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I was thinking, yeah, you go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm trying to talk students into doing it.  You know, those who need to do video editing, no, not yet.  But everybody else, it's far cheaper.  And I was talking, when I went last week to Madrid, I went to PRISA, the giant media company  there with El Pais.  And they have an education arm.  They're doing fascinating things in Brazil with a company that basically handles everything  for a school from curriculum through technology.  And they, of course, because this is for well-to-do students or families, they have iPads.  And I'm yelling at them saying, no, no, get Chromebooks.  So much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, it makes sense for students for sure.  And I think for older folks as well.  I'm thinking about my mom.  You know, I got her a shitty netbook and it's garbage.  And I'm thinking, do I get her a tablet?  Should I get her a Chromebook?  You know, I want something that she can do things with, but that's not going to cause  a lot of problems where I have to do tech support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think one of the things that's kind of intriguing is maybe we aren't paying enough for these  though.  Maybe we, this is, this pixel has shown me kind of, it really is a better experience  with a better hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where is the $600?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the $999 one, I think this is the one people should get.  I know it sounds expensive, but this is going to last you for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Leo, now that I have a Chromebook with lightning speed, I think I should abandon  Skype and go back to the Hangouts at State.  There's one thing you can't do, although I imagine that's just around the corner at

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  some point.  Yeah, I hope so.  Anyway, that's kind of, I scooped my before you buy review, but that's basically right  there at the review.  I'm impressed.  I'm really impressed.  Hey.  And I feel like it should be, people should think about getting it.  I know $999 sounds like, geez, I don't know.  But I've always said that there's a false economy to getting cheap hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it that much better than that Acer you showed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, God, that's a good question.  The Acer is a pretty good choice if you want a big screen.  What's nice, that's the other thing that's nice is there's an ecosystem starting to evolve  where they're not all the same.  The Acer is the first real, I mean, the 15 inch, that's the first 15 inch screen.  And that, I mean, it really looks nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the Toshiba is nice, except that it's HD and the type is just too small for the  old eyes.  Right.  What I want, what I think I said in the show before is what I really want is I want to  go back to the original days of Dell where you could truly customize your own machine.  If I could get a machine from Dell with a touchscreen and LTE and lots of memory and  I think you could put together the ultimate machine, which wouldn't probably cost 999,  but would probably cost about 800 bucks, 750.  And it'd be a great machine and would have everything I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say not having LTE, I think you mentioned that, Jeff, that's torturing  me.  And it's strange.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why wouldn't it have it?  My guess is 85%, they say, of the users of Chromebooks or Googlers, and they live enveloped  by a warm cloud of Wi-Fi and through their entire lives.  Most of us are now.  Well, many of us.  I go into offices, you know, I was at a market yesterday and their tech department does,  you know, makes you give blood tests to get on and we'll put Chromebooks on.  Silly.  So, you know, the LTE just connects and that's it.  And I'm on, no problem.  But not anymore.  Now I have to pull out a little box.  And what do you want?  Who's your advertiser now for Wi-Fi connectivity?  Wi-Fi?  Do you have one?  I don't think so.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't you get some new thing?  Jeff, you mentioned.  Karma.  I did the Karma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which the advantage of the Karma is you pay for the gigs no expiry.  So if you want to buy 10 gigs, you buy 10 gigs.  When you use it up, you use it up.  And I think it's $14 a gig, which is a little high.  But if you realize nothing ever expires, you're not buying a monthly.  That makes more sense.  It's on Sprint.  Is it good coverage?  It's Sprint.  I don't know what it was.  Tingle?  Ting?  Ting.  Ting.  Ting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tingles that other service that you use.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With chicks.  Yeah.  So Ting, I don't know whether they have.  Yeah, now you can buy Sims from them and do no more just CDMA.  But I don't know if they have just data accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why, if Google's going to do a wireless MVNO anyway, why wouldn't they?  Maybe that's what's going on is they're not going to put LTE in here until they have their  own LTE card to put in.  Right.  Oh, baby.  That would be the way to do it.  Right.  So they're going to have to do Sprint slash T-Mobile slash Wi-Fi for very little money.  Why would that?  Maybe that's what we're waiting for.  Maybe they are going to.  They haven't.  Have they said, no, we're not going to do LTE?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Reporters asked and said, you know, it wasn't like they were saying, as you thought last  week, oh, it'll come out in two weeks.  You know, apparently not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That I believe, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if they did something.  Or maybe they'll do a Wi-Fi card with their new MVNO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because if you have a laptop that only works on the internet, then you kind of need to  make people some way to always have the internet.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This works offline in a lot of respects, but it is of course better with online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I tweet offline?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you need to tweet offline?  Do you really want to?  It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you want to tweet from your flight?  You can't mere cap from it either.  What?  What?  What good is that?  You could have Google Hangouts.  That's so funny because mere cat really isn't anything new at all.  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's just no, no, no, not in any way in any way.  The name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and the easy, I guess, onboarding.  I don't know.  Okay.  I don't know.  The concept is not new.  No.  And it's like it where it's like, oh, we've never seen anything like this.  It's so strange.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  Matthew Ingram is here.  So great to have him.  You want to point people to your website, Matthew Ingram dot com.  Best place to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure.  I'm I'm currently reconfiguring it.  So again, it's all under construction.  But yeah, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jason Snell did and just create your own thing.  You know, it's so we're so close.  You could do a people love you.  You could do a Patreon.  You could you could figure something out and do it.  Are you tempted at all to go your own way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am. I definitely am.  I mean, I'm tempted.  I'm tempted.  I wrote one of the last things I wrote was about Ben Thompson, who who runs a blog called  Spritecary.  Yeah.  Super smart guy.  Way smarter than I am.  So that model might not work for me, but I'm the fact that he's you know, he's got thousands  of subscribers and he's making a living and he and he works on his own time and does what  he wants and writes a newsletter.  And I mean, that kind of thing is super appealing.  But I I just don't know.  You know, I I have certain income requirements.  You know, I have kids in university and and a wife and so on.  I can't just sort of take six months off and see if I can make money on sort of crowdsourcing.  But I mean, I've written enough about it.  It's it's it's hugely appealing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Ben is like Karis Dettie.  He's he's an analyst.  And so this stuff feels like analytics.  And you could see how people would say, OK, I'm going to pay for that because that helps  you make money.  Pure journalism.  I know, Jeff, you talk about this all the time.  Maybe that's a little harder to put behind a paywall, but there must be other ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really hard.  Yeah, it's really hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There must be other ways to say you can do research reports, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And conferences.  Yeah, that's the ticket.  Well, one thing Ben does and Horace and all these people is they appear on Twitter regularly  and we are very happy to promote whatever you're doing, Matthew.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I certainly appreciate being on.  We love having you on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by SmartThings.  Smart people brought to you by SmartThings.  I like it.  SmartThings is smart.  If you're trying to automate your home, it's a solution that kind of everybody's been looking  for for the longest time, which is how do I get all the different things, smart things  in my home to talk to one another?  It started with a Kickstarter project for the SmartThings Hub and it has exploded to  really incorporate every to encompass everything you're doing in your home, whether it's security,  whether it's just convenience, whether it's monitoring, SmartThings plays well with others.  As they say, the hub interfaces to their iOS or Android app and then interfaces to your  your Eon Labs micro dimmer and key fob, your two gig programmable thermostat, your Belkin  Wemo, your I mean, DropCam Pro, your Nest, your Ecobee, your EcoLink door and window  sensor, your Everspring door and window.  I could just I mean, I literally I'm just going through the alphabet here.  Everything, your Sonos speakers, your Hue lights, and they can all work together to  make your house a smart home.  The best way to start is with a SmartThings kit.  Once you get the kit, you're going to solve a particular problem.  They have solution kits for lighting automation, for instance.  That's what we're looking at right now.  Or security.  We're going to get you 10% off that kit, the first kit and free shipping in the US.  All you have to do is go to SmartThings.com slash twit.  You'll get the hub.  You'll get additional sensors and then kind of the sky's the limit.  You now imagine using your smartphone app to say good night and the lights turn off,  the thermostat adjusts, the doors lock.  I do that.  I still do that by hand every night.  It's a lot.  It takes a while.  Be so cool.  Just press one button.  Set your lamps to brighten every morning at sunrise or keep your home protected with  home security, motion detection, water detection.  Your speakers could broadcast barking dogs when there's motion detected outside the  house or just a welcome home song when your children return.  I love it.  And I think you will too.  I want you to go to SmartThings.com slash twit.  Save 10% off any home security or solution kit free shipping in the US.  SmartThings was named editor's choice at CES 2015.  I'm not surprised.  SmartThings.com slash twit.  Give it a try.  Today you'll like it.  Google I.O. registration opened yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you going, Jeff?  I don't know.  I put in the request.  We shall see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We got the same thing last.  They did this last year too.  And we have about 10 people who want to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I shouldn't take a spot for one of your guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we don't have to worry about Gina anymore.  She's on her own.  Right.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Jason, how have you already heard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe I haven't.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Maybe I'm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know.  I think Robert was weird.  Robert Balasar was reaching out.  Father Robert.  Because he wanted to get pro lineup programmers for our coding 101 show.  And Google responded to him and said, yes, you have two for the entire organization.  Thank God Robert is an honest priest.  And he said it on the main said, it's up to you to decide.  Because I'm sure Robert would like to go.  But so would Mike Elgin.  So would you.  So would Jason.  So would a lot of people.  I don't want to go.  I'm going to stay here because I think they're going to stream the keynote as they usually do.  And we'll do our usual streaming coverage.  Registration goes till five o'clock tomorrow, five o'clock Pacific tomorrow, March 19th.  And it's going to be another lottery.  You know, you'll have to apply when you get the invitation.  It's not free.  Nine hundred dollars for an attendee.  Three hundred dollars if you're a student or a teacher.  Everybody has the same chance.  Google I.O. is a lot of fun.  May 28th and 29th at Moscone West.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do they decide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I imagine they have a lottery.  I think they have a computer that'll do.  You know what?  They have not said they have not said because we know what we need to know.  You wonder if there's maybe more than just a lottery involved.  I wonder.  I wonder.  A black box algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we look at your page rank.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't think they say it's random.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then it's not.  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They said starting last year, they started to say, you know, it's it's randomly selected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I don't know how close to the truth that necessarily is.  Random-ish.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it does say we'll randomly select applicants from among all the qualified applications.  Qualified might be the word.  Right. Right. Right.  That that is the little not not randomly.  So what they're going to do is go through a list and qualify people and then randomly select.  Right.  Presumably they'll want you to be a developer or somebody who can bring something to the table, I would guess.  But I don't know.  And they don't say what qualified means.  Right.  The order in which applications received has no bearing.  You need to sign into Google.  So it has to be your real Google account.  I should I apply?  But I know.  But see, I don't I don't want to go.  So I shouldn't apply.  So, Jason, here's the problem.  We need to tell them before they tell us.  Well, I will figure it out.  Jeff, you applied.  No, I applied through press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not a developer.  So right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fill out this form.  That's probably what happened.  Robert probably filled out that form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pressing free.  Free, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you still get the goodies.  I wonder if I guess they'll be giving away a pixel, maybe.  You can't keep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  We should get bonus points for having bought them.  Yes, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, sir.  I will be fun this year.  I mean, we heard about Lollipop last year.  I don't know if we'll hear about what's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you're also going to see you're going to see Sundar's Sundar was the star of the show last year, but he's really been in charge.  Right.  Much.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  Well, there you go.  Google I.O. coming up.  Interesting medium post.  About by Astro Teller Astro.  I didn't know, for instance, is not his real name.  It's Eric.  He's the head of Google X, the moon shots.  And this is part of the new back channel, which is Stephen Levy's little corner of medium.  This is the journalistic corner of medium.  One of them.  Yeah, it's his job.  It's his way of magazine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And this is basically a transcript of his speech of Astros Teller's speech at South by yesterday.  So some very interesting stuff in here.  If you haven't read it, they made a ECG vest.  That was his first startup in 1999.  It was really cool.  In fact, I think I'm pretty sure this is the body media vest we wore.  I wore this or somebody wore this during the screensavers at Tech TV so that you could see in real time heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram as the hostess host in the show.  I'm pretty sure unless I had a bad nightmare, I'm pretty sure we did that.  He said the problem is we got a bunch of older people and people who would theoretically be wearing this vest and they 65 to 80.  And they said they hated it.  And we said, well, would you wear it if it would save your life?  I don't know.  Maybe.  Well, OK, what if we made it so you could fly?  I guess sometimes maybe.  But old people are like that.  They're not going to say yes.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if you could fly there for free?  I don't know.  I'm happy right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm trying to get my parents a tablet.  My show of my life is worth.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, are we going to be like that, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  No.  Matthew says yes.  Oh, yes.  No, I'm fine.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I like the old phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When will that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Before you realize it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As we harden in our ways, I guess.  I'm starting to get.  I don't understand why I need a new computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chrome is just fine.  It has been for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I feel it's already happening to me.  I don't want to go out anymore.  So Google X, one of the first projects he says was called Genie,  was to fix the way buildings are designed and built by building an expert system,  software genie.  Did you ever hear about this?  I never heard about this.  Never heard about that.  Worked on it for 18 months, spun it out to a standalone business where it has been growing  and thriving for the last two and a half years.  OK.  Then they did Flux.  Oh, no, the company is now called Flux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Loon is one of my favorites, not just because of the name, because it's a Canadian  bird, but just the idea.  I remember when they first announced it.  I thought it was April Fool's.  Right.  Which is great.  It sounded satirical.  It was so loony.  You know, we're going to float balloons around the world and give people internet.  I'm like, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  Project Wing, the self-flying delivery drone.  The Loon balloons actually are going to I think they're going to be real, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they are.  They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They totally are.  How about this, Makani, an airborne wind turbine, an energy kite?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Cool idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't that cool?  Very.  The higher up you go, the faster and more consistent the wind is.  So, if you put the turbines up in the air.  And the speed, stop right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where was it?  The power of the wind goes up with the cube of the wind speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  So, that makes a huge difference.  But so does the weight of the turbine.  Oh, that's nice.  So, that's the key, right?  Is to make something light.  The Makani energy kites are 1% as much as a standard turbine in a tower.  And the center of the virtual circle it draws in the sky is at 250 meters where the winds are stronger and more consistent.  And as you said, considerably more powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing that I thought was most interesting was some of the places where he talks about how they failed.  Right.  And sort of why they failed.  And like Google Glass, you know, got too much attention and was sort of seen as a finished product when it wasn't.  Which was kind of my sense of why it didn't maybe do as well.  But the other one was, I think it was Project Loon.  He said they massively underestimated the difficulty of keeping the balloons aloft.  Like, we're off by a factor of 10 or 100.  So, not just a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  An order of magnitude wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just, I find it impressive that he would even admit that.  You know.  Yeah, except that.  They were off by that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That failure was followed by a success in which they figured out how to make them stay up much longer than they had thought.  So that's the challenge, right?  You take the failure and you make it into something.  He says, we've mostly fixed this problem at the time.  It was quite stressful.  Now, thankfully, balloons stay up for six months at a time.  Well, beyond the three months we need for a viable service.  There's the little self-driving car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And his point about that is similar to, you know, all the great ideas when you're coming up with the concept don't, well, amount to a hill of beans, but a small hill of beans.  It's not until you actually test the product in real world conditions, you start to suddenly realize the things you got wrong or the things that you didn't anticipate would be a huge deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He also says as they get better at it, that's a problem because it's failure that teaches them.  So the longer the amount of time between our failures, the harder it is for us to improve.  That was very interesting insight.  They're not failing enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not. It's too good.  Yeah, you guys are too good.  Stop succeeding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think that's the whole idea of failure is just so fascinating.  I had a long conversation with a German or an Austrian journalist today who was going on with me and talking to me after I had done my attack on Der Spiegel.  We talked about two weeks ago and, you know, I keep on saying that the Europeans have to have more willingness to develop in public, which means fail in public.  And that that's a precursor.  And yes, we in America fetishize failure.  I always make that joke, but we're not so sure that's true now.  I think that it's just a method of being open and learning in public and improving something in public.  And you look at his talk about saying, oh, yeah, we learned a big lesson about privacy and Google Glass.  People didn't like not have known the picture was taken.  So, you know, it wasn't that, oh, my God, they've done something horrible and pros are evil.  No, they learned learning is OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So here's a good one they learned with the self-driving cars.  He said, you know, we knew that if the car drove itself, people would, you know, maybe not pay as much attention as they ought to.  You know, they'll say, oh, no, no, no, I'm going to keep my I'm nervous.  I'm making my hands. He said, as soon as we started doing stuff, people were doing horrendous things.  They were just they were crawling into the backseat. They were just they it was just horrible.  So he said, we realized that the only way to make that this would work is to make it truly self-driving.  So we took the steering wheel out. They said if it doesn't go from point A to point B without any human intervention, it's no good.  If it requires any human intervention, it's going to be a horrific failure because humans, as soon as they think the car's got it covered, just go, OK, see you.  There's no backup system.  It's like they are not the backup system and don't count on them.  He says people already do stupid things like texting when they're supposed to be 100 percent in control.  So imagine what happens when they think the car's got it covered.  It isn't pretty. So that's actually a good explanation.  I was wondering why you take a steering wheel out?  Doesn't isn't that a comfort factor for humans that there's a brake, there's a pedal, there's something I can do if the machine fails?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Great, great.  That's really interesting. The human engineering part of a non-human device.  That's kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Probably always do, don't you? You always have to take it.  Humans are the thing that screws everything up.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and I forget who said it, but my dad who was in the Air Force used to love the line, no battle plan ever survived contact with the enemy.  So you can have all the great ideas and plans you want.  But people will find a way to do something you didn't expect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You asked a whiz in our chat room says, well, why does it have rear view mirrors then if the humans aren't necessary?  Well, those aren't really rear view mirrors. Those are cameras.  The little wings sticking out. They're not for you.  I want this car and I will come to work each and every day in it.  And I don't care even if you know, Buckminster Fuller, the great Bucky created something called remember the Dymaxion car.  He said, there's crazy. We're making cars that are not aerodynamic. He designed it like a teardrop.  It had some very odd features. It was three wheeler, I believe.  And it never got anywhere because somebody got killed in it.  It had a fatal accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did wonder about the car. This car is four wheels in those specific positions.  Is that the best do you need that model for a car?  Is it just because that's what we expect it to look like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you have to, as you said, human factors still coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As long as it has lots of cup holders, I think it'll be pretty successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Without a cup holder, it's not a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The president or CEO of Ford at one point, I think it was, said they can talk about all the features they want in their new cars.  And all people care about is they want more cup holders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was the great thing about the Homer, Homer Simpson's car.  It had tons of cup holders.  It's important.  And shag carpeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Bonapetit had an article on the history of the car cup holder.  Oh really?  Just in case.  Really?  I don't know why it's in Bonapetit.  Ever since George Washington crossed to Delaware to go sign the lease on his new pickup truck,  President's Day has been associated with getting a good deal on a car.  And while some people buy a car based on gas mileage and sporty looks,  we all know the most important part of a vehicle is its cup holder.  Look at that.  Snack tray for car from Modern Mechanics.  Holds a Coke bottle.  Real demand for the cup holder didn't pick up into the 50s when drive-ins and drive-through windows became mainstays of American eating.  The very earliest evidence of a complete cup holding comes from a 50s newspaper clipping that describes the snack tray for car that hangs from dashboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I was in high school, we still had an A&W that would bring the trays out and hang them on the side of the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, high school.  We had one in Petaluma until a few years ago.  Really?  Then the waitresses were on roller skates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  I thought it was cool.  I liked going there.  It's the best thing ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You roll your window down.  She takes your skates back.  You don't even have to get out of the car.  No, it's so great.  The best beverage security system of the era belonged to the 1950 Cadillac El Dorado Brom.  Plenty of extra luxury, ultra luxurious limousines has built in bars, but the Brom.  How do you say that?  Brom was the first to come with a magnetized glove compartment door and a set of four metal tumblers.  Oh, jeez.  Perfect for keeping your cognac stable while you're passing the jitney on the way to the Hamptons.  Patents for the 70s for a more advanced version of Clyde Morgan's pullout tray.  The customers looking for a car with a built in cup holder were stuck in the wilderness until 1983 when Chrysler invented the minivan.  That is the first you're looking if you're watching the video.  That is the first minivan, the Dodge Caravan and the Plymouth Voyager.  Same car, different names.  Your sex appeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, that's hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They had two cup holders sunk into the plastic of the dashboard.  But it would take another decade for that to become ubiquitous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that shows what's so wrong about Detroit.  If they had a way to listen to the public.  Yeah.  We all want to told them, cup holders and plugs for our Walkman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Walkman.  You know what happened in 1994?  A 79 year old woman, Stella Liebeck, sued McDonald's after spilling a 180 degree coffee in her lap in a stationary car.  She got 2.7 million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a famous case.  Very famous.  I believe that judgment was actually reversed.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She only got $640,000 on appeal.  The case became fodder for endless Leno monologues and a national argument about tort reform, but also a strong argument for the industry wide adoption of the cup holder.  If the car she'd been sitting in her grandson's Ford probe had even one single cup holder, the whole idea might have been avoided.  So there you have it.  1984, the very first cup holder for reals in the 1984 Chrysler Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager.  Boy, that's an ugly ass car.  Even an ugly color like kind of dopey brown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's what we had a caravan.  Did you?  The faux woody look on the side.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not at all surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  How do we go to that's what I love about this show.  It's about Google, the cloud and cup holders or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's where you're up in the cloud.  You have low oxygen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does your Chromebook have cup holders?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no.  Very disappointing.  I might add.  You know what?  I'm excited about the Google has now an API for Google now or is going to be big.  That's a huge.  This is the article from the next Web.  Martin Bryant writing Google now will one day be able to work with information from all the apps you use.  I didn't know there was a pilot program with 40 third party services already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't know that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But this is again from South.  Yeah, this is from South by your wire had a great article.  This is from South by a Parna Chennai Pradhan.  Prana Pradhan director of actually came really close to getting to nail on that.  A Parna Chennai Pradhan, director of product management for Google now, gave an interesting insight at South by at a marketing land.  Danny Sullivan session at South by when asked by the attendee how Google now will handle competing data from rival apps.  She said individual user app usage patterns would help guide what data should be shown.  I think it's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I remember when I first saw Google now and I thought what if this could show me not just things that are in my Google calendar, but any type of information, news, weather, sports, all sorts of things.  It's a potential pipeline for all the information you need to know right now on your phone.  That's that's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I yeah, I mean, one of the things she raises is the notion of you know, you could have a card at the amusement park that would then tell you, hey, the ride, you know, your is ready for you.  Your auction and here's some from the wired slide.  Your auction ends in one hour and 22 minutes or QR code from Walgreens because you're near Walgreens.  Here's some coupons or balance rewards points.  Yeah, this is this is great stuff.  The the Danny Sullivan panel was cut short at South by by a false fire alarm.  Oh, shoot.  Which happened to me, by the way, I went to a Mark Cuban talk at South by a few years ago.  Really?  And Mark was being his typical nasty self.  Yeah.  And the fire alarm went off and I took that as an excuse to get the hell out of there and never went back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had one go out for the giga home event to UCSF.  I think there's something someone from TechCrunch pulled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's some renegade.  Yeah.  Competitor going around pulling fire alarms.  So there'll be an API.  That's pretty exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the difference then between now and notifications on your phone?  Don't they merge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get now notifications, don't I?  I think I do.  Yeah, I do.  You don't mean.  Now it's push versus pull is what it is.  So notifications are pushed to you and get your attention.  But I love the idea of saying, well, let me go look at my now dashboard and seeing what's going on.  And so that's pulled.  Right.  Except it's pushed to the to the pole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So here's the other question for the 40 that are doing this.  Is that opt in now for us with now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to have the app of the install the app installed and then it taps into that.  And, you know, you can as you can do with any Google Now cards also, you can kind of say don't turn it off.  This.  But how do I turn that on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like I wait.  My beloved ways.  I don't think it comes in and now for me, but I use ways every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is ways one of the 40?  I honestly I don't know.  It is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So so do I do I turn on now for an app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, she's that's what she's saying.  She's saying that Google looks at your usage to decide what to put in now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is where I do have a problem.  Everybody else raves about now.  And I like now, but I don't get a lot now.  Right. You need more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I was also doing surveys to identify what people want.  She says we also use personal experiences.  A visit to Disneyland inspired her to get the team working on support for theme park ride Q times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will say I used Google Now a lot more when I was traveling.  So I was in a different country.  I didn't know where I was going.  You know, I needed to play information.  I needed traffic information.  If I'm just going from my house to the shopping mall and back or to pick up my daughter, Google Now is pretty useless because it's not going to tell me.  I don't already know.  Right. So are you interested in this new location?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, the 7-Eleven five miles away.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But when I was in Italy, it was it was a lifesaver.  I mean, I think I told you guys I slid it up by mistake and it said, hey, your flight's delayed and there's traffic on the highway heading to the airport.  I'm like, thank you so much for telling me that.  It's like the most important information I found out today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, this is I'm so I'm looking at my now now and I've got calendar appointments.  I've got news stories that are referred to searches I've made in the past and I've got places nearby.  But I just got one that was kind of interesting.  It said, I see there's something going on at one o'clock tomorrow.  Do you want me to add that to your calendar?  I'm not sure.  And I guess it saw it in my email.  But it wasn't a confirmation because I am flying to Vegas at one o'clock tomorrow.  So I said, yes.  So that so it actually added something to my I love the parking location.  That's nice.  Those were parked.  Yeah, I get that one.  My 18 t bill is due tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, I don't get any of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mine says, tell Jeff that Google now is really useful.  Mine. You know, mine does all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mine just gives me honest to God.  I get this all the time.  It gives me stories about Chromebook and Edward Snowden.  Well, you got to do more searches on Google and smartphones and tablets.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Snowden thing.  The one pushing.  Yeah, we know we're watching you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You might as well watch back stories to read.  That's it.  That's all I ever get.  And I get the you know, the card that says it's you know, it's some horrible amount of time to get home for you.  You push back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take a helicopter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If only if only.  So is it you that put this Nick Bilton story in the rundown?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The health concerns in wearable tech.  Jesus, it's driving me nutty.  I put it.  I put the two of them together because you because you have on the one hand, Google just got a patent for curing cancer with a watch.  Then you have Nick Bilton, who's turned into the whiny nanny of the technology world.  Watch.  Well, and this story really bothers me because it's it's really fluffing around the facts because it's saying, well, cells bad for you.  But most watches, most smart watches don't have cell.  They only have Wi Fi and Bluetooth.  By the way, we all put Bluetooth in our ears thinking it's safer than putting the phone by our ear.  So now suddenly having Bluetooth in your watch is going to give you cancer and kill you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and so we also there is no evidence that cell phone radiation is bad for you.  That too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, you know, he tries to use that.  It's a real it's a real straw man with a match.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's quoting Dr. Joseph Mercola, who is not a credible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this piece, you know, Nick, I like Nick.  Nick's a nice guy.  We love him.  He's tried too hard to go from future man to Fred Flintstone.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I live in the future and now I really hate it.  I don't like it very much.  He wrote this book was I live in the future.  Now it's now I don't like it so much.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's trying to shift off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I wonder if this is the Times telling him we need an anti editor, an anti technology.  But don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't do it.  No, this is not this.  This fluffs by.  And I know what we're going to hear is the New York Times.  These watches are going to be bad for you.  You're going to get cancer.  They're going to kill you.  Right.  You know, my watch has Wi-Fi.  I mean, I don't even know.  Does that Wi-Fi has Bluetooth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does have Wi-Fi.  That's something we learned, by the way, which is kind of interesting.  Apple was very made a big deal about how we not only use Bluetooth, but we use Wi-Fi so  that as long as you're within your Wi-Fi network, your Apple watch can talk to your Apple phone.  It needs an Apple phone so that it can do its thing.  So you can leave your phone in your bedroom and go throughout your house.  And as long as you're still or conversely in your office and go throughout your office,  as long as you're still on the same Wi-Fi network, it'll work.  And that was like, wow, that's great.  And then somebody, I guess Google said, oh, yeah, Android Wear watches all have Wi-Fi  in it, too.  We're going to have to turn that on with firmware soon.  I didn't know this had Wi-Fi in it.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Might as well put it in.  It's a tiny chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess it's a cheap chip and they can just stick it in there.  I think it's very intriguing.  It seems like almost an intentional effort to have hidden features that you slowly enable,  like the battery life has gotten better and better and better and better.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually one of the things I'm fascinated with, whether it's Tesla cars or, you know,  there are more and more things that are effectively getting smarter and better over firmware  updates that come over the air.  So instead of having to take your car into the shop, Tesla can actually change the height  of the chassis of your car with a firmware update.  Fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, everything we have, I guess, is kind of like that.  Very intriguing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wasn't there supposed to be a Tesla announcement today or something that Musk said, I'm going  to solve all your problems with battery worry?  Did you see that story?  Not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I remember him mentioning that.  Why don't you find it and take a break while you look?  How about that?  All right.  We're talking Google in the cloud and all that stuff and cup holders with Matthew Ingram,  late of GigaOM, now at MatthewIngram.com, at Matthew I on Twitter.  Do you do Meerkat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do not.  I have not Meerkatted.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just going to give you a chance if you do.  Okay.  It's ridiculous.  Here we are in a live streaming studio.  I do more streaming hours of video than any human alive.  And half my staff is now Meerkatting everything.  Jeff Needles is like number five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two thousand people were watching Jimmy Fallon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Rehearsing.  I had a thousand people watching me Meerkat and I think I broke it because it stopped  at 999 and never went beyond that.  In fact, then stopped you.  So what is your number three?  Who is number one?  Mashable, Jimmy Fallon, Jeff Needles, ladies and gentlemen.  Jesus.  He wasn't even at South by Southwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  He found his thing.  He found his calling.  You know what he does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He leaves it on all the time.  Yeah.  Okay.  There's a market for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What happens on needle vision?  What happens on needle vision?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We talk.  He interviews people.  It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know the best thing about Meerkat?  What?  The name.  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, Ustream, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Meerkat?  Ustream sounds like a urinary tract infection.  Meerkat is a cute little fuzzy animal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't cross your Meerkats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Getting really used to the Meerkat posture.  You know someone's Meerkatting when you walk around the corner  and someone's standing there like this.  I'm Meerkatting.  No, sorry.  You've got to actually see the camera.  I'm Meerkatting.  And they're walking around like this everywhere.  I'm Meerkatting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We actually had to formulate company rules about Meerkatting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't just Meerkat people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, because people are going around.  There's screens open with financials on it.  There's whiteboards with show ideas on it.  You can't just go around all the time.  Meerkatting.  Or they're in the bathroom or whatever?  Yeah.  You have to have Meerkat rules.  Pretty soon you'll go to the gym.  It'll say no cell phones and no Meerkatting.  Leave your Meerkat at the door.  Leave your Meerkat at that periscope.  Twitter's slow to emerge competition is now starting to...  Kevin Rose tweeted today, I saw it.  It's amazing.  See, dumb name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meerkat is way better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Way better than periscope.  You think that's it?  It's just the name?  Well, I think it helps.  Definitely helps.  Had Google put something like Meerkat on Google Glass,  would it have been as big?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  It would have caused war in Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's hard for Google or Facebook to do those kinds of things  because there are these giant entities that everybody slightly mistrusts.  Whereas if it's just a guy,  hey, I came up with this new thing.  It's cool.  You should use it.  People are like, all right, I'm in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  When we come back, we're going to talk about the New York Police Department  and their new spot-shotter system.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This is a good one.

Matthew Ingram, Jeff Jarvis, Leo Laporte,  This Week in Google,  Police officers, thank you, Chetram, for this story from MSNBC.  Police officers in New York City have now a new technology called SpotShotter.  You might be happy to hear this, Jeff.  With it, they can detect gunshots in real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not that new.  What's new in this story is that they're installing it in new neighborhoods  and they are finding there are more gunshots than they knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The $1.5 million system uses 300 sensors to triangulate the location of a gunshot  to within 25 meters of where the bullet was fired within seconds.  It sends a notification to an operator who reviews the audio file  to determine if it actually was a gunshot or maybe fireworks or an engine backfire.  The system then forwards an alert to the NYPD with relevant information  about the number of shots fired, a map of the location, and if the shooter was moving.  That's the Twitter feed you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  It seems like sending it to an operator introduces, you know, it's going to slow things down a fair bit  if someone has to listen to the file and then, was that a gunshot?  Was it a car door slamming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's interesting that there are people who can tell the difference.  In cities around the country, according to the Chief of Police in New York City, Mr. Bratton, William Bratton,  in 75% of the cases, they're not dialed into 911.  Yeah, because people go, exactly that, oh, it must have been a firework or backfire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For some reason, I'm now thinking of the Batman scene where he has all the cell phones up on a screen  and you can listen to any conversation and then, I'm sure they're not working on that.  Oh, no, they would never do that.  Yeah, I would not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is fine.  This is just gunshots.  Yeah, only gunshots.  If they happen to hear anything else, they can just throw that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They would ignore it, sure.  It's a good point, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They now have an array of microphones in every borough of Manhattan, of New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like if you said stick them up or, you know.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They send that to an operator to determine how serious you were.  That's a good point.  They have microphones now recording constantly all over New York.  They're listening to us.  Well, they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this is a sensor.  I mean, they're going to be sensors of all kinds.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, just everybody's phone is going to be listening to these kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you could get Google Fiber, wouldn't you subscribe in a heartbeat?  Oh, yeah.  Why is it that only 29,867 people have subscribed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's for the TV package.  Oh, that's the TV.  I think that's what that's for.  You're right.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what it is.  I misunderstood.  They don't say what the penetration is for the Internet.  So, they have almost 30,000 TV subs.  So, Google Fiber is in Stanford.  They're conducting a trial in Connecticut in Kansas City, Kansas.  Kansas City, Missouri.  Provo, Utah.  Number one city, Kansas City, Missouri.  They've been there the longest, 20,000 subs.  Then Kansas, 7,000 subs.  It goes down pretty quickly.  Provo, which is, they've only been there for a couple of years, 2,507, and 194 users in Stanford.  But the penetration is not great.  Only 13% in Kansas City subscribe to the Google TV.  13% of the Google Internet subscribers.  I guess that's less.  I thought that was Google Internet.  That's less interesting than I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if you're going to sign up for a wire cutting, no cable TV, who are you going to sign up with?  You're going to sign up with Google.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, if I had Google Fiber, I'd sign up for their TV.  Yeah, I would too.  But I guess only 10% did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, why isn't it higher then?  Yeah, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it not a good deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think at first they didn't have all the channels.  It was a rollout issue, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what it is.  ScooterX is saying no AMC on Google Fiber, no deal.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't get Mad Men.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Don't want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're going to keep your cable.  You also have to put down a $300 deposit, it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google Fiber channel lineup in Kansas City.  Let's see.  I can't tell her.  What would you call AMC?  Entertainment?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  American movie channel?  Sounds like entertainment to me.  Yeah, I'm not seeing it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it have the Hallmark channel?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I'm signing up for that.  Jeez, treacle and trickle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That sounds like one of your reviews.  Treacle and trickle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, in fact, Hallmark got so mad at me when I was at People Magazine reviewing.  They pulled off their hats with People Magazine.  And believe me, People Magazine had a lot of Hallmark ads.  Wow.  What's wrong with you, Jeff?  I'm just a growling cuss.  Your cumulonimbus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Google Code is shutting down.  This kind of saddens me.  According to one of the members of the team, when we started Google Code, there was a real need for this.  It was SourceForge and nothing.  He said, this is really a risk.  The open source community is at this great risk.  If SourceForge, I don't know what's going on.  Let me close this.  If SourceForge shuts down, all these open source projects will be out of luck.  So they create Google Code.  But now he says there's so many places you can create and host an open source project.  There's no need for Google Code.  So there's GitHub, but that's a commercial project.  It launched in 2006.  So there'd be an alternative to SourceForge since then.  We've seen a wide variety of better project hosting services such as GitHub and Bitbucket Bloom.  Many projects moved away from Google Code to those other systems to meet developers where they are.  We ourselves migrated nearly a thousand of our own open source projects from Google Code to GitHub.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you know, there's no point in keeping it going if users are going somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there is a Google Code to GitHub exporter tool.  The problem with GitHub is it's a for-profit business, right?  You're still somebody else hosting your stuff.  True.  It is pretty cool though.  GitHub?  Have you been to their headquarters?  I love GitHub.  GitHub's headquarters?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's amazing because they have this World Economic Forum held an event there in San Francisco.  They have a replica of the Oval Office as their entrance.  You're kidding.  Oh, no, no.  They have all this crazy stuff.  They have a huge bar and the founders serve from it.  And there's hardly anybody working there because who better to be virtual than GitHub?  It's practically empty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  GitHub is pretty awesome.  It is pretty great.  I use it.  I install it on most of my computers.  Yeah.  And you can do it more than just programs.  You could do it for writing a book.  You could use GitHub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, I was going to write and never wound up writing about it, but Clay Shirky  had an interesting...  He posted something basically that was a blog post on GitHub.  And I think it was about the demonstrations in China.  The demonstrations in Hong Kong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly, Matthew.  Yeah, I put tons of photos and stuff.  And I was so mad at myself.  I thought, oh, of course, Clay would do that first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And a bunch of people sort of, you know, I forget the term, but they pointed out things that needed to be changed.  And I forked it, but then I didn't know what to do with it.  But I still thought it was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is a dumb question.  Do you have to download GitHub?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You need GitHub.  Yeah, you need GitHub.  Well, no, you could do it on your Chromebook.  You could do it without.  That's what I'm asking.  Yeah, you don't need that.  It's just a site.  Well, but it depends how you're going to use it.  So for instance, I put on my Mac, I put GitHub software.  So if I'm writing software, I can put it up on GitHub.  And even if you're multiple people, then that's very useful because it's very...  But it really is a version control system.  So you can check in and check out changes to the code so they don't conflict.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's Zen Hub for GitHub on the Chrome Web Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure there's ways to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's what's interesting about using it for text is that version control,  anyone who's ever tried to collaborate with people using, you know, Microsoft Word,  or it just makes you want to put a bullet in your head.  And GitHub is really great at tracking, you know, who's got different versions of the file,  what changes have been made, condensing them all into one file.  It works for code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Should work for words.  Yeah.  I remember when I...  My first book that I was going to do with Gina Smith, we were going to use SVN,  which was the very common way to do this in those days.  GitHub is also...  You can use it for free.  So you don't...  But yeah, I think that's interesting, though, that Clay used that for...  That's wild.  Yeah, it is.  Damn him.  Did he do that again or was that it?  I don't know what he did again, but he didn't need to.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He got his cool merit badge.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But he didn't come up with a cool term for what it...  Like, he didn't make up a new word for what that is.  Get publishing.  I think, Matthew, I get publishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Get publishing.  Get publishing.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  Google Flight Search has gotten even more useful.  We talked about this actually on the radio show with our travel expert.  It now has route happy information, so you can see what flight amenities you will get.  We are in an airline tomorrow called Spirit.  You ever hear of them?  There are so few amenities on Spirit, you actually have to pay to carry on a bag.  Yeah, that's becoming more common.  And if you don't pay ahead of time, it's $100.  If you just show up with your carry on, it's $100.  What are they charging you to check it?  I think it was $25, something like that.  It was $200 for four of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just show up late with a big bag and they'll gate check it for nothing.  No, I don't think Spirit does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think there's nothing for nothing on Spirit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'll leave it on the gangway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.  Your bags won't be going with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At one point, Ryanair was talking about charging people for the bath on the plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They fortunately decided they thought better of that.  Thank goodness.  Did you see what Danny Sullivan reporting this one on Search Engine Land,  what happens now if you use Google Search and Firefox?  No.  It says, switch your defaults, big banner, switch your default search engine to Google.  Learn how.  It's a little desperate for Google.  Wow.  A little bit, yeah.  Did Firefox change to Bing?  Is that what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yahoo.  Yahoo is Bing.  Yahoo.  Yeah.  Yahoo is Bing, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  I'm going to have to, I don't use Firefox, but I'll have to give it a try.  Switch your default search engine.  Wow.  They must be costing a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those default search deals are big money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, because the tyranny of the default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, and he says that since the deal, Yahoo search share rose.  Wow, that's like two points, two percentage points.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yahoo making money on anything is a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, anything going upward is.  Wait, it's going up?  That's not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's this?  I don't understand.  Maybe you can explain this to me, Jason.  This is kind of all, we're doing the change log kind of ad hoc here.  You could send a hangouts message with your voice in Google Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What does that mean?  That means that you can do a voice command inside Google Now to send a message through search.  You could do it with SMS right before.  Now you can do it, a hangout message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a cool idea.  Okay, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Send a hangout message to Jason Howell.  So it'll.  Is that.  No such user.  Okay, no, I found him.  Which account?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I don't know what it will show.  Good.  Don't show that.  What's the message?  Hey, Jason, it's Leo.  I'm over here.  You have to work.  Hey, oh, well now it's now I have to type it.  Oh, did it not?  Well, if I'd done the whole thing, it probably would have done.  Yeah, yeah.  But that's cool.  So that's as opposed to say send a message would do SMS.  Right.  Send a hangout message will send it via hangouts.  Exactly.  I don't know if that's a big thing or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say the easier they can make it to to start a hangout, the better,  because I felt like an 87 year old man when I tried to start a hangout.  I don't do hangouts.  I literally could not figure out how to do it.  I know how to send them a hangout.  I'm like, I can't figure it out.  You do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's begun, Matthew.  I don't want to hang out bow ties.  And you're going, what's this hangout all about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why don't we just get on the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In my day, we'd set it by Pony Express.  This we mentioned that the new Pixel is using a type C USB connector like the  soon to appear MacBook.  A lot of John Gruber has decided that Apple invented the type C connector,  which has caused a interesting lash and backlash.  A lot of tech blogs picked up Gruber's assertion and said and asserted the same.  And a lot of other people said, no, wait a minute.  Google actually put out a video.  A video?  Here's the Google type C video.  It doesn't say we invented it, but they kind of imply, you know, it was here.  Let me turn on the audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Allows us to deliver power, data, display over one connector, one cable and one port.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's about the same size as a micro USB connector, but it's good for up to 100 watts,  super high speed data and allows you to output 4K display over it.  It's pretty cool idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, we worked with the industry to come up with this standard.  See, there's an engineer drawing on a whiteboard.  So it did come from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Clones are made with stamped parts that are then formed into the shape that you want them to be.  We decided to use a deep draw process, which is taking a flat sheet of metal and pressing it into the right shape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, the same technique used to make the Apple Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you make it much harder and much stronger.  We designed the connector to have a symmetric and your coffee mug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, and B 52 tires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But OK, so I do like to type C.  I'll have to say it's kind of hard to get out.  It isn't. It doesn't.  Well, it doesn't fall out.  It's harder to get out than a micro USB connection.  But I love it that it goes either way.  Weak in your old age.  Another thing, it's so hard to disconnect my laptop now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why don't the plugs come out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They fall out easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't like to wonder why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am turning into Andy Rooney.  It's true.  It's true.  So Google has decided to pay a little more attention to the app submissions in the Play Store.  Humans will now review.  This is kind of an appally response.  I don't know what this means.  App submissions on Google Play now reviewed by staff and will include age based ratings.  That has to be a huge new department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, what happened before?  I mean, they wouldn't put up malware in the App Store.  How did they determine what was how did they determine before?  Just was the basic standards they had, which were technological standards.  They probably had some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder if they have all made it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bouncer was what that was called.  It was a security kind of thing going on.  Automatic security scanning for known potential threats.  So they wouldn't as the new ones would be discovered.  Add to that and verify apps runs on Android.  You can have that kind of check every app install on it and it compares it against that list.  This is something different.  It's actually been going on for two months now undetected.  And Google is just now announcing it saying and we've been doing it for two months and you know, you guys haven't noticed yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So so there's going to be E for every one G for general.  Oh, yeah, the ratings.  What is the oh, it varies by region.  So there's M for mature.  So in the US, E, T and M, which is just like gaming, everyone teen and mature.  Other countries will do it the way they do whatever it is, games or movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if they were getting flack for were they getting flack for kids installing things that weren't age appropriate or I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There isn't anything that sexy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, Google just in general, as of late, has been paying a lot more attention to kind of the kid angle of things.  Right. YouTube for YouTube kids, restricted profiles and Android, all that kind of stuff.  So I think this kind of falls in line and they modeled this rating system from what I understand closely to the MSRB that already kind of exists in video games.  Yes. Yes. Sorry. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the video game race.  Now, it does sound like it's somewhat up to the developer because they have a questionnaire.  The developer fills out and then they determine the rating based on that.  So it's still not heavily manual process, but it is.  I think, you know, there was just a published study about the freak exploit that showed that, you know, so what freak is, we talked about security now if you want to get all the details.  But the idea of freak is it's a downgrade of encryption that a man in the middle attack can force by sending certain crafted packets so that when you have an encrypted connection, you can have really weak encryption.  This was encryption that was created when the US government 20 years ago banned export of encryption.  Remember that? So they had they allowed 512 bit encryption, which is just no good.  It's greatly cracked. And and but most SSL suites apparently continue to support this very low grade encryption just in case they meet somebody that only can do it that way.  They shouldn't. And and operating systems are being patched.  Android has been patched.  IOS has been patched so that they no longer allow downgrade to that lower level.  But if you're using an older version of Android or an older version of iOS and you install one of these malicious apps on your system, you could be vulnerable to getting freaked.  That would allow a bad guy to see all your encrypted traffic, including credit cards, passwords, so forth.  So FireEye, which is the security firm that did this research, came up with one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine titles that left users open to this encryption downgrade attack.  But this is the interesting thing. Twelve hundred and twenty eight were on Android. Seven hundred seventy one were on iOS.  So it's not like I think a lot of times people think I'm using an Apple. I'm safe.  I'm not particularly not a lot safer.  So the big takeaway is update your operating system.  Now, that's easy with Apple because unless you have a fairly old device, you can easily go to the latest version of iOS.  Eight point two has been patched against freak.  What version of Android? Five point oh two.  Not sure when they patched it.  I'm not sure on that.  But that will leave out. I mean, my note four is still a Kit Kat, so that will leave some people out.  So be careful, I guess.  About what does what apps you download and update your operating system as soon as you can to test if browsers are vulnerable.  Visit the SSL Labs page and and it'll tell you freak attack dot com.  Oh, let me do that.  Everybody now do that on your Android device. Freak attack dot com.  Yeah. Now I'm curious.  What's it going to do?  Well, it won't do anything bad. I'll just tell you if you're vulnerable.  It will install the it will.  It will attempt to warning your browser.  OK, there you go.  Your browser is vulnerable to the freak attack.  It could be tricked into using weak encryption if you visit a vulnerable website.  So you have to go.  You have to have out of date operating system or browser.  You have to visit a vulnerable website and you have to have software on your.  Well, I guess this browser is vulnerable.  I guess is what it's saying.  But doesn't your Chrome update itself automatically?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought it did.  Freak attack dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See what I think it's the it's the.  Yeah. What does your Nexus six say?  It should be all right.  Let me try it with a Samsung browser.  Good news. Your browser appears to be safe from the freak attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're it's I think it's an I it's an L.S. late level update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then stop it.  Mine is vulnerable.  You too. I feel vulnerable.  I'm so open.  So be careful.  Wow. Popular sites that are susceptible to freak attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  NPR dot org.  Airtel.  Who put this site out?  Tweet by the.  Oh, this is good.  This is SSL Labs.  Reliable.  Yeah.  The Samsung browser is also vulnerable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'm happy to say Tweet is not Tweet dot TV and TechGuyLabs dot com.  Both have been updated for the vulnerability.  Who?  Giga.  Oh, no.  Sorry, Matthew.  Just joking.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no.  Sorry, Matthew.  Just joking.  What?  On top of everything else.  Freak attack.  Who did this site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The one that I'm sending you to SSL Labs.  It's a reliable.  It is.  Yeah.  It's a firm that does SSL testing.  And wow.  Yeah.  Look at all of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Holy cow.  I just tested it on my Nexus six that I got yesterday and it's vulnerable, but I'm installing  the Chrome update now.  So now I'm going to check it again and see what it's like.  Oh, so they have before and after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So your credit card company came through and got you a new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  And I finally received it.  Yay.  It's true.  Yay.  Yeah.  It's about time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  So that's good to know.  The freak attack is possible when a vulnerable browser connects to a susceptible web server.  So the key is to upgrade your browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm updating right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Maybe I need to update too.  Yeah.  The update fixed it.  Everybody are using the Chrome beta or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not in the Chrome beta.  You're on the Chrome main channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Main channel.  Well, I'm using the beta.  Why didn't I get an update?  Actually, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if I, I very well may be in the beta actually, because if I did that, I probably did it a  couple of years ago.  And at this point I've just forgotten.  Who knows?  Yeah.  But no, I mean, I checked before the update and I was vulnerable after the update.  I'm good.  Cool.  If my Skype slows down, it's because I'm...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do.  I see a Chrome browser update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lots of bug fixes is all they say, but I bet you that's exactly one of them.  So I'm going to update my browser and I'll let you know.  So there you go.  Interesting.  In the UK, there's a Google tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is indeed.  What?  There's an everything.  I'm not exactly clear, but yes, this is the political move.  It's the new budget and they've been threatening this.  Google's avoiding taxes.  Well, the law, they're doing what's legal.  So now they're going to say, well, we're going to tax you anyway.  What is the tax?  It's a 25% tax on...  How are they determining?  Diverted profits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is to avoid the Dutch sandwich and the Irish turner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Irish turner or whatever.  Yeah.  And once again, and the thing is if it's discriminatory and aimed at only one or two companies, that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the you're too big and make too much money tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You damned Yankees.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google, 25% tax on the profits.  That's higher than the general 20% corporate tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And yes, come on.  You know, what's discriminatory?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's unclear how easy it will be to actually implement this tax.  And of course, yeah, how do they know?  And who did...  Yeah.  So it's not everybody that has to pay it?  How can you legally do that?  That seems...  Just certain companies have to pay a higher tax.  All right.  We're going to get out of here because...  I'm fine for a while.  Yeah, but Matthew has to go.  And I don't want to live here.  Don't stop just for me.  Don't stop just for me.  Are you tired of us?  I will stop just for you.  No, actually we're done.  We've gone right through it.  We've gone through everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This was not a heavy week.  I've got to say.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although Microsoft is developing...  Here's one more story.  Software that converts Android phones to Windows 10.  Is that malware?  Is that something?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the definition of malware.  Is this something somebody would choose to do?  Why would someone want that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's testing Windows 10 with power users of the Mi 4,  which is an Android smartphone.  The initiative, which Xiaomi, who makes the Mi 4 stressed,  is not a partnership.  That's a nice clause.  So apparently you can...  It effectively overrides Android,  turning the Xiaomi phone into a Windows 10 device  complete with Microsoft services.  What?  This is a story from TechCrunch by John Russell.  What?  The software does not offer a dual boot option.  This is a ROM based on Windows.  It's like Cyanogen or some other ROM.  Wow, you could just put on your phone.  Super great idea.  What?  That's one way to get people to make Windows phones.  So here's the latest...  Here's an update from Microsoft.  As part of the Windows Insider program,  Microsoft will partner with Xiaomi  to offer Windows 10 free downloads  to a select group of Mi 4 owners.  You will be able to flash your phones with the new Windows 10 OS  and provide feedback.  So you're not getting the current version,  you're getting the future version,  which is fairly...  So it's a beta testing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a beta testing on another platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sounds like it's Xiaomi only though, right?  This headline applies more than just Xiaomi,  but as far as I can tell, it's just the Mi 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Xiaomi says, we're not a partner.  We're not a partner.  It's just a partnership.  I'll just let you know.  What is it then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, what the hell?  Why are you doing it?  We liked that Sachin Adela fellow.  We thought, all right, go ahead, knock yourself out.  That's a surprise.  Well, what's of interest is that technically it's possible.  If it's possible, others will do it.  It will be, you know, you'll get your new boot manager  and among other things in your Android phone,  you've rooted and install a new recovery partition  and among other things, you'll say,  okay, now you can install Cyanogen Mod 12 or Windows 10.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's interesting that it's even possible.  Our show today brought to you by Lynda.com.  Probably the guys who developed that were studying programming at Lynda.com.  That's what I'm thinking.  Lynda, actually, a lot of people,  Lynda.com is for anybody who wants to learn problem solvers.  Maybe you're just curious or maybe you want to get a better job.  Take better photos, master Excel, build a website,  boost your Photoshop skills.  At Lynda, you can learn most anything, lynda.com,  over 3,000 on-demand video courses  on all of the tools everybody's using.  For instance, if you want to learn how to write mobile software,  there are courses on Android Studio, Essential Training.  That's neat.  That's the new IDE that Google just started to give away.  Swift Essentials Training, the new Apple programming language.  There's also courses, well, there's one called  Building a Note, Taking to App for Android.  It would be a great way to get started.  Or iOS or Windows Phone,  where they teach you how to create a mobile app  on each platform from start to finish.  I love that.  lynda.com.  And by the way, the teachers are great teachers,  but they're also practitioners.  They're people who do this day to day.  The greatest photographers, Photoshop.

It's great.  So, lynda.com slash twig, 10-day free trial awaits.  Matthew, at this time on the show,  we'd like to offer a free tip or tool.  You don't have to, but if you have something.  You know, I was giving that some thought before the show,  and this is probably going to come as not news  to lots of people in the chat room  and lots of viewers and listeners,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but I got a Chromecast,  and I'm going to be doing a live stream  of the live stream,  and I'm going to be doing a live stream  of the live stream,  and I'm going to be doing a live stream  I got a Chromecast.  I think it was for Christmas.  I just started  using it a lot,  You know I played around with it  and I used the backdrop feature to show photos  and whatnot,  but I didn't find a sort of compelling  use case other than my daughter  trying to show me the latest funny YouTube video  on the tv.  But I set up a Plex server  And now I'm basically  just streaming Plex  through the Chromecast.  So instead of, so the Plex server is somewhere else,  pull it up on my phone,  Plex has Chromecast support built in  through the Chromecast to the tv.  It's fantastic.  Take the Chromecast with me,  throw it in a pocket, you know I'm in a hotel  or somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Doesn't the Chromecast have to be on the same Wi-Fi as you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does, it has to be,  yes. So the Wi-Fi,  it works great in the house,  but as long as you're  in the hotels.  I'm trying to think of whether I've actually used it in a hotel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's this new thing that they said they were going to do,  I don't know if they've done it yet, where the,  you wouldn't have to have access.  Be on the same Wi-Fi? Yeah, they were talking about that.  Yeah, so weird sound thing that they were doing  that you would somehow, I can't remember how it worked,  I don't know if that's coming. So maybe it wouldn't work in a hotel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't tried it in a hotel.  You didn't try that. And there's something else new about the Chromecast.  I'm excited about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Yanco Recreation. Oh, the remote control thing.  Yeah, Yanco wrote about that.  He decided, I'm going to keep writing, I don't care.  So he's writing on Medium.  This is an example of somebody,  am I saying his name right by the way?  Yanco.  Retkers or Rutgers?  Retkers. Former GigaOM guy, he decided,  I'm just going to write it on Medium.  Who cares? This is exactly what it would have been like  if he'd written it on GigaOM. It's a great article,  nice job.  So because Chromecast supports  something called CEC,  now your TV may use a different name for it,  I'm just going to call it any link.  But CEC is an extension  of HDMI that lets  you send control  commands between your TV and an  attached device. So in my case,  when I turn on my  TV, it turns on my receiver  using CEC and vice versa.  It tells it, OK, you handle the audio, that kind of thing.  Well, it turns out in the latest  firmware upgrade to Chromecast,  support for CEC  was added to the Chromecast,  which means that  you should try it. But the  TV remote you have  already,  for maybe your Blu-ray or your TV,  might work with Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you should be able to  switch to the Chromecast and it can switch  inputs on your TV and start streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you can press pause.  Or play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But your TV has to support it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Your TV and your remote  have to work and so forth.  I haven't tried it yet, but that's fantastic.  And Yonko got this  from the Chromecast Reddit  subreddit, RedditR  Chromecast. So  actually a good place to go is to  this subreddit  ready to cast. And they have  lists of things that work and what people have been  using. Works with my Samsung TV  pause and play on BBC iPlayer  is working. Bravia TV  play and return seem to work.  Pause does not. So it really has  something to do with how it's  implemented  on your TV and so forth.  So it's kind of cool.  So try it, I guess.  You can use your phone and your  Android device as a remote, but it's nice  to have a remote remote. And they don't come  with a Chromecast.  Jeff, your

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  number? I'm going to go with the number  two. A nice  little Eric Schmidt told the story  South by Southwest. The Washington Post has the first  person story of this. A Google Translate  love story.  Two lovebirds  met in Haiti, an American  and Frenchman.  And he spoke no English,  but they were attracted to each other.  And  used Google Translate.  Wow.  And finally moved in together and got married.  When I was in Madrid last week,  it was quite amazing that I was  sitting through these presentations  in Spanish. I didn't understand a word,  but they had PowerPoint.  So I would point my Google Translate  phone app at  this PowerPoint screen.  And it would translate from Spanish into English  pretty damn well and  incredibly fast.  It's amazing. Before long,  we're going to have simultaneous audio  translation on Google Translate. I'll bet you.  I hope the divorce lawyer has  Google Translate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I'm just kidding.  That was cynical.  You would get tiresome after a while going  I love you.  I love you. Te amo.  Je t'aime. Je t'aime.  So two  is the number? Two people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You stole two of my other numbers,  so I went with what I had. Oh, I did?  I'm sorry. None of the numbers were any  good. I thought the cube of  speed was interesting, but I didn't know what it meant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Two is good. I like two.  So we showed you the  Earth View extension from Google  Maps that was really cool that when you add  a new tab to Google Chrome  blank page, it would show you  a random satellite view from  Google Maps.  It was called Earth View, and I still recommend it.  It's free from Google, but they've released  another one. That's cool, too.  So you remember every time I had a tab, I'd have a neat  satellite view.  Now, every time I have a new tab,  I have a great work of art  in all my new tabs.  And it is.  It's kind of fun, and it  doesn't just have to be great works of art.  This extension is the Google  Cultural Institute,  and you can choose  what it is that shows up  and how  often it shows up and things like that.  It's an extension. It's a silly  extension, but you know, on the Chromebook,  you can't rotate wallpapers  and stuff, which I kind of miss.  I like the idea of having different  desktop wallpapers, but this kind of  solves it, because every time you do a new tab  in Google Chrome,  you get kind of a new full-screen  thing.  So let me show you. There was the Earth View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, on  Chromecast, the  backdrop thing where you can show your photos,  you know, it mixes  in my photos with  just Google photos, so  the artwork shows up and NASA photos show up,  and then you can just say, okay, Google,  what's on my Chromecast?  And it'll tell you about the picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't that nice? But you have to leave  your TV on, which is kind of a drag. Yeah, you do.  Yeah. So this  has some, it's called  Google Art Project. It's an extension for Chrome.  And it shows you  what buttons are there and how often it changes.  The default is to change the artwork  every day, but I decided to  change it every tab. I prefer that.  So it's kind of cool. Isn't that  nice? If you like, if you like  just having interesting backdrops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember the days with screen savers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. It's kind of the opposite of a screen saver.  You have to have your screen  turned on for this to work.  So that is a, there's  a new Chrome extension.  So I'll give you the both. Somebody's saying in the chat room,  what's the other one? I like the satellite  maps. So  that one is called  Earth View from Google Maps.  And you'll have to choose. I disabled  that so I could use Google Art Project.  But if I get tired of that,  I just disable Google Art Project,  turn the Earth View back on,  and now I get more satellite  images, which is cool too.  These are very beautiful.  It's just whether you like it.  That is cool. Yeah.  It's just, you know, because you have the same  wallpaper all the time on a Chromebook,  it's nice to have something different.  Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes  this edition of This Week in Google.  With Andy Rooney.  With Andy Rooney.  A bunch of old farts.  Great to have you. The three Andes.  Yeah.  Always a pleasure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think, boy, you know, we had several  Medium stories today.  Yeah, I'm starting to think.  Great stuff on there. Starting to think. It's interesting  that Yonko decided to publish on Medium,  at least in the interim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's funny. It's a great  place, you know, if you don't- no one goes to  your blog or you haven't-  you know, you don't have one or you haven't  sort of fixed it up. Medium's right there.  It's super fast. Writing is  really easy. Lots of people see it.  Yeah, I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They even have like a Top Stories  thing, which is kind of cool.  So yeah, there's some discovery there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
