Transcript:  Oh, this is Mexico City. Yes. We arrived last night. So nice here in taco taco town now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they appreciate being

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure they don't go for taco town. Well, they they have tacos

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do they I personally think tacos is the greatest food in the world  I love I think Mexico City has the greatest tacos in the world  So it's my highest compliment for a city to call it taco. No, no burritos because that's I think an American. Yeah  Yeah, what are they what's different about them is that the breakfast

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We have all kinds of tacos we have tacos from Mexico City. We have tacos from interior Mexico

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We stick everything in a taco what I'm thinking plantains or southern Mexico that kind of thing  What's that? What's a typical Mexico City taco, by the way, that's Stacy Higginbotham of Stacy on IOT and  The Stacy on IOT podcast with Kevin Toffle. Sorry. I want to introduce you before we get in onions and cilantro. Yes. Yum  That's all you need

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well to to answer your question the  the great thing about Mexico City is that all of the different regions are represented here and in addition to  Modern regions of Mexico. You also have a lot of ancient  Aztec and Olmec foods that are just completely amazing most of the  Every country has a food region or two. They like to brag about and here it and here in Mexico. It's southern  Mexico it's where all the great stuff is coming from but I agree but they there's just so much  Incredible variety and layered on top of all of that regional variety. Well, it has to be said that Texas and California  Mexican food are considered  Legitimate variants of Mexican food here in Mexico City as well  So layered on top of all of that you have this revival in the food business with you know  Hipsters creating like experimenting with a lot of different things one of our favorite taco places  They put goat cheese and avocado and things like that. It's just it's just really fantastic  And it's just a great foodie city all around

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, are you eating any mole because in Mexico City, I would be doing like the mole sampler all day long

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacy I'm bathing in it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's an Aztec invention chocolates in Aztec invention

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's it's actually a little more recent than that that the Aztecs used a lot of chocolate  but the but they didn't use it in a sweet variety or in a sauce like that, but it was kind of like a  It came in the last few centuries, but there's so much innovation in mole. It's just mind-blowing and yes, we eat tons of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My understanding is mole is not just a particular sauce, but it's a mix of ingredients. It's kind of like gravy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How we would like is that yeah, we we go and we do on the guest room at Mexico City experience. We did this  Essentially, it's a chili class where we're learning about chili  But we also do this go into mole in multiple ways and one of the moles that we try it actually has a hundred and thirty  Something ingredients one of what one of which is cookies  They there's a style of cookies that they actually grind up and put in the mole  So that's like that cookies multiple ingredients itself  but but that's made by this woman who's like  she's she's an older woman who lives in a village where they grow this very rare kind of chili and  She once in a while comes to Mexico City and teaches chefs  three day class on how to make her mole the entire three days is just about her mole and  We get to eat it and it's just it's really really really incredible  We also go to Puyol, which is probably Latin America's best restaurant and they have their  What do they call it? They have a five-year-old mole?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which I know about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah, well they serve they serve you a plate and  They put the five-year mole in a circle on the plate and then they put a new mole in  In  Come on Stacy seriously we had somebody who postponed their best experience and they're gonna come later we have a room for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Spain so Spain. Yeah, she's in Spain. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everyone's cool places except me. No, you're in Austin. That's a cool place  I'm always in Austin  So let's change the subject for something Stacy's intensely interested in oh  Something she couldn't care less about  Kso gaming

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stadium why am I on this show? All I do is talk about food

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I don't mind this turning into a food show. I totally am behind that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kso and chips with Stacy. Yeah  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the title of this episode as a matter of fact  So you better get some case of talk in there pretty darn quick  Stadia which we taught we covered the event  yesterday at the Google  Google spoke at the gamers developers conference GDC game developers conference and announced their streaming  gaming service  Well announced is a big word for what they did  Because they didn't they left out a few critical elements like  Time it will be released sometime this year  Cost we don't know  Nor do we know what games will be on it except it looks like there might be a version of doom  However, it's an interest there were a lot of interesting technical features and I think yeah for GDC that's probably  You know why they were talking about it there they want to get developers on board we talked a little bit about Microsoft has a similar  streaming  plan for next year and  We were talking about it on Windows weekly today and really Microsoft is in a much better position from a  Gamers point of view and already they have a reputation because of the Xbox is a gaming company  But also they have a ton of titles  Google doesn't own any gaming titles. They're gonna start a Google studio  And so it's unclear what games you'll be able to play on the other hand the idea that you could play a high-quality  You know triple-a title perhaps on your Chromebook on your Android phone and best of all on a Chromecast ultra hooked up to your TV  using a  Controller made by Google  That's an intriguing possibility

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and it has to be said so first a little ice water on anybody who's excited about this  They announced something very similar to this  Three or four years ago, and it was going to be based around Google Plus and  They were going and and Google and the Google Play Store now  It's primarily a function of YouTube and Vlad Savov has a really good piece in the verge today  Talking about how this is really about saving YouTube more than  Beating Microsoft. Why do they need to save the most successful video platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because this whole this whole world of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gamers remember that PewDiePie started as just a guy who put a camera on himself  I was playing video games  And so there's a lot of video gaming stuff that is put is posted on YouTube after the fact but twitch  Is is a kind of a scary thing. It's live  There's some live gaming going on YouTube, but that's kind of the future and I think  Google sees the ability to stream directly and integrate YouTube as a way to make it super compelling for the really  High-end gamers who want to stream and do that sort of thing?  They also love when there are products and services that require massive data center power because they excel in that area  They want people spending more time on the internet not on  Consoles or look, you know using local files and stuff like that their whole  Sort of business models to get people streaming from the cloud and so this is very a very  Googley thing in lots of ways  But I have to also say a couple of points one one about  As a as a nomad as a digital nomad. This is like the greatest news ever because you know, my my kids are playing  Xbox constantly and I can't you know when I'm traveling  I'm not gonna travel in Xbox even though my my younger son has been playing Xbox for a long time  I'm not gonna travel in Xbox even though my my younger son has done that  So I'm just like I can't play these games they're playing these multi massive multiplayer online games and I'm just like oh that's nice  I don't have any ability to do that with this I  Should be able to do that in most cases if I can find the the internet speeds and it's not just nomads who?  Don't want to buy a console don't have the the  Spaced for a console etc. It's great. It's going to be great  Probably to play these kind of triple-a games on a phone a tablet  Chromebook or whatever. It's also a great thing for Chromebooks in general because they've optimized this thing for pixel remember they the  they sort of beta tested the  Assassin's Creed game for a while with with select  Pixel users I actually signed up for it immediately  But couldn't play it because I was in Italy or something it was only for US users. I think  So that's that's really cool regarding the Microsoft being way ahead. I don't really necessarily think that they are way ahead  Microsoft is way ahead in terms of gaming titles, but I think Microsoft has a long way to go before they could stream them  And and and essentially deliver them to people who don't have the console who don't have an Xbox  Xbox

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they could do it, but they may not be incented to since they make consoles and PCs  That may not be their business model, but they certainly have Azure cloud  And yes, you know I mean you've got you've got three big players here with big cloud services Microsoft Google and Amazon  All three have a foot in this space  Amazon owns twitch so they very much have a foot in this space  Yeah, yeah, right. I don't think that this is this is just Google saying here's what we'd like to do  There's no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no having said that I mean I think they I think they could do something  It's not gonna. It's not gonna be as good as that what they showed for a long time  Yeah, I mean that was a demo well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It also ignores a critical factor that's out of Google's control, which is the last mile and yeah, you know  some people have a great experience people with great bandwidth and low latency will have a  Great experience and then the vast majority of Americans will have a terrible experience  And now Stacey there is something that you are into that this is  Relates to is I imagine some of this is the hope that 5g will solve that last mile problem for more people

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's a long way off right well. Yeah, and it's not gonna be okay  Depending on how 5g works it  You're gonna have it convert to Wi-Fi in your house  I'm trying to think logistically because the massive spectrum that we're gonna use for  fixed wireless 5g service  The in to get the capacity they need you're gonna need a lot of megahertz. You're gonna be using some of those  Upper gigahertz spectrum that doesn't penetrate walls, so you're gonna have something outside your house  That's gonna funnel that into your Wi-Fi network, so logistically. That's what that's gonna look like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure Google wants to see people doing this on an Android device out and about too if you had the bandwidth  Yeah  Honestly there's about 18 players in this  Including some non you know big companies and frankly this is this was tried years ago a company called on live  Did this and the problem on live had was that they didn't have enough servers?  Because there was a lot of use during peak hours and very little use during off hours and they couldn't  They didn't want to keep all those servers online. This is a problem Google will not have  Maybe Google's doing this to get a killer app for its gigabit

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Internet and I know it doesn't want to do fiber anymore or the fiber kind of fault  That's the big question like if you knew you were gonna do this wouldn't you have pushed fiber harder?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, I mean the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The investors didn't want them to push that harder  And they also ran into technical troubles in the way they were doing it  They did it in a very googly way, which was they were like  We will build the fiber loops around cities that is our plan and we will invent a new technique  And then that didn't work out so well, so they're like we will try something else and that didn't work out well  And then they were like never mind and by the way, we're not getting the subscribers  That's the other thing when I talk about the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the other thing right when I talk to real users like my wife  She this the what always comes up now when Google announces something new is well how long before they kill that?  Google has really created a reputation  And not just with geeks, but with real-world people of I mean inbox just went under right of just killing things kind of  Randomly and that doesn't help  So that's why I think Microsoft has a huge head start they're already in the gaming space  They they you know, they're in it to stay  They could have killed Xbox a long time ago when they struggled against PlayStation, but they didn't they have a lot of titles  They have a studio Google's announced a studio  But they don't they haven't announced any titles or or even you know, all they have is Jade Raymond who is a legend in the business  She's running the studio, but they've got to convince developers to develop games for this  non-existent service  Some you know, if you think end users have to take a leap of faith  Developers have the same problem  You mean I'm gonna develop a game for this service who knows if it'll launch and if it does who knows how long it's around  If I'm a developer I say I want to stick with Sony and Microsoft. Thank you very much

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really think they will be and should be a different set of games because the the sort of the best  The greatest hits Xbox games are always going to be better on PlayStation Xbox, etc on consoles

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And PCs by the way steam steam on PCs is gonna totally dominate that but totally so this is this is not gonna appeal to  Anybody who already has an Xbox or PlayStation or a gaming PC. It's just not it's gonna appeal  It's right primarily to people who don't have any gaming

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hardware right now. It's gonna improve casual gaming. Yeah for casual gamers. And so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not how Google was pitching it though yesterday it felt like that's right they were going after the triple-a titles

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I and and I'm sure that they will exist  But if you really are into gaming you're not gonna want to do that streaming and it's gonna be latency  There will be latency and and it's gonna vary based on a whole bunch of things. This is by the way is another  Kind of punch in the nose to rural users who have who are always get shafted in terms of one more thing  Exactly. So it's it's it's really problematic on that score  However, I can see up-and-coming game companies or innovative game companies or even the big game companies  developing  games  Optimizing them for streaming not not just a you know converting old titles streaming but but optimizing games  And so hopefully I'd like to see it become a new like I mean look at the difference between console gaming and self  You know smartphone games their night and day  I mean to for the most part the most popular games on smartphones are not the  Console style games they're more like word games and you know  You know silly cartoony type, you know true, you know get your mind off of you know  You're standing line the DMV type of type of distraction games. I was playing that game the other day  And but but I'd love to see streaming games sort of occupy the space between that, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is one triple-a title that people play on consoles they play on PCs and they play just as avidly on mobile devices  And that's fortnight and I think that truthfully Google's  Prayer is that they can get the next fortnight  One of the things they talked about was a battle royale fortnight style game with a thousand players  They talked about cooperative gaming that they can do uniquely well because the servers are co-located  Run, you know high-end gaming hardware next to each other and so you at home can play a cooperative game and everybody can have  A different device for instance and the latency between  Game instances is zero  So I think that's what I honestly think that's what Google's just crossing their fingers for who knows  Maybe they have something in development  The problem is you can create something doesn't mean it's gonna be as successful as a fortnight  but if they that that could be the make it or break it for stadia is  Is is just some game that you could only play on stadia that everybody in the world wants to play and you know  They do have a game kind of like that with Pokemon go  Harry Potter wizards unites gonna be like that  They need a title like they need a title that just takes the world by storm and then they need to get lucky  They need to get lucky. That's actually that's probably the best way to say it. They need to get lucky. Yeah  Here's what we asked a 14 year old gamer  Karsten bondi's son Zach  Karsten asked him what he thought and he said one he talked about the beginning where  CEO Sundar Pichai took the stage and said I'm not a gamer. He said it's incredibly dumb  To start off your gaming presentation with your CEO saying the words. I'm not a gamer. I  Kind of agree and I have to say that's an excellent point. It doesn't set the stage gamers are looking at that. Well screw you  number two  Number two why did they announce a gaming system without any games?  Even the one game they said they were going to have a doom  Update they never showed any gameplay from  During the keynote they confirmed doom which is already playable on literally anything this is Zach's  Thought literally playable on anything that even vaguely resembles a computer including by the way  There's doom versions for the Apple Watch and the iPod  They have no exclusive games the only first-party title Google has ever launched  Do you know what it is?  It's the one Sundar Pichai said is the most played game of all time the dinosaur game  Which you get when you get a 404 on a website  That is awesome and by the way, you can't play it on stadia because your internet would be down

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  If

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Zach is smart Karsten  Let me know when he's old enough for us to hire him number number three  If your system is dependent on an internet connection, it looks really bad  When your announcement live stream glitches out twice in an hour and you don't even bother to fix it in your YouTube video  So this is what he's talking about and we noted this when we were watching the event. This was everybody saw that  And by the way, first of all, the cameraman's butt is in the shot  It's frozen and glitched and this was for everybody watching it  They didn't even bother to edit that out of the announcement on YouTube  1.3 million people said well if that's how good it is, I ain't playing it  That happened several times  So if you can't stream a video you can't you gonna stream a game?  So sec includes maybe the dinosaur game will be playable on stadia after all  Final judgment worst game system announcement ever but I knew that in fact, I even said Carson  I don't know if you remember this during the event. I said I could tell you right now. I can hear the hate from the gaming community  Who are notoriously fickle anyway and are quick to jump on anything they feel is not you know, whatever  game ish  But that's not who this is for. This is not for current gamers  I don't think I don't I don't I don't think that's the goal. But the question is it for anybody?  And we know it's not for Stacy Higginbotham

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm just I don't I don't game. I mean, I'm excited

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm on the technical perspective like you've never like on your phone played like Scrabble or anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, I think I play I used to play words with friends way back in the day  That's a game. Well, yeah, and I play board games. I just I don't play games on my computer. I  Played mist a long time ago. You're not a gamer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you played the dinosaur game

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've seen people playing the dinosaur game. Does that count? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, there's a you know, if I enter if my internet's down, I go read a book

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's so funny because it really is and I am very guilty of this  But there really is a reality distortion field in these keynotes and I always have to kind of  Pinch myself slap myself on the wrist while I'm watching them because they're oh, you know if they're well done, they're exciting  And you watch them you go the this is great. I can't wait to get this and then as you get farther and farther from the event  And the real questions  Seep in you start to realize maybe that's not so great

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a good example of that potentially great. I mean really is it's all potential  It's just that you know in the same week when they're closing Google Plus and alo  Yeah  It's kind of hard to be like yes, I'm all in I'm doing this all the way man. This is like the greatest  This is the future now. Maybe it will be the future. Maybe it won't probably won't so, you know, Google's really you know  They I am surprised that they don't  Do a better job of explaining this whole reputation  They act like they don't have the reputation that they clearly have of closing things that their most passionate users care about  That's the thing. They don't close the  nobody cares about the boring stuff, but like they build up all these passionate users around inbox or  Google reader people are super into it and then they kill it and then they create another thing and they get all these passionate users  And then they kill it  So it's like nobody trusts Google anymore to not kill things and that's really hurting them and they never talk about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only I just come to think of it the only  Counter example to this reality distortion feel that Steve Jobs perfected of  You know so exciting in the announcement and then a little bit less overwhelming is Samsung. It does the worst announcements  Yes  But I have to say now you having used the s10 plus for a week and a half  the more I use it the more I love this phone this phone is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  awesome if they had done it on purpose, it would have been brilliant to lower expectations and  Have everybody be delighted

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  Well, Google has learned the Steve Jobs way and it was an exciting announcement. I hope they get the I hope they succeed  I would love it if I could play games on my pixel book  Or on my chromecast. I mean that would be really great. Yeah. Yeah, I would love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would really love it. In fact, I occasionally go looking for  Xbox style games that I can play and I inevitably give up and just be like well, I guess that's not gonna happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, I'm sorry. No, does chromecast the new one it supports 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi. Yes  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the ultra  ultra the ultra  Which is I think 80 or 90 dollars is 4k HDR 60 frames a second and 5g  Okay. Yeah, it does not have an Ethernet jack. However, so you will want to use the 5g obviously for 60 frames per second

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not awesome for gaming

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's enough though. Okay. Yeah, it's sufficient. It's when is a gamer ever been like, oh, so you're right though

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Often gamers, you know are talking about frame rate. I think less so now maybe but they often talk about framers 60s plenty  That looks real scooter X says it does have Ethernet. Is there is there a dongle that comes in the box?  Maybe that's why I don't remember Ethernet online  Maybe there's a USB dongle. I guess that sounds right. So if it has Ethernet, that's even better  In the power adapter, okay. Oh, yeah, I guess I do remember that mine's been sitting behind my TV for so long  It's got thin layer of dust on it. I don't I don't really remember unboxing it even  Alright, well if it has Ethernet, that's that's pretty good  Alright, I think we've said it all which is ironic. I thought we'd spent a lot more on this  subject, but I think that there's just so much unknown that there's really not much more to say except it's all potential our show today brought  To you by Express  VPN I  Am an Express VPN fan. I found my VPN folks  And if you've been looking you might have found it to Express VPN  Look there are two reasons why people use a VPN virtual private network  That's the thing that encrypts your internet traffic from your computer to the VPN server  Eventually it has to enter the public internet  but why should it be visible in the open Wi-Fi coffee shop or at the hotel or  Even to your internet service provider. Why should  AT&T get your data right there. We know they don't what they do with it. They sell it  Even your home internet service provider often sells what you do online to third parties  So people are using VPNs more and more often there is an important distinction though between a  Good VPN and a bad VPN. There are many many bad VPNs out there  First of all always before you buy a VPN read the privacy policy  When you see Express VPNs privacy policy, you'll note they don't log anything that you're doing. They don't keep track  They don't know who you are. You are completely anonymous. And by the way, they don't they don't operate in the United States. They're offshore  So they don't have to respond to a subpoena from the US government. This is secure  This is the best way to protect your online privacy  It secures and anonymizes your browsing by encrypting your data hiding your public IP address  You can operate in any country. They have servers all over the world. I think it's 160 different  Servers that's good for two reasons one because you can emerge into the public internet and in the country of your choosing  But also because there's a server close to you  So that means your performance is gonna be better and I'll tell you most of the time when you're using Express VPN  You won't have any idea you're on a VPN easy to use  They've got apps that run seamlessly in the background on Windows Mac iOS Android phone tablet anywhere  You are open the app click once and you're protected  for less than seven bucks a month  Express VPN number one VPN service rated by tech radar  Comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee  So there's no reason not to try it right now  And in fact, we're gonna give you a three extra months free with a one-year package at express VPN comm slash twig  Don't compromise on security. Don't compromise on  Privacy and don't compromise on speed express VPN comm slash twig three extra months with a one-year package  expre s  VPN comm slash  Twig and we thank them so much for their support  This week in Google  So the third shoe has dropped things come in threes the third fine  from the EU  for Google  this the smallest fine only a mere 1.49 billion euros about 1.7 billion dollars and  While  Google stopped doing this almost immediately so they don't have to make any agreements about not doing it anymore. It was a  Fine for limiting how some websites could display ads  Sold by others others than Google's ad services if that makes any sense  I don't know if it's over now. I don't know if Google's gonna dispute this  I think they're just gonna pay it because a it's not all that much money and  B they've stopped doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're just I mean I caught your conversation on  Windows weekly about this and I think that's exactly right. They just they have so much money  They know these things are gonna happen, especially in Europe  So they just pay the fine make the changes that they have to make just the cost of the business. Yeah  Yeah, and so this is this is for you know companies that were using their search for internal search and  You know  Essentially Google was hogging the best  spots for the search  for advertising and trying to exert control over  What sorts of advertising could happen by the website and so it was a little bit abusive  I personally think it's kind of a borderline  Abuse, I don't think it doesn't bother me that much. I mean, it's they're not charging for the service  And it's voluntary so on the part of the companies  But they are so dominant in Europe they're much just I always remind people of this  They're far more dominant in Europe than they are in the United States  And so Google is a sore subject in Europe because they are so popular basically  so  This is also by the way is the smallest of the big three fines. It's not that  It's not a lot of money for Google. It's just the cost of doing business in Europe. It's not the end however of possible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Action or charges or fines this for sure. This is the chart from the European Commission  There are actually five probes  Three of them have been completed the comparison shopping was the first the  Misuse of Android was the second and then this most recent one advertising  Google has a pop appealed the first two has not yet appealed and probably won't appeal I think this one  And then there are two more probes ongoing  with regard to local search and maps and  scraping and  Charges have not been filed the probes are ongoing on the charges not so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know what scraping is I don't know what it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably I'm gonna guess it has to do and this is a pure guess  But it has to do with snippets  It's that like some zik shrek where Google puts snippets of content  From the sites that a new sites that it shows research results  I'm guessing I you know there's this is from a Wall Street Journal article, and I don't think they even explain what those other two  probes are so I  And I think I apologize I'll have to do some research

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I apologize, and I think this one's been going on for a while a couple three years or something like that  If I'm not mistaken Google stopped doing this in 2017  Well this one, but in terms of the scraping I think that they've been looking at that for a long long time and and  so I think I  Don't know why it's taking them so long other than a CEU

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and there may be hoping that article is it article 13. That's the scraping one that might take care of it  I don't know there's and it's controversial as you know  France and Spain have both acted against snippets Germany has to with less than stellar results, so  Anyway just an update Google has also  in an attempt to  Swage the European Union decided to do a browser  Ballot kind of like Microsoft did in Windows for EU Android devices instead of  Automatically getting Chrome and Google search on your Android device when you first set up an Android device  Google will let you choose which browser and which search engine you want to use  This is the Microsoft Windows browser ballot, which is just so stupid  And by the way, this isn't even all the browsers it went on and on and on  Right, and it was a random mix in a random order  so  Google we don't we don't have an image of Google's browser a ballot and how or how they're gonna do it  But that they've already decided that that might be the way to do it. I have to think I  Just imagine at the meeting they said. Oh, yeah, let okay  Good. We'll put a ballot on the Android phone. See how I see how they like that. We'll show we'll show them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean all this all this essentially  This is a repeat of the Internet Explorer bundling and I trust thing in the 90s which which was  nobody  talks about it like this, but essentially  Microsoft's point was proved correct. Yes, basically what Microsoft was saying is that anybody can choose any browser  We're like one great browser away from being crushed and and then nets  Firefox came along and crushed them and then and then chrome came along and crushed Firefox. So  The the bundling doesn't matter that much and offering a choice has practically no effect whatsoever

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's you have to have a browser  It's it's an integral part of any operating system if nothing else to give you a way to download a browser  How you gonna download Chrome if we don't put a browser on there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the only time I it's the only time I use safaris when I get my new MacBook and I'm like boom  Safari to Chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when is so April is Google is Mike is of course the last  Google Plus user

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, Oh April 3rd, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, just I just got a thing saying save all my photos

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you saving all your photos between Google Plus and flickr and what are you gonna do man? Oh, man

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I already have all my photos and there's there are multiple efforts to to  So Google has its own process for downloading  I downloaded all my posts and some of them are I put a lot of work into and they're very evergreen  So I'm probably going to repost them on my blog good  But but we do have I mean like I said, I wrote in a Google, you know  fast company piece a couple of months ago  most of what was great about Google Plus was killed in  2014 and  So it's kind of been a shadow of itself for the last few years. So it's at this point no big loss  to a certain extent that that's heresy in in some circles, but  The problem is a  Lot of passionate Google Plus users felt like this is the one social network. I want to use  It's the only one I want to use and all these smart people that I've gotten to know really well are here  We have these great conversations and everything was great and now  Nobody knows where to go Facebook's off the table because they're horrible Twitter is annoying  To a lot of people and where else you're gonna go so people are going to you know  They're going to plus spora and they're going to we me and they're going to all these social networks  Nobody's heard of but what's happening is that the Google Plus community is being is going off to 22 fragment

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's a diaspora, but it's no long that means it's gone it's being destroyed right and I actually blame Google  For this because they did create something value. They really pitched it hard a lot of people went all in  I mean Mike, you know, maybe it was ill-advised to put these full-length articles on Google Plus and nowhere else  But but you did it because you believed in it and you really liked the conversations there  And how could Google just let that go and this is why people no longer trust Google they see this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This feels like and this drives me nuts  I mean the web is no it's no different than the rest of our lives  There are places I like to go and talk to people and hang out and I spend my time  I put my effort in I've worked at publications that have gone under for example  There are coffee shops where I hang out with my friends and they are no longer around or someone moves  The world moves on and I know this feels really mean but I'm kind of like  You know, it didn't work for them. They shut it down  Okay, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you want your own clearly weren't a Google Plus lover

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I wasn't but I've loved other things like I mean all of my giga-ohm stuff only half of it exists  I've lost my entire podcast catalog from giga-ohm and I'm like, yeah. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's life, you know this life I've got I'll tell you why it hurts  I mean it hurts but just but I'll tell you why we need something like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do we though? Yeah, we do a part it no cuz then we stagnate  I mean then you go and create other communities you take your ideas that you learn from other people and then we I mean think  About it in the physical world, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The physical world if there were if there were  There's towns yeah, it's like a town has disappeared that's a big deal right but those people left that town

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not saying it's not a big deal  I'm saying these things happen in life and you just have to accept it and  Put you down your roots somewhere else and do it all over again. And that's what people  That's life. I guess I just I understand what you're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing that has to be said though is the Google plus the original version of 2011 to 2014  To a lesser extent afterwards was a really really special social network  I mean it was really every social network for some reason I and I certainly have no idea why this is has a certain  Zytec has a certain feel to it a certain tone a certain, you know  Instagram is so different from Twitter or Facebook, even though it's owned by Facebook  And the the essential nature of Google plus there were things that were achieved on that social network that you just are unheard of  on other social networks one of them is lots and lots and lots of people actually turned  strangers into close friends in real life  and I'm one of those people I have  15 20 people who I  Go visit and who I know personally and who I didn't know until we started following them on Google Plus you learn you  Have a lot in common. You have a lot, you know, you you gang up on trolls together  You do all the stuff you do hangouts and then they're great friends  I have people in Belgium and like I went and stayed with a great friend that I met on Google Plus in Switzerland  You don't you don't hear about that kind of stuff on Facebook basically what you're doing is you're kind of  Hoovering up all of the for all the friends and acquaintances and co-workers you've ever had and maintaining some superficial connection with them on Google Plus  you're like  everybody was a stranger because you're you know, nobody's family was really to speak of and  You make these great friends. I don't know why that was the case. We used to have these things called hurls hangouts in real life  essentially meetups and I've never heard of a social network that was so  conducive to  real-world friendships  In the early days of Twitter and it stopped soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But in the early days of true there were tweet ups and it was very much like that but Twitter  became mass appeal and that  Ruined it and I think one of the reasons Google Plus was great is because it wasn't very successful  And exactly the people were there were great. But I what is it? What are the other lessons to be learned from this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google can't do social no matter how much I  Would I would submit I will not I think we need to have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I  Don't think we can trust any company to do this, right? I  Had a WordPress blog and do it yourself. Well, that's not social. Ultimately. It's only a little bit social  I mean, honestly and it's been tried and this is so I know my solution isn't a good solution  But we need a federated open network  that  and you know, I we had hopes that in you know, Identica then status net then  Mastodon would be that they have the right backbone  But somehow those communities never gelled properly  But that's how it has to be because if a company's in charge of it all sorts a  They could kill it but be they start monetizing Instagram  Was a great site great social network until they put an ad every ninth post and they started adding all these features like stories and the  Influencers as soon as the influencers arrived Instagram went way downhill. What about something like Pinterest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe Pinterest is the answer. I don't know. I mean, it's it's a high quality. Is it very social?  I'm trying to it feels more like people put stuff there, but they doesn't feel like there's interaction. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right. It's a scrapbook

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, right it's a problem it's where people interact become cesspits

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not that's not a crazy idea. I keep I keep wishing Mastodon would succeed because from a technical point of view  It's the right thing. Nobody owns it  It's federated you can create your own server  But the communities that have been created on Mastodon and I haven't found one that really attracts me at this point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the problem is that every social network is either a failure in which case it's not worth using because  Nobody's on it. Yeah, or if it's successful, they will ruin it in order to squeeze every nickel out of it  That's why it can't be commercial  There there that those the only two social networks we've ever seen Google Plus was different for a while  I mean people say it wasn't it wasn't popular and I  I mean, it's way more popular than lots of other social networks that have emerged since that people think are popular

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Great features though, like unlike Mastodon, which really is a Twitter clone. It was a threaded conversation clone  it was great with images people like Trey Ratcliffe showed that it became a  Fabulous place to put your images Google mismanaged it almost from day one  establishing this crazy circle system that no one wanted to maintain and then you know  I mean they just they they killed it deaf by a thousand cuts and it's yeah  It's tragic and it's a really good example of why Google or any company shouldn't be in charge of social and yet  No one's done any I wish they you know what Google open source  Yes, slack is slack for many people turned into that. Yeah. Yeah, I  Mean, maybe that's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what? I would say we had a so the former giga-omers  We actually had we we took our slack channel right at the end of the show or at the end of the  company you still do it actually still is alive and for the year afterwards, we actually even paid for our own private slack and  We did it because we had a lot of value in it and slack such a pig as an application

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hard to support it. Oh  There's like no no, it's just a terrible. It's I mean it's written in electron and it's just big and heavy  And it needs I don't know what it I don't it's not bad  I mean, I know people are doing it discord is another very popular

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Social network, can I can I propose I have to I have to say something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, let me just say this before you do which is Google. Please open source Google Plus and let us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Take it back. Okay, the tragedy is that we already have  the world's greatest social network  Which is email and the reason that nobody wants to use email for social networking is because they've lost control of their inboxes  Lots and lots of people have  20,000 messages in their inboxes and because they can't can manage the spam and the hype and the thing the newsletters and all that stuff  They're like, yeah, let's go to let's all go to slack  This is the prevailing attitude, but it's it's mistaken  everybody goes to Facebook for example because  For a bunch of reasons, but the number one reason is network effects. Everybody's on Facebook because everybody's on Facebook except  Everybody isn't on Facebook email. There are three or four times as many people on email. Everybody is on email. Yeah, everybody's on email

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  terrible social experience  That's it that's like saying in what way exactly saying chain letters are awesome for social experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But in what ways it's exactly what Leo's talking about it's an open system you can use your own front end you can use this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That the other thing you can't communicate easily with people  You can't see it the conversations when they're threaded the way email threads them are horrible. You can't  Yeah, maybe it's just we need a better client and maybe the client  No, cuz then you would still split your email  So then you would just take your email identity  But you still have to split them out like I don't want to communicate with my friends over email  because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a professional inbox. There you go. There's a solution. Why don't we

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's dead, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rats well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  my  Yeah, my point is that that email is so close  You mentioned the threaded I mean I you probably use Gmail that the threading of  message threads on on Gmail and inbox is not great and  But it could be it should be  It should be something that is fixable in the client  But it's it's a it's a it's a it's a great social network because you can't  There's no algorithmic filtering. This is it and then the truth is this is one of the reasons people hate it because somebody like Facebook  There's not some corporation monitoring your relationships and deciding who's important who isn't important  Anybody can email me. Yeah people people say they don't like that  But actually people love that fact that that Facebook is simply not showing you what people are posting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I mean everyone there's too much information if there's no algorithm  I mean, I have 17,000 unread emails in my inbox. This does not stress me out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but again, but again that that's handleable in the browser  I mean you there's no reason why you couldn't algorithmically sort emails  Other than the fact that you also have mission critical business. That's great the same box

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly, and that's that's my that's the dog again earth dog. That's the mark against email  I guess well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is one of the interesting things that happened when I got off Facebook  Well, I mean I haven't gotten off yet 4th of July is when I'm officially getting off in the meantime  I'm sort of criticizing them like every day and also trying to get people to sign up for my newsletter and go to my nice book  my nice book is a  folder on Google photos where I post personal photos and where people can comment and like those photos and it's a kind of  Replacement for Facebook, but what I've noticed is there were I already have lots of family and friends who were not on Facebook before  And so they never saw my personal photos  now that I'm on  Google photos they see it because they get a notification in their email inbox  And so they use an email, but they didn't use Facebook and so now for the first time there were several  Older relatives of mine who are seeing my personal photos for the first time  But again, this is a way  This is back to the promise of Google plus Google plus promise to integrate Gmail and Google plus so email  Social networking was all kind of the same thing and photos by the way. Yeah, exactly  Exactly. And so now now I'm sort of email and photos is the same thing unless you choose to get notifications on your phone or whatever  Some people do both but lots and lots of a lot more people are seeing my personal photos on Google photos  Then we're seeing them on on Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's some smart developers should just reverse engineer  All the best features of Google plus Google photos and email and  Make something there's an opportunity here. I think a lot of people are going to be leaving Facebook  there's p I here's why I think it's sad Stacy because I think  We need a good social network. We clearly  Like social networks, but we also see the downsides to social networks  Is it impossible to design a social network that really works  Maybe maybe we just haven't tried enough times I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think I think the problem is there's not one social network that's gonna work for everyone, right?  And that the challenge then becomes oh  Well, if everyone's not on it, then I can't reach everyone thus people are like, oh, this is not the right social network  And then we get frustrated  I mean the things I want a social network are probably very different than the things Mike wants in a social network  I would guess since he is said I think a well-designed app could probably handle both  Maybe it could handle the difference between Mike and me but could it do Mike me plus my mom and my daughter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure it could why not I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think look at work. Then I don't think it would be as essential like I think at different points of your life  You want different things  I think you communicate different ways with people depending on the type of person you are the type of interaction you're seeking. I mean I  Just I  Don't think there's one for everyone and even every stage of your life

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do think that there's a general idea that most people would love in a social network  So the problem I think most of the problems with social networking, especially Facebook is  Inauthenticity so I would and I mean that very broadly so for example when  when my uncle Fester posts some mean he found I  Have no interest in that. I don't see why

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I wish it somebody needs to start naming kids Fester so that down the road  There'll be a future world in which people will have an uncle Fester. Yes, please you young parents out there, please  Fester you're not doing it for him. You're doing it for the future generation. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think of the future but but I think that and and so that ranges from people passing around memes or other people's thoughts to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Russian interference to you know disinformation campaigns to that was the beauty of Google you could you could filter that stuff out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well to over time it  People were sharing stuff. That's not their own thoughts, but I would love a social network that had basically two rules one is  No, Phil no algorithmic sorting or filtering when I follow somebody I want everything they post  Yeah, second thing is nobody I don't want to get any content that isn't the actual words or photos taken by the person

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no share no resharing no retweeting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes  Absolutely, I mean I don't mind retweeting but if but that I do that with tweet tech

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I turn off retweets and it really cleans the Twitter stream considerably because you don't get this amplification effect

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but but you know that even with back when before social network  Working one of the big problems we had an email was everybody sending these like, you know, these forwards  Yeah, chain letters and like, you know, and they were all that was fake news of the you know, 2005 or whatever but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't it continues to this day. By the way, there's plenty of yeah  Relatives who continue to send those

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And another thing that this social this fantasy social network should have is the ability to bring in content that follows the rules from other  social networks, so somebody wants to be on Twitter and  And and and I can just plug in Twitter and have their tweets coming to this social network and then my comments go back out  It's Twitter. But again companies like Twitter are gonna throttle, you know, they're gonna strangle that and it's cradle if Kevin Marx were here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He would say this is the kind of thing the open web is, you know  Indie web is constantly working on and there are a lot of initiatives and a lot of attempts to kind of solve these technical  Challenges, but I and I've tried a lot of them. I play with them all because I want to you know  I'm looking for this this one thing there is one tool I'm gonna mention because a big part of the  Social networking that is email is newsletters Mike. You've got a great one  The problem I have with newsletters is that I get too many because it's not just Mike sending me newsletters  It's also way fair. You got what I need and I don't want that  so and they're all  Intermingled so Megan Moroney on iOS today found a really nice app. That's basic  It's called stoop. That's basically you subscribe to newsletters with a stoop email address  If you sub sign up for stoop, you'll get an email address and then all the newsletters you actually want go into an app  That you can read and this really works  Well, this is it's a it's a news rep a news reader for email newsletters

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it would be the elevator pitch and I think I think that's cool, you know, it's basically this is what I I roll my own  For that exact same concept. What I do is I have a full newsletter folder  I have a rule that basically grabs every email newsletter and puts it in that folder and then when I'm ready to go read  Newsletters, I just go through them in reverse chronological order  It's very nice to not have newsletters in my inbox nice to I do the emails for my kids or whatever and so  It really really works for me and as part of how I achieve zero inbox like several times a day  But again, this this is kind of a nerdy thing that most people don't want to do  So an app like this is a great idea because it kind of kind of does it for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We need the opposite of a Google change log  Maybe the Google dead list or something. Yeah the Google graveyard  Spring cleaning so April 2nd and I actually there's a there's some details to this April 2nd  inbox is going away and  Google Plus are going away. Here is how it works the timeline Google's released this February 4th  Which is past you can't create a new profile  All your web comments will be deleted  On April 2nd that's coming up. In fact all comments  Consumer Google Plus content will be deleted. They Google has said they're gonna keep a business version of Google Plus around  I don't know what that means  Other than Google notes content that it's required to keep for legal reasons. So photos videos  Your album archive everything is gonna go away. You need to go to Google takeout and get it all  There's also a Google support page for that, but that's not all they're gonna be inbox and Google Plus are going away  But so is goog.gl  Their URL shortener is going away. Yeah  Yay  also alo

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I believe the links that exist for that will continue to work, but you can't make new links. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Google is really doing some house cleaning. I  Can't say I'm unhappy about  Inbox because I mean it was good and I feel bad for Google relied on it  But I think there are other choices out there  And the URL shortener there are certainly plenty of choices there. I use bit.ly for that  Google Plus was long has been dead for a long time. They're just pulling the cord  But I'm sad I'm actually most sad about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  well, the the good news is that Internet Archives and the archive and archive team are  Working to preserve public posts. Thank you  They posted this on a reddit and essentially what they're doing is they're they're going to  Compress the photos so you're not gonna have the high quality photos  They're probably not gonna preserve all the comments  Like I mentioned that the the glory days of Google Plus between 2011 2014 the Google Plus messages had a maximum of 500  comments and  for many many users  Their comments were maxed out every time on every single post so for  posts that have  More than probably they didn't say specifically but I would guess a few dozen comments  You're not gonna retain all those comments, but they'll try to retain a screenshot  Essentially of the common of most of the comments or some of the comments  For posts, but again, the most the important thing are the posts and the photos and they're trying to  Retain them all and that this is the reason this is interesting is because if you thought  That if you were wanting to delete your posts and figure well, just like Google do it for me  You really should delete them ASAP  Before they're archived by these guys because the this archive may live forever actually. Let's hope it does it should. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then there's Devin Nunes  Hard not to to be amused by this  He's a representative from California  Former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee now ranking member  he's sewing Twitter and  A number of Twitter users including his mom is fake mom  Devin Nunes mom and his cow Devin cow to parody accounts for 250 million dollars  Nunes is accusing Twitter facilitating defamation on its platform  By ignoring lawful complaints about offensive content and by allowing that content to remain accessible to the public  Saying that it violated terms and services terms of service  On the other hand, it's not illegal to parody or mock  people  and ironically  Devin cow  Which had fewer than a thousand followers when this lawsuit was announced  Well, I should just go quickly check but has gained a lot of traction  Let me just see Devin cow now has  472,000 followers

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Frustrating here is that people have actually  Beat Twitter up for having terrible terrible like reactions to people saying hey  Take this down. It's offensive. It bothers me and Twitter's constantly like  Like women who've been you know  Yelled at on Twitter that that's a big problem. They have they see all kinds of offensive content and Twitter does nothing  so I  Mean do I wish Twitter had better standards? Yes. Do I want to get behind the scenes?  Do I want to get behind Devin Nunes and his obvious attack on a parody account? No  Well, I'd also be really curious what Jeff would say given his yeah, Jeff said

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have I with parody accounts?  I've never sued Twitter over that and I've you know, I mean a if you're a public figure, especially if you're a member of Congress  Yeah, yeah, you you really kind of have to accept the fact that people are gonna have something to say to you and Twitter's a  Good place to do it  Told him he should sue I mean what it was obviously bad advice  he's grown the size of the  Devin cow following by

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  471 it's the best thing that ever happened to his cow. Oh, man Devin cow is so happy  But but my favorite part about this is that he is specifically talking about  About you know libel and defamation coming up to the  2018 midterms and  the lawsuit is 250 million dollars for compensation and  300 and an additional 350 thousand dollars in punitive damages, but like it's like wait a minute back up there  250 million dollars in compensatory damages. He's saying that he's going to lose  250 million dollars because of these parody accounts. Well, I imagine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That Twitter will seek a sorry judgment and get it thrown out immediately. I  Can't imagine this will proceed and even if it does there's no way he's getting a penny  Where was this money coming from? Where is the quarter of a billion dollars you lost Devin?  I mean, yeah  Was it from from bribes from from campaign finance turns out Devin Nunes is his battle lawyer as he is a member of Congress  And and and a bad  strategician as well because or strategician  Because he Devin cow now has a hundred thousand more followers a hundred thousand more followers than Devin Nunes official account

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that seriously I think what he's actually doing is that I I  Personally have to assume that this is a publicity stunt. Yeah, and the whole it's it's basically  Trying to feed the Republican narrative that social networks have a  Anti-conservative bias  President's jumping on this everybody's jumping on this and in interviews with various people  Jack Dorsey has pointed out that most of the time much of the time when people say oh this conservative person posted some  Conservative opinion and you block them. He says well, that's what you think is happening  But actually we see all the behind the scenes what they're really doing is they're in the part of this coordinated campaign of  Disinformation with multiple fake accounts and bots doing all this XYZ and the sum total of all these things that this particular  Instance is doing is getting them booted off. What what what is chilling and nauseating about all this is  that  there's a lot of dirty tricks in politics and you know, you can't blame just the  conservatives but and and so let's not let's just basically point out that disinformation works and  That false narratives work and the the the conversations are getting so extreme and it's all being amplified by  By so by social media. Everybody's got a voice  even Nunez's cow has a voice everybody's got a voice and so  There's a there's a legitimate mainstream politicians are essentially trying to make the world safer for disinformation  because that's  The strategy that's those are the tactics that everybody's glomming on to if we can basically shame social networks into allowing  Disinformation campaigns or you know any of this other stuff  By saying that they have a conservative bias  I mean they've seen Facebook actually reverse course on things when they were accused of having a  Conservative bias we've seen all kinds of hay being made  When this particular person or that  particular account has been shut down or  Suspended or whatever and they just immediately just apologize and reverse course on it so you can you know, it's just a strategy  They're trying to make they're trying to increase the size of the window  That's allowed for any kind of speech that harms  Political opponents. I think that's the problem if Twitter were doing what Nunes's lawsuit says

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it was actively censoring and shadow banning conservatives  Thereby eliminating Nunes's voice while amplifying the voice of his Democratic  detractors  So what I mean, I don't think they are but what if they were so what I'm sure you could accuse Fox News or MSNBC  Of having a bias and not giving a voice to people it disagrees with if it's a media company  It's allowed to do that  What what makes Twitter special that that it's not allowed to have a point of view if it does which it I don't think it  Does but even if it did that's not illegal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  again, I don't think this lawsuit is being  filed in good faith

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly, it's a truth. I'm sure any judge will just say well, come on  Here's one of the tweets from Devin Nunes mom that was mentioned in the complaint Devin Nunes  Your district is looking for you. Are you trying to obstruct a federal investigation again?  You come home right this instant or no more Minecraft. See that's cool. That's pretty funny. That's comedy. Yes  And even if you were a Devin Nunes fan, I think you would say well, that's funny. It's not harmful

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. It's not you know advocating harm to another person like some tweets and lots of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we did. Yeah, we've seen a lot of that  Yeah, and I don't see that blocked I wish it were but we don't see that blocked

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can't buy you can't block the president of the United States. Come on. I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way  Finally finally a bill has been signed into law banning fake news  and  internet insults completely illegal  in Russia

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm so glad that somebody is standing up against fake news  It's it's about time. It's about time the bills

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Say you can't criticize  The government let's see. Here's the exact quote  There's punishment for spreading information that quote exhibits blatant disrespect for the society  government official government symbols  Constitution or governmental bodies of Russia see Devin Nunes would love Russia, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The US did have laws like this what we had the treason and sedition law way back in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was right after the First Amendment became the part of the Constitution  We passed a bill that's that said oh and by the way, don't say anything bad about the government

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, I mean we came back from that. Thank goodness. Yes, thank goodness. Yeah, actually really remarkable

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much the First Amendment has become  Almost a state religion and I'm and I think that's a very good thing. But as you point out  Historically Stacey it was not it was it was not particularly even honored by Congress  But thank goodness. It's kind of is these days  And I think that's the right thing clearly in Russia  There is no First Amendment insulting state symbols and Putin will carry a fine of  300,000 rubles and 15 days in jail for repeat offenses

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know in California you can flick off a police officer and it's considered a First Amendment right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was an interesting case wasn't it? It's like oh, but I wouldn't recommend it  I'm not saying as a policy. It's a good policy  But you know sometimes having the right to do it and actually doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are different things well one of the one of the fun things about  President Trump and I don't want to talk about his politics or this is in the left right thing, but  Whether you're conservative liberal you have to acknowledge the obvious fact that he tends to call fake news  News that does not praise or that's critical of him  That's his definition of fake news and good news is news that is praise worth it that praises him  And this is essentially the law that they've enacted in Russia. Yeah to it to a large extent. They're saying no fake news  What is fake news? Well anything that criticizes the government is by definition fake news and so it's absolutely ridiculous  It's also ridiculous because of course it has to be said that Russia is the  probably the world's largest  purveyor of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  News in the world, so it's actually a very good point. I hadn't really  Really thought about that. It's illegal in Russia, but you could do it against anybody outside of Russia

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's something that Russia has been on the forefront of for a hundred years  I mean they during the Cold War this their their  You know, they got the Soviet Union  Governed to a very large extent by  Using disinformation within the country. This is before globalization all that kind of stuff  But the KGB was masterful at disinformation and just go look at the archives  You see different versions of every photo where they before Photoshop they were, you know hand painting  People out of photos as if they never existed and so on so they've been at this for a long long time  Stalin was a master

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, actually the president is already  Campaigning for 2020 and is way out spending the his Democratic opponents in ad spending on Google. In fact  Most of his ad spending are not Google most of his ad spending is on Facebook  He has already spent three and a half million dollars from the beginning of the year  On Facebook ads a million on Google. That's more than all the other candidates combined  And you know what it worked for him  It's I think in a way this shows that these other candidates haven't learned the lesson of the 2020 election  Facebook is really where the batter battleground is going to be isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I think I think that what's happening to a very large extent is people don't want to throw a whole lot of money behind a  Candidate when that candidates chances of being the nominee are very silly. We have a front-runner then yeah, see it ramp up  Trump is absolutely going to be then, you know  Well that not necessarily actually after  You know  There could be lots of news that comes out that could harm him and the Republican Party may want to go with somebody else

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Mitt Romney and others are saying they're running so there may be some challenge

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so but still he's he's a you know, it's pretty safe bet that you can  Contribute to his campaign now and and you'll be actually backing somebody who will be running. Yeah, which is nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I  Think we'll be watching with a real interest because I think  It's pretty clear that Facebook ads are the single most effective way  Right to they were but you think it'll be very interesting to see how Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean remember we talk about this all the time Facebook tweaks his algorithms and six newspapers go out of business or not newspapers  but news organizations, so  There's a very real chance that Facebook could adapt the way that it  targets advertising or  Allows people to do things related to ads that changes that and that would be very I mean I  Wouldn't count it out  I guess is what I'm saying Facebook could really Facebook is very very much so a player here as much as it may not want  To be as much as it may hate to admit it  It can do things to make its ads make ads much more much less effective

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook getting a lot of heat of course for the tragedy in Christchurch  It was streamed live for 17 minutes by the shooter or the alleged shooter on Facebook  Although do we still really have to call him the alleged shooter if he streams the video of him doing it live  I've not seen it until until someone is convicted in a court of law. Okay alleged. There's some pretty strong evidence  Which he provided I  Never helped to see it  But there are a lot of people who want to see it and of course the real problem all the social networks are having  Right now is keeping that video down  Facebook says it removed one and a half million reposts of that video  But that several hundred thousand still got through Twitter and reddit and other social networks have faced it and now in Australia  Telstra one of the big  Australian telecom companies is actually blocking  For Chan 8 Chan and other sites they say because of these videos  But I wonder if this is a gonna be a long-term strategy. No, it was temporary. They've already unblocked them again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have okay. Okay, I think so and but it raises another question  I mean back in the old days before social and before live streaming  I mean, we really have to you know, we've all gotten used to live streaming, but what a revolution that is  I mean, I remember what is first coming out actually talk speaking to Google Plus the first  Way the first free way to live stream multiple people was hangouts on air and  It's like, you know, it's like owning CBS News or something like that  But with a larger audience potentially if it's you know  and obviously that kind of power is going to be gained by lots of people for lots of purposes including  violent psychopaths and back in the old days  It was a kind of a common thing where where crazy people would hold hostages or do something  Threatened violence if you don't read my manifesto on the air. I will do XYZ  This is like this has been going on for now now. They don't have to do that anymore  they can go directly to the people and they can  Livestream their stuff which raises the the the question and this is a dicey issue because I'm saying this as we're live streaming this  But do we need live streaming are they are the potential downsides of live streaming worth the the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We can filter something like this building filters for this that catch  Something of this magnitude or even people who are trying to kill themselves over live stream  Those are things you can actually algorithmically detect if not the content of the video the sudden interest in a video  Facebook saying that no one apparently reported this feels like a real dodge and  I know there are there eight billion people on this planet now. Have we reached that yet 7.5 and  You know 3.5 of them have internet access so they could be streaming it something abhorrent at any one point in time  but I do think there is a  There is an investment that needs to be made in detecting these and getting them down faster, and it's not it's technically very possible I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I would say even if it weren't  That it's that that's no reason to stop live video. I'm sorry. I just really feel like  Yeah, I mean it's awful, but but  One of the things that's so great about the internet is the elimination of gatekeepers and  People who were protecting us against things we didn't want to see I think back to the Vietnam War which was some called the first  television war and I think one of the reasons the Vietnam War was  so heavily protested was because people for the first time saw the horrors of war in their living room and  I think that if you attempt to filter out the horrors of the world  In a reasonable attempt to you know keep people safe. That's a mistake  And I don't think the gatekeepers made the world a better place  And I think you know this is the problem with the internet it brings in the good and the bad right into your living room  But in the but in the long run I think that any restrictions on the capabilities of the internet is a big mistake

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also worry that that that the the Facebook's and the Google's of the world will screw this up  There have been lots of you talked about the benefits of live streaming some of these have involved cases of police brutality  Where and it's actually a shield to a certain extent  I mean there have been cases where people have been on the brink of being attacked in some way or  Violated in some way and somebody be like well. This is streaming live right now  You're you're like and you can't you know once it's in the cloud. You can't take it back  You can't delete the file or whatever and so live streaming  has a  vast positive  Upside however, I just hope Facebook can  distinguish between violence that involves  That's being streamed by a victim in order to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, yeah, I don't think it can and I think it's very hard and Facebook is primarily relying on the you know  Reporting of the people who see it to take stuff down and honestly, I think that's fine  Well, I think that's the that's the bitter with the batter  I mean, I think you just got that will that will be gained

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's say some somebody on one side of the political spectrum is live streaming something that people on the other side of this  Political spectrum don't like so this they they use their campaign methods the same thing  They do on Twitter to to like attack somebody  Twitter mobs and they get it taken down as offensive comment and content and it's live streamed  So once they've gotten it shut down  That moment is lost and so I  worry about the incompetence of the of the companies the the  Should be  Immature to the technology and also worry about the fact that every powerful thing whether it's live streaming or or  reporting  Objectionable live streaming will be gamed by the propagandists the liars the cheaters the everybody's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's unfortunate and I think what we definitely want to do is prevent the glorification  Of a mass murderer by resharing this video and I think that the efforts companies have made to prevent that are well  You know spent  Mm-hmm, but I don't think turning off live streaming is the solution. I really think that that's that we  That's a technology that needs to continue

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's you know, it's not the live streaming as much as it is the radical virality the real-time virality  Virality is a problem. I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can't prevent it so what are you gonna do to stop virality that's humans  See, I think a lot of times we want to legislate human, you know, I mean humanity  No, I guess that's what laws are right, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's society's effort to control the worst

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we have them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no we are okay. Yeah, they were just the power of amplification is is really  Does a lot of damage when it's when the wrong thing is being amplified and that's exactly what we're talking about here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know what the answer is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Live in a cave and  Not no, that's not the answer I guess I guess that's you know, New Zealand's decided they're gonna enact tough tougher gun laws

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, New Zealand is actually very proactively doing things that I think will make a difference  Like that's a start. Yeah  Or you could put those videos on myspace and probably they'd get lost forever  My space has lost all the music uploaded to it between  2003 and 2015 as a result of a server migration project  Face myspace says any photos videos and audio files you uploaded more than three years ago  May no longer be available on or from myspace  We apologize for the inconvenience and suggest you retain your backup copies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think lots of we actually have lots of people in Congress that know something about technology. Let's let's get somebody in the White House

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what worries me is that is the conversation everybody's having everybody I've had it myself  we're all having this conversation where it's like oh, but the problem is that the that his  Political opponents will attack him. It's the fact that a hacker, you know, if you look at his actual  history  It's all very innocuous  I think as far as we know  And it's actually much of it is very positive in terms of learning about technology learning how it works  But the word hacker has a negative connotation. And so the propagandist the political propagandist will try and destroy him

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Different kind of hacker. He also has a DUI. He has other things going on  Although we on the plus side if he got into the White House  He might replace the president Nixon's bowling alley with a skate park, which would be pretty so we voted Donald Trump in okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyone can be president

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He did say that  He joined the hacker group because it was you know  Like the Facebook of its day when dad bought an Apple 2e and a 300 bought modem and I started to get on the boards  It was the Facebook of its day. You just wanted to be part of a community

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so I don't think being a hacker has negative connotations now does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think being a skater is worse than being a hacker  punk rocker, yeah, I mean people don't like extremely California things and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Skating is one of them like, you know, well and he moves his hands a lot, right? What's that all about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So remember that show it was a movie back in like the early eighties called gleaming the cube  He's a combination of the computer hacker and Christian Slater skater character  That is that is what he is love it and if you didn't watch gleaming the cube  You were a massive Christian Slater fan back in the early eighties as a teenage girl, he's a strange fellow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got a there are a lot of people who  are very  Respectable people nowadays who had who did a lot in were skaters who have tattoos gonna be hard to elect  I mean it things who we gonna I have a friend who he is just the most I  mean if you you think he was  You know, he seems like a CEO I mean he's very seems like an ultra responsible person and  After a while you learn he was he was actually a pro skater Wow back in the day and it's like wow  That's that's and that's amazing. But I just I think it's a it should be a non-story. It won't be a non-story  It's gonna be weaponized and it's it's part of the it's part of the problem with our political conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's only a matter of time before we get a skater in the White House, I'm so I'm just saying that's right  That's right. Yeah, maybe Avril Lavigne. I don't know. We'll be the first lady our  Time for the play the trumpets.

You could set a date and time for your tasks and get notifications  you can create repeating tasks and  import reminders into tasks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  isn't this self evidently a  kind of  mitigation of the termination of inbox  Because one of the things that inbox had that Google the gmail doesn't have is this whole super integration with with  Reminders and so they're basically saying oh we're gonna kill the thing that  Where you have been doing most of your reminder stuff and we're gonna give you gmail instead  But gmail has a click a button and there's your tasks and there are all your reminders  Thanks to this new feature.

I guess I'll have to wait you you'll have to wait  Yeah, that's the whole point and yeah leaders of tomorrow  But but basically I  I've tried tasks ten times at least where I'm like I'm gonna use tasks. I'm gonna I'm gonna change everything  I'm gonna go use tasks. It makes sense. It's logical  And then I just I just don't like it like as Stacey was saying it's just something about it  I just don't like it. I've tried using keep I've tried using a  gazillion  apps and  Extensions and lots of things and now what I use is I simply use the snooze feature of gmail  So I try to do everything as late as possible and that's this is provided a structure around my workload  My workload and I basically just go through my inbox and I'm like, I don't have to do that till you know  April, you know and off it goes and this isn't due until Friday. I need like a couple hours  So let me put this at two hours before end of day Friday. And so I push everything  Off into the future and I'm kind of like juggling all these things in the air, but man out of sight out of mind  It's like so nice. So if anybody is inclined in that direction  It's great way to achieve the zero inbox you have all these tasks that have to be done  but they're off into the  nether world of of the snooze feature in gmail and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's really in for me. I do the same thing except I  Have what's called the BS hour and it's Fridays because it's my light day  So I schedule and I schedule the time on my calendar and I go through all of  Your schedule beer and scotch our beer and scotch.

It has an all-male folder  Which that's not a gender reference  I mean all the mail, you know the replies and all that kind of stuff  and so I like that feature if I don't trust that that my that my  Filters have properly put things in the right place. I can just go to all mail  It has you can go in and individually create rules much more easily  so I like  Gmail a lot  But there are I do know a lot of people who loved  Inbox and are very sad that it's going away and despite the fact that they've added some of those features in gmail

What an incredible company get an immediate unmatched view of all the networks and dependencies  Let me let me step back  Thousand I I have to explain that this is for people who live in the cloud  If you have a business that uses the cloud for storage  for delivery of content for apps if  Your stuff is in the cloud and nowadays I think most businesses have at least some stuff in the cloud  you need  thousand eyes because  There's a reason why we draw the cloud is just this puffy little cloud up there  It's a black box stuff goes in and you hope it comes out in a timely fashion  But it often doesn't and it's very you know hard to see what's going on there in that puffy little cloud  Unless you have thousand eyes with thousand eyes  You can get an immediate unmatched view of all the networks and dependencies that impact your users digital experience  Because it's awesome  They they have eyes everywhere. There's sounds thousand eyes unique path  visualization technology  Extends beyond any boundaries you can see understand and improve the experience for all your app services websites  Most people most ID departments can basically most sensors basically see what's on your network and as soon as it leaves your network  It's like well. I hope it gets there  But thousand eyes has a massive array of vantage points  Spanning both the public and the private internet cloud providers right down to the Wi-Fi in your local coffee shop  It can see everything. It's as if you've been looking through a smudged  Windshield it just covered with mud and trying to peer through and figure out what's going on and a squeegee just and it's crystal clear  You can see it all  Everybody who works in the cloud knows there are times where you just go I don't know what's going on  And the boss comes you say I know we're losing money boss. I I know  The people aren't working or whatever and we're trying to figure it out  But we just can't see into that puffy little cloud now you can I can't tell you how valuable this is regain  Control ensure the best possible digital experience for your employees for your customers for you  Make sure you're in the right cloud  That's another thing thousand eyes can tell you if the content you want to deliver should be in that cloud if  You're connected to the right SAS instance  You can see issues before they impact your customers and employees with thousand eyes and they've have they have great white papers and information  I've learned so much about wine. You know things don't work or do work  This is why top banks enterprises SAS companies the world's largest and fastest growing brands rely on thousand eyes software to do the  Cloud and do it right  thousand eyes comm slash twit get a demo get find out more and  For your boss you can get the exclusive ebook on five cloud migration challenges  You shouldn't ignore lots of information at a higher level  For for for people about that cloud migration  I know everybody's considering it we're all moving to the cloud if the cloud is important to you now or going to be important to  your future  thousand eyes comm slash twit  Do the cloud right thousand eyes comm  Slash twit. It's thousand spelled out th o u s a n d e y e s comm slash twit thousand eyes thrive  In a connected world. I'm really pleased to be partnering with them. They're just a really great  Company. All right, Stacey. Did you see anything that we didn't cover?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, I'm going mole

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mole mole mole at this point she says I don't care if there's something in there  How about you Mike anything important? Do you want to keep this woman from her mole?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I do not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey do you have a thing I have one more thing for you to do I do yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was typing them in but I type them in badly  So I am planning to drive myself my daughter and my dog up to Seattle  So I've been trusting and playing with road trip apps and since we are actually it is spring break now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So just the two of you are gonna drive together. That's so cute

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's the dog too. Well, of course  Okay, she's like another person. She has opinions and everything. She's gonna be sitting in the in this  She's gonna be sitting shotgun. No, she'll be in the back seat. Okay, the daughter gets shotgun  Roadtrippers is the first app  There's two and I'm still up in the up in the air on which one I like that there's features on each that I  like and the other is  For caught I don't know how to say it. If you are k ot  Got  Forgot. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Miss the turns on your terms. Oh, I like this idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what's neat there is you can actually tell it a lot of things like where you're a where you're going  But also like how much you want to drive? When do you want to start and it's it's a lot more detailed  so if you really want to like and then road trippers is really nice because  It shows you like parks and things like that  And I like both of them because you get like your total drive time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You get like estimates on you have to go to triple a and get a map with a magic marker on it for this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah in like this this road trippers like estimate your gas costs and that's what I think  So yeah, I was I was really excited. I think both of these are so far. I've experienced them  As the free app, they're both high quality  And I'm I mean, I haven't taken the road trip yet. So have you ever done a cross-country trip? No, I haven't  Fun yeah, I've driven to New Orleans a couple times and I've driven to Tallahassee

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I want to ask you why  Now this is gonna be what a great mother daughter thing mother daughter and dog thing to do I think this is great  Yeah, so things like the giant ball of yarn and stuff like that, right? We're actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Focused on I think we're gonna go see like the Grand Canyon. We're gonna take some detours. We're going to Marfa first  so Austin to Marfa and then possibly somewhere in the middle then maybe the Grand Canyon and then  We're gonna drive through like the Columbia River Gorge  I'm trying to convince myself that I want to go to the Escalante National Park in Utah  But that's also kind of like a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There really isn't a whole lot to do in Kansas except to go to Cocker City and see the world's largest ball of twine  I'm just skipping Kansas. We're skipping Kansas is not on the agenda. Oh, come on, you know, you want to see this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think Mike should do a gastro nomad adventure in Cocker City

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The twine experience there's lots to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That sounds awesome Stacy that sounds absolutely incredible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Especially that app sounds great since the world's largest twine ball is pungent with a smell of moist twine decay  That's the review from roadside America calm

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We went to  We were in Maine and we did a roadside attraction. It was the world's largest chocolate mousse and I will tell you it was pretty good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fun to see these it's kind of tradition  All right, we'll enjoy I think that sounds like a great idea  Mr. Michael Elgin your pick of the week

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As you know, I'm obsessed with GANs which are generative adversarial networks  Yes, I think this is the most promising technology for the future of fake everything we've ever come up with it's basically a  Machine learning technique that's been around for about four or five years  Which can generate fake data can generate fake words fake images fake videos think this fake that we're all familiar with deep fakes  Those are generated with GANs. Basically you throw a bunch of real data at this machine learning system  One of them and there are two machine learning systems one takes the real data and tries to  To imitate it with fake data lots and lots and lots of fake data throws it the other one which is the discriminator which judges that data based on how  Good it is compared with the real sample and then  the  The original one goes back to the drawing board tries again  Does it better this time and both the discriminator and the generator get better and better and better  Until you get fake data that looks completely real now  We've seen that this person does not exist  Before and then somebody came out with this cat does not exist  This is cats made with you know artificial cats made with this technology and now there's a website  And this is my my obsession of the week called this X does not exist  So somebody has started to curate all the goofy GAN related  websites that people are throwing out there  This rental does not exist is one of them. It's a fake Airbnb listings  This waifu does not exist. I'm not sure what a waifu is. I'm not really  This startup does not exist. So they're creating those the startup websites that we've all seen that are all very similar  Oh, I gotta go to that. Wait a minute. This is a GAN created. Here's here's one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's here's one  Premessent  Using AI in fashion and it's got a nice picture of a fox  Meet the team of pre mess it get to know the heads behind pre mess it or even better become a pre mess it  Massa and a lafore the cco  Shalene claps the CEO  Douglas Domena the CEO  Permessent is more than just blockchain  Funding calling and startup are just a few characteristics of pre mess and but we offer a lot more fear  fearless  euphorically irresistibly  Permessent is like Google but for fashion  This is this is this is auto generated this is brilliant this is brilliant. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I  Think that over time this this site will be populated by lots and lots and lots of examples of  some of them better than others of  GAN generated  fake data and images and videos and everything and I think that would be very healthy for us to pay attention and like see  What is being produced so that we can dial down our?  Well dial up our skepticism about the images and words and sites and everything that were presented because  The problem with this kind of thing is that you can you can when when you can create?  fake  Anything at scale yeah, then and let me give you another example that we don't talk about because I wrote about how this technology  Could be used to crack security  There there's a GAN that can actually crack fingerprint  Readers of the kind that you you have in your your smartphone  Here's how it works basically these fingerprint scanners don't scan the whole fingerprint  They scan little chunks of it and lots of little parts of it to see these patterns that are unique to each person  However, there are some snippets of these fingerprints that are more common than others and so somebody use GANs to create  thousands and thousands and thousands of  fake  Fingerprint snippets. Oh that are most likely to pass as real snippets  And then they're combined in all these different variations  And so it's essentially a brute force attack on fingerprint readers where they throw  Thousands of these snippets at until they get one to unlock the device and of course this can happen very quickly with  You know fast computers. It's a brute force attack just like a password attack, but you can do it with fingerprints now  Thanks to this technology so there's lots and lots of ways that this general method can be used to  Do things they're not supposed to be able to do they they they just have absolutely destroy captures  And so which is ironic because the whole point of a capture is to prove you're human  Turns out machines are better at proving they're human than people are of course they are  Wow  Anyway, this X does not exist. I love it. Check it out  This was our 500th episode if you've been listening continuously

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
