We know him better.  I have one question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to have one question.  We're going to get to in a few minutes.  But are you going to buy one?  Already did.  Too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You already did.  You guys already did.  He's the Leonard Taub Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Hello, Jeffrey.  Hello.  Also blogs at puzzlemachine.com.  He's at Jeff Jarvis on the Twitter.  Stacey Higginbotham is at Giga Stacey on the Twitter.  She's at Stacey on IOT.  She's our sailor suited IOT expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just thinking that.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's a black and white striped shirt.  It's not navy and the stripes aren't white enough and I don't have a boat neck.  Thank you.  Take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And she's landlocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You fashion fools.  Well, Carl Lagerfeld is no longer with us.  So somebody has to take his mantle and I think it's going to be Stacey Chanel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to call you Coco.  Kamala Harris jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which no, I didn't know anything about the Kamala Harris jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there was there was a kerfuffle because reporters were she was going to visit small businesses.  She went in this place and it had this amazing multicolored jacket and she tried it on.  The reporters were laughing and she's saying don't take pictures.  And then the right way went crazy about the reporters are cozying up and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  CNN, Tyler Durden, which clearly is a pseudonym, CNN reporter sparks ethics controversy after Kamala Harris fashion shoot.  It's been shared eight times on the Internet.  Thank you, YouTube.  YouTube always promotes the best content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I want to hear the review of the jacket.  I was just like the jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I haven't seen the jacket.  Is it like you guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it like Joseph's amazing color?  I think it's I want to see what I think.  Let me see if I can find an image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I will say having having read because when House of Cards was happening, I was all about Robin Wright's clothes.  They were gorgeous and fantastic.  And I was like, man, who who are they using in this show because I want these clothes.  And it turns out she made most of them because many they don't think about how to dress a president.  And I was like, oh, dang it.  She should have her own line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so the issue here is that Maeve Reston, who is a CNN reporter, tweeted, we kind of forced.  Oops, I closed it.  Dang it. How does this Internet work?  You use this Internet law.  I'm turning into my father.  How does this Internet thing work?  Take two. Oh, Kamala Harris jacket.  So, sorry, I think she related to Reston Senior.  I have no idea. The very famous was his name, James Reston.  So here's the tweet.  We kind of forced Kamala Harris to try on this awesome oversized rainbow sequined jacket.  She snapped it up.  She bought it. It's awesome.  What's wrong with that?  It's great. And then I mean, I wouldn't wear it.  But no, that's awesome.  Whatever. It's her style.  That's fine.  Then Neil Bortz, the conservative talk radio host, says quite the objective journalist you are Reston proud.  And then, oh, good Lord.  Yeah, I know.  I have to say, CNN is under a little bit of a fire these days because of something.  I was one berserk last night.  I bet you were.  Is that in our is this in our purview?  Is this in our portfolio?  No, I don't think this is about foldable phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't really want so here's here's what's well.  Yeah, let's just talk about Samsung.  Had a big event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We just concluded our coverage of it.  You can watch the whole thing on the Samsung stream or on our stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they by the way, I thought this was going to be super fast and we were going to be early today.  But there was so much stuff.  A lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, they really skimmed the surface because there was a lot of things they didn't talk.  Did you hear Bixby mentioned?  No, but now it's.  Did you hear their new Android interface?  The Samsung One interface barely mentioned.  They they whipped through it.  They didn't talk a lot about features on the watches.  They whipped through it.  But and what's interesting to me, quite the opposite of Apple.  Apple usually will build to the end and then the one more thing the reveal that was always the traditional way of doing it.  But they usually saved the most important piece for the end of the show.  Samsung started at the beginning with the most important piece easily.  The Galaxy Fold, which will be available April 26th.  It is yes, a folding phone, a front screen, little small four inch front screen that opens up to a seven inch screen.  And there's a handoff so that whatever you're looking at at the front screen,  if it's a map as they demonstrated, you'll open up and the map will be full screen on the seven inch screen.  I thought it looked great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was surprised.  I was going to make fun of it.  I was already too.  And then I got a little bit of lust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then of course, they announced the price one thousand nine hundred eighty dollars and people choked.  But I think Samsung secretly went, yeah, choke, because if you think about it, they already said it's a luxury device.  Oh, yeah. People will buy it.  It's such a distinctive phone.  They want everybody to know it's two thousand dollars because if you have that phone, it's a status item.  Right. If you open it up, everybody knows you spent two thousand dollars.  It costs a lot to make.  Yeah. And I don't think two thousand is actually that far out of the park, especially if it's a replacement for your computer.  And that's what phones are becoming rapidly.  Right.  I know a lot of people looking at it saying I want it and it's out of my reach because it's so expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do I mean, like in a normal house where you have a computer at your jobs,  people still mostly have computers unless they're in like a weird field, maybe design or something.  Every home still has a computer unless you're I know every millennials may not though.  Remember, this is if you still have to write something or do anything, you have to do it on a computer.  Yeah, I am asking. I'm thinking this through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you might be that might be a generational gulf.  I might be old, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My daughter spends a lot of time in her computer.  I mean, I'm willing for that to change, but she's a student.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But once you're not a student, you're not writing papers, you're not doing homework.  I think I mean, it's already the case that we all and I bet you're included in this,  spend much more time on the mobile version of our computers than on the desktop versions.  Maybe not because you're a writer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, but I do I do see her.  I'm just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Welcome to the new world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm just thinking about paying bills or like buying stuff.  I mean, yes, I buy stuff on my phone too, but like they demonstrated a three pane interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you have tiled windows and it looked pretty easily easy to swap the windows around.  The keyboard if you want.  I'm sure there's a keyboard available.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I was I saw I was clean.  I cleaned up my office doesn't look good and it looks better.  It looks completely different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does.  I was I was wondering I was laughing because I'm like, what did you find Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I found I found my I think it was the tree was trio owned by Palm.  Yeah.  Yes.  So I found my trio.  Well, they weren't owned by Palm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They did the Palm OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think it was I think it was my trio.  I can't even tell.  But the point is having the keyboard on it.  I thought how addicted we were and how how keyboards.  Yes, Palm become less and less and less important and also in a less text based world.  They pay Bill Stacey.  That's point and click.  It's writing stuff.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you might just depends what you write.  So I thought really interesting on this and this isn't the folding phone.  They show this on the s10 was it's essentially an Instagram dedicated Instagram device.  In fact, they had the CEO of Instagram longtime Facebook or Maseri come up on stage and they  showed how quick it was to share directly to Instagram without even opening the app.  And of course, Samsung took some heat has taken some heat in years past because you  can't uninstall the Facebook app.  Now you I'm sure will not be unable to uninstall the Instagram app.  And that's very interesting.  That's an interesting play.  So Samsung is looking at how people use phones.  Remember as a South Korean company, they may have a culturally culturally a different point  of view in Japan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody laughed when the family came out.  Right.  Everybody said all those weird Koreans only they will use it in the world.  Nobody's going to want a big phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the best analogy.  And in fact, I bought the first note fell in love with it have owned every note since  people laughed at me.  I put the note to my head.  Yeah, I think we did.  Yeah.  Say what's that?  You put that piece of lumber you're holding up, but I loved it.  And so I do think that's this is going to be I I poo pooed folding phones right up until  this demo.  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't see you were trying to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there you go.  I thought folding phones were awesome.  I was waiting for this and I'm like you guys were all like, I'm like, let's see.  But you were right.  I'm still stuck on this idea of computing.  That's what I'm thinking.  I'm thinking about like, oh, how do you book travel?  How do you bet again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe maybe you're right that the only reason I brought that up is because $2,000 is such  a that's the price of a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yes, I'm like, you know what we need?  We need another generation on this show.  We need we need a millennial.  Well, not even we need a young millennial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I bet you Henry this would be he'd be happy with this.  Although he did Henry watch was he around?  He did watch I think he is around.  He curious was review.  He does use a MacBook for video editing.  And of course he works in sales.  So he's doing a lot of stuff with spreadsheets and and presentations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want you a bunch of kids like in college and that sort of thing.  They use MacBooks or laptops.  This is their video consumption device.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think I think though it wasn't it the case that in Japan personal computer ownership  was much lower than in the West and they had as a result much smarter phones.  Earlier.  I don't know if it's in Korea, South Korea, Japan and Korea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Korea has a wonderful mobile infrastructure and carriers that are very innovative.  So unlike ours that are nickel and diamonds for everything.  Koreas have been South Korea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's another point because they spend a lot of time at the end of the show talking about 5G.  They're going to have two 5G ready phones available soon.  You can preorder the 5G Galaxy 10 in a month.  No, not even this was 5G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where is 5G really installed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it isn't really that's my first thing as well.  Who cares?  Nobody can get it.  And then I realized wait a minute.  That's a very that's a very parochial point of view because of course 5G is widespread in South Korea.  Is it I think so.  I don't know if it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, furthermore, I don't know if it's that widespread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean they are more widespread than here, which is it's not okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, we don't have any 5G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One estimate is by 2023 an entire 32% of the US population will have access to 5G in two years.  One third.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that doesn't surprise me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So as of December, South Korea launches 5G, but only for enterprise users initially.  But they're anticipating.  Furthermore,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pardon me?  Because didn't Qualcomm just launch their 5G mobile chip that's actually reasonable for the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I suspect that might be the chip they're waiting on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean that just happened this week.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Furthermore,  what Chinese giant makes 5G gear that is currently being spanked all around the world?  Oh, Huawei.  And I thought well gee, this almost sounds like Samsung might make 5G networking gear for carriers.  They do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so it's a competitive opportunity to grab us a market share.  Oh, so 5G mobile routers and 5G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see.  The SK South Korea Telecom provider offers 5G.  There's actually two service providers.  They both have spectrum.  I guess it's coming soon.  Sooner there than here.  I'm not clear outside of industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to figure out if it's mobile 5G or if it's just them using 5G like Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They plan to provide enterprise customers with 5G in Busan, Incheon, Daegu, Daejeon.  That's fixed.  Enterprise, Guangzhou and Osan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's fixed mobile or fixed, sorry, fixed wireless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you're right.  And in fact, we have fixed wireless, not the same standard, but we have fixed wireless in the US as well in enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Well, we have fixed wireless 5G.  That's what Verizon's offering people right now.  That's right.  But it's their 5G.  It's not the 3GPP standard that is used by cellular carriers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I love it when you guys geek out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not geek.  It's just accuracy.  That was like the nerdiest thing I think I've ever said.  Excuse me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not being geeky, I'm just being accurate.  Excuse me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to be pedantic for a moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Excuse me.  This is not pedantry.  This is accuracy.  So I think that this is very interesting.  Remember that the media competitors to Huawei.  You're all of yourself, Stacy.  Are Nokia and Ericsson.  But that sounds to me, it sounded to me like a kind of a play by Samsung.  You know, you like South Korea.  We're an ally.  Just saying.  So that's interesting.  They also announced three new Galaxy S10 phones.  We knew everything there was.  Well, I thought it was really interesting too.  This is from a point of view of technology journalism.  Is that everything about the S10 phone had been completely leaked accurately in detail,  including yesterday, a Norwegian television station that accidentally ran the ad for it a day early.  So we even had an ad for it.  But we knew nothing about the Galaxy fold.  It was a complete revelation.  We knew they were doing it.  That's all.  Because they had said so.  So my guess is that means Samsung has the ability to keep the lid on some things and the desire to leak other things.  Well, especially if they had so much stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, keep our this.  What is it?  It's not a red herring.  Is it a red herring?  Because no, they're real.  But it's like a really pipe releasing a valve.  That's it.  So they're releasing stuff to the media because the media is definitely looking.  Right.  And then you keep your good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And also they keep the eye of the reader on them for an entire two-week period leading up to the event.  I think at this point, they're going to have set a bar that's very high for every other carrier or phone manufacturer at Mobile World Congress this weekend.  This was a this was cleverly timed.  They did it in San Francisco, not Barcelona.  They did it a few days early.  I think Samsung has shown a mastery of of the media over the last two weeks.  That's quite impressive.  Yes, but not but not great taste in music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't have everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So one of the things that they didn't talk about much, you said that I'm very curious about is the one interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And all I know is what I read.  But Dieter Bohn in The Verge has been playing with it apparently and he wrote a very positive review about it yesterday.  The best thing ever.  He said it's the best Android interface yet better than Google's.  He really liked it.  So that's encouraging too.  Because if there was one negative the one reason I don't carry Samsung phone.  Yeah, I use the Google phone.  Well, there's two reasons one is the user interface.  It's pure purer on a Google phone.  Although Bohn points out really what is pure Android AOSP maybe is pure Android, but that doesn't have any of the Google stuff at all on it.  So really what's Google selling is their skin.  More pedantry out of you guys.  That's pretty pedantic.  I think of the Google version is pure Android.  Yes, it is.  But if but Samsung's has gotten closer and closer not to pure Android, but to equally good Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they still have oh my gosh, do they still stick a lot of bloatware on their device?  No.  Okay, because that's always been the issue with Samsung.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but there is going to be that issue which is you're going to have Samsung's gallery and Google Photos.  You're going to have Samsung's browser and Chrome.  There are there and Bohn acknowledged this that there are still double applications in many areas.  So if you call that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can still use my Google things.  I don't want to switch to Samsung's photo thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So and now we know Instagram will be on there.  Facebook has always been on there.  So if that's what you're talking about, I don't think that's changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't just get kind of frustrating.  It is you can remap the Bixby button now.  Woo.  Can you that's when there was just an article saying that the I think it's on the verge that you can remap.  That's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bixby because you could you see that may be an error again.  They had the same story when the s9 came out and then once the s9 came out, it was modified so that you could not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the verge.  You can remap the Bixby button on Samsung's Galaxy s10 to do whatever you want as of today.  It's a 12 minutes ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's if it's if it's according to Samsung.  Yeah, they were in the hands-on room.  I'm sure so if it's according to Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The verge the verge has confirmed that with the s10 the company is at its settings that allow you to customize the button beyond what's been allowed previously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm starting to really be bullish on all of this and so there's actually three I'm gonna make three things three reasons  I haven't used a Samsung phone.  That's one the skin and I guess you conclude the junk wear to Google Phi.  It's not a five phone.  I have to use it with a US carrier and three security patches.  One of the issues has always been that security patches, especially those monthly updates.  I don't mind that and that Samsung's been slow to put nine on its phones and they have because that's features.  But I think security is super important and they have also been a month or so behind on the security patches that probably stay the same even with trouble.  So those for some people may still be compelling reasons to stick with a pixel pixels as we talked about last week doing very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now it looks cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it does.  It does this the Samsung s10 is $750 the s10 is 899 at its base model.  The base model of the s10 plus is 999.  But the one I ended up getting with a ceramic back and 512 gigs of storage was a whopping $1,250.  How much did you spend today?  Just that because I couldn't get the fold yet.  I'll buy the fold.  We have to we review them.  It's not I'm not I wouldn't if I were not doing what I do if I were just a civilian so to speak.  I don't think I would buy either.  Well, if you were a civilian with a budget you don't but like gadgets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, this is not this is not a phone that probably will appeal to the mainstream until some super cool people have it.  So like Leo.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think I love the pixel and especially with the price cuts.  Now you can get pixels a lot less expensive.  They're cutting three or four hundred dollars off the pixel prices now at various, you know deals.  I think the pixels probably what I'd have and if I were really price sensitive, I'd probably have a moto g7 or g6 g7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got the other one with the folding one.  It's that's thick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, so the Royale.  The only other folding device currently on the market it was shown at CES is $1500 and it's janky as hell.  So the FlexPy I'll show you if you want to see it the FlexPy compare this at $1500 to to what Samsung's doing with a much more I think elegant UI.  And I think you know, this is it.  I think this is definitely Samsung's got to be and yeah, it's expensive to make this Samsung by the way is putting a lot of cameras in three cameras in the s10 the folding phone will have six cameras two in the front three in the middle one in the back.  It is hard if you got a holding phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to figure out which way someone's going to point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and by the way a lot of the pictures even on stage today at the Samsung event have people had their fingers right over that punch out for the camera because that's just the natural way to hold it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what would be interesting?  Okay, so you've got six cameras now, you know my beloved Jabra 65t elite headphones.  They have two mics on each side and I'll get to it.  They actually take a sample from each mic and they optimize they pick whichever one sounds better on phone calls to pick up your voice.  So it's like whichever of the four mics that you've got available.  It's like, oh this one, you know, it's a very quick AI thing.  But imagine that with your fingers in front of a camera on your right camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  It's a funny thing you should say that because Samsung also announced the Galaxy Buds.  I guess Google neglected to trademark buds and it does the same thing.  It figures out which microphone sounds better and uses that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's NXP's technology.  They announced it two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so they're probably using NXP's chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I would I don't know that for certain, but that's what I would guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other thing that's cool about these Galaxy Buds.  They have a very much like the AirPods.  They have, you know, little in ear buds that go in a case that charges them just like your Jabras.  But the case is a wireless charging case and can charge on the back of the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so I have mixed feelings about this.  I'm excited like woo, but then I'm also like that's good when I have access.  But what happens like when I'm I don't want to use my precious precious phone battery to charge my my device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At least it would be you my real fear is there going to be phone nudges that are going to borrow your phone's battery.  They're going to say, oh hi, do you mind if I put my watch on your phone?  You know, that was like my phone on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the most successful posts I ever wrote as a journalist from a pageview perspective was a giga open.  It was like, sorry, that's my my fi.  Yeah, get off my my fi.  It was because it was very early on and people kept like if the device was out people would be like, oh, can I connect?  And I guess yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you can't maybe.  May I borrow a little power?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so until I started earning.  Karma.  They use the Karma my fi and then if other people use yours you earn future uses still using that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, who's got a my fi nowadays.  They even change their name.  Come on.  I think that's happening soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, because I have my AT&T grandfather thing and I'm just stubborn.  I think it's going to hurt AT&T.  I think every day they wake up and say Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they're all excited.  Get off that grandfather.  Excited because you're the last one.  They've talked everybody out of it.  Incidentally, that PowerShare technology Samsung showed is not exclusive to them.  Somebody in the chat rooms pointing out that the mate the new mate phone mate 20 from Huawei does that and the rumor is Apple's new phones will have PowerShare technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess if you have one share what one charging pad you put your phone on that allows you to charge two things.  That's all right.  So that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can just also be on the train.  You could be sitting on the path and somebody could say oh my my my Galaxy Buds just died.  Can I just put them on the back of your phone for a little bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because I'm using it.  This is a quiet car Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't use it.  I'm reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could be consuming content on your nifty foldable phone.  Okay.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  Anyway, I think this was a very good day for Samsung.  I think they showed themselves well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they using Qi charging?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They didn't use the Qi word or the Qi word.  But their chargers are Qi chargers.  The Samsung chargers because I charge my iPhone on it.  They have those fast chargers.  So I'm going to presume this is all Qi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So then you could probably take your earbuds and put them on a Qi charger.  Like if you have it built into your nightstand and then just like plop those down and you'd be like.  Like that would that not work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have it built into your nightstand?  The stack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do not but my next nightstand will have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Doesn't IKEA have that?  Yeah, IKEA sells them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  IKEA offers them.  Actually a lot of hotels put them in and then there's some cars that have them.  It's not the fastest charging you're going to.  And actually the Qi folks, you really want to get crazy.  They actually built a standard for the Smart Kitchen that comes out this year and it will charge large appliances.  So there's more power being conducted.  So the idea is you'll have a blender one day that you just doesn't have a cord.  You just stick it in the charging spot on your counter and it goes.  I want a Cheechin.  Oh, Cheechin.  A Cheechin.  Yes, it's my Cheechin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  There's lots more to talk about.  Gosh, there's so much to talk about.  There is.  We'll do that in a second.  But I do want to show you my Bluetooth headphones and actually I prefer to all of the above.  These are the Aftershocks and I was I have to admit completely skeptical because they use bone conduction and I thought there's no way I'm going to hear audio from my cheek bone.  Especially through your thick skull.  Through my thick skull.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that boosts the resonance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does.  You know what?  That's so funny that you should say that because what you can do when you're wearing them is if you put your fingers in your ears to block the sound coming through your ear because it's right next to your ear.  It gets more it sounds the bass gets better.  So this is what they look like.  They these are the best sport headphones I've ever had.  But they're also Bluetooth talk headphones.  So I they're so comfortable.  I wear them around all day in the house and I could just talk.  It's great.  The microphones work really well.  You see how they they sit on the side of my head like that and the sound quality is great.  This is a headphone.  I would recommend for anybody who works out runs bicycles.  You don't want a headphone that blocks sound because you don't want to get run over by that truck coming up behind you want to be able to hear it.  It's wireless Bluetooth for one multi-point pairing which is really nice.  I have it paired to all my phones.  They rest just outside just outside your ear and they send many vibrations through your cheekbones to your inner ear bypassing your ear drum.  They even come with earplugs.  So if you wear them on the airplane and you want don't want to hear the baby crying behind you you put in the earplugs and you could still hear the music which is wild.  The wraparound.  So I actually am glad the one thing I don't like about these other brands with it just go in your ears.  I feel like it's easy to lose that individual earpiece and and it's not that secure.  This has this titanium very lightweight titanium band which means that they're attached and they're always sitting very comfortably on your head and they are really secure.  I'm shaking my head for those who've been listening really really hard.  If you like headbanger music, this is good for you.  Crystal clear phone calls music.  I listen to my audiobook all day wearing these around the house.  I could still talk to people I could still engage but I could still hear it's really fantastic.  They're IP 55 which means you can wear them in rain.  They repel sweat and dust six hours of continuous music and calls on a single charge 10 day standby time and they charge up fast about an hour and a half.  You'll get a two year warranty.  These are Aftershocks AFTERSHOKZ at the end not S.  They're safer for driving in any outdoor activity because you hear what's going on like emergency vehicles and traffic.  If you're running biking I wear these when I bike all the time.  We've got a great Aftershocks tech bundle.  You can find it on the website when you go to twig.aftershocks.com.  $50 off the tech bundle that includes the air Trix air a pop socket for your phone.  Large portable storage case a really nice silicone rubber storage case portable power bank and a traveler tumbler insulator.  The whole pack get $50 off when you go to twig.aftershocks.com and use the code twig at checkout.  I admit and I bet some of you are skeptical.  When I first heard about this I thought there's no way they could sound good.  They sound great and they're the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn.  And sorry to say by the way because we got somebody from the UK saying I tried your Aftershocks deal and it didn't work in the UK.  Yeah, it's US only.  I'm sorry twig.aftershocks.com use the offer code twig at checkout in the US to get $50 off.  But even if you don't that's the tech bundle.  But even if you don't get these they're fantastic.  They're variety of models Aftershocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Last I can not worry about things falling out of my damn ears because I have weird ears and nothing stays in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Lisa can't wear AirPods because her ear canal is small and so they're not comfortable at all.  In fact, anytime you wear anything stuck in your ear, whether it's wired or unwired after a while there's fatigue these.  These just fall out and they fall out which is I'm on my third pair of AirPods.  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you seen I presume the the AirPod beams?  No.  Romeo, Romeo, she's alive.  Don't oh damn he's wearing AirPods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's go Romeo, let's go to Know Your Meme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Know Your Meme.  That just died.  These are not good memes.  I'm not going to show them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you want to oh, did you okay?  I just lost the story.  Did you see that Disney has reportedly pulled their ads from YouTube?  That is even a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, we got to talk about this.  Wired, a wired story that is huge.  Apparently, I know this just broke today.  Apparently, and maybe it's wired UK because they spelled pedophiles with an AE.  So that might be a UK thing.  But it turns out that there are kind of quasi child porn videos on YouTube a lot of them.  That it was young people in scanty-clad outfits doing exercises or yoga that the pedophiles have jumped on these.  And in the comments, they'll even say go to you know, 13 minutes 3 seconds in.  It's a big problem.  And what's really I'm sure upsetting Disney and other companies is that these you know, really I don't know if the videos are intended to be sketch or not.  Yes, wired UK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not intended.  Most of them are just taking advantage of the fact that young people post things online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and little children sometimes have their butts exposed or they're in an underwear or you can anyway, I don't want to go any more on that.  But these so here's an example of major advertisers Shen Yun on one of these and then they show in the comments.  Hi, nice to meet you.  Kisses and hugs.  You're beautiful.  It was a video of a young girl playing in her underwear and another one.  Yeah, here's Lori Al's ad pre-roll ad with comments that are often little more than time stamps that direct people to sections where exposed genitalia could be seen.  Or a child does the splits or lifts up their top to show their nipples.  This is this is bad for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the videos aren't the problem.  It's the damn commenters, right?  If the bit because because what are you going to do not let children put up their ballet things?  It's the problem here is that there's sickos who ruin everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, on some videos confused children who are uploaded who have uploaded videos of themselves playing in the garden.  Respond to comments asking them how old they are on one video a young girl appears to ask another commenter why one of the videos had made him quote grow.  The video shows the child and her friend doing yoga is accompanied by pre-roll advertising from Lori Al.  The video has 2 million views.  One of our advertisers Grammarly.  We're absolutely horrified and have reached out to YouTube to rectify this immediately.  This is the problem of buying ads on YouTube, frankly.  A spoke us.  So Fortnite has paused all pre-roll advertising on YouTube Epic Games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this speaks to a couple things one as platforms get bigger and people use them.  So people use these platforms.  They become massive and scale.  They're hard to escape.  But then people can go down wormholes on their own.  This is not.  But it's the same sort of people that if you post pictures of your kid and like a bathing suit right Instagram, but tell me what you think of this one minute one video monetized monetization is turned on 410,000 views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A prepubescent girl performs a dance routine in a dingy flat flashing the camera halfway through in a definitely illegal distressingly exploitive bear crotch shot that's shared in the comments with a timestamp.  We've seen it accompanied by advertisements for fiat and Shen Yun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh that dance show.  Good Lord.  That's that's disturbing.  And I think anytime you see.  I mean, we'll tie this to something that I know is on the rundown.  I don't know if we'll get to it, but it's talking about like Facebook using location like police are looking at its own content to find people who want to harm its workers and employees.  And talking about if that's ethical.  I think the the issue here is we have the ability to police this, but companies are unwilling to do so and they're coming to a point where advertisers in the community will force them to because it's simply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  YouTube doesn't want this because they're going to lose money.  This is terrible.  I know that they are to mention illegal in some cases, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're no longer this cute dark corner of the Internet.  I don't mean dark in a negative way, but just when when you're a public Main Street of the Internet, you have to have Main Street values and mores and they haven't wanted to admit this because they think they're still on the normal Internet or the old Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know how to think about that, but well, and YouTube is even more complicit again, not intentionally.  I'm sure algorithmically complicit.  Wired says YouTube doesn't just recommend you watch more videos of children innocently playing.  It's algorithm specifically suggest videos that are seemingly popular with other pedophiles.  Right.  This video is monetized with the pre-roll advertising from Maybelline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now I don't always have to have the bad thing happen.  And then you figure then you catch up and YouTube's been fighting this for a long time, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What the precious I feel like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the case of children's pedophilia, you might want to err more on the side of oh, maybe we'll take down a few good apples and you can rectify that afterwards.  That's my that's my gut feeling.  However.  I don't know.  I don't write algorithms for content filtering, but I feel like.  I feel like.  That should be I mean, and I know people will go around it, but that's that's what I mean, look how great China is it's answering its population.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Videos about with children in them can't have comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and I mean, and there is a parenting thing should you like I don't I try very hard not to put up videos of my kid and I ask people not to tag her in anything.  And I do that because.  Not necessarily for this reason, but I want her to have the freedom to be able to put these up, but soon.  She's going to be doing this with her friends and not necessarily on YouTube, but I'm musically in other places and or sorry, tick tock and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We should point out that according to wired reports of pedophiles commenting on kids channels first appeared in 2017 and YouTube promised to fix the problem in the same year major advertisers pulled their ads after they appeared next to extremist content.  Including rape, apology, anti-Semitism and hate preachers.  This is an endemic problem and you know, the funny thing is YouTube is getting a lot of heat for takedowns that are inappropriate.  The verge for instance had a pretty pathetic attempt to show how to build a computer that involves such things as putting in the power supply backwards and all sorts of in some cases dangerous practices obviously whoever wrote the video and did the video didn't know what they were talking about.  Some of the commenters, you know, so people took it and showed it and commented on it.  Some of them responsibly a lot of them responsibly saying no don't do what is this guy talking about?  Don't do that.  Don't do that.  Some of them got racist.  The presenter was black and of course that's terrible.  The verge however responded with a takedown of all of them.  And.  You took it and showed it.  And.  YouTube took them down.  And I just feel like that's we're seeing more and more examples.  It's happening to us too.  Where companies don't like the commentary.  And they're taking it down.  Not for any legitimate reason but they're taking it down because they don't want that content up there.  And maybe the legitimate reason is it's verge content.  That is being shown in the commentary and so they're saying well look it's our content you can't do that.  But as and we were just talking about this Apple did this to us yesterday on our Macbreak Weekly show.  Not because they didn't like the commentary but because they had we showed an Apple ad and commented on it.  Jeff is the professor of journalism I will ask you.  That is called fair use commentary right?  And generally held to be a good defense in cases like this.  YouTube does not make it easy apparently.  We're trying to get the video restored and my people are saying there's nowhere to dispute this content ID.  I find that hard to believe.  There's got to be a way to dispute it but they don't make it easy let's put it that way.  The verge in this case manually submitted the takedowns.  Apple has done that against us when we streamed their product announcements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know there's an interesting business opportunity here.  I've been thinking about this in other contexts.  Vimeo.  Well welcome to Vimeo.  But but and there's a moral hazard here aplenty but imagine if there were an independent auditing structure.  That you paid to do this for you and that and that the platform is trusted.  I don't like it because it's redlining it's for the more privileged but at some level.  You know like when I need my passport renewed I go to the service that does all the stuff for me and expedites it.  Someone does that for ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not the FTC.  There is a middleman for advertising disputes for God what's it called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it the ad bureau?  In the US or UK?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the US.  I know because Sprint and Timo and all the carriers get cranky with each other and submit their like my networks better.  He says his networks better and then you get these like so and so whatever this bureau is has decided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll look at it.  Meanwhile and we talked about this also on Macbreak Weekly yesterday so maybe this had something to do with it.  YouTube has announced in their creator blog they're going to make the strike system clear and consistent.  And they show a nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what I was asking you about is this clearer or more consistent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not sure I don't know.  The point of this is most people who break the community guidelines aren't doing it on purpose.  So YouTube has a three strike system.  You get three chances and then you're banned.  Ninety four percent of those who receive a first strike according to YouTube never get a second one.  But they even thought that was too dramatic.  So starting February 25th all channels will receive a one time warning the first time they post content that crosses the line.  And that can be a variety of things but mostly it's over copyright.  With no penalties to their channel except for the removal of that content.  That's a takedown.  This is to make sure everyone takes the time to learn about our community guidelines.  And then can quickly get back to creating great content and engaging with the audience.  So I think consistency is fine.  That's a good goal.  First strike results in a one week freeze and the ability to upload any new content to YouTube.  Including live streaming and other channel activities.  Strikes will expire after 90 days.  The second strike in any 90 day period will result in a two week freeze.  The third strike will result in any if you get three strikes in a 90 day period in channel termination.  So you get you get to have a strike every three months.  You know I don't know if it's better or worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hank Green did this video I think we mentioned last week before last.  It really goes through the detail of it and it's excellent.  But it doesn't make any sense that the system is broken.  It is what it is.  Soon we'll have article 13 and it won't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We will not. That is in the Europe.  I know it's still bad.  It should affect you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean do you have European listeners to the IoT podcast?  I have tons. I have lots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Europeans they're really good at IoT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  I spent my holiday reading the Commons report on disinformation and fake news.  And the Karen Cross review of UK journalism.  And the article 11 and 13 stuff.  And your conclusion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I spent my holiday reading the three body trilogy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh you read all three in one holiday period?  Oh yeah.  You're a fast reader.  It's a good trilogy.  It's long. It's good.  I've only read the first one and a little bit of the second one before I got exhausted.  Before petering out.  You're like oh I'm done.  It's going to be a TV show I guess.  So you read it now.  How much time did you spend reading it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well it was a four day weekend.  So I usually read a book a day.  You read fast.  Do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No wonder you don't have time to watch pornography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just kidding you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not going on my tombstone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just didn't have time.  No you must read very fast because those are really long books.  It took me several months to get the first one done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know it took a while to get into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't watch any TV or something.  I mean you don't eat food.  You're not human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I exercise. I play with my dog and my child.  Wow I'm impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And she creates a great newsletter and website.  I didn't work this weekend.  A fine podcast.  Four whole days she didn't work and she read three books.  And she makes queso.  And makes queso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Queso is like really easy.  You dump a...  Like hold on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Negotiations continue in the European Parliament over Articles 11 and 13.  Is there...  Julia Rada who is a member of the EU Parliament.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It passed the first vote I think today.  And there's further votes.  And some countries are saying...  Whole countries are saying no.  This is going to harm innovation in the internet.  But the big countries...  Let's see where do I put that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Julia Rada's blog is the place if you want to read more about this.  She is great.  Julia Rada.eu.  The greens.  She calls it the pirate party.  The greens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She is pirate party.  That's official.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nevertheless...  You've heard us talk about it many times.  I don't want to spend a lot of time.  But Article 13 is the one that would require us.  And anybody that uses content.  And all of our shows are based on commentary on other people's content.  To get licenses.  And furthermore if you're twittering.  And you're not a youtuber.  And you're not a youtuber.  And furthermore if you're twitter or youtube or facebook.  You can't post anything that hasn't been licensed.  You can't post anything that hasn't been licensed.  So you have a huge burden to make sure that everything that you have on there.  So you have a huge burden to make sure that everything that you have on there.  If there is copyright material by anybody else.  If there is copyright material by anybody else.  In other words there is no fair use.  Well there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is.  I read the text.  There is an exception for criticism of fair use.  But as Larry Lesick famously said.  Fair use is the right to hire an attorney.  Yeah it's a defense.  And the platforms are going to say.  That's too nuanced for us.  If somebody else made it.  You can't put it up.  Period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because the liability is huge.  And then the article 11 is a link tax.  Oh I hate this.  Which is very similar to what Germany tried to do.  And Spain did.  And Spain did to their detriment.  Reproducing more than single words of very short extracts of news stories.  Will also require a license with no exception.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Including nonprofit blogs.  So the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Commons report

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  had this strange  factor in there.  That not only do they consider.  Because GDPR they consider.  There is a wide range of things they consider to be.  Personal data.  Like your IP address.  Yeah that's a really tough one.  That's a really tough one.  It's awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So now they're proposing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To go the next step.  Any inference about you.  You own.  So everything about machine learning.  That's about.  Finding patterns.  And making predictions.  Now suddenly they're trying to propose that.  You own that.  What the heck that means.  And how you do anything about that.  So Amazon comes along and they want to recommend.  These galoshes.  And they want to make sure.  You know these galoshes.  Because you bought those boots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't make inference.  Without having someone's underlying data.  And that's always been the issue with GDPR.  But even if you have permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For the underlying.  Now they're saying basically you need permission.  For the inference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is silly.  Because to get rid of that.  Threat.  All you do is take away permission to use.  The underlying data.  And what I'm trying to get to.  Is Amazon might have data.  On my favorite galoshes.  And.  I'm trying to think.  Someone else may have data.  On my foot fungus.  Powder purchases.  And if they put those two things together.  They might infer.  Like my insurance or something.  That I'm trying to give myself.  Foot fungus by wearing terrible galoshes.  What is this analogy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fungus fighting galoshes.  That would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was trying to turn this into something nefarious.  But I really shouldn't have started with galoshes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're saying aggregating data from two different sources.  Into an inference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But really all I have to do.  Is stop the data about my foot fungus.  Powder purchases.  Again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't make an inference if you don't have the original data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's on pages 16 and 17.  Inferred data is therefore.  Regarded by the ICO's personal data.  Page before it says.  Get this. Geeks. Watch out geeks.  If tech companies.  Including technical engineers.  Involved in creating the software for the companies.  Are found to have failed to meet their obligations.  Under such code.  Dot dot dot.  Through independent regulation of the ability to launch legal proceedings.  Against them.  With the prospect of large fines.  Being administered.  As the penalty for non-compliance with the code.  So you do something for Facebook or Google.  Now.  They're putting the employee in the case of having to know every implication.  And basically have their own attorney.  What's weird is they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they become liable.  Well that's because they can't go after the tech firms.  So they're going to go after their employees.  You always in a legal fight.  Go after the weak link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And hope it keeps.  They can go over the tech firms. They're going after them both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But.  This is a much bigger stick.  From a strategy perspective.  This isn't going to make it into the end law.  But this is a really good way to start your negotiation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well don't forget there are.  People in the European Parliament.  Like the German member of EP.  Sven Schulze.  Or as I call him.  Sagen Schulze.  I know nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He.  I don't know anything.  He thinks Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because he's getting so many protests.  Over article 11 and 13.  He thinks it's all coming from Google.  Because they all seem to come from people with Gmail addresses.  So I did a slightly better translation of his tweet.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He said now every second.  I'm getting messages about articles 11 and 13.  And they all come from Gmail.  And never mind that the information in them is wrong.  Google do you really need to take this action?  Idiot.  I know you're angry.  Yeah I know you're angry.  I know you're angry.  I know you're angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know you're angry Google.  But really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's a member of the European Parliament.  I think right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes MEP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If we could just get all the old white guys out.  We'd be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I couldn't agree more Stacey.  I could not agree more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And worse he's been retweeted 212 times.  I'll put my Camelah hat in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sagen Schulze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know nothing.  I know all the jokes back are in German or Swedish.  Or whatever.  So yeah.  It's pretty hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Man Google I know you're angry.  But you have this fake  really necessary action.  Plus the English.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hashtag odd things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hashtag fake. Hashtag Google.  And he did the hashtag right.  He separated the hashtag from the text by a space.  So it doesn't even work.  Hashtag filter hashtag article 13.  Actually does work. Look.  Hashtag Gmail. Hashtag Google.  Hashtag fake.  Plus he put the space in.  But it might still work because it looks like they're blue.  Which means they are links.  Oh that's true they might.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are the people.  These are the people.  These are the people.  And when you see me go crazy about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is why.  Bad people on both sides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  To coin a phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks.  No seriously I think it's coming from both ends.  It's coming from the ignorant regulators.  But honest to God they're getting ammunition.  From things like YouTube.  You know recommending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More like this.  Listen to how you just phrased that.  YouTube.  Because you explained it earlier before you went into devil's advocate mode.  Well I don't blame them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I sort of do blame them.

Transcript:  Welcome to our future folks.  Things are. Tools are going to be out there.  People are going to misuse them.  And then you've got to catch up to the misuse.  And every time we have this horrible shock that has occurred.  Yes.  Bad people will do bad things.  That's not surprising. The issue is not.  Well the issue is that in some level.  But the issue is. What do we expect the platform to do?  And how quickly do we expect them to do it?  And I'm fine for all those three things.  It's the fake shock that somebody did something bad in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know that almost all the people who these days espouse the flat earth theory.  Learned about it on YouTube.  I don't blame YouTube for that by the way.  But it just shows you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well it's the thing we discussed last week about the anti-vaxxers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well did you see Pinterest is just no longer serving up the search results?  I didn't know how you felt about that Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm fine with it.  I've been thinking about it.  So Zuckerberg said in his interview with Jonathan Zittrain at Birkman Center.  A couple of interesting things.  Because he couldn't deal with it.  And there is a point at which.  If your Facebook say you know what.  Not only are we not going to promote news.  News is for voting.  No news.  Forget it. No news.  It's a mess.  This is for people with their cats.  No news.  That would be a bad thing for society.  But if your Facebook.  And I own no stock in Facebook but I did gather money from Facebook for my university.  I have no.  I'm independent of Facebook.  I receive no money personally from Facebook.  If your Facebook.  And if a new share responds to one of your shareholders.  At some point you'd say F it.  Just F that news.  That's in essence what Larry and Sergey did early on.  And then all these damn journalists came after them.  They were all difficult and they kind of said F them.  And they pulled back any effort until it became a matter of PR and lobbying and brand.  That's when they started making friends to the news business again.  And now they're making it and they're doing a very good job.  And it's working for them.  And it's valuable and it should be I think.  But if I were at some point Google doesn't make any money off Google news.  At some point just say oh to heck with it.  Go on from Europe.  Go on.  So who's Shane Dawson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  He's a YouTuber.  Kevin Roos writing about it in the New York Times.  Last month YouTube star Shane Dawson uploaded his new project.  A nearly two hour documentary called conspiracy theories with Shane Dawson.  In the video set to a spooky instrumental soundtrack.  Dawson unspooted a series of far-fetched hypotheses.  Among others.  Did he do the Chuck E. Cheese one?  Yes.  So I'll get to that.  I'll get to that.  I'll get to that.  I'll get to that.  So I'll get to that.  iPhone secretly record their owners every utterance.  Popular children's TV shows contain subliminal messages urging children to commit suicide.  The recent string of deadly wildfires in California was set by the military.  Using a high powered laser called directed energy weapon.  None of it's true.  Maybe he's a comedian?  I don't know the video has received more than 30 million views.  The follow ups drawn more than 20 million views and started a public feud with Chuck E. Cheese's.  The restaurant chain which was forced to deny claims it recycles customers uneaten pizza slices into brand new pizzas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a good one.  Dig into this one.  Look up the photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  It's a comedy right? This guy's a comedian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but I'm telling you Leo look at that pizza.  Looks pretty good.  No it doesn't.  No because that's not, if you try to put those together you wouldn't end up with one round pizza.  Those slices clearly came from other pizzas.  Notice that prep priority slice has a slice on it and it doesn't go over to the next slice?  I'm telling you Leo there's a conspiracy at Chuck E. Cheese.  This is me playacting folks.  I'm not really saying this about Chuck E. Cheese but this is the game.  That's not an actual pizza.  It's recycled slices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean this is from Shane Dawson's Twitter.  Memories of Chuck E. Cheese pizzas.  One of them is half cheese, half pepperoni.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not believing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. No one believes it except maybe, I don't know.  Does Shane?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well actually you do look at some of the pictures and you don't know how they would make the pie.  You're like oh that could be two different pies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It could also be somebody who took two different pies, ordered them, put them together and made the picture to make a conspiracy.  Which is more likely the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've seen lots of tweets from like this, I work at Chuck E. Cheese.  I can tell you we literally do not recycle our pizza slices.  Like that's whack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Instead we're in the back with a child sex ramp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've seen kitchen guys make fresh pizza all the time.  A new order comes in and we see the game room guys throwing out leftover pizza on the table.  So, proof positive.  Dawson joined YouTube in 2005, became one of its bigger stars several years later when he began posting his comedy sketches on the site.  After rising to fame, he faced backlash for his use of blackface and racial stereotypes and skits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, somebody who is not an awesome person does well on YouTube.  What a shock.  I'm shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm telling you, I'm moving our entire network to Vimeo.  This is just, I mean honestly, by the way Dawson's real name is Shane Lee Yaw.  I don't believe that for a minute.  He has 20 million followers on YouTube.  And this is what scares me.  A devoted teenage fan base.  Clearly he makes content that's going to, he knows how to make content that's going to do well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, as long as we are in a mass based, volume based, click based ad structure,  the motives for everybody are perverse.  Including CNN, including the media, the media that's going to be watching.  Including CNN, including the maker of the video, including YouTube, including Facebook, all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But does YouTube stock recommending Dawson's videos even though it will cost them a lot of money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At some point they're going to, it depends on the pressure.  It's countervailing pressures.  And some people are going to say, obviously he's joking.  It's a joke, I get it.  Because what you end up with then, is that at some point they start banning onion and I would scream bloody murder.  But if somebody out there believes the onion, as it happens all the time,  you know Chinese newspaper reports onion story, right?  Well, we've got to get rid of that.  Yeah, no you make a good point.  So what do we expect?  We don't really have the discussion about what we truly expect them to do and follow through.  Do we expect them to get rid of political ads?  Do we expect them to get rid of all anti-vax stuff?  Do we expect them to not accept videos of children?  Where do we want the line to be?  We kind of have to say so as a society.  Whether it's the law or not, they're going to enforce the norms of society.  And society doesn't know what the head she wants.  So we're going through a process of negotiating this now.  And they get blamed for it all.  And sometimes they should be blamed for it all.  But a lot of times we as a society should be blamed for not making up our mind about what matters and not agreeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, I think they wait too long.  Yes, I agree.  I think they have the tools.  They just don't want to deploy it because it is expensive.  It does put some liability in their hands.  And I think there are some things that we can all universally agree on as being a problem.  So conspiracy theory, dude, not really.  Things like child pedophilia, yes.  Anti-vaxxers?  I was like, anti-vaxxers?  Oh, so iffy.  How do you...  Well, so this is where I think the tech companies, I don't think there should be a ban on anti-vaccination, vaccination content.  I do think figuring out how to tweak your algorithms so they don't continually feed into paranoia...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They should not promote that, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ...is probably the way to go there.  Like, I think having a...  We need to be having technically informed discussions that we're not really having today.  Oh, I was like, and Jeff has left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've finally done it, Stacey. Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was like, man, that technically informed discussions, that was too much for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pedantry.  So here's a whole shit...  This is a post I haven't written yet.  Don't worry, that's not my writing.  This is what I'm writing about.  So there's a brilliant professor named Phil Napoli, who's now down at Duke, who wrote a paper that scares me.  And it says, the headline is, what if more speech is no longer the solution?  First Amendment theory meets fake news in the filter bubble.  You have...  The First Amendment is under attack because people don't know what to do with this stuff.  So the idea that less speech is better than more speech is antithetical to my soul as an American.  Antithetical to my beliefs in the First Amendment.  But there's talk about that going on.  Then you saw Justice Thomas saying that maybe the First Amendment is being overutilized yesterday.  And you have these European reports saying, let's...  Platform should just get rid of a lot of speech.  And I read the comments thing, again and again and again and again and again on the margin, I wrote China, Iran, China, Iran, and China, Iran.  Put those tools in the hands of China and Iran, which they're doing on their own, and then the UK starts to look like China or Iran.  We've got to recognize that speech is speech, and the problem is more that people believe stupid things.  That's education is what we need.  I don't mean media education, I mean education education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would not disagree with you.  I spend a lot of time teaching my daughter about this.  I think we probably need to change the curriculum a little bit to give people more media literacy or just internet literacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They went through that.  No, because the problem I have with that is, to some extent sure, but that's not the solution.  That's media-centric, I think, and acts as if you just had the user manual for our stuff, you'd be fine.  No, you've got to have the ability to think generally.  Nothing to do with the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Critical thinking is important, but I think when you're teaching critical thinking, using examples from today's media is really relevant.  Some people are never going to think critically.  Some people surf the internet the same way people used to come home and sit down and turn on Law and Order and just sit there.  It's to let your brain rest.  The problem is, when they do that, it's no longer a lean back.  They're asking you to engage and to forward and to make a statement about things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's also true that your idiot Uncle Joe and your friend Joey on the playground have always done this.  It's not anything to do with the internet in the end.  There are other opportunities, but there are also more opportunities to look up stuff and say, Joe, you're full of it.  You're wrong.  We never talk about the good.  We never ever talk about the good that comes.  That upsets me.  I know, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought you were talking about something real.  No, I wish it were.  I think I need it.  I can show you something almost as exciting.  It's my Aura Ring.  Can we talk about that?  Yes, this excites me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have such good sponsors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, we do, don't we?  Aura, actually the way we found out about this was kind of interesting.  Kevin Rose told me about it.  Kevin was on triangulation.  He was wearing a ring just like this.  I said, what's that? That's cool.  He said, oh, that's my Aura. Let me tell you about it.  He told me all about it.  He said, I'll get you one because he's an advisor for the company.  They're a Finnish company.  He wrote to the founder of Aura.  They sent me a ring and I've been wearing it for six months.  It is the best fitness activity and sleep tracker I have ever used.  It's a Finnish company.  Number one, I think privacy is very important nowadays  when we wear something that records our every move.  The Aura Ring is governed by GDPR.  They're a Finnish company.  They have very strong privacy policies.  If you're worried about that, read all about it on the Aura site.  Aura, O-U-R-A-R-I-N-G dot com, O-U-R-A-Ring dot com.  But let me tell you what it does because it's really cool.  Inside the Aura Ring are a whole host of sensors.  Infrared optical pulse measurement.  If it's on your finger, it turns out that's a really good place to do that.  Better than the wrist.  Sometimes people with Apple watches say,  well, I have a tattoo or I have a very hairy wrist.  It's not very accurate.  This is much more accurate because  I don't remember the physiological details.  You can read about it on the site.  But because of where the ring is measuring,  there's a much more clear and much more accurate  measurement of the blood flow there.  But that's not all that's in there.  It's also got a 3D accelerometer, a gyroscope,  and a body temperature sensor.  And because of it, it knows all the activity, of course.  It measures steps.  But also my heart rate.  I can measure heart rate variability,  which is a really important indicator, it turns out.  The higher your heart rate variability, the better.  Because that means your heart is responding better.  This is the app.  And the Aura Ring, by the way, can store quite a bit of data.  I think six weeks of data in the Ring.  But every day I open up the app and it copies it over using Bluetooth LE.  It's very quick and easy.  I can see, let me go to yesterday because I got a good readiness.  So you get a readiness score, which is based on all of this.  Although it noted I had an elevated body temperature.  Oh, that's kind of interesting.  And here it is. It was up a little bit.  Often that's a sign that you might be getting sick or something's going on.  Got a great sleep score.  It measures everything, including your awake time,  your rapid eye movement, dream time, two hours, light sleep, four and a half hours,  56 minutes of deep sleep. That's great.  And you can drill down on any of these facts and get more information about it.  You can record activities.  And if you look at the readiness report,  it'll give you a lot more information about what that score comes from.  Body temperature, resting heart rate, recovery indexed.  And here's the heart rate variability.  The higher, the better, which is interesting.  That usually means that your system is more robust.  You can get information.  Here's a really useful one.  You saw what a great score and an hour of deep sleep.  And I thought, what did I do yesterday that I didn't do the night before?  And I realized I took a little tiny melatonin pill that apparently made a big difference.  I could see definitely how exercise affects and improves my sleep.  My heart rate, resting heart rate is a good indicator of overall health, things like that.  I just, I love this thing.  This is fantastic.  This is the Aura Ring. It's made out of titanium.  So it's super lightweight. They have a variety of colors and shapes.  There's the silver, there's black.  There's stealth, which is what I'm wearing, which is a matte black.  The other black is kind of piano black, shiny.  There's even a diamond version, which would be a great gift for a special person in your life.  $2.99 for silver or black, $3.99 for stealth, diamond $9.99.  But I want you to order it right now because these things sell off the shelves so fast.  At this point, they can't promise to get it to you any sooner than May.  But you might say, well, I'll wait till May. No, because then it'll be August.  Just order it. You will be really glad.  It's a great gift for mom, for Mother's Day, for a graduate coming up in June.  You'll get it by then for sure.  Activity insights, daily feedback that helps you better understand your body, improve your health, reach your goals.  It is fascinating to see.  This is the best way to measure all this stuff.  You can charge it up in just a matter of hours, and it holds its charge all week.  What I usually do is I take it off, charge it.  The charging thing is just a little circle base. I put it on my dresser.  It's a USB charger. The ring goes right on it.  It charges up very fast.  But also you could do what I do, which is just charge it for a few minutes a day so it's always ready.  I just really love this thing.  This is the OURA Aura Ring.  I think you're going to love it, but don't delay because they sell out so fast.  They're making them as fast as they can.  It's hard to make because it's a very precise device.  OURA RING.COM  If you use the offer code TWIT at checkout, you'll get $50 off your purchase.  Order it today to get it by May.  OURA RING.COM  And the offer code is TWIT.  I just love this thing.  I've worn every fitness device known to man, and this is the one.  This really is the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I'm going to Helsinki at the end of March.  Maybe I'll pop in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're not in Helsinki. They're in...  Oh, I can't remember the other...  Another part?  No, no, no, no. It's a well-known town in Finland.  Espoo?  Espoo. Thank you.  Nokia?  Yeah, if you go to visit Nokia, you can see them.  I bet you there's some people who used to work at Nokia over there, but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's pretty much any tech company in Finland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Really cool.  So Google says, no, we made it.  I told you there was a microphone in there, but it wasn't supposed to be a secret.  So, okay.  We're talking about the Nest Secure, which is what they're...  We talked about this already.  We talked about this already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we talked about it.  So we talked about the news that it was opt-in only because they were going to enable a microphone that had been in the secure.  So it was announced?  No.  No.  So, okay.  So yes, when they announced this functionality, they said, by the way, it's opt-in.  You have to opt into this service because we're not going to turn on the microphone unless you've opted in.  Oh.  Now, at that point, though, a lot of people were like, wait, what?  There's a microphone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it wasn't in the original specs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And so Kevin and I talked about this actually last week with regard to smart televisions.  This isn't a Nest problem.  This is a connected device problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot of TVs have microphones in them, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  And so I'm actually doing...  So we talked about it on our show this morning.  And this Friday in the newsletter, I'm going to focus on this.  I'm putting together...  And this is not just blatant self-promotion, but I'm putting together a list of disclosures for connected devices, like what you need to tell people.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A microphone's a big one.  Camera, too.  Not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, microphone, camera, but also speakers and a ton of the devices you have in your house that are smart devices, they have additional sensors.  They have humidity, temperature.  Like a lot of the Hue Motion Detector also detects temperature.  Does that matter for most people?  Probably not.  Why does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because I have one in my office, a Hue Motion sensor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because one day they might want to add functionality.  That's why they do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's cheap because it's all part of a system on a chip probably, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  But yes, it's relatively cheap.  And if you use that data, you can kind of gain some new insights.  I mean, basically the money is in the data.  If the money's in the data, you put as many sensors that are relatively cheap as you can, because who knows what algorithms you can derive that will tell you something new and exciting about someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you think it's credible when Google says, this is what a Google representative told Business Insider, the company made an error.  The on-device microphone was never intended to be a secret and should have been listed in the tech specs.  That was an error on our part.  You find that credible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I find it incredible that they wouldn't realize that this is a problem.  I find like secret sensors in your IoT devices have been historically kept secret for competitive reasons.  So I believe that Google did keep it a secret and did it because they wanted to have to be able to announce a new feature that was competitively exciting, right?  That could be a competitive advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you say on the box microphone inside, people are going to say, well, how can I use that?  Yes and no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have to say on the box microphone inside.  But you can say, I mean, I looked at the Nest Guard press materials.  There's nothing in the press materials.  So at a bare minimum, when you send out those review units, every review unit you ever get comes with a little booklet that gives you all the tech specs and everything you need as a reviewer.  That's not in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's that is that's got to be that should be.  And if it's in there, you put it, you say a microphone has been included is not enabled for for possible future use or something like that to to kind of transparency and control.  Yeah.  As a principal, I think they could have done that and without any harm.  I was trying to think of why they might not have you think it's just tone deafness like they don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like I said, competitiveness.  You don't want to say like if there's a microphone in there and yes, your competitors are going to do tear downs of your products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they're going to know they're going to know more than anybody else does.  They're going to say, oh, there's a microphone in here in five seconds.  They're going to look at it, say, look at the microphone.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe a little longer than five seconds.  But yes, I mean, they could see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not hard to see a microphone, I would think.  Yeah.  Unless you've never looked at chips before or something, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. And they do.  But I don't think I'll put it this way.  I don't think you go as nefarious in not disclosing this.  But I do think it was dumb that they didn't disclose it.  I'm not clear that it's not nefarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, you know, we get all the time.  I know we get Google pass after pass after pass because we feel good about Google.  We like Google.  But at some point you got to start saying, as people have now done with Facebook, nobody gives Facebook a pass anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's such a widespread industry practice, which is why like Google, if it was nefarious, Google is not alone in having these nefarious aims.  And TV, as you pointed out, many, many TVs have microphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  TV's have it.  And by the way, they're on and used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're on and used.  Your doorbell, your ring doorbell, the old ones used to have a temperature sensor in them.  Again, it's not used.  You may not know it as a user.  That's not exposed to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not that I care if they know what temperature it is outside.  I do care if there's a microphone in something that I don't know about.  I care about that.  What we call that in the business is a bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  But there are also...  If the Russians had done it, we would have said...  But some of these other sensors are equally problematic.  You just don't know how they're being used today.  So a humidity sensor or a decibel sensor, which are in things.  I grant you all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My question now is, why do we give Google a pass?  What is it about Google that we give them a pass?  If the Russians had done this, if Facebook had done this, no pass.  If the TV manufacturers do it, no pass.  If my car had a microphone in it...  Oh, wait a minute, it does.  By the way, as you know, because we both own Teslas, you can shout at your car,  there's a bug, would you report this back to the factory?  Which I think is pretty funny.  I don't know, Jeff, I think we do give Google a pass.  Should we keep giving Google a pass?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  If you say so, I'll do it.  Yeah.  That's a...  Yeah.  Yeah, we should give them a pass because they're nice guys.  I'm now ruled.  That's it.  Because they're nice.  They're nice guys.  Yeah.  All guys, but they're nice.  Nice.  They're nice people.  Google would never do anything to spy on us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They now say that they have a microphone in their Nescah.  They changed their specs.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because they get caught.  Yes.  Yes, we put a microphone in your great seal that we put in the embassy.  Yes, we do that now.  That's for your protection.  It detects a fire alarm going off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are lots of mics in many of your things in your home.  I know.  Why does the TV have a mic?  Oh, that's my favorite.  So it can hear some signals that are sent to track conversation...  No, to track what you're watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're viewing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's like, why does it chicken cross the road?  So it can hear.  Yeah.  In fact, they can tell advertisers if you're...  They can tell people, oh, they're watching Channel 4 or they can do all sorts of things.  They have recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interestingly, you can't actually buy a television anymore that doesn't have...  It doesn't have some kind of tracking on it.  Wow.  I would love to find someone...  Not everyone owns these yet, but if you guys know of a television, I am very curious to  find a television that doesn't have a microphone in it.  We've got one down on the beach right here.  It's big.  Yeah, the microphone goes in before the name goes on.  Yes.  So this is where we're heading, which is why we need to talk about what needs to be in  these disclosures and have these discussions because very soon you're not going to be able  to buy new washers and refrigerators without connectivity.  Microphones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've got to get to the point.  So go back to your point about competitive advantage, Stacey.  I think that the risk of pissing off your own users and inviting regulation is worse  than the risk of your competitor finding out that you have a microphone.  And I mean, I wrote this about Facebook, that Facebook's culture of opacity is killing  it.  And they don't really have a competitor.  So they should...  I mean, everything that...  The rule ought to be at Facebook, whatever you're doing, if there were a camera on you  and we showed the world you were doing it, you'd proudly stand up and say, yes, I did  that because it's a good thing to do, it's the right thing to do.  Everything they do should bear scrutiny of transparency.  Same for Google.  Same for any of the companies.  So more transparency is good.  The risk is greater on the other end, that you're going to get caught like this.  Oh, we've got a couple people at the microphone and they're going to be freaked out.  It would have been far better to just have a little fine print on every device and all  the geeks come out and look at the specs and say, wow, look at all the sensors.  Isn't that cool?  And they'd be far better.  That's all I'm saying.  So no pass, Leo.  I took back the pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Retroactively taking away the pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I am deciding who gets the pass.  Because Leo gave me that power.  You're in charge.

Transcript:  Google did backtrack on something.  It only proposed a modification to Chrome that would have blocked ad blockers.  Now, here's another one where I think Google gets a pass from some people.  They didn't implement it.  They asked for comment.  They said this would improve performance by eliminating the capability.  In fact, they even had a ghostry, which would be one of the things blocked, carried out  a study that found that ad blockers actually pretty much speed up the browser.  They have a sub millisecond impact on network requests.  But because they block all those big heavy ads and flash and all that stuff, they actually  speed up the browser.  So in effect, this modification to Chrome would have slowed things down, not it's intended  to speed up and Google back down.  Some people, paranoid people, people who do not give Google a pass said, well, really  the reason they wanted to do this is to break ad blockers.  But after all, they gave us a chance to comment and now they're backing down.  Anything to be said about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they have the right to block ad blockers.  Oh, that's a very good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like that.  Tell me about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think that that that well, I'll put it differently on a media company.  The New York Times says you can't come to our site.  That's fine.  If you don't pay, well, the same for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I use and I have started using now in all my systems, the Brave browser, which is a  chromium based browser.  So it's basically identical to Chrome that has a lot of nice features, including a built  in ad blocker, tracking blockers, thief.  Yeah, I'm on TV net site.  18 ads and trackers were blocked.  It does HTTPS everywhere, which we all agree is a good thing.  It blocks fingerprinting methods and it makes it incredibly easy to switch off because this  is they call it shields.  You could turn the shields up or down.  So if I go to a site that says, you know, like I'll go to I'm more.  Here's a good example.  I'm more does this now.  Our friend Renee Richie's site puts a little sweet big eyed kitten on there and says, Oh,  it looks like you're using an ad blocker.  We use ads to keep our content free.  Please support us by whitelisting us.  By the way, if you press continue with ad blocker, it does let you go on.  But you know what I'm going to do?  Because I like I'm more.  I'm going to shields down on this site and I'm going to get all those big fat ads.  And by the way, the page is still loading because there's a lot of ads on that.  But I want Renee to have a let make a living.  So I think this is a good choice.  It also brave has something really interesting.  I was going to make this my pick, but I'll do it a little bit earlier.  Brave has something really interesting.  And I know you are aware of this because we've talked about this before.  The ability to send money to brave payments to sites that you visit.  So you can establish they use a cryptocurrency or currency or something called the bat.  You can put money funds into the account.  I even got a grant from just random grant for bats.  And then as you visit sites, if you fund it, those sites will get some money.  I don't know if they let's see, I guess show only included sites.  So I don't I don't know if you have to do something to participate.  But see, here's the Washington Post, Instagram and Gadget.  I kind of like this model. How about this model, Jeff?  Instead of reading the ads, I just I just send them some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We just spent the whole like other third of the show complaining about people  not thinking about the stuff they're forwarding on Facebook.  And you expect people to like look for sites they like and know not everybody, just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's this is the micro payments will save us beam.  If only people could give a dime over there, be a lot of times it'll be OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have no I. Another reason why this is kind of maybe not going to fly is it requires Bitcoin, Ethereum,  Litecoin or its own Bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you heard of Tony Hales Scroll?  You know, Tony Hales was the founder of Chartbeat.  Yes. And so he started a new company called Scrolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We used Charpy for a long time as an analytic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did they just buy Nuzzled or is that another one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Scrolls is new company Scrolls, but Nuzzle Scroll.  But Jonathan Abrams Nuzzle. Yes. Yes. Yes. Keep it alive.  It's good news. Good. Great news.  And I have five million subscribers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get email every week about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Scroll will give you an ad free experience.  You'll you'll give money to Scroll and Scroll will divvy that up across the sites.  And Tony's not saying he's going to save all the journalism.  He's just going to say for some portion of people who are irritated by ads and ad blockers don't work very well,  you can go to the New York Times or one of their publishers who they have here.  They have a bunch of publishers signed up.  BuzzFeed, Box, Atlantic, SB Nation.  And you will get a guaranteed full ad free experience and they will get a share of the money you give.  And if the ads just really bother you, but you feel guilty about ad blockers or you don't think they're good enough or they're ugly or they're slow.  This is an alternative for those people.  A set size of the market that he's going after. Nice. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wish him luck.  Anyway, I'm using Brave now. So now if Google made that change, it would probably happened in.  Starving journalists have always used ad blockers.  Shame on you. You should find a better way to make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can't block my ads. Are we going to go to our sponsor now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, that's a better way. Right.  No, actually, I unblock. I unblock the ad blockers on sites that I regularly use because I know I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to pay for those sites. Kevin would like you to add about Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, for instance, perfect example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was there just today. I see the ads because I'm a nice guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  His ads are like AI generated. There's fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Barely has any ads, so I'm not too upset about that.  Wait, wait for it. I hate this because about Chromebooks is going to show.  Oh, you know why I don't see any ads? I have currently been blocking them.  Thirty seven ads and trackers blocked. Wow.  One fingerprinting method blocked. Does he know about all this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is one network. You know what I hate? Have you seen these green box ads?  No. What? I don't know if you can see this or not.  I see these. This is all the only ads I see.  You see this? No, you can't see it because of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does he know that Xfinity has an ad on his site?  It's not bad. I love you, Kevin. Of course, I'm not going to block ads on your site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're actually relevant to your interests, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not going to allow you to send me notifications. Sorry.  That's OK. I know. I really bothers me that every site I go to now says,  let me send you notifications. This is bad. You can turn that off in Chrome.  Can you? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, sometimes I want them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well then. I've been looking. You should not turn those off.  Are you sure there's a way to turn that off? I'm pretty sure. Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there is. I think there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because there's a way to turn it off after the fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Allow or block notifications from all site on Chrome.  Oh, good. You say Chrome turn off notifications.  If you Google that, you will get the support Google snippet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't want to turn off. I don't want to turn off notifications.  That's the wrong thing. I want to turn off the request to show.  Oh, right. Right. That's a different word.  Because I like notifications because my Google calendar, for instance,  does notifications. I don't want that to turn off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want the New York Times to be notified. Some notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just don't want to be asked every single time I go to a site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which you would never, ever want a notification from. Oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google is going to do a big announcement on March 19th.  We're going to stream it. If they stream it, we will cover it.  The Game Developers Conference. What? Google Game Developers Conference?  The theory is it could be the long telegraphed game streaming gaming service from Google.  And that would be very interesting.  Project Stream, a subscription game streaming service.  Microsoft is working on one. Not out yet.  Sony has one. There are a number of companies that also do this.  But Google is a big player. If you get my drift.  It would be very interesting. So we will cover that March 19th.  1 PM Eastern. What day of the week is that? Is that one of our?  I think it's a... What do we decide?  Is that... Anyway. Oh, it's two days after St. Patrick's Day. That's what it is.  Can you just Google March 19th? Yeah, you can. It's a Tuesday.  It's Tuesday. So we'll be juggling shows on that.  That's right. We'll move iOS today. I think something like that.  Let's see. I think it'd be good to do the Google change log.  Whoa. That was a little too fast.  That was a little too fast.  I always wanted to be leo.dev. And Google's got it.  .dev, the new top level domain.  As you know, what Google does with these top level domains is they roll them out slowly.  So you can register it. But at great cost in the first days.  Let's just see if I can get leo.dev and how much it would cost me.  Oh, look at all of these different registrars. Can I use Google for this?  There we go. Click Google domains.  Of course, hover would be the one I would choose.  Well, it's only $3,500 plus $360 a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is down from $11,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's gone down. It goes down every day. It'll continue to go down every day until it gets to the bottom price.  I didn't mean to add that to my cart. Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jane, stop this crazy thing.  Stop this thing, Jane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jane told me to click it again and it went away.  It does go down and I think at the end of the month it'll only be $360 a year.  But I think that's the final price. So it's expensive for leo.dev.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a three letter domain.  Is that why?  Those are pretty expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or is Google just... I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not against you. You are not the center of the universe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I'm just going to give them the benefit of the doubt that they're not price gouging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Null was the same price.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  N-U-L-L.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I'm not blaming me. I'm not saying me.  And I wasn't going to say that, Karsten.  Dope.  I'm not saying it's because of leo.dev. I'm saying it's all .dev.  And that the issue is that Google's price gouging.  But I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt.  How much did they pay for .dev?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a 10 letter domain and it was 3,500 bucks.  And $12 a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's because somebody else had it or something, right?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know how this stuff works.  So companies purchased these TLDs, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can get it at GoDaddy and GoDaddy is also charging that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The same...  It's probably something associated with the legal structure.  You know, who knows the answer to all of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who?  Your husband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  GoDaddy is only charging $479.99 every year for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $479 every year?  Yeah.  So Google's higher upfront or possibly lower if it's not interesting.  Andrew says we don't know how much Google paid for .dev.  Or does...  The other applicant he thinks was Amazon, but he would have to check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Google does own .dev.  Okay.  Yeah, I guess it is in the changelog.  Interestingly, GoDaddy to make as a little value add throws in an SSL certificate.  So actually that price is not so bad because you get an SSL certificate with it.  Anyway, pre-registration at the normal price, which is probably 360 bucks,  opens at the end of the month, February 28th.  Developers are going to want this.  .dev, right?  I think that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think companies trying to attract developers will want that.  But that may just be me.  Like I would put my developer blog on that site.  If you go to Twilio.dev, I would imagine that you would find cool tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, do you still give Google the benefit of the doubt on Google AMP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What now?  Are you going to give them the AMP rant?  I miss that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could, but I won't.  I'll avoid the AMP rant this week.  Using AMP to make display ads safer, faster, and better for users.  Isn't that what you're doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what's coming.  Because the problem with AMP publishers complain about is the ads don't come up fast enough  because the advertisers aren't AMP and they're slow.  So trying to force the advertisers to give you a better experience.  And it's not just speed.  I was at one page today and the stuff comes down from the top, it comes up from the bottom, it comes in.  There was not one line of text on the page.  It was all invading ads.  And AMP doesn't allow that crap.  So yes, good for AMP.  Okay.  Not the answer you wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I knew what you would say.  Smart. I'm not going to do these stories.  Fighting disinformation across our products.  Smart regulation for combating illegal content.  How about interpreter mode with Google Assistant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't we talk about that?  Did we talk about that?  Is that the one where you talk about that with the Google Assistant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now you can do it with like if there's a Google Home.  Oh yeah, we did. We showed it checking in to the hotel.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. I was like, I vaguely remember this.  That was like a demo of it. Is it actually working now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Caesars Palace Las Vegas has it.  Dream Downtown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go over to Dream Downtown in New York City.  Or the Hyatt Regency at the same place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Lindsay Lohan likes that hotel. I've stayed there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dream Downtown?  Yeah.  So 26 languages. You can even do it now.  Oh, on your Google Home device and your smart display.  Oh, okay.  So I can now do this on my Google little, that Google screen.  What's it called? The Google Home Hub?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got it right here. So what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Say, hey Google, help me speak Spanish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey Google, help me speak Spanish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I'll be your interpreter.  When you hear this, it means I'm listening. Let's get started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So now you have to say something in Spanish, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where is the train station?  Oh, the other way around.  The other way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Como te amo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Esta es la estacion de trenes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  And now you have to say something in Spanish to continue the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Buenos dias.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's cool.  Here, let me see. Oh, well, I guess I can't hear me.  You tell me what to say. I'll say it.  Yo veo con mi ojito.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Me dice que decir el ESA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that is. What was that again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the phrase would be, hey, you know who, be my language interpreter or help me speak language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See if it knows German. Don't you speak German, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it knows German. You can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Help me speak German.  It's still trying to figure it out.  Because you said because I didn't stop it.  Okay, Google, help me speak German.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't want that.  Say German interpreter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stop.  Be my German interpreter.  Stop.  Be my German interpreter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I'll be your interpreter.  When you hear this sound, it means I'm listening.  Let's get started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where is the train station?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ¿Dónde está el bando?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Das ist falsch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Give it a longer sentence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Say something about Leichschule Südschweck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Talk about your existential sentence.  Leider mein Deutsch ist sehr schlecht.  Seit Schule gibt es zu viele Jahre und habe ich zu viel vergessen.  Almost.  That's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Assistant, you can say, be my Italian interpreter.  Help me speak Spanish.  Interpreter from Polish to Dutch.  You can even just say simply Chinese interpreter or turn on interpreter mode.  I can't do it on my phone. I can only do it on the assistant.  It looks like it's just Google Home speakers.  Some speakers with Google Assistant built in and all smart displays.  Maybe you can do it with Lenovo or JBL.  Maybe it's just a rollout.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is really cool.  See, that gets them some extra points.  They can sin in the future and use that pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.  It's like three Hail Marys. It's awesome.  ARCore 1.7 with new augmented faces API for the front facing camera that can overlay effects on a user's face, even if your camera doesn't have a depth sensor.  Pretty, pretty cool.  You want to see it in action?  Oh, look at this.  She's turning herself into a bronze person.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty cool.  That's a little creepy.  Yeah.  Well, creepy is as creepy does.  So dinosaurs, chess.  You saw the Childish Gambino ads they've been doing, right?  They're actually pretty cool.  You get Childish Gambino and you have dancing with you and stuff.  It's really cool.  Oh, Google has some pretty good stuff.  I got to admit in there.  Somebody give them a pass.  And Google Facebook have to do to get a pass from you.  Facebook's never getting a password.  Never getting a pass.  You're not supposed to play.  I'm using the Brave browser.  Knock it off.  Maybe I know I'm supposed to stop all auto.  Just use Google.  Everything will be OK.  Google.  No, Google is back on Apple Watch with the app Keep, which is nice.  You can now take notes or read a shopping list.  Even more importantly, on your Apple Watch, if you use Google Keep, Google Keep is a very nice app, given that it's free.  I use Google Keep.  Yeah.  So one of the things I love is a shopping list because you can set it up that when I go to the store, pop up my shopping list.  And now it'll pop up in your Apple Watch, which you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're boring, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in that case, that's...  I slept.  I slept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Google Change Log.  All done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh, you guys.  Someone in my house is cooking bacon.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Bacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bacon.  I love bacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're like that cartoon right now.  Your nose just follows it and pulls you across the room.  Bacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you see This Person Does Not Exist?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think?  This person does not exist dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my God, the world's falling apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the show.  What is this doing?  I mean, so what?  Is this?  I don't understand.  It looks just like a guy.  I know.  Yeah, it's making up people.  It's not a real person.  It's making up people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not a real person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's making up people.  But it looks just like a guy I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, people's face features are actually...  I mean, there's lots of people who look like a guy you know.  I don't know this guy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I guess his name is Dieter.  He looks like the guy in the Travago commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that haircut, definitely his name is Dieter.  Oh, what the hell's going on with that comb over?  Dude.  Whoa.  Oh, this is fun.  We can make fun of him.  Because it's embarrassing.  We can make fun of him because he doesn't exist.  Doesn't exist.  Okay.  Let's do another one.  So, what is going on?  Why am I getting this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How long before this technology gets used for porn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this technology has been around a while.  There's a woman named Janelle Shane.  I'm trying to think of the name of her blog.  She does all these hilarious things with these GAN networks.  She's a research scientist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's wrong with this up here though?  There's some error there.  Something going on with the hairline.  By the way, that kid needs braces.  Oh, there's a multinational, multicultural child of all races and creeds and colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, she's over at AI Weirdness.  So there's a blog post called GAN Cats where it's GAN networks creating cats.  That's hilarious.  But she does a lot.  So what we usually see in the media is good results of this.  And this is good.  But this type of network is usually or can be horrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  GAN stands for generational, I'm sorry, adversarial networks.  So they're working one against the other to come up with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Till you get to something that looks right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's impressive is, at least on This Person Does Not Exist, is they're not doing any editing.  They're just throwing it up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  But you're only seeing the good ones.  Or people are easy to do because we have so many images of them.  But start thinking about GANs for other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yesterday, Steve Gibson was very upset.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That scares me.  He was scared.  He was very scared over AI.org's technology that they would not release.  AI.org.  What is it?  It's the Elon Musk funded...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this just Elon doing his...  Well, that's what I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  This is...  So I wrote about this a lot.  It was created in 2015.  It's Elon and others.  They created this...  Basically, the idea was to be able to open up more AI research to everyone.  So it was both getting datasets.  It was also understanding problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they were very careful about saying safe AI, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they used the word safe at the time.  They were looking at the ethics of what they were creating and how it could be used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they said they made a text generator.  Okay, this is like...  Too dangerous to release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's...  Okay, both the headline and...  That is like cherry picking the most scintillating bit from what would be a horrifyingly dull  story otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they don't want anybody to know how they do it, right?  They haven't released...  They released some of the dataset.  They've been reluctant to release more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sometimes they don't know how it's done.  Depending on the type of AI they are...  Depending on the neural network that you're programming, and maybe it's not even a neural  network, you don't always know how the computer comes up with what it comes up with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is a possibility.  Yeah.  I saw this story.  I was like...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Today, malicious actors, some of which are political in nature...  This is from the article...  Have already begun to target a shared online commons using things like robotic tools, fake  accounts and dedicated teams to troll individuals with hateful commentary or smears that make  them afraid to speak or difficult to be heard or believed.  Their concern is that research into the generation of synthetic images, videos, audio and text  may further combine to unlock new as yet unanticipated capabilities for these actors.  So due to concerns about large language models being used to generate deceptive, biased or  abusive language at scale, we're only releasing a much smaller version of GPT-2 along with  sampling code.  If you're not releasing the dataset training code or GPT-2 model weights, they're afraid  it'll be misused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not that afraid.  Should I give you a sample?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, the data they use comes from Reddit outbound Reddit links.  So if a Reddit link had karma of three or greater, it was presumed, well, this must  be a good site, which means the machine does particularly well.  I'm not kidding.  This is from the article.  This is from their paper.  It does particularly well on issues that involve Lord of the Rings, Brexit or Hillary...  No, who is the singer that...  One of these pop singers.  Because of the Reddit connection, I think.  Here's an example.  I'll read you just a little bit.  Steve read this yesterday.  So the human wrote this prompt, which is a bizarre prompt, I might add.  In a shocking finding, scientists...  Do you want to take that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't realize that was on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a little passive aggressive.  A little microaggression on my part.  Stacey, would you like to take that call?  In a shocking finding...  By the way, if it's human written, it's an ungrammatical human.  In the shocking finding, scientists discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously  unexplored valley in the Andes Mountains.  Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorn spoke perfect English.  Then the machine, after 10 tries, I might add, wrote this.  The scientist named the population after the distinctive horn of its unicorn.  These four horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science.  Now after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally  solved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  Which is to say that the entire text of human life is just a cliche that you can copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  That reads like my early papers.  Journalism school, like my drop into journalism school was astonishing.  I was like, oh yeah, 500 words, no problem.  Cliche after cliche.  I was like, oh, every word has to be a meaningful fact or means something.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yikes.  That's hard.  Although we should point out that the Washington Post has had a robot writing its sports stories  for several years now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AP and Reuters have been doing financial stories, weather stories, sports stories.  It saves effort.  Text is just a form of data visualization.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's all.  Good.  See?  There's nothing to fear here.  I give it a pass.  Move along, humans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I give it a pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff gives it a pass.  Oh, this is a new feature.  This is a new feature on the show.  Pass or no pass?  Jeff gives it a pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to say we shouldn't implement this for a variety of reasons.  It's going to happen anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't give you a pass for that.  No pass for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No soup for you.  Cliche, trite, unoriginal.  No pass for you, Higginbotham.  All right.  There's a couple more quick stories and then we'll get our picks because I know I could  feel Stacey craving the queso.  The bacon.  The bacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is the bacon going to be on or in, Stacey?  Do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this a surprise?  My guess, the bacon is allocated for a kale and sweet potato and egg dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it needs bacon, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's not good at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But with bacon, maybe.  Maybe.  Breaking Google News from Axios, this just in from our chat room.  Thank you. Thank you.  Hell's Kitchen NYC.  Oh, no, I don't have the link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they're in the chat room.  Twitter's top policy executive is reorganizing the company's worldwide  influence operation according to an internal email obtained by Axios.  I have no idea what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're going to lobby better in other places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google exec reorganizes policy shop as global threats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a scoop from Axios right there.  Yeah, it sure is.  That is inside baseball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a scoop. It's just in.  Long rumored shakeup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I heard Stacey was whispering that rumor to me just the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is it? Tell me about it, because I like Axios or I thought I liked Axios.  And now everything is written in this new  like TLDR executive smart brevity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They call it. They've always done that.  That has always been their thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So like this story is two sentences.  But if I want to go deeper, I get another 206 words.  It's like that's go deeper.  Yeah, it's smart.  Smart brevity.  That's the we do the opposite part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do we don't be sure.  Prolixity, we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We are the headquarters of dumb prolixity.  And pedantry and pedantry.  OK, so that's just it's just Axios's thing.  I like Mike, the Mike Mike's briefing in the morning is a newsletter  written in that fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The tech one. Well, it's what's it says.  It's our friend. Oh, you know, freed is great.  You're free. And media one is also very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'll click the link because I want to read more.  And it's the same as you know, everything you need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's it. Oh, is that it's over.  You're not going to waste your time with background paragraphs.  Like there's more and quotes and all this junk.  It's just going to tell you what you need, which I kind of like.  Really? You know more than I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like I need to know more.  Uber is going to cap the sues.  Oh, I'm sorry. New York City has capped the number of ride hail cars  and pause the issuances of licenses for 12 months.  Uber sues saying, hey, there should be as many Uber on the street  as the market will bear.  Well, you live in New York, Jeff.  I've heard people in New York say the traffic is terrible because of Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I also the day, you know, I watched the tourists come in town  and try to hail a taxi.  And I think all the schlub, you can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you got to know. You got to know what to do.  You got to have the the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And plus, I mean, it's still the case to this day.  If you're African-American trying to hail a cab on the street.  Yep. There you go.  Racism lives in all kinds of ways.  And so you call the Uber and you can get a ride.  I think it's the market at work.  Until until they're all put out of work by self-driving Ubers,  which will kill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is always what Mike Elgin has said, that international travel  has become so much better in Mexico City,  knowing that you can get Uber is infinitely better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't get one in Barcelona, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Especially is it illegal there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe they shut it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We used car services, I think, in Barcelona.  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, car service.  It's like the days back in the day when I had a phobia.  A phobia of phone booths in foreign countries.  Oh, my God, am I ever going to figure this out?  The language with this or that.  Not right now. You just take your phone and call.  Yeah, you don't have to go to the phone booth.  Life is easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have to talk to an operator or nothing.  Oh, they're all unemployed.  But you cannot copyright the Carlton dance.  The start one of the stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Flossing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, can't one of the stars of the Fresh Prince Alfonso  Rivera was suing Fortnight saying that that dance I created  on Fresh Prince in 1991, that's mine.  The copyright office says that is not a choreographed routine.  It's just some moves, which, by the way, you got from  Springsteen and others.  And so you really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something George Costanza would do.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So actually, Fortnight is being sued also by some kid who  flossed.  That wasn't just me being random.  So I wonder if that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, there's the multiple suits against Fortnight because  those dance moves all come from somewhere, right?  You want to see the Carlton?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, everything comes from somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, here's...  This is Alfonso Ribeiro and the kind of, I think, the  canonical demonstration of the...  Carlton.  You need, by the way, you need a candle to really make this work.  That's it, the Carlton dance.  Now, am I going to get a YouTube takedown by Carlton or Fresh  Prince?  By the way, NBC owns this, not Carlton, but he used it when  he performed in Dance with the Stars.  Dancing with the Stars.  So that's the dance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say maybe he created...  Maybe the script just said dance and he created it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sure that's the case.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So.  There's also the rapper 2 Milli, who does some sort of  move that's in Fortnight.  But I think this really is the copyright office saying...  Enough.  You can't really...  This is...  You can't copyright a dance...  You can copyright a choreographic routine, a ballet,  but you can't really...  You can't copyright that.  A move.  A move.  You can't copyright a move.  Are we...  Do you have anything that I missed before we wrap this up?  I think we did everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to torture Stacey and keep her away from the bacon as  long as we can.  Well, I want to start...  Let's start arguing about something now just to torture Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why don't you argue about something like Chromebooks or  weird journalism standards I don't care about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  Okay, now that was...  Elon Musk meets PewDiePie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now that's a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, God.  I don't care about that story.  I even saw that headline multiple times and ignored it.  This is in PewDiePie's battle with the T-Series Bombay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's two moguls considering things very quickly.  Yes.  Zuckerberg is considering putting the Facebook login on the blockchain.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What does that even mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You told that to Jonathan Zittrain.  I don't know.  What does that even mean?  And then Jack Dorsey is considering a clarification feature,  not an editing feature, but a clarification feature.  We don't know what that means either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe he'll clarify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How about this?  Paul Vixie, internet pioneer.  Blast Google for how Chromecast behaves on his home network.  This is another Twitter, I'm sure another Twitter outburst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google, this is bogus as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, it was on the IETF mailing list.  Vixie, who is an internet Hall of Fame engineer, he created DNS.  Was upset about how Google uses DNS in its Chromecast Ultra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No way, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No way.  Gotta get that data, data, data, data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hunger is doing things to her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can tell.  I love this.  This is the part of the show we look forward to all week long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now I'm hungry and I have to go to the bathroom.  So at some point in time, I'm just going to be like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did we talk about Amazon pulling out of New York City last week?  No, this is news.  No, we didn't.  Oh, that's right.  That is news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They pulled out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it happened Wednesday.  Did it happen Wednesday or did it happen Thursday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It did happen on Thursday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It happened on Valentine's Day, Thursday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, what do you think?  Is that childish?  They're taking their ball as Mayor Blasio said, going home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or?  I think the fascinating thing in this  is that the amazing AOC proved to be more popular than a mogul  and a mayor and a governor.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I would say-  Oh, sorry, go on, Jeff.  I didn't really-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was done.  I was just corking myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm going to bring it over to Google.  Because if I look at this, I'm like, eh, this is probably  a good sign for, I guess, transparency.  So being able to say, hey, this is how this deal went down.  This is what we gave up.  I think that's always important because we live  in a democracy, theoretically.  They should have included the stakeholders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I completely agree.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think this is going to be interesting  because if this becomes a big deal,  Google has sidewalk labs in Toronto.  And I've done an interview with someone on the show about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, this is very controversial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hugely controversial because Google  hasn't been 100% clear, in many people's opinions,  about how it's handling the data, privacy around it,  and then also how it plans to make money.  And it's starting to look more and more  like a government giveaway.  So I would say the next thing we should look at post-Amazon  picking up its toys and going home  is what the heck happens with sidewalk labs?  Because that doesn't look as certain anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, even the negotiation.  That's my second day lead.  Or end of the week lead.  There's even unrest in Northern Virginia now, in Arlington.  And some Arlington city councilor members  said, we don't vote for that.  Because that's Amazon HQ2 part 2 is in Northern Virginia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been so pissed about corporate giveaways  on tax revenue breaks and stuff for this for decades.  I do think that, and I like AOC,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her tweets  implied that by not having Google there,  they would somehow magically get $3 billion  to give to more needy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but I think what she was, now she didn't really say that.  I don't think.  I think what she was saying is, we  shouldn't have to give them a $3 billion break.  We should still get the jobs.  They should be open with the community.  And they weren't.  So now a conservative front group  has put up a billboard on Times Square complaining about AOC.  And it's just a company that tries to fight for companies.  And the more she does, the more she pisses off the right,  the bigger they make her.  I'm just amazed by her social status.  Yeah, she does.  I'm looking at subsequent tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She does understand that half a billion was capital grants.  2 and 1 half billion was tax breaks.  Yeah, she clearly understands that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Google quietly went, I put this in somewhere  that I'm going to run up, Google quietly went and used  more normally made up companies to negotiate and get  tax deals across the country.  So I mean, the idiocy here is that if local governments got  together and had a meeting and said,  let's all just stop this, they'd all have more money.  But instead, there's a competition for that.  And they fight each other down.  It's just like the double Dutch sandwich with an Irish twist.  If all the countries would agree to stop that stuff,  they'd all have more money from these platforms.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Amazon pays on its $11.2 billion in revenue  in 2018.  How much tax?  Oh, nothing.  That's legal, by the way.  But yeah, yeah, it is.  Talk about tax grants.  And I saw a graph, another thing that I, by the way,  AOC tweets a lot.  I'm still going through.  I know.  Wow, does she tweet.  So I also saw a graph that shows job growth in New York City  is through the roof.  There isn't a lack of jobs in New York City.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, and Amazon's still going to be here.  Google's getting jobs like crazy.  They're buying up property like mad.  Yeah.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Anything else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Unless we have virtual bacon.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I wish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey has her pick of the week.  Just in time.  For those of you moving out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I was going to do my house listing,  but it's now under contract.  Oh, congratulations.  That was super fast.  It was.  It's been it took.  We're not even actually on the market.  So it took three days of.  So you got asking.  Did you get over asking?  There was a little bidding war.  It was very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But wow, it all fall through.  So we'll see.  It's a good.  Well, not a good one for you, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.  So instead of my home listing, which was going to be it,  I'm going to do my checklist.  And I may have done this before.  So I'm sorry if I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, you have it.  But hold on just a moment.  Oh, sorry.  I forgot the last day.  We forgot advertising.  You can skip this if you want.  But I wouldn't if I were you.  That was one heck of a tease.  And I have something I have a couple of things I want to talk about for a change.  Before I do that, I want to talk about Dio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  This is a checklist for when you leave your smart home.  It's an oldie goody.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you leave, leaving a smart home.  Make sure you do these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So this is a list of how you handle things when you're about to move.  This is clever.  So this is prior to occupancy or closing.  I don't know any of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And are you doing all this for the new owners?  Some of this.  Most of mine instead is a little bit longer.  But yeah, I won't submit changes of ownership and contact information  to device manufacturers.  I'm just going to deauthorize my access.  Let them figure it out.  Which does include.  So you have to erase everything in your own account.  And you're best off doing it also, delinking everything from Nest  and your Amazon Echo accounts as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This has gotten much more complicated than it used to be moving.  Used to have to turn off the power, the gas, the water, and say, see ya.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And some of this, I will not.  I have to bring.  Well, I actually have my own modal.  And I have my own router.  So I don't have to worry about that.  But it's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  You can get a copy of this at OTA.  Actually, OT Alliance.  Yeah.  There's only one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the Online Trust Alliance.  And they did it with the National Association of Realtors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OTAlliance.org slash smart home.  What a good tip.  So congratulations.  You snuck that one in.  You buried the lead.  You sold your house already.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I haven't I haven't sold it yet.  That's it.  It's under contract, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  OK, I will stop.  I'll knock wood again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no.  It's just, you know, a few they got to cross the T's and not the I's.  It's not a big deal.  Yeah, but it'll take.  I mean, don't jinx her.  And and and and you got somebody who was willing to say, OK,  we won't take occupancy for a few months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'll be moving.  If this all goes according to plan, I'll be moving in the middle of April  to another place in Austin.  And then we'll finish it, say, till school finishes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, God.  So you're going to move place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're probably going to do like an Airbnb or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you'll send everything in a container and then you'll just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going to do a probably container.  Somebody's. Yeah.  Good. It's really only like six weeks.  So that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so happy for you.  Me, too. That's the you know, has buying and selling is such a pain.  That's a big purchase. Yeah.  Jeff Jarvis has a number for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we can do the numbers here.  So so Axios previously mentioned has a very brief post  because everything is Instagram as an engagement powerhouse  using data from CrowdTangle, which is owned by Facebook.  Top 10 accounts on three platforms by number of interactions.  So the top account on Twitter, guess who?  And with the chief, 103.9 million interactions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but look how close Ariana Grande is and how far everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ariana Grande, Ariana Grande for president.  I'm fine with that. I'm down with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Huge compare. I mean, she's twice the next biggest one.  Is AOC doing really well.  Thirty six point two million interactions.  What is the period of that a week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I should know that.  Well, there was an I should know that.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Between November 17th and February 17th.  February 17th. So actually, AOC is going to get probably higher.  Go up here. Yeah, huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then Facebook Lad Bible is number one with a comparable  121 million versus Trump's 103. What's Lad Bible?  It's what you what it sounds like.  It's a publication for for its maximum on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Thank you.  Oh, it's for boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So more than you, but more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Men who still act like boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's for people who read the articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's not just it's not just porn.  It's not sorry, soft porn or it's hot, hot women, muscle tips and just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's shallow males.  And then what's Cifras, the number two?  By the way, Lad Bible has more engagement on Facebook  than the president has on Twitter, which is interesting.  On Instagram, though, when these numbers dwarf the other two platforms.  That's the point we get to. Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So nine, yeah.  What are we looking at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're looking at a Brazilian search result.  OK, get back to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eight hundred twelve million interactions.  What's nine? Yeah.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On any of these three platforms, I can't look them up.  It's a reddish reddish thing.  Go from the world.  That sounds bad.  Kylie for thirty three, then Arianna Grande.  NBA, Cristiano Ronaldo, NFL, The Rock.  Kim Kardashian finally showing up in ninth place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Kylie's on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's who Kylie is.  Oh, you don't even have to do a last name, just Kylie Jenner.  Oh, for crying out loud.  What's the deal with her?  His lips popping that important.  Oh, I know who she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But younger sister.  She's the cool Kardashian.  She's the Gen Z Kardashian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All this does is make me sad for humanity, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That Geo's on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't know who a lot of these people are.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kamala Harris is number 10 on Twitter already.  Interesting.  Do you think that that's interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And is Yi Kanye?  Yes. OK.  Pretty soon it'll just be why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's good that we have Stacey on the show so she can tell us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think, though, that that is a indicator of like genuine?  I think Twitter, not Twitter is kind of its own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so so it was interesting.  I think I actually did another look at the candidates.  And Kamala Harris and full disclosure, as I have a Kamala hat,  was number one, except on Facebook, where Bernie  was the one this is before he announced.  And Bernie, you know, I did I did a story, a post  in 2016 about occupied Democrats, and they really they got one hundred  to three hundred million impressions a week from Facebook memes.  And they kind of made Bernie and Bernie stayed very strong  in that meme world of Facebook ever since.  Not on Twitter, not on Instagram, but on Facebook.  And that's how he got to raise six million dollars in a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My my pick of the week is kind of disappointing, frankly.  The FDA says buying young people's blood won't keep you from aging.  Can I get a refund?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Apparently, this is the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. People are looking for Silicon Valley.  Peter Thiel did it.  That's why it's like a quote unquote text story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, because we're so bright here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, this is really Carstens pick.  I knew nothing about it.  But I had to mention it.  My pick is something actually I don't know anything about,  but I want to ask you about, Jeff,  which is a new site called Creder, C-R-E-D-D-E-R dot C-O.  And the idea is to rate news sources on credibility.  And I think that's kind of an it's a new one.  Yeah, I just want you to take a look at it.  The reason it comes up, it's a guy in Petaluma has a guy  in Petaluma has set it up and I know his dad and he contacted me.  And I think it's very it's a very interesting idea.  The I don't know how they rate the credibility,  but that's the key. That's of course the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there an about? Yes, there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Which is blank. Oh, geez. Maybe it's so new that 404.  Yeah. 404. But, uh, uh, top outlets,  they have a leaderboard on outlets and that's interesting.  I don't just thought this would be an interesting thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll dig into it. Introduce me if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I shall. I shall. He also does the podcast, um,  for, um, the, um, oh gosh, now I forgot the name of it.  It's the one where the, uh, uh, uncovered the stories that are under covered  each year. They do that list of stories that were missed.  So I think he's kind of in this space anyway. Uh,  and then finally I want to mention, um, somebody,  none of you care one wit about,  but I'm kind of sad about this, uh, this week. Uh, one of, uh,  the legends of, um, voiceover passed away, Ken Nordeen,  at the age of 98. I bet you don't know his name. Do you? Um,  he's very famous for word jazz. In fact, you could find,  fortunately a lot of his stuff. He sold these as records,  but you could find a lot of his stuff, uh, on, uh,  he's got an amazing voice on YouTube. If you look for Ken Nordeen,  98 years old.  He's got an amazing voice, but more than that,  like Tom Waits meets Christopher Walken.  And he was reading poetry in a jazz club in the mid sixties and they ran out of  poetry and they said,  and he just started riffing and invented something called word jazz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so he searched both like that, uh, that AI algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like something I would make up as a thing that isn't really a thing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  happens to be a thing. I think he did a little bit of LSD. I'm just guessing.  But I love his voice and he's legendary in the business. So we're,  we're sorry to lose him, but Ken Nordeen, uh,  passed away last week at a ripe old age, I might add of a 98.  But if it's any, uh, it's just an excuse to get people to,  to look for his stuff and find it. Ken Nordeen,  I know R-D-I-N-E, a Chicagoan through and through.  Um, all right, I think we're done. Go get some food. Get some bacon and kale,  sweet potatoes and marshmallows. Sounds fantastic. Fantastic.
