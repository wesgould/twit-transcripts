Transcript:  Coming up next on this week in Google, Leo's out for the week. So I Jason Howell and filling in for Leo. We're here with Jeff Jarvis, Stacey Higginbotham and Ant Pruitt. We got a whole lot of Google to talk about this week. Google is the ultimate warrior in the battle between Google and Oracle. We talk all about that case and the Supreme Court decision that decided it.  Google IO 2021 is near suddenly we know all about it. We've got details for you. Stacey reviews the Nest Hub 2. That's the one with sleep tracking. I go hands on with the OnePlus watch. Their new wearable that's coming out soon. The Pixel 6 is supposedly going to have Google's Whitechapel chip in it and so much more that we talk about next on this week in Google.

I'm Jason Howell filling in for Leo Laporte. I like to say that he's gallivanting but I think he's gallivanting in the Petaluma area or at least the Sonoma County area. Still gallivanting. He's probably doing it in a gallivanting sort of way but happy that he's taken a break and enjoying himself and happy that it means that I get to join the crew today. So I'm happy to be here joining us as always. I will start with you Jeff Jarvis buzz machine.com or you can call me Jeff Jarvis.  Or I can go for the super long the Leonard Tao professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark graduate school. Newmark. Newmark. New York. I knew that was coming and I didn't do it. Why didn't I sing it. How you doing Jeff. All right. How are you. Glad to have you here. Thank you. It's good to be here. Also joining us and returning after a week away is Stacey Higginbotham at stacey on iot.com. What's up Stacey. What's up. I'm in a good mood today. I can't wait. I know.  I know. I know. Loving it. It's like it's like lifting the collective energy too. That's what happened. Yeah. One of us. Yeah. So it's good to see you. Good to have you back. And then also joining us from well nearer to me in real life than anyone else on this on this podcast panel is Ant Pruitt.  I'm Ant Pruitt. Twitter.tv slash hop and all other things. How you doing Ant. Unbelievable as always sir. How about you. So you're. I knew you were going to say that and then I knew you were going to wink. That's like your thing. You do unbelievable as always.  And then you wink. Just makes me feel so good. It's good to see you. I'm doing well. It's good to be here and we've got we've got some Google stuff actually actual actual Google News actual Google News that we can talk about today.  But you know kind of scrolling through we might end up talking a little bit about Facebook. I'm sorry Stacey. I don't know. You know it might happen. I will persevere. You cannot kill. You bring it or down. Sorry I don't want to. Yeah I don't want to bum you out. But harsh my buzz man. Yeah don't don't want to harsh your mellow.  I suppose we should start with the story that I only realized when I was kind of setting up the dock for today's show. I completely forgot to put this into last night's rundown on all about Android. Totally an Android story sort of I suppose at this point.  Definitely a story that's been in the Android world for more than 10 years. Google has won officially in the Supreme Court in its case against Oracle. This is the case that had to do with copyright claims. Oracle was claiming Oracle stated and proved that Google had Java code in the Android operating system code.  A decade ago like I said Google of course claiming fair use Supreme Court ultimately sided with Google on this reversed an earlier appeals court decision that Oracle had won in its favor I think two times. So this is just one of those cases that just like never goes away.  We talk about it for a little bit then we forget about it and then like four or five or six months later it appears again and it's appeared again. Is this the end of this story. Are we at the end of this arc. Yes because the only thing you can do after the Supreme Court rules is take your toys and go home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Google is basically that we'll have some petty fighting maybe back and forth like Google being like yeah Oracle you know what we're no longer using your software but really this is such a huge news like Monday morning I woke up I was stoked because it was after Easter and I was probably still on a sugar high and I saw this and I was like oh this is amazing and my husband thought it was actually going to be exciting and I tried to explain to him how not copywriting API's basically  enables the entire service oriented like tech economy that we have today to exist and he was like Stacey it is copyrighted. They didn't decide copyright they decided fair use fair use. You're right. Thank you Jeff. I'm glad you're here. You'll never hear that again by the way. Sometimes.  You're in such a good mood. I'm like yes Jeff you're right. Wow. Right. Wow. It is copyrighted but it's fair use. You can do this but this is huge for like this huge the way we work today. I mean think about it like just I as an IOT person every item in my smart home uses API's to talk to other things you have to have access to these things and this lets you control them but it also lets people use them which is a huge thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which without like honor is terms so you can't have Oracle step in the middle of innovation and say and hope up. Pay my toll. So pay me. You got a lot. I think the other thing that makes me happy about it is because they did kind of dodge copyright and we'll get back to where the software can be copyrighted later. As of now it can be but I think that they use that open for a fight for another day which probably could be good news but just as a creative as we all are here it also  is a an endorsement of fair use and that's important for all of us. That's important for you know you showing videos on these shows or for us. Acting as critics of things. It recognizes the core copyright which is that it's meant to spur creativity. So the strong endorsement of fair use which Larry Lussack once said fair use is just the right to hire lawyers.  You know it's still not it's never going to be clearly defined but there's an endorsement of it here and that made me feel good. And finally it feels really good to see Oracle as a jerk company getting kicked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jason you asked if we're going to hear about this again. It seems like we only heard about it when it was about vacation time for what's his name McAfee. But this was I thought this was was good news because I talked to a employee at Google and he brought up I'm not going to say his name but he brought up some good points and said that yeah there were a lot of things brought up in this documentation that made it look bad on Google but this is a good news.  This is still just for the better of everybody. And like you said far as fair use and being able to use certain things in our content creation as we are content creators. And I believe Miss Stacy mentioned Mrs. Stacy mentioned something regarding you know hey we can be petty with Oracle.  I think they've already started that because they're going to step away from a particular accounting software or something and move over to S&P. I want to say I saw that the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep they're getting rid of Oracle. Just yeah okay we were nice to you while this went on but yeah. Be gone Oracle. Be gone.  No one likes Oracle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean find me someone who likes even my friends who work at Oracle don't like Oracle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's harsh.  Your friends are all hiding right now.  No.  There are two good threads in here Jason that I thought were really good. One by AMAC.  Alex McElroy.  Yeah.  Who you know I think one thing we owe some thanks to Google in this case is everybody wants to slam the big platforms. Google spent god knows how much and spent 10 years fighting on behalf of all of us in favor of this fair use. And AMAC says that it was 10 years ago when he was part of the team of lawyers who were privileged to work on number one book searches fair use number two DMCA protects YouTube and number three androids use of Java APs is fair use.  And that they they fought these things and good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't fight them out of the goodness of their heart though Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No but they could have given up like like I think folks are lately and and and you know against Murdoch in Australia I think they're they're less likely to defend the Internet as well because they're because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did start this back in the do not be evil era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was a 2013 2012 I think the appeals case was 2014 so they started the case before then.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah I mean it was it was a full decade ago this has been one of those 10 year cases.  Crazy crazy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other really interesting thread here was pulling up here.  Matt Shroyers.  About the notion of interoperability.  And that there was a flip here.  Let me see if I get this right that the active supporters were Oracle and the Sun and Microsoft was I don't know so much because you know you don't want to be interrupted with us like Oracle was with Java and and the interoperability one here which is really important to.  Stacey can put that better than I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had to stop listening to you because I was being talked to by John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes interoperability Stacey like it or don't good or bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pro interoperability.  Okay there we go.  It's like do you appreciate kicking puppies.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Oracle when it was down had been in favor of interoperability then it turned to win against it.  Yeah.  But in the end it won and Oracle lost was on the wrong side of history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oracle said in response to this they said they stole Java and spent a decade litigating as only a monopolist can this behavior is exactly why regulatory authorities around the world and in the United States are examining Google's business practices.  Yeah take that Google.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bitter.  Bitter.  Bitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Little bitter.  I mean you spend you spend a decade fighting for your side and you lose you're going to be a little bitter.  I have a feeling anybody would come out the other end and be like yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah that's how I felt about net neutrality in 2018 or 2017.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't worry it's coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It came back around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah exactly.  That that arc is turning for the better again.  So there we go.  Cool.  Google wins.  Happy happy to get that on one of the shows.  I don't know how I missed it last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had all sorts of other great you know like important because you're probably trained to say oh the Google Oracle story oh God it's still going on.  You know honestly right.  You're probably right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah you're probably exactly right because when I saw this headline I was like oh my goodness.  How many times does this story come up and I have to like kind of rehash it again and go through the you know all the twists and turns.  And is it's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well Jason I didn't see Twitter go berserk the way I thought they would have.  I thought Twitter would go crazy with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter went nuts on my feed but I have the cloud feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You saw it on my Twitter didn't so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My Twitter was absolutely quiet.  Hey yeah.  A P I's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's there's the differences.  Yeah right.  Yeah she's all IOT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm on infrastructure Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah exactly.  And I'm in the regular people Twitter.  It's always infrastructure wait for Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  Indeed isn't it for all of us.  I'm sure if your Twitter went nuts over that news then are they going nuts over Google I.O.  2021 we actually have information and it's no it's not an in-person Google I.O.  So it's virtual which I mean we kind of expect right.  Like at this point like you know it's what is it next.  At least we're having one last year there was none.  Exactly right.  Last year it didn't even happen.  They had planned to have it and then you know you can cite a number of reasons why it didn't happen.  You know there was a lot of social unrest happening at that point.  I think this was I think that was like post like almost immediately post the George Floyd incident right.  Somewhere around there where Google was like 25 as we now know it was George Floyd.  Yeah it was that it was pandemic it was a number of things and they were like yeah maybe it's maybe having a celebratory  conference at this point is not a good idea.  So they postponed it indefinitely.  So we're getting it May 18th through the 20th.  It's going to be virtual free to attend.  Of course I mean I'd be surprised I suppose if it wasn't but free for everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah everyone can go this year.  Everyone.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can all go to the virtual Shoreline amphitheater online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bring your sunscreen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah we're going to take a drive down there even though it's virtual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  There might be a handful of other people that show up.  They're like what Google I was happening right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like you all could do.  This is a great opportunity for a twig branded background.  Go out there take a photo of the amphitheater so people can set it as their virtual background so you can.  There you go.  Brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey that's a great idea.  Love it.  They're going to have a consumer and developer keynotes.  So you know talking products talking features.  Sounds like the you know the general ideas is very similar to what you get out of a normal Google I.O. just compressed into three days although three days is about what it normally is anyways right.  When it's when it's out of short.  Yeah it is.  Four days maybe at the longest.  So.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm curious to see how to do the actual opening keynote because you know that's going to be pre-recorded.  There's no way.  And you see Apple and Microsoft have done with those opportunities to try to really really make them in depth and captivating to the audience and not just really bore you to death with a bunch of slides.  So I'm curious to see what Google would do with its Google enos to make this an interesting interesting presentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what I would love to see.  Let's just let me just dream big for a second here.  So I have I have Google audio nest audios I have Google to nest displays.  I've got my pixel.  I feel like how fun would it be to like be able to tune in on a couple of these channels and have like like I don't know different camera angles or different things kind of happening.  Wouldn't that be fun.  And Google is the type of company who would think like that.  I think that would be cool.  So I am sure they're not going to but like oh my nest audios I could have them behind me and they could be like crowd noises or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what's your wish for I.O.  What do you want out of I.O.  What do you want them to announce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would like actually I'll go for I'll go first.  Go for it.  I would like Google to talk about smaller machine learning chips.  So bringing actual machine learning to their TensorFlow the TPUs are big right.  They've got TensorFlow Lite.  I think it could be smaller and better.  So I would like for them to make some big waves there and make it easier for normal people to use in maybe train.  That would be really neat if you could train your.  Maybe what.  Train.  So like imagine if I could do NLP like I could train my devices for my voice or my wake words.  That's something that's in grasp actually from a technical perspective.  And then the other thing I really would like is much more information about local processing.  And if I'm thinking super Google nerdy I want something on the distributed side.  So like how we can actually start getting even if it's on their database side so it's on their side but eventually it could come to us is getting devices to really share computing loads across networks in a way that.  Is a little bit more flexible than it is today.  Like you don't mean example.  So like this is a crazy example but like my my phone and my Google displays might decide amongst themselves which one will do the processing for hearing my voice.  That's a really easy.  I like that. Yeah.  Yeah that's cool.  But it could also be like.  Yeah it could also be like Stacy really does these like I need to borrow some compute power for some machine learning to do some hyper personalization for Stacy's house.  Let's you know the middle of the night no one's using these displays and she's not using her phone.  Let's combine all that compute power to do some quick training and then poof the next morning I wake up and I've got all better stuff.  That's it. We're getting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like I have Stacy neural network.  Yeah.  Personal neural network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People are already like there have been companies that have put like early which is a highly distributed programming language on like light switches so they can do that within the walls of the house at various times right.  But we really need someone to take that sort of thing mainstream and that's I don't think that's going to happen but it'd be really awesome if it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Still trying to understand what I want.  So take the take the light switch as the example because that already exists.  What like what does that result in.  Like so it could learn things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could learn it like OK there's in there there's different layers so if it's only light switches maybe it just learns exactly it does.  It learns exactly what someone's schedule is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh I see I see.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other like the next layer is once these things start once there are common frameworks for things to talk to each other.  It actually could talk to my phone and let's use the phone as a proxy for me even though it may not be because I may not carry it with me.  But if you use my phone as a proxy for me then you have this additional piece of information that says hey Stacy's right here.  Take action on this and.  So it's pulling in more data to learn from and possibly react and you can do a lot of this you can do.  It just happens.  Like over periods of weeks as opposed to every day.  Writing like an ongoing kind of yeah and a lot of companies say things like oh we do personalized machine learning but they really don't.  They have a cookie cutter base well they say they're really just doing machine learning across all of their customers and then they're like they process it every like two weeks or a month and then they do a software update to everyone that's like hey we're better now because.  And that's not bad I mean that'll be things like hey we recognize dogs now on our cameras because we've trained on everybody's dog.  But how much cooler could it be if it were if you had that computing power that they could use locally to be like a your stuff isn't going to the cloud but be we recognize your dog.  So when that raccoon runs into your dog door we're going to be like holy cow Stacy there's a raccoon in your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Got you right.  This is a fear of actual actual personalization.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not marketing personalization.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's basically the door not Kylo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  For you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah I don't know I don't know.  You know what I want.  Looking forward to.  But Jeff.  Yeah what do you want.  You know what I'm not.  My is obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's sweet.  I was going to say Chromebook of some sort.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I was thinking Chromebook.  Yeah yeah I want to pixel.  Mobile network connectivity.  Yeah.  That's.  That's the standby.  But you want to know you want a new pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you change the name of it you want to go back to the name.  What's that.  Stacey said G Suite.  Didn't they.  Sorry no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whatever whatever the Google thing like your your issue with Google's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Enterprise or whatever.  Thank you enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I've given up Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I've noticed you haven't been.  So so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Quitter.  We will later get to Chrome.  Changes.  And I'm trying to do the new changes and of course some of them I can't do.  And then he explained why it has the strange a strange little logo.  That's a box.  With a squirt with it with it with a cross in it and then another box over the side.  I tweeted this I said what does that even mean.  I guess it's an office building.  And if you're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's don't wash in hot water.  I'm sorry Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey is image today.  Yes yes.  That's great.  So you're right Stacey I would love that but I've given I've given up.  I've given up.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But.  And Jason what do you want.  Well you had you had mentioned pixel like the only thing that really comes  immediately to mind because I'll be completely honest I kind of forgot about  Google I have this year like I was truly surprised by the announcement like.  Oh yeah.  That's right.  It is normally next month and Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason I used to rendezvous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah exactly.  Exactly.  I miss that.  I miss the the in person.  And you know have lunch with you and everybody else that we see the whole  experience I'm really looking forward to.  Hopefully next year we return to an in person I.  We'll see about that.  But yeah I mean I think the things that I look most forward to at Google I.  Probably because I'm more of a product person than I am a developer I'm not a  developer at all are kind of the product how the product announcements yes but  also how kind of the developments on the development side of things tie into  those products and make them even better.  If I know you said Jeff that you know maybe a pixel announcement of some sort.  If there is to be one a Google I.O. it would be a I mean if the previous couple  of years is any indication it would be one of the A series so it would be what  would that be the pixel five a or G or maybe not even the five a five G to make  it even more confusing it might just be the five a and then later this year we  get the five a five G and the six who the heck knows I don't know.  I'm already confused but yeah but maybe maybe we'll hear something like that I'm  sure there will be some sort of product the thing there I'm just not certain I  know exactly what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well they were talking about.  Anything you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah my wish list is really a shot in the dark and and they probably won't do it  but I would be curious to see if they come up with a tick tock like piece of  software the way everybody else has done it.  They already have everything in place with Google Photos and they've added  those extra updates to the video side of things and why not just continue to put  something else out there because that's all you ever do is just throw stuff out  there to see if it sticks and I just see how how googly it would be but I doubt  they'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't be I'm trying to trying to remember there trying to remember if  YouTube already has see I've lost track because everybody's yeah I see that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the YouTube YouTube shorts was one YouTube shorts that's it.  Yeah but I'm thinking you know outside of the world of YouTube just just  something right into photos because oh right.  Don't write into photos because photos has the capability to do all of these  different animations and filters and stuff that it does via machine learning  and it matches up little video clips for you already.  Why not let the user have a little bit more control and do their own thing the  way the likes of a tick tock or Instagram Reels does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would that have a social component to it.  I feel like photos is like less of a social app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah but you can but even with photos those those things are shareable to those  other applications via a link.  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So using photos to create the media and then sharing it out to share your social  network.  You want.  I could see that photos has a lot of that a lot of that capability of like you said  creating in interesting ways you know different types of genres of media  creation stuff so I can see that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they overdo it but so if you when you register you can put in the  question you would ask Sundar.  Oh that's right.  Well I asked them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How are you going to make money when search is done.  That's the biggest Google extra extra existential question.  What replaces search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See me I would ask him how is he going to really get leadership to focus.  You know everybody is so siloed there and that organization talked about it before.  So what can he do as the head to get everybody to focus and just you know stay on  course with whatever the product is and not do all of this bouncing around stuff.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That that question that prompt in the side the sign up process to.  Whatever a virtual ticket for Google I.O. took me by surprise I was there for like  10 minutes like God you know you got to put in your Twitter handle if you want to do  this it's got to be a good question like what if they actually pick it.  I think I ended up coming up with you know I don't know if it's a like a like a  softball question but I just was curious to know Facebook's was it Bosworth had  said you know the next 10 years of of kind of personal media devices and you know  personal media device dominance won't be smartphones it's going to be wearables  glasses watches that sort of stuff.  I'm curious to know what's what Sundar believes like is the next you know if the  2010s were defined by the smartphone as they have been what are the 2020s and  beyond what what is the next paradigm that we have yet to discover highly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  distributed continuous computing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With a nerd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm telling you.  Just you wait y'all you're going to be living it and you'll be like oh this is  what Stacey was talking about but I barely understood her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She knew what she was talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's too hyper and a little incoherent.  That's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll see.  I wonder like at what point we'll know like who is like what is that setting up  for is that setting up for a keynote where Sundar Pichai answers these  questions.  Yeah.  Live for everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well they have to answer questions now because he'll they did it right.  So but they can pick them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah yeah yeah they'll cherry pick of course.  Yeah.  Jason from Petaluma asks.  Yeah exactly.  Exactly.  And then we're talking about the pixels so we might as well mention this and we  can take a break here.  The Pixel 6 and actually the Pixel 5A 5G might actually be powered by Google's  homemade or internally made Whitechapel chip.  So this is their first kind of mobile phone or mobile device specific system on  a chip.  They're creating this in collaboration with Samsung.  So be the first time their own silicone goes into their silicone goes into their  pixel devices pushing out Qualcomm which has been there since the beginning with  pixel devices and of course very similar to what Apple's been doing with the M1.  And yeah I don't know I'd be interested to see how like what that affects what that  changes with the Pixel 6 compared to the 5 and before it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If that changes cost of things right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well it changed the ability to like put things like when you have your own  silicone you can like pop on you can pop accelerators on there like Apple has done  for example wearables and devices so they could do that.  It might reduce costs because you're not paying.  Yeah I mean you're back.  They'll still have like an arm license but they probably won't have the Qualcomm.  These.  Yeah right.  And it could be good across the board if they're working with Samsung then you  could have all Android phones working from the same silicone which means you  could put things on the chip in OS and tie those very closely together that could  actually lead to like better security.  So OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was that due to the companies that use Android without their chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well LG got out of the mobile phone market.  So how many of them.  There's Huawei there's Samsung.  This is Samsung they're working with though.  So they're there said they're the story says they're co-developing it with Samsung.  So Samsung has their own X and O chips.  So if Whitechapel is Google plus Samsung that the largest provider of Android you  know just basically is going to become vertically integrated which gives them  some good Apple like features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah except the fact that a lot of Samsung's well all of Samsung's premium  flagship devices and our Qualcomm and below our Qualcomm at least in the US and  that's just just a huge percentage of Samsung's device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Samsung has really a long time to get and develop X and O's and to put that  I mean they've been working on X and O's chips for like I want to say like a  decade.  But the other thing to think about is when you develop your own chip you have to  have a huge volume of devices and pixels are not that so Google couldn't actually  credibly do this alone but they do have good point good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.  Very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I mean they have to have Samsung.  I mean I think it's a good move I think it's a necessary move it sucks for  Qualcomm but Qualcomm's already getting Qualcomm's already seen this writing so  they're definitely focused on other areas like servers and they bought all the  Wi-Fi companies I mean they bought Wi-Fi business they have all these other  businesses now anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well yeah and guest on last night it's all about Android we talked about this  Ryan Hager from Android police pointed out Google can make the silicon you know  that's driving these phones but then there's also the question of the modem  that taps into that and you know that that can pose a bit of a challenge for  Google potentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well Apple still uses the Qualcomm radios in their phones don't they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah I'm not.  That's still their baseband processor.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well let me let me check but I really thought it was they're not using the the  application processor but they are OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I'm not I'm not familiar with with the M1 to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah they they started they've started working they said this year that  or sorry last year at the end of last year that they're working on their own  modem chip because they do still have Qualcomm in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh OK.  All right.  So maybe less of a less of an issue.  One of the questions that I had on this was are is Google you know then if we're  talking about a Pixel 6 with Google's own chip are they targeting a move back  into the premium market with the Pixel 6 or are they going to stick to what they  did with the Pixel 5.  And I mean last night's guest you know felt pretty confident that they're going  to stick in the same category that they are right now and you're not looking at a  return to the premium flagship era of Pixel phones.  But I suppose that remains to be seen but I'll be curious to see if Google kind  of doubles down on that because I still don't even know like was was it a good  move for Google to to kind of ratchet the Pixel 5 down into the mid range.  No I was pretty positive going into it but then when I reviewed the Pixel 5 like  I was a little underwhelmed with it.  It's why I use the Pixel 4 XL now like I just kind of didn't didn't see why I  wanted to continue using the Pixel 5 and so I don't know that I'm entirely sold on  that strategy personally but we'll find out if that makes a difference with White  Chapel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait what do you mean by.  I'm still in the 3A XL.  I'm still in the 3A so yeah.  But what do you mean by going.  Is it a cost function or were you disappointed in like features.  I.  Or was it laggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what.  When I when I think about it it wasn't that there was a feature about it that I  didn't like it was just I was unimpressed like I used it and I am in using it I  realized there was no reason for me to use that when the 4 XL works just fine for  me it was like one of the first times where I use the latest and greatest and  realized I didn't need it and that's probably what it was.  Usually I'm right there on on the you know trying to stay along with the cutting  edge and the Pixel 5 felt less cutting edge to me and more like another you know  what I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I so appreciate you going down this road.  I so appreciate you going down that road sir that it because it's just been a  whole mess of marketing not just from Google but from all of these OEMs about  hey jump on this latest and greatest and pay a premium for it even though nothing  is really going to happen to justify that extra cost that you just put in.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.  Is it maybe I'm growing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it phones are getting boring.  I mean were there features that you like because I feel like phones are kind of  boring now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I won't say boring I was okay.  Actually just as stale made it at the time you know it's just there's only so  much a phone can do same right.  Same with the laptop there's only so much a laptop can do before it stops becoming  a laptop in terms of to an actual workstation you know.  There are limitations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean and you know and that kind of ties in a little bit to the story that we only  alluded to just a little bit ago about LG you know basically shutting down their  mobile division.  You know it's kind of a kind of a shame that that happened not because LG was  producing phones that were taking the world by storm necessarily but because LG  was was really doing some interesting things with they were really playing  around with the mobile phone to try and see like okay everybody's used to a slab  you know a black slab phone like let's let's do something different.  Let's bring out the LG wing that has the little screen that flips up to the side  and sure it looks funny and goofy but they actually decided as a company to put  their marketing and their their money behind that idea to see if they could stir  the pot a little bit.  And yeah phones have become boring.  They really have.  Maybe they don't need to be more than that than what they are though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know I think I think when you go to Stacey's level of multiple devices you  have a blob that's your personal thing.  It goes to different devices it goes to your glasses or your ears or your will I  mask or whatever.  That's where it goes.  You know it's personal distributed distributed computing becomes interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah yeah.  So who knows maybe Sundar Patra I will read my my question to him after all and  then we'll know and then when then we can we can get ready for the future.  Let's let's take a break and then actually when we get back Stacey you want to talk  about the the nest up to because I know you were bummed to miss out on last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah because I had it.  Yes I will talk about it.  I will show it to you.  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excellent.  We can get your day on the nest up to when we come back or when we return to the  show.

We thank Melissa for their support of this week in Google.  All right.  So the Nest Hub 2 and Stacey you've had this for a little while.  You've been I imagine you've been sleeping with this to the side of your bed  analyzing your sleep and giving you data that you can do something with.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You said no.  So let's see.  Let's see what you can see.  So I moved it out of my bedroom so you can't see my sleep data but you can see  like right there it's telling you I have no sleep data but it's giving me the  typical Google home screen possibly in dark mode.  Jeff don't look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No I'm asleep though it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm trying to see one of the things I didn't like about it is you have to use  the Google Fit app.  OK.  Actually let's start this whole thing off like a formal review.  Here's what we're talking about.  We're talking about this device.  It's a seven inch Google Nest display that sits by your bedroom or that they want it  to sit by your bedroom because 20 percent of people apparently put these devices in  their bedroom and Google is like oh I know a lot work that angle.  Normally so and it has Google's solely radar in it and that is what it uses to track  your sleep and it tells you I'd show you but right now the photos of my daughter so  I'm not going to show you that when I get to a photo of something that I can show you  I'll show you how it shows your sleep tracking you opt into it.  It is all right.  I had a real issue with it deciding that I was sleeping when I was just laying in bed  reading and Google will tell you no no it knows you're just reading in bed and it shows  you that but mine actually showed me as being asleep.  So it also uses it has three mics and it uses the mics to determine if you're snoring  or if you are coughing.  What I did discover is that while sometimes I do snore sometimes my husband snores in  Google can't really tell who's snoring.  It can tell that I'm tossing and turning because it only notices me but it doesn't  know who's snoring.  So that's one thing.  The sleeping was pretty tied to my Fitbit when it worked.  I will say I absolutely hated when I didn't sleep well and Google would be like you slept  too much last night or you need to improve your bedtime.  I was like shut up Google do not tell me what to do.  I got really upset with Google.  I was not prepared for those kind of emotions that came out.  Partially I think because Google to my Google is a man's male's voice and I did not need  a man telling me how I slept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't man sleep me.  I really think that was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just like normally it doesn't bother me that Google uses a man's voice but when  Google is like judging my sleep I was like oh no.  It's super easy it's super comfortable.  If you want to track your sleep and you don't want to like spend a lot of time on it this  is fine.  It's not going to change the way you sleep unless you're just ready for that.  Just because you know you've got to go to bed at a regular time every night right.  You know you got to wake up at the same time every day but it's not like you're actually  going to do that unless you're going to do it right.  Google's not going to change that.  It can do things like suggest that you lower your lights and it'll be like do you want  us to lower your lights at the best time for you to go to sleep and you're like no I do  not want you in charge of my life Google.  So anyway home control is fine.  It listens a lot better.  It sounds so much better than the original one.  There is no camera on it and I mean I like this.  I put it in my office for now just because I've got a Fitbit.  So I already know how I sleep.  Yeah questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well some of the stuff you mentioned there like the whole warning of okay you should  probably start dimming your lights right about now.  I think that's a good idea for people that don't quite understand you know circadian  rhythms and getting your body tuned up for proper rest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is that is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I'd be like Stacey I'd be arguing with it.  No I'm not ready to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what you say the way you sound every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah I mean it's up to you if you want I mean is it is it helpful.  Oh the other thing I will say because I did voice matching if I and I don't know what  it'll tell me how did I sleep last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It looks like you don't have any sleep data reported for that day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay but if you had asked that and you were here Jeff it wouldn't actually tell you  because it's tuned to my voice so it ties like the sleep data to my voice which is nice.  So I guess if my husband wanted to know how he slept he couldn't.  So that was nice.  I don't know what else to tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are the three dots on the top Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh microphone.  This is the solely thing right here.  The center thing okay.  The center thing and then those are microphones I believe.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you ever have the pixel four or the four XL or was it only the four XL that had the solely radar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was only yeah okay here's a picture this is what it looks like see that little thing up there  in this corner if you have sleep sensing on that's how you know and it's always on there  so you know that it's going to try to like watch you sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a little what a cute doggy who's a good puppy who's a good dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cute puppies.  Does the solely radar make more sense for a device like this than it did on a mobile phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes oh and you can start like this is actually kind of neat in my office setting or in the  kitchen like I don't actually have to touch the screen if it's playing stuff I can swipe to the  next song or pause the music I think this is pause I haven't actually how reliable is that for you.  Actually I got up to four feet away and it was reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So because I can't say that about the four XL phone just swiping through Spotify or what have you.  It is the worst experience I'm like just pick up the phone and she's exactly I'd be surprised if

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  anyone that has that phone actually like is still like trying to make that stuff work because it  never works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what y'all it's probably about three feet away now that I'm that's impressive still

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah that's impressive I mean it's probably a larger sensor offers I imagine it's a larger sensor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's nice if you're like playing in like if you're in the kitchen or your hands are dirty like I do  it because I'm lazy and it's far away on my desk but everything has to be cleared in front of it.  So it's not like if there's something obviously won't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm literally having my morning routine of washing my face brushing my teeth or whatever and I have  music going and every now and then I want to hear something with a little more so I swipe in the  air like a Jedi to tell Spotify to go to a different track never happened the phone right there on the  sink with me you know it's right there never has this is this how much I can't remember how much

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this is I think it's ninety nine dollars I think so too.  I just wanted to just get ninety nine dollars you could put this in your bathroom there's no camera  there are my rights there is a physical switch for the off button for the mic.  So if you wanted to stick that in your bathroom and you solely you could like it wouldn't it  wouldn't have the sounds of you peeing I guess if you're worried about that and then I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  think while you're in the shower you could change tracks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well me I'm like I don't know how far away your shower is and the moisture rating on this thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but yeah I was going to say it's I wonder how well it would stand up to yeah oh yeah the  humid bathroom oops yeah there is that aspect but um sweet I mean a hundred bucks is not that  expensive I'm just I know that the marquee feature of this or at least the feature that  Google is really touting is the sleep tracking and I'm just in that camp where I'm like how  like how important is like knowing sleep data about myself to me it's not at all but I realize  other people have different needs I just don't know what I would do with that information like  I know when I wake up in the morning whether I had a good sleep or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'll tell you you'll stop drinking alcohol because good golly gosh I sleep I mean after five  days of no alcohol I can totally see it in my sleep's like pattern and it's oh yeah I mean it's  really distressing I'll be honest I'll be like oh man do I want to sleep do I want to have some  restorative deep sleep tonight or do I want to have a glass of wine right these are terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  decisions I was going to say something similar along those lines Mr Howell that information is  important if you're someone like me that knows they have bad sleeping habits to be able to get  some type of analysis on what happened the previous day and previous night's sleep to try to  combat that and lead up to a better night's sleep the days that the days that I really really push  myself physically you know doing calisthenics or whatever I'm assuming I'm going to just crash  and just sleep like the best ever and most of the time it's not that it's usually the inverse of  that I'm wide waking up more often and stuff like that so I have to try to curtail how much I push  myself during the day because I still want to sleep but yet be able to recover properly to be  able to perform the next day so yeah that data is pretty important I wonder since we have the  pixel 4xl would would we be able to get something like this in that phone because you have phone  stands out there that you can put on your nightstand and it has the the sensor right there I wonder if

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we could do that in the future I don't think I mean since they didn't put in the five I don't  think Google's investing on the solely on the phone no and all of the phone this is important  all of the data all your sleep radar data is processed locally on the device and only the  insights are sent to the cloud so that's really important and I mean your phone processor could

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  do it but I mean I'm guessing I'm guessing the the sensor that provides the the solely radar  capabilities is pretty small on the phone because it needed to be and I'm guessing it's not as small  on the nest hub because that's a larger form factor device it gives more distance that's  probably why on the phone you have to be really close to it for it to register anything versus  the nest hub if you can get close enough to just pick it up any of those interactions on the phone  from three feet away I don't think it's going to do nothing when you try that oh I did want to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's one other thing about this that gives me pause and I don't like the way that Google did  this I see why they did it they talked about this in the the launch for this they said hey  for now the sleep sensing is a free feature and when I was doing the when I was doing the calibration  there was a tiny little message on the screen that said something about the nest aware subscription  like warning me that it might become part of that and I was like but it's possible that after Google  figures out what it's going to do with Fitbit it will turn the sleep tracking into a paid feature  which means like I hope they don't do it this way I mean at least they're trying to tell you  but if the sleep sensing is really important to you on this device know that you may end up having  to pay more for it after like in like a year yeah which is a little sucky and to not know the details

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of that now is kind of especially if you're buying the device for that that's I feel like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google should probably the best way to implement that would be like going forward for buyers of  this device it's going to cost x but if you already have it you got a year free right yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  something like that or free forever you know like I realized maybe maybe it's uh maybe it's me not  understanding what it takes to run a business but I kind of feel like you know this is Google  we're talking about they they were they were floating free storage on photos for years

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with how you know how many they deploy fiber networks around the country at cost like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is sleep data the comparison is way different like just why why pay for sleep data like I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know it's for free if you think Jeff like let's talk about what Sundar wants and thinks the  future of if it's not slabs of glass and advertising it is services yeah yeah that's right wearables

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  having that day I'm just putting that out there and and and and recent I think recently said  that you know you were talking about what the decades of the net before and that were passing  out of the advertiser supported net into the from his view because  and recent horowitz thinks it's a media company into paying creators directly net but a different  way you can look at it as you go from the ad supported net to the service net now the problem  is very few winners there very few people aren't going to you know there's only so many places  you're going to spend your money on stuff on services on content on anything uh and and the  marketing cost of it is extremely high so I don't know that that's any Valhalla you arrive at but  nonetheless you're right stacy services with value I think packaged services with value  then then the brand matters then do you trust google to do all these services for you do you  trust amazon to do it for you you trust facebook no you don't um and so on yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well cool okay so it sounds like you're pretty positive on this device I mean there's obviously  a couple of asterisks involved the sleep you know the potentially having to pay for the sleep data  somewhere down the line something that someone's going to have to ask themselves but 100 bucks for  this device even if it doesn't do the sleep data if you take sleep data and sleep sleep tracking  out of the equation is it a recommend is it worth 100 bucks if you don't have an oh now we now we

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hear you oh I was like I don't know what happened okay if you don't have a nest google nest display  I don't know what the heck to call these things right now um or you want one without a camera  this is a great one if you already have one unless you listen to a lot of music I mean it'd be worth  upgrading if you really care about the quality of the sound it's not going to sound as good as  like the nest audios but it sounds way better than the first small nest right of display  then you'd upgrade but yeah for 99 bucks for 99 bucks it's a great digital picture frame I mean  yeah the sunrise alarm is nice I I feel like it's okay yeah I remember when the standalone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  google home was 130 bucks and that was just a little a little dome looking thing with no screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so you know the price so I didn't put this in the rundown but your old friends at sonos did you see  this are building the speaker into hidden art with ikea yes the symphony oh really symphony  you could imagine this google stuff being embedded into all kinds of things you know your  your light switches as you said earlier and god knows what all I feel like light switches are a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  terrible medium for speakers but yes the tiny little speakers I mean they exist I've tried  light bulbs that have speakers I mean so you pop them in your ceiling and your light bulbs  really yeah you've tried everything uh sanglade sanglade makes a lot of really interesting  light bulbs if you're in the smart light bulb market and they're very inexpensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so anyway I remember hearing about the speaker light bulbs and wondering if it would actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  work because of all the heat um they're leds so they're not yeah okay all the father of leds died  um last week in case we want to honor that because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've not heard that I can't use it is samu aka sucks yes blue led inventor who shared the  nobel prize in physics died at 92 rest peacefully yes yeah I missed that too  um LEDs are all the rage so thank you for that that sorry that that was really random but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  was like blue LEDs used to be like difficult and expensive and rare and he helped change that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah no kidding um let's see here cool well thank you for uh your thoughts on on that I was very  curious about that uh we do have a little bit more google news uh here let's see here yeah I know  looks like uh it looks like all these well all these at least this week there's two people uh  two uh notable names of people leaving google one of them an ai ethics uh researcher sammy bengio  bengio sorry if I'm mispronouncing your last name I probably am one of those was wrong anyways uh  google research manager he oversaw the ai ethics group quit on Tuesday actually timnit gebru and  margaret mitchell both actually reported to sammy uh he's been with the company since 2007 and so he  has bailed as well as well this whole ai ethics thing is just the oh just the hits keep coming

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for google as far as that's concerned yeah this was poor thinking because it's not like it's not  like ai experts are a dime a dozen right these people can go anywhere and so who  yeah if they don't like what you're doing that would be something to ask but shy at i.o but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's not necessarily for i.o right yeah well yeah and the thing is like he's only going to  pass the gatekeeper exactly exactly he's only going to answer the ones that they feel comfortable  answering it i just something tells me they would not they would choose to not answer that oh come  which i suppose doesn't mean don't ask but have some guts guys  you can do it uh not only that uh the uh boss the head of waymo john krafcik um or is it krafcik  why can i not pronounce people's names anyways analysis departure he's been with the company  five and a half years um he was essentially brought in in 2015 to help bring waymo to  more of a commercial viability state and i think google and waymo kind of expected  self-driving vehicles and the waymo division to be further along now than it is um but this is just  though the way of uh the way of waymo i suppose right now so he's going to be replaced by uh  co-ceos uh tequedra mawakena and dimitri dolgov are going to replace him so it takes two people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  oh i was like i think it's the worst you're like oh man i was so working way too hard it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  confirmation it's confirmation that you're leaving and that was probably a good move  when i read when i read through this though the question that come up came up for me  is are we as tech journalists and our consumers who are who are like really pro-tech and pro  autonomous vehicles are we just too optimistic too um too optimistic about the future of  self-driving cars versus what can actually be delivered at this point do we feel like  things would be more delivered than they are right now or do we feel like it's on track

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's a bit late i mean i remember thinking my daughter wouldn't have to get her driver's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  license yeah i mean according to plan right i thought 2020 was going to be the year for all  of this stuff you know yeah yeah yeah i'd like to see this this to continue to progress um so i'm  not totally sure pulling it or anything but we still got a little progressing yeah but it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know it's like when you move right the last like 80 percent is um what is it what come on  y'all help me out here it's like you're you're like 90 percent packed in the last like 10 takes  the most amount of time or is right difficult yeah it's all the little stuff that's not quite

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so easy to just that's where we are we're like we got the big stuff down and now we're like oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  crikey people yeah it's in the middle of the street where they're not supposed to what are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we going to do about that that's a really good point ah yeah good point all right so optimistic  again that's self-driving cars you're doing all right you're doing all right autonomous vehicles  um let's see here my voice is going sorry about that um did you guys hear about this lyra codec i  thought this was neat google had announced this a month ago i think in relation uh to uh duo  and essentially it's an audio codec that google has been developing  to um specifically for low uh like really slow connections so essentially this would allow for  high quality audio to be transmitted over even 2g connections i think we talked about at the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because it was it was it was meant for um countries with less bandwidth yeah yeah they were

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  bringing it to do markets right emerging markets places where they might only have 2g connectivity  right like it's not something that we see here in the u.s. but in other parts of the the world  absolutely and it turns out google has open sourced this i think they said they were going to do this  initially they just hadn't done it yet now they're opening open opening sourced open sourcing lyra  and uh making the code available on github so that other developers creating their own product  products can bring in that technology and improve the audio quality and reduce the  the level of data that's required in order to transmit it so that's cool stuff i think that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the key opening it up to the community and letting more hands and eyes get involved in this to to  really bring this to life and make it better uh support on the other hand may be another story  but at least this is something that'll be out there in the wild for people to be able to take

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  advantage of yeah yeah we'll certainly see how it how it distributes and you know how it's used and  what that leads to but i think that's good news um google has acquired uh a startup and this is uh  what is it called dysonics so apparently this happened last december and we're only just finding  out about it now google's been kind of cagey as far as uh any any of this they're not really  commenting on it much but uh dysonics uh as as the company prior to to acquisition developed a motion  tracker for headphones so this would have this acquisition it would seem would have to do with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  3d audio which you know when could they finally fix the damn pixel buds this this is this is like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the worst news if you ask me why am i going to worry about 3d and spatial audio and stuff like  that if just regular functioning earbuds don't right yeah that's that's come on google maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they're gonna come out in like a year or two with something that's actually good and work and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  revolutionary if it just works eventually it just works dot dot dot eventually um apple is doing  this with their apple i uh airpods pro i believe i was thinking the magic had headphones or was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it yeah was it the larger ones it's well i know that i know the big over the ear 500 something  dollar ones have it i don't know about the the fancier pros yeah i believe also yeah the airpods

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  pro article i read anyway said airpods pro so it there the 3d audio is there spatial audio is there  galaxy buds pro also uh offer this the idea being um if you're watching something that supports it  like you know when you go to move your head the sound like i don't know that i've ever really  experienced this to be honest but the sound will kind of follow your your head movement while in  some cases keeping the like dialogue at the point the place in space where the person is that's  talking just as one example so probably pixel bugs you had no sound followed you right you move your

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  head and it drops off and completely yeah completely the closest i've seen is is like with the uh  oculus in um what's the oh yeah the vibe they they had ambisonic sound uh with their 360 video  and yeah that's true that's about as close as you're going to get yeah and this is designed

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for things like ar right and vr this isn't i mean i think it could be cool if like you're  imagining alien remastered for that where you're like you turn your head and suddenly everything's  you know changes but really i think it's for less like today's entertainment more the immersive  entertainment of the future right make more sense anyway where it might appear you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  nine to five google posits you know possibly the google pixel buds like we've been talking but  i don't know like i guess i don't think of that kind of um media experience as as a tiny little  earbud that you put in your ear i think of that more as like the over the ear kind of a a bigger

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  presentation sort of approach so who knows what let me ask you something as to how with  having earbuds in your ear versus wearing cans um i'm assuming you just have a less immersive  experience wearing earbuds because of a fit or something like that because a lot of times the  earbuds if they if they're properly fit they block out a lot of ambient sound yeah it's true  is that something that you have fought against and just rather have cans

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  honestly i think it yeah i was gonna say i think it depends on the application depends on what i'm  doing if i'm out if i'm out gardening i'd much rather have the earbuds and that's perfectly fine  i can put on noise cancellation it really doesn't matter but if i'm sitting down in front of a  screen and i'm watching something i would much rather have the over ear experience and get you  know because inevitably at least the headphones that i'm going to use that are over ear are  probably going to be better drivers you know larger larger components yeah it's just going  to sound a little better because it has the space to do that versus in earbuds but i mean  they're coming a long way now we're getting yeah they're getting there some of them are

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  absolutely we're getting great isolation i bought some with noise cancellation and all sorts of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  fancy things yeah yeah i just did a comparison a couple of weeks ago the galaxy oh you had the  job release right and the jobra 85 yeah the elite 85 that's what i just got yeah those are my  favorites i love those yeah yeah i've been with the jobras for a few years now and i'm really  into every every generation is just better and better yeah that's a good upgrade hot twit.tv  slash hot is on take thank you for the promo yeah i think that was last week's episode or the weeks  before i can't remember it was a week before last week's was cow digit there we go but uh yeah you  know they've come a long way um they're doing no you know active noise cancellation now um it's  i think with those it's all about the fit you got to get the the the tips that fit your ear canal  perfectly because if they're too big they're going to push out if they're too small they're  going to fall out you're not going to get that nice base response you know so you got to find  the right fit and some people just do not care for that like suction feeling um i'm used to it at  this point but if i'm going to sit down and watch a movie i would much rather have you know over the  ear or i'm going to listen to like an album at my desk absolutely so who knows maybe google will  come out with an over the ear solution similar to what apple has done recently that that could  absolutely happen i could totally see that um oh boy i'm realizing we should probably take a break  let's take a break and uh then we will we're probably going to branch out beyond the google  after we take this break and there's some news you know some facebook news some other things  dotted throughout i just saw actually just saw in the in the the chat that twitter might be in talks  to acquire clubhouse we could talk about those talks ended those talks ended so they're not might

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they're now oh they happened to which oh it happened in whatever  yeah i'm kind of like of course someone's going to be like oh crap everyone's on clubhouse let  me call them up yeah like i'll give you a crazy amount of money they really qualify as this news

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  data leaked can you explain this to me that was a 2019 leak why is it in the news now i'm just not  it was put up somewhere i just haven't bothered to go in it up for people to have access to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  beforehand it was it was leaked but no one shared it so who who put it up who had to put it up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  i didn't follow that story i don't know that we know or i don't know that i've seen anyways who  put it up necessarily um yet however it is now appearing in on the dark web for free so it's not  even uh this large mass amount of of information that is being you know sold on the dark web it's  just there and anyone has access to it and it has you know a lot of phone number information oh my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  god they're gonna ruin the phone jeez i might be getting junk calls

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  oh i guess the phone is useless yeah true i get i get far more uh spam calls on my phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  number than actual calls oh yeah that's why the google screening is so great google's like hey  do you want me to screen this and i'm like oh yeah i do yeah yeah why is my phone not doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that lately though that's that's a good point lately i'm not seeing that how do you turn that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  on where do you turn that on every time i update google i lose features and gain features and i

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's no rhyme or reason to it it drives me bonkers um where did i turn that on i think it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  offered it to me one day do i have what bugs me is every time i open the dialer it has that hole  do you want to place them on hold why they have you on hold whatever the little i think screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  calls there it is there it is yours is verified where where did where did you get to it how did

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you get to it it's well so if you go into your phone app i'm not going to go out there because  it's got a bunch of other stuff so not my settings go into settings then you've got down here at the  bottom uh spam and call screen as a feature and so that's where you go and you can activate that  in there but apparently i had it activated so i had it on so i don't know why i'm seeing uh spam  calls do you know what you want me to call you and offer you insurance i'm seeing just do it  do it i'm seeing less spam calls i'm seeing a lot of spam text messages like tons of them suddenly  so i don't know they get you any way they can um yeah so there was that uh with facebook i mean  it's just a lot a lot of people's information but you're right i mean at this point at this point i  feel like i see this story a million times every single month like at a at a certain point i just  kind of get desensitized to it i was like okay well it's data it's already out there when i go  to have i been pwned.com you know there's like 10 different things that i've been pwned yeah but it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  goes back to like 2007 for me it lists them all so you think oh my god i went and did it again and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's you know again yeah yeah i did not find my information in the in the uh they have updated  i uh have i been pwned.com by the way with the information from the facebook dump and uh i did  not find my information in there at least you can put in your phone number it's a part of that  but i mean there there is a security element to that too i i would imagine like for like two factor  authentication that uses a phone um that could be a vector for someone who really wants to take  advantage of some of the phone numbers they find in there it couldn't just it could also  not just be locked into like spam calls it could be people who kind of use it on a deeper level  you know to do two factor but how likely is that to happen to everybody i don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  things to fear i guess um how about the other story i didn't want to i didn't want to delve  into you made it green what i'm just going to ask here is the amazon urination story

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mean it has to be talked about no but i presume that in a time of covid in every restaurant at  every store and everybody closes all the restrooms yeah i just presumed that part of the problem was  if you're driving all day for amazon how do you and is that a factor in this story or do we not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well i mean the issue was in line that was an issue well i'm just thinking about the fact that  drivers have to pee in bottles part of it was their quotas didn't allow for time for biological  functions right you just had to make these package deliveries and then the secondary  issue was where can they go to do it right and this is something the ups people at everybody i  mean this is not just it's not just amazon yeah it's everybody right now it's got to be tough out  there well even before i mean it's not like if your ups guy was like hey can i use your bathroom  you'd be like um no dude hey hey quite frankly if you're just if you're just an average ant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  pruitt sometimes they're not going to let you use the bathroom either because it's right people are  closing down their bathrooms because there's so much idiocy happening inside of bathrooms destroying  them and whatnot so yeah this this isn't really an amazon problem this is just it is what it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  i mean there's just a wide kind of unionization uh thing happening uh with with big tech right now so  i know leo has mentioned you know in in recent weeks like these stories are less technology and  more more labor you know labor social laws and and and stuff and so maybe less less appropriate  or less necessary to be discussed on the shows i i did not i i will say though that i did not care  for for amazon's response that that tweeted response i really put a sour taste in my mouth  and i was just like oh come on like what i can understand not not agreeing but it was such a  pissy tone it was like you don't need to do that oh did you have to say that that way jason i'm  like jason now another room shot jason such a piss war tone that's better okay good is that a  word we can't say on this show it probably is i think i think we're headed toward uh piss war is

Transcript:  oh man sleep me okay i leave that that's a better show title yeah that's a better but but would you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have preferred a standard pr playbook tweet response i i much i appreciate the fact that  this was almost human what they tweeted back instead of the true yeah we're taking actions  to blah blah blah blah blah blah blah that every big tech company says straight out of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah the pr playbook page 25 but they lied yeah that's the problem they lied yeah they just had  the lines i was like i was like so they're instead of taking a page from the pr trait playbook they're  taking one from like what the trump administration playbook where you're just like uh this is an  alternative fact right they lied there's nothing to see that was not cool along dude y'all i am so  blurry what is happening to my camera i've got the barber walters effect no i don't know bandwidth  no i i've plugged in okay sorry i'm like crisp well you know i don't mind being like  fill me in soft  strice and you can start singing like strice and i cannot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what about the the aclu story that that got a little bit of attention aclu was coming under fire  it was revealed last week that it was sharing data with facebook which i mean you know who isn't but  when it comes down to it it's aclu you know and they're an organization that kind of makes a you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know kind of makes a statement against i'm guessing hey well what were they sharing and why you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  usually for the people right yeah for the people so they were sharing context so this is this is  information uh that was collected when people were visiting the site when they were silent signing up  with mailing lists buying something uh through the aclu site making donations data shared with  facebook including names addresses phone numbers i mean but why yeah well that's that's a great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  question was it just negligence or was it was it a re business reason for them or i think that's  what's what i believe that i'm trying to remember exactly what it was because they talked about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on twitter policy and then when they updated their privacy policy they disclosed that it shares data  with facebook from their website visitors if you join a distribution list make a purchase or  submit a donation it includes your name email address phone number and zip codes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so basically why were they doing that that's what i'm still trying to understand oh i imagine it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so they could solicit more donations from like-minded people also on facebook oh yeah you know what they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  probably could build a like this set yeah that would be my that's what that's probably what it  was then okay there's probably a legitimate business reason but it's oh data and facebook  you know i just don't want to go anywhere near that third rail now technopad well i mean yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  data and facebook but then also kind of like i think i think what captured certain attention  about this is that it's aclu and this would be the kind of thing that they would right in yeah in  other cases kind of turning the table and looking outward going hey you shouldn't do that let me  look it up right their statement just said what is that book you're reading is that moral  panics okay all right all right fair enough fair enough yeah and they see you'll they they punted

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on this their their statement was they must often the aclu must often work with companies that we  are actively challenging to improve their own policies and practices so basically yeah we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  using it too we got to yeah um trying to see what else is there anything in here that y'all um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  pandemic happened so and you are not putting your studio in the living room i don't care if this is  how we make a living no you are not putting all this crap in the living room well it wasn't even

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that we have a den we actually have a den downstairs the problem is the den has no door to close it off  from the kitchen and from the living room so i have a space it's just the kids are going to be  doing their school you know my wife works out of the house as well this was the only way that i  could like close the door and know that i wasn't going to disrupt everything and vice versa so  anyways it's working out take my space it's worked out all right so what's going on here well let's  see here we've got the pixel 5 getting an update at the april uh 2021 update which i'm hearing at  least on on uh twitter a lot of people saying they're seeing some improvements there's a there's a  gpu performance gain as part of this update so if you've got a pixel 5 definitely want the april  2021 update you might actually see some speed improvements on certain aspects becomes less meh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah yeah more and probably a little bit of a battery bump too right probably so yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  absolutely and actually there's there's a few other improvements here camera quality and how  that translates into third-party apps gain performance sounds like a pretty a pretty  decent upgrade for the pixel 5 so make sure that when you see that april update if you have it  make sure and let it go through and you'll be happy that you did also android 12 developer preview  2.2 there's been a couple of updates actually of the developer preview the second one they had one  that went through like a like a it's like they they did the developer preview 2 and then they did an  update like a week ago and now they have another one with more security patch and bug fixes so i  don't know what's going on there probably doesn't apply to most people watching and listening to  this show because it's the developer preview i don't know i'm pretty positive no one on this  panel is is updating uh to the dev preview at this point i'm i'm not even doing it right now  so you're not you the god of android isn't i well i have it on a separate phone so often  so often i would actually just put it on my my daily driver because i want to know but um this  time i chose to put it on a separate phone i'm gonna wait until the actual beta if it's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  development i was there the day that you walked your phone i was there for that famous day

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i gotta be careful now yes you do yes you do is mr howe just getting older is he getting older

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and wiser with all of these definitely getting older it makes me see if i'm getting wiser  uh google is bringing support for the rust programming language which this was a store one  of those stories i was like okay i'll take your word for it i don't necessarily understand it  when i read into it further it's essentially um there are different ways to develop for android  if you want to develop for the os itself and not necessarily apps if you're doing apps you might  use something like kotlin if you're developing for the os itself you might use c or c plus plus  rust is another way to develop for the operating system itself and it actually addresses memory  safety better than c and c plus plus two so if you're a developer that probably makes a heck  of a lot more sense to you than it does to me google's apparently been working on this  integration for the last 18 months um so there you go they'll be they'll be talking about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in virtual i.o did you hear about rust maybe they will they sure will they sure will rust

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yes right a couple of years ago we had the kotlin announcement and everyone in the audience went  nuts for it so yeah i wonder if rust project is well that's because it's new but rust is not a new

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  programming language kotlin was new yeah um people were very excited about kotlin yeah people it's  like a i feel like rust is i feel like it's been around for like a decade y'all it's been a while

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  okay well uh late to the party but at least came to the party  um google play music has one final update that lets you hide the app on your phone and i'm  guessing i didn't get to read through this but i'm guessing some phones might have google play music  kind of installed and it's still there even though if you launch it like you can't get it to run  anymore and this final update will uh what i call this epicides the update that kills the app

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's like it's the reverse of recursion that's actually kind of nice that they're thinking  about that for people like me who like want everything on their screen to be like  uniform used no i just want it to be like there's no room in my life for like non-essential stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you just gotta get rid of it yeah no i'm with you okay yeah i'm with you on that definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  why why have an app icon in your in your tray that literally does nothing when it's done it's done  let me let me remove it please absolutely agree um we were talking about the pixel buds earlier  and um i think last week leo may have mentioned in the changelog that there was a possibility of a  pixel buds a coming somewhere down the pipeline uh and apparently there was a an email sent out  um i don't know who it was sent out to exactly oh it was the google nest mailing list and anyways  in that email it shows the whole family of google devices and under accessories or above accessories  is a version of the pixel buds that have like a like a greenish a quiet like a mint color to them  and we haven't seen that yet that's a that takes a version of really knows their google stuff to  notice that because it's totally totally um but it's not it's definitely not white either they  like the buds themselves are green and the buds usually are one question so what do they work

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's a good question i can't have none of the time they work half the time so there is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  an improvement if i turn my head you know what drove me nuts about it i could never find a pattern  oh it's when i turn my head this way oh yeah no it's when i do that no my hand is here no my  hand is there there was no pattern oh it's when i'm facing east it's when i'm facing west no  no way can i find out when the damn things wouldn't work they just often wouldn't work

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  he's doing the hokey pokey while he turned himself around

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and why didn't it happen only outside it basically didn't happen inside it happened outside why air

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it made no sense none walls no walls for it to bounce off of i don't know  nuts you're not alone they are they are very glitchy that's disappointing because i really  like them for the totally hands-free uh assistant yep or going on runs or whatever when i don't want  to like have to interact with my phone or whatever it was awesome i could just say  skip forward 30 seconds or skip forward two minutes and yeah it was awesome that's pretty  cool but pretty glitchy so there's that too um google workspace users um are going to get some  extra time to create unlimited docs they're going to get until next year apparently this was  an extension that google had initially set uh for you know docs sheets slides other workspace files  to not count against storage caps i think because of the pandemic back in november they announced  this it was going to go through june 1st but now we're getting an extension to go into 2022 so  you get more free doc files that uh don't count against your storage space are they free forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or come next year they start charging you for all this stuff that's a good question if you create a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  bunch of these docs and then yeah that's a good question i wonder um delay the count  i'm man i'm i mean i'm guessing that it's uh that it's free forever but why would it be i guess  it should be but usually the whatever you have in your drive counts against your storage quota  well right yeah so yeah that's a good question i don't know the answer on that one okay um of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  course google storage is very cheap yes it is i'm not gonna i'm not gonna complain i have other  things to complain about that's not yeah your earbuds and my status as a workspaces customer  in other areas i'll complain yes yes that will never go away that will box here or there everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  google is opening up android auto to uh to i think third party navigation options parking charging  apps just more integration with apps in other words android auto for quite a while has been  in some ways kind of locked down to google's own apps for certain things like navigation and  and ways i think eventually and now they're opening it up even further so that's good if you use  android auto i don't really use android auto very much maybe i should but i don't i do it's all i use

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it i don't drive anymore so well you're not going anywhere mr howell so what's the thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's true that's true going more places now it's opening up maybe i should use it again  and then finally and i think you uh so i put this one in there i'm very excited about one feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  very excited so i've talked in the past this is this is a new chrome os update and um a few things  in it one is i've long since wanted multiple cut and paste like what i'm doing the rundown i got a  cut and paste once for the url cut and paste once for the headline cut and paste once cut this once  now when you cut and paste into chrome os it displays the last five things you've saved in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the memory so you can okay and then i used to have a separate app for that yeah exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  i used to have we used to call save get keys in my prehistoric days of of newsroom systems so now  you can put the url in and then you put the headline in and it's gonna it's gonna save jason howell  immense amounts of work i'm very happy with that that's a good one uh the other one that's good is  they've improved the screen grab piece so now when you mark something it's something says you want  to save this and you can change the shape of it you can do all kinds of things to it do other stuff  too so that's good um it uh it says it directly controls your android phone but it won't let me  do that because apparently i'm a google workspaces person wi-fi works better powerful screen capture  tools we did that already uh then keep critical files at your fingertips now on the bottom of the  screen it'll give you three little um icons for the last three files you did something to right  there now um uh stacy's uh air spoil partner in all things other things podcast did a whole  piece about how to get rid of that but evidently you can only get rid of it kevin said for a while  because then it's going to come and be there permanently and it's irritating people because  it changes their their tray but you can keep critical files at your fingertips um more about  a assistant who cares uh the desks uh supposedly that's easier i don't really use the desks uh  personalize your lock screen who cares easy access to your media controls i don't care that's it but  there's a lot of changes in chrome os that was a lot that is a chrome substantial update it's for  the time to sound like a productivity os yes yes it's i'm telling you i'm telling you folks  follow the light children yeah you have that mr jarvis the light children

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we've been relying on uh chrome os largely in in our house the past year just for you know  right school school and everything yeah the chrome books that we have have come in very handy oh  yeah um although i have i have one one criticism that keeps cropping up and that's that uh this  has to do with family uh family controls basically like family time controls uh what do they call it  family link is that so each each of my daughters has a chrome book that they use for school and  we have the chrome book so you know they they also get ipads from the schools but most of the time  they end up using their chromebook instead ipads how old-fashioned yeah yeah they're nice you know  they've got a keyboard attachment it's just they they prefer the chromebooks and i'm proud um  however they also have through family link their own tablet right there they're like personal  tablets and of course if they had it their way they'd be on their tablets 24 seven uh i ramped  that down you know my wife and i control that of course but the problem is in family link there is  no way to to tell family link uh school laptop as much time as they need to do their school work  personal tablets just the amount of time that i want to give them so if i so if i set it for  an hour let's say because they only get an hour of tablet time a day then they're in the middle  of a zoom meeting on their on their chromebook and an hour in it kicks it out and i have to unlock it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and there's no easy way to do it what router do you use because you could also control that like  most internet routing software you can actually do it by device so you could create a profile for  your daughters put their devices that are their tablets under that idea that's a good it's probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  something built into your sonic mobile app oh wait do you have no i'm on comcast now comcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  oh so they do that so comcast under xfinity wi-fi if you pay for that and you're using their wi-fi  they let you create a family profile it's called xfi yep i've seen it in my app and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  their app is actually quite good like that oh okay so it's comcast business not comcast xfinity so  we don't have that however i do have the euro and the euro is okay you can totally totally have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah okay yeah do you do you know how to do that because i can tell you i'm sure it's i mean i off

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the top of my head i'm i'm guessing it's in the settings and probably pretty easy i never thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to go that route i wanted to stay with the google go to the plus and add a profile and then that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  how you're going to do it perfect that's great and then i would just add it for the tablets

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  specifically i would create whatever for your girls because if you create a profile for each of them  and then add the device because like i don't know if they have phones or if you want them not to  have access to and then you could just swap things out based on how you feel about right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  their access to things that's a good tip why didn't i think of that and of course i'm  we're coming up with this right now as they're on their last couple of days of spring break  and then they actually return to in-person school here in a couple of days that's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we figured it out yeah you can still do it for grounding because like with the euro because it's  tied into amazon echo you can always just say turn off so-and-so's you know jane's profile

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and then boom it just shuts everything down wow you're tough you're a tough love i know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  don't mess with stacy that's great thank you i'm so excited i could help you jason i know it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  season you know great i'm sure it does something you know well it does as much as a cloth filter

Transcript:  looks like mad max meets adidas um but it's like a google daydream viewer but for your mouth  yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but i was thinking about this and i'm like you know what if we go into a culture where we wear masks  all the time the fact that it's got the earbuds it's got an integrated microphone in there so  you could like and i'm thinking maybe not for like walking around the grocery store but what if you're  sitting in your office you know and you've got to wear your mask all day yeah this actually doesn't  this is i wouldn't mind the ventilation so i i'm just throwing that out there is do i think it's  gonna be i mean i would not wear it but it's not as crazy as it seems although i wish well i am  would focus on weak that's all why wouldn't you wear it why wouldn't i wear it right because i  think it is hideously ugly and also yeah mostly because i think i don't want that that looks like  something's attacking your face it just maybe it's comfortable and if it is i might change my mind

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's also it has it definitely has a gamer aesthetic to it yeah yeah it feels like to me

Transcript:  here so and what you got um i have a couple things and the first thing i i like to tell people to if  you can avoid it stop taking painkillers i know people have aches and pains but um painkillers  can can be quite addictive and lead to a whole host of problems and uh i had my hip replaced  several years ago and and battled with pain management and things like that but i found a  couple different ways to try to manage pain and this here is something that i got my hands on  fairly recently i was hoping i could do a review about it but i figured you know what i can at  least give them a shout out and it's the lumar care duo i have it here in this in my studio  this is a really nice device um and it uses lasers to help manage pain i talked about this on my  previous show hands-on wellness being able to use lasers and other types of pain management devices  to actually you know activate the nerves and the proteins and cells inside of your body to help  manage pain to keep you from just popping pills because all those pills are doing is just tricking  your brain they're not healing anything um and they're just giving you more of an addiction  opportunity but this thing is pretty intuitive works for for muscles and skin and joint pain  it's got three different settings here you just toggle through and you can do treatments five  minutes at a time it's not something that you do you know for 20 minutes half an hour anything like  that just do this a couple times a day um i've tried it out because i battle with the wrist and  forearm issues because i do a lot of push-ups and i carry cameras all day and eventually my grip gets  weak and i found that just playing with this for the last several weeks does make a difference and  then you can see it automatically shuts off if it's idle so yeah this this is this is a pretty  slick device so shout out to luma care for again trying to get people to stop taking so many dad  gum pain pills and allowing these pharmaceutical companies to just consider continue to profit  off of us and turn us into low-end drug users yeah and lastly my well secondly my other picks are  go watch my show hands-on photography tv slash hop spend a lot of fun had a couple interviews i have  another interview coming up really soon that i i can't wait for y'all to check it out but my last  one i talked with mr freddy clark about food photography and beverage photography and this  man just does some amazing work and a lot of is just based on lighting and just how you set up your  lights and i'm still not quite there yet but i'm getting close i'm going to figure out one of these  days and uh also in that episode we alluded to a workshop that i've been invited to and that is  the wanderers photo excursion and that's wanderers photo.com myself mr andrew scrivani mr steve  brasil mr freddy clark we are all going to be your instructors for this workshop in new orleans  i will be focusing more on street photography as well as cityscapes and part of the street  photography we have a second line band in new orleans that's going to be there and allow us to  to do a shoot of them as they march through the streets of new orleans just doing their thing  with their instruments and that's going to be a lot of fun a lot of energy to capture through  your lens and i can't wait that's in october so go ahead and get yourself registered and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah absolutely and you know one plus has long been the value brand there's a lot of people  wondering if maybe that value brand identity is uh is on the way out with their phones you know  because their phones keep getting more and more expensive but definitely it seems like with the  with the wearable at that price 159 dollars they offer a lot um within this smartwatch so  these are available now so with no where else right they yeah i believe they announced um no  where os this this is running android but they're not officially you know it's not officially running  where os google's where oh i see so it is android os okay interesting yeah yeah yeah absolutely and  yeah available for purchase april 14th so i have obviously have the screen set oh yeah see i've got  my music and i could stream that through to my my headphones and it looks snappy too yeah yeah it's  a nice i gotta say it's a it's a sharp looking design it's um not bad and especially for 159  dollars so i'm going to be doing a full review of this for hands-on tech next week uh is is my hope  um so uh yeah i guess that's what we call a tease more more coming on this at some point next week  but uh you can you can purchase it yourself uh april 14th if you want to get in on it that's  exactly a month or sorry a week away from today so uh yeah the one plus watch there you are at 59  dollars not a bad price all right and that's uh that's what i got and i think that's what we got  i think we're at the end of this episode of this week in google always a lot of fun thank you uh  thank you all for uh let me uh crash the party and and sit always a pleasure sir always yes  lovely to have you back thank you uh jeff what do you what do you want to leave people with  buzz machine.com anything else just beware beware of the moral panics and not just one of them not
