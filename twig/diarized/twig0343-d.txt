Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, all the technicians who need to actually do the work, I just emailed all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We can help defray the costs maybe.  Much excitement.  Yeah, if it costs anything.  That should be okay.  Yeah.  Very excited.  Wouldn't that be fun?  Yeah.  Also with us, Aaron Newcomb. Great to see you again from NetApp and of course, regular on Floss Weekly and all about Android.  Glad to be here.  He brought some projects as he always does.  Yes.  You never stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't.  This is why things never get documented.  If anybody, people are always asking me after the show.  Right up the blog post.  Yeah. Where's the instructable? Where's this? Where's that? I'm like, you don't understand.  That's done and I've moved on to three other things.  I kind of like that.  So, just get it done.  I'm done.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Big news just at press time, as they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Raky news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do they do? They call down to the, they stop the presses.  We've got to, we've got to rack it up and relay the, play the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is it they say?  I only got, I only got to yell stop the presses once in my career.  Really?  Did I tell that story?  No.  So, the San Francisco Examiner, Sunday edition, there were two pictures.  One was of the California Condor.  One was of the Pope.  The captions got switched.  So, under the Pope it said, soon to be an endangered species.  Stop the presses!  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And how come you got to do that? Were you a?  I was a Sunday editor.  Editor Pro Tem? Oh, I didn't know that. You edited the Sunday paper?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, we had the Sunday news and so we had, they chipped off the caption literally so they could get the presses back on.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You mean like with a chisel?  Basically, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were still using hot lead?  No, no, no. This was, but this was, they had plates.  Plates were, you know, metal that stood up so you just tamped the metal down and there was aluminum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. That's kind of cool.  That's really cool.  So, there was no caption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have, no, I have old plates. Let's see if you can see this.  Oh, I'd love to see this.  See that, that coffee table back there?  That's made of plates?  That's two newspaper plates.  No.  Very heavy.  Very, very heavy.  Oh, that is so neat.  That's cool.  Lead that thick.  Yeah.  That's, that's, then they switched to aluminum.  Wow, that's really cool.  Newspaper geekdom.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You saw the very sad post in, was it Bill Moyer's blog?  About.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He didn't write it, but yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But all the journos who are gone, you know, out of, and most of them, because as these newspapers close and they're, they're folding right and left, most of them are middle-aged and they're just not getting another job.  What happens, it's a Dale Maha-Ridge's article, what happens to journalists when no one wants to print their words anymore?  And most of them are, you know, ending up doing something else, PR, or if they're lucky PR, they're not so lucky working on a hot dog cart.  Wow, look at that sad picture too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was on a paper folded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Rocky Mountain News, February 27th, 2009, 150 year old daily paper shut down, 200 staffers lost their jobs.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That is a very.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What did I hijack us into the unhappy past?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not the past.  That's the sad thing.  It's the present.  Yeah.  Papers are closing right and left and there's not a lot of places for these talented journalists to go, is there?  What do you tell your kids when you read an article like this?  You're teaching kids to be journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they're 90% of them get employed within six months because they do the new stuff.  They're doing entrepreneurial journalism, social journalism, and they're using all the new tools and they're going to new places like Vox and BuzzFeed and Fusion and Courts and those kinds of places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've seen, of course, this is the story of technology and of the Internet in particular is that businesses change and fail and rejigger themselves.  And I'm sure the similar scenes played out at Kodak.  Yeah.  You know, but this one really, I don't know, for some reason, it's really affected me.  But, you know, it's happening everywhere.  It's happening at Disney.  Disney, good friend, laid off at Disney because Disney decided to replace all of their engineers with H1B visa people they've imported.  They were cheaper.  And the sad thing is they were kept on for six months to train their replacement.  Right.  If they want the severance, you got to stick around and train your replacement.  That is horrible.  That's not supposed to work that way, by the way.  Oh, is that against the law or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You have to have a need.  You have to say, we can't fill this position with another guy.  So we're going to apply for the visa and then you get it.  But you have to prove that you looked and you couldn't find the guy or girl that you needed.  And then you can get the visa.  But it's definitely not supposed to be a wholesale replacement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The story is, of course, that Disney doesn't do it themselves.  They hire companies that do this.  And of course, there are many lawsuits.  Here's an article from last month in The Times.  Lawsuits claim Disney colluded to replace U.S. workers with immigrants.  But Keith Barrett, who's a good friend of the shows and comes by all the time, he was very proud that he worked at Disney.  He was an IT guy, but he and 250 others of his colleagues fired and replaced.  Because what Disney does, as many companies do, they go to a consultant company that hires foreign workers on H-1B visas to displace them.  And so Disney is just outsourcing its IT.  It's not Disney's fault, they say.  It's very sad.  And the other sad thing is, and it talks about this in the article, is that many of these displaced workers applied for other jobs at Disney.  In this case, one of the women who was training a replacement applied for 150 other jobs at Disney and did not get one.  It seems like they should have had some priority, but apparently not.  So there's a big lawsuit going on.  Anyway, yeah, that's a downer. Let's talk about something happy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fee, fi, foe, foe. I smell the blood of a newspaper bun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is what happens. This is the kind of displacement that...  But I think it's important for us as we celebrate technology and celebrate the Internet and the new economy that we understand that there's a very human cost to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All the more important for companies and even individual professionals to invest in their own future as best they can and be aware of what's happening.  There's a reality to deal with.  And I don't mean to sound cold hearted, I'm not, but it's...  Well, it is the reality.  It does no good to ignore the reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if you're a young person coming up, it does a lot of good to think about what you're choosing.  We did a great interview on Triangulation about a month ago about the professions, because I think it's always been thought,  well, if you're a doctor, a lawyer, an accountant, you're not at risk.  And of course, they are also at risk.  But in a different way, the jobs aren't disappearing, but they're changing significantly.  What does expertise mean in an era where you've got Watson?  Speaking of which, did you see the Google Go computer won its first game yesterday?  Oh, I didn't see that.  We should be watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is about the most boring video ever created though.  It's an exciting moment, but the video is stultified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's a slow game.  And I love Go. I play chess.  And of course, we've seen this happen years ago.  We saw this happen with chess, but it was always thought, well, chess is one thing, but Go, Go's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The difference is that you can calculate every possible move at every move in chess and you can't with Go.  Right.  Is that the difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could. It's just a much more complicated computationally.  And so there are many, many, many, many, many more options in Go.  But presumably at some point you can make a machine with enough RAM and enough processor power to do the calculations.  In this case, AlphaGo, which is the program Google developed, didn't in fact look at all the moves.  It used intuition, aka.  Intuition?  It used previous experience.  Previous experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they had this thing playing itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  They played as humans.  They played as humans.  Yeah.  And of course, computers have beaten good amateur players.  But this was Lee Sedol, who was one of the top professional Go players.  He's not. He's the explainer, I think.  Not that guy.  The little screen.  Yeah.  Lee is a nine dan Go player, which if you know Go is very good.  I mean, Grandmaster Plus.  It's a $1 million prize, a five game match.  So I think, I don't know if game two is today, but yesterday on game one, he was beaten.  He said, I was very surprised.  I didn't expect to lose.  I didn't think AlphaGo would play the game in such a perfect manner.  Wow.  What's interesting is AlphaGo made a bad move early on.  And Go, more than chess maybe even, is a game of emotions and intimidation.  And normally if a player, a human, makes such a bad move early on, he gets demoralized and he's easier to beat.  And Lee said, that didn't phase the computer.  It just kept on playing.  And in fact, played a game, a move towards the end of the game.  Lee said, I never thought it was even possible.  Such an unexpected game, a move that he said, I would never have foreseen this.  This is the 19 by 19 board that they play on.  One player is black, obviously.  One player is white.  The idea is to occupy territory by surrounding the other player's pieces.  It's a beautiful game and a simple game.  Why does it keep doing that?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It hasn't started yet or something.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just fast forward.  Lee's thinking right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm captivated.  No, not at the end.  You'll see.  You'll be at the end when you have all the pieces or many of the pieces.  The board will be full.  Yeah, there you go.  So what you're trying to do is occupy territory.  And the game ends when there's no more to occupy.  So a human obviously is moving the piece for AlphaGo.  I don't regret accepting this challenge, said Lee.  I am in shock.  I admit that.  But what's done is done.  I enjoy this game and look forward to the next.  I think I failed in the opening layout.  So if I do better on the opening aspect, I think I'll be able to increase my probability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, one game is not evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it is and it is.  The fact that a computer could beat a 9-dan player in any game at any time is phenomenal.  So today, Saturday, Sunday, and Tuesday at 11 p.m. Eastern the night before.  So tonight, I think at 11 p.m. Eastern or 8 p.m. Pacific.  Huge.  And if it wins the match, then it's even huger, to coin a phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's huger.  Huger.  So this, what is it, Fan Hui, is a European champion.  So I'm assuming he...  That was the last one.  He is not a professional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was just a very good amateur.  Lee is 9-dan, which is as good as it gets.  This is, I mean, this is big.  This is equivalent.  It's not like beating the world champion.  I don't even know if there is a world champion.  There must be a world champion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there is.  I think on the radio, Lee, yesterday, this guy was, if you had to rank it, you know,  like you do normal stuff.  He's like 8 or something.  They said 4.  4 in the world.  But I'm just wondering, having studied a little bit of Asian culture, whether this is, how  demoralizing this is.  I mean, this is not, you can't say it's base here.  Yeah, it was a big deal in chess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was a very serious chess player and tournament player.  It was a big deal in chess when deep thought, IBM's Deep Blue computer beat the world champion.  It was initially demoralizing.  It was like stop playing the game, demoralizing.  Like, what's the point?  And then humans got over it and in fact play better and harder than ever before.  And now they use computers very heavily in preparation.  You're not obviously allowed to use during the game.  But in training, it's really a big deal.  So the matches tonight.  Yeah.  11 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In some ways, I'm still more impressed by jeopardy because I'm stupid about this stuff.  But be jeopardy is hard in some ways, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the linguistic layers.  Right.  Yeah.  This is kind of a classic computer problem like chess is.  Chess is solvable.  Chess, you can, you know, there are almost infinite number of positions, but computers  are able to calculate so deeply that they can pretty much make the perfect move every time.  If you apply enough power to it.  Go is 19 by 19.  There are many, many more possibilities.  It's very deep game, very difficult game.  Although I always thought Go would be not so difficult to crack because it's pattern focused.  And computers are good at pattern matching, but not as good as humans.  Humans are the kings.  So this would be this was for a long time thought to be insolvable.  Like, no, like this isn't going to happen.  No computer. But that's we know that that's not so add to journalists and Disney I.T.  and go masters.  You're out.  Get a new gig.  I'm sorry. That was mean.  And when we come back, there's some breaking news that I said we would talk about.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We're going to talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're going to talk about it.  But when I come back, yeah, I don't know if goes older than chess.  I think I'm pretty sure it's a lot of it.  Yeah, it's a very simple game.  It's a beautiful game.  And as serious as I was about playing chess, I always found Go extremely challenging because, you know, there's there's not different kinds of pieces.  There's one kind of piece and it's all about strategy.  Well, so is chess.  It's it's just hard.  It's a very hard game.  Really amazing.  I should point out, though, that there's still calculation.  It's about calculation.  This is something computers are good at.  Probably you're right, Jeff.  In some ways, playing Jeopardy well is harder.  And in fact, I don't think I think there were a lot of.  Caveats in Watson's win in Jeopardy, right?  Like they helped it out a lot.  Chris, I think about the chess about the deep blue.  Our show today is brought to you by Atlassian.  I don't know if you're a programmer.  I don't have to say anything more.  You know, Atlassian.  Behind every great human achievement is a team mapping the genome, 3D printing, space exploration, renewable energy or planning your next off site team.  How do you bring everyone together to build what's next with Atlassian?  We've used Atlassian in many ways.  We use Jira when we were designing our website.  We used HipChat.  We still use HipChat all the time to meet.  We have about eight or nine HipChat channels.  What's neat about HipChat is it supports, of course, lots of integrations.  And we had installed a little bot that tells us now when services are down.  In fact, we told one of our partners that their service was down for 10 minutes last night.  They said, oh, we didn't know.  We said you should be running HipChat in Atlassian.  You can you can assign, track and manage tasks for any project with Jira.  That's what we use for the website was really great.  You can create and share content, organize results, bring team members up to speed with Confluence.  You can get instant messages or video chat with your team from any device with HipChat.  You could test, review and manage code in real time.  That's Bitbucket.  Atlassian is the king of this stuff.

Unleash the potential in your team and build what's next.  So about an hour ago, this was like a shocking announcement.  The Android beta of N became available not just for developers, but for anybody using a Nexus device.  So if you were using, if you have a Nexus 6, a Nexus 9 tablet, a 5X, a 6P, a Nexus player or,  and this is an interesting one, the Pixel C. I know you do, Jeff. I do too.  It's time to put N on. Is N Nutella?  What did Hiroshi say?  He said, we're not saying.  We're not saying.  I thought Nougat.  Not downloading right now.  I thought Nougat would be a good one.  Oh, nice. You're a brave man. That's on your Nexus 6.  That's on my Nexus 6. My big old Nexus 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this the one you're moving to PHY?  It's already on PHY.  Oh, nice.  As we speak. For now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's a big, big change besides the fact that it's not just for developers, it's an over the air update.  That is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice and easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One click, done.  Yes. So you go to Android.com. I'm sorry, Google.com slash Android slash beta.  And then if you go with you logged into your account, you'll see which devices you have that are eligible.  You see I can and then you have to enroll that device in the beta.  So I can I don't I'm definitely going to do the pixel because one of the things that's cool about this is split screen, which the pixel really could use.  That would make it up.  That might by itself make the pixel be the device.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And anytime you're using Android on a in a desktop fashion, right, like I've done with this little thing here.  Right.  You miss the windowing.  You absolutely miss the windowing.  So side by side is going to be great.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll do it on my pixel.  You're going to you're doing it in your six.  So you this must have been your experience.  So I said enroll.  It says device enroll.  A system update will soon be offered.  So you got that right away.  That comes right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you're done.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could check to see if an update is pending by downloading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's still downloading.  Yeah.  It's eight hundred fifty megs.  It's not that big.  It's not giving me any progress bar.  So I'm a little worried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Eight hundred fifty megs.  That's small.  Why is that so small?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's about right.  Is it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's about what's still sitting there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So questions, answers, Hiroshi Lockheimer, who's the head of the Android team, wrote  a medium post, not a Google Plus post.  Sorry, kids.  Yeah.  Another nail in the coffin.  Well, we'll be getting to that later.  And yeah, actually, there's some interesting there's Google Plus News.  And as in not so early, it's not named yet.  A lot of people thinking Nutella, but that's a commercial name.  I think Nougat.  Well, they've done it before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Kit Kat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true.  Nut roll.  Nut roll.  That's not a dessert.  That's a thing.  What is a nut roll?  Well, they've had candy bars.  Somebody says Nestle Road.  I don't even know what a Nestle Road is.  Nougat.  I think Nougat.  Yeah.  I like Nougat.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He said it's not...  What did he say?  It's not ready yet?  It's the last line.  Probably the last line.  All right.  Going all the way down to the end, he says, so the burning question that's on everyone's  mind, what will the end release be named?  We're Nut.  Tell me.  Yeah.  That's the top highlight.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is big.  I'm just stunned.  This, presumably, timing-wise would be Google I.O. would be here's what's new in it.  Yep.  So to do this now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So you've got all these developers in the room who have N.  Who have it.  Who are able to start playing with it.  Does that take the wind out of the sails or does that make...  No.  That makes I.O. yet more developer-oriented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It means maybe they'll ship it at I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  And they must feel very confident about it to roll it out this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are the features that we know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, this is the earliest preview yet, according to Hiroshi.  You'll be able to act on the feedback while still being able to hand off the final and  release the device makers this summer so they can get their hands on it.  So for fall, like in your new...  So they won't release it at I.O. then?  No.  Let me see.  I'm not sure what's new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's multi-windows, which is the one we already talked about.  There's also direct reply notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Direct reply.  Oh, so when you get a notification, you can...  But a lot of the third-party manufacturers...  The third-party ones.  The OEMs have been doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The third-party apps.  There's also bundling notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  So you got 23 notifications.  Right.  It doesn't show up in a big list.  It's like right there.  Oh, yay.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's good.  You'll get an update every four to six weeks until the public launch of N. It could take  as long as 24 hours to get...  So here's the timeline.  Yeah, they say preview updates March, April, May, June, July, and the final release in  Q3.  So they have a pretty clear roadmap of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think the rationale here is they're going to get a hell of a lot more feedback  on it as they're...  Oh, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's wonderful.  But as you said, they also must feel very confident.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because this isn't a limited rollout to certain developers.  Half the world's going to do this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, real play.  If you've got a Nexus phone, this is why...  You know what?  This is a big selling point for a Nexus phone.  I was switching over to my new Galaxy S7 and then I thought, well, maybe I...  Hold on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe I should go back.  Didn't they give a discount on the Nexus?  Was it five?  Yeah, all Christmas they were saving 50 bucks.  Because...  Oh, on the fight.  150 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't need an invitation anymore.  If you buy a phone, they'll say, oh, you want to put five on this?  Right.  And it comes delivered with five, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's interesting that the Nexus player is getting this too.  Yeah, that's a little weird, isn't it?  Because why would you want any of...  Notifications don't care on a Nexus player.  So those two features are out.  Split screen probably don't care because you got the lean back experience that may not  even work on the...  I'm curious why, what is in there that's going to help Nexus player?  I moved off the default operating system for Nexus player and I'm using somebody else's  mod because it's so much better just to run stock Android.  But I don't know, maybe I'll go back and back it up and try this because I'm curious, what  could there possibly be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  150 bucks off when you buy a Nexus 5X and that can...  Although the 6P is really the phone that you want.  Is there a deal on the 6P?  I think.  I haven't seen it.  It's a little big.  Maybe people don't want as big of a screen.  So Dieter Bohne has been playing with N over there at The Verge.  He said, we just finished flashing the preview just to kick the tires and beak under the  hood.  Everything is zipping around the screen much faster than we're used to.  Animation speeds radically sped up, but there also seems to be very high level of care dedicated  to the movement of basic OS elements.  How does split screen multitasking work?  Pretty well.  You operate it by holding down your finger on the top of a window in the main multitasking  view and dragging it up to a highlighted area.  Once you do, the other half gives you a second view to pick another app.  Kind of how Samsung works.  Samsung, you go into recents and if the app supports split window, it'll have a special  icon which you tap.  Once there, you can adjust the splitter up or down in portrait mode or left and right  landscape.  And this worked with third party apps like Twitter that weren't built for it.  Interesting.  Although Android has of late really been focusing on screen resolution independence, right?  That's kind of built in.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, chat room saying picture in picture for Nexus player.  So that makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, that's the two windows.  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And especially if that goes out to the TV manufacturers as well.  It makes a lot of sense.  Right.  So if you're watching TV, you got, you know, SportsCenter up here and then you're watching  The Martian or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dieter says some crashes here and there when we were messing around, but overall it's much  more solid than you'd expect for an early preview.  But that's important to know if you're thinking of putting it on your main devices.  You just did, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm not.  I put it on my Nexus 6.  Oh, OK.  6P.  Oh, good.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm not crazy.  You know me.  I'll come whining to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, working.  Quick settings have changed.  There's a short row of icons at the top of the notification shade.  That's always been there.  Hitting one of those buttons will directly toggle Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or whatever.  But pull it down farther, you can change what appears in quick settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there an app drawer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, people were rumored.  The rumor was there's an app drawer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course there is.  I haven't seen that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure.  It's halfway through downloading.  I finally found the status bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Main settings also refreshed.  Each line shows more information now.  There's a suggested area for settings that Android thinks you want to pay attention to.  Notifications, much more information dense, almost to the point of distraction, says Dieter  Bohn.  It does mean you can get a lot more done in there.  That's the quick reply feature.  And other nice bits and bobs.  For example...  What about Google Now?  It doesn't say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't used Now on Tap hardly at all.  I hardly ever do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if that's because Now on Tap isn't that useful or just because...  Whenever you have a new interface feature like that, you gotta kind of remember it.  Yeah, that's the problem.  Wow.  Big news.  So if you have one of the...  Oh, there is an app drawer.  Yeah.  Of course there's an app drawer.  That was a non-starter to begin with.  There's no way...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no marketing image that somebody...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was badly done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They forgot the app drawer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They must giggle there.  Oh, he put a pedic through the gate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And also, if you didn't like that, you just use one of the third party launchers, of which  there are many, and they'll have an app drawer.  I can't imagine them doing that.  So it would be nutty to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or it could be an option, right?  Could be an option in the settings, you want the app drawer or not.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exciting news.  Whatever it goes, I'll...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to run home and get my Pixel C. Of all days, I normally have the 6P with me, but  of course now I'm doing the Galaxy.  By the way, I still love this, but a word of warning if you buy the Galaxy S7, it's slippery.  It's like a little fish in your hands, and I've already cracked it twice now.  Geez.  Which I have never done...  I haven't cracked a phone in years, but it hit on the sidewalk, and you see that?  This back, which is heavily shellacked, I guess, cracks very easily.  And so there's a nice big...  Oh, wow.  Yeah, it's like a mirror.  And I have another crack down here, a scrape or something.  I don't know even...  Better the back than the front.  Well, the funny thing is, of course I ordered a case.  I don't...  Although this is a phone you'd love to keep out of the case.  It's so pretty.  But of course I ordered a case, because I got the phone so much earlier than the normal.  The case is going to come Friday, a little too late.  But yeah, I'll just put in a case, and I won't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Last night on All About Android, Flo talked about how her...  Hers was cracked too.  Yeah, on the front by the home button.  Her screen was scratched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is a very fragile phone.  I love it.  It's still my favorite Android phone I've ever used.  The camera is mind-boggling.  So I've seen some of the reviewers...  All the reviews came out yesterday.  I see some of the reviewers say, oh, it's as good as an iPhone.  No.  It's like 10 times better than an iPhone.  You heard it here.  Not even close.  Yeah, some people found negatives that I just did not agree with.  And yes, of course the iFixit folks tore it down and said, this is unrepairable.  They gave it a 3 out of 10, which I thought was generous.  They said, we don't see how you could replace a cracked screen.  It's all glued.  They said repairs will break it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw a teardown that went through how they water-resisted it.  Yeah, that was cool, wasn't it?  Yeah, did you see that?  Yeah.  They talked about all the gaskets they put around the power button and the USB and all  that kind of stuff and where all of the features were.  Oh my goodness, look at that.  We are ready to go.  Oh yeah.  Jason.  Jason's a kitten on the keys.  You can see the water test strip there.  There's three of them in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's three water test strips.  And the phone, we now know, if the charger port is moist, we'll say, it's wet in there,  don't plug it in.  Which is good.  Yeah, it's just what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's kind of surprising how little you need to do to get that water resistance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, why didn't they do that before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Water doesn't want to go in there by nature anyway, so you just need a little bit of...  Seal that sucker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know that was a big deal and people were really upset that the S6 didn't have waterproofing.  I don't know.  What, are people dropping the toilet a lot?  Is that what's going on?  Yeah.  I'm pretty good with my phones.  I rarely break or drop them.  This was a little bit sad and it was only because this is so slippery.  I mean, I would not have dropped it.  So what were you doing when you dropped it?  I thought I'd put it in my pocket and either it didn't go in all the way or something because  I wasn't bending over or anything.  I just got in the car and I heard clatter, clatter, clatter.  Then I looked and I couldn't see it and I thought, oh God.  It was out in the street.  I snagged it before a car ran over it.  But it hit this corner and it shattered the glass.  It's almost like glass.  It shattered whatever this is, it's a little shattered and then it's cracked across.  You can feel it.  It's rough there.  But a case will cover that up.  And you know what?  You need a case on this because this edge, you hit it all the time.  Every time I give my phone to Lisa to show or something, it launches a different program  because you can barely hold this thing without tapping the screen somehow because the screen  is all the way around, which makes it beautiful.  It's an interesting form over function where it's really about how gorgeous.  I mean, it's a gorgeous phone.  So the case that I got from Casemate will go over around it, cover it up, protect it.  And I wish I had it.  It's a sign of old age, says Hobie in the chat room.  Yeah, you start dropping things.  Then you forget where they are.  Where did I leave my phone?  Where did I leave my pants?  That's what I feel like.  I've got a cortisone shot in my finger.  Oh yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're kind of like a little spacey.  Look at that.  Look at what they did to me.  Wow.  What did they do that for?  He's all bruised on his webbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They hit a vein, a vessel.  And it's all numb.  I can't type either.  I can't type.  I can't type.  I can't type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't type.  I can't type.  I can't type either.  So if I'm a little slow, it's not my fault.  Why did they give you cortisone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have tennis elbow?  Trigger finger, that's what they're saying.  Trigger finger.  You're shooting too much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm working in the shop too much.  I'm working in the maker space too much.  And so my finger will ...  Wow.  It catches ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I've had that.  It's hell getting old.  He's not even old.  That's a sad thing.  He's a young man.  A little preview for you, man.  They say it's more common in people with diabetes.  And I'm a type 1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a type 2.  I'm a type 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a type 4.  I'm a type 5.  I'm more common in people with diabetes.  And I'm a type 1 diabetic.  Oh, there you go.  Sure.  So I've gotten out.  I'm not getting old.  I've got diabetes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm getting old and I have diabetes.  I've got the diabetes.  I've got Tae-Soo now.  The diabetes.  Are you really?  Yeah.  Really?  So I'm really trying to cure myself by eating better and losing weight.  I lost 30 pounds.  I'm working hard to get back to normal.  Because now the doctor said, it's a cascade.  They kept giving you other drugs.  Now he says, well, we really should put you on statins.  No, I don't want to be on statins.  Me neither.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I say that every time.  Tell me every time.  I'm like, no way.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  David Agus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  David Agus, you know, doctor of the stars.  He's the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody should be on statins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says it's because of him.  He personally said to me, I have all these things that are about inflammation.  And he said, why the hell aren't you on it?  It's about the inflammation.  Take them.  And I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?  And you don't have bad side effects?  No.  He wrote a book.  He was a Steve Jobs doctor, although that's not really a good recommendation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, he's the guy who tried to fix things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a little late, I guess.  Yeah, exactly.  He wrote a book called The End of Illness, which I own.  And it turns out the whole book is take statins.  And don't take vitamins.  And don't take vitamins.  So what am I doing?  Taking a lot of vitamins and no statins.  David, who also advised me personally on my prostate situation is the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, you got a good doctor, dude.  He's, well, that's the whole...  I'm very grateful.  He's the world's nicest guy.  I see him at Davos.  Doesn't he do Obama, too?  He does a lot, a lot, a lot of people.  And he also did Robin Quivers.  And Will.i.am?  Robin Quivers had cancer.  And she had a huge, really bad, bad thing.  And Howard Stern got a hold of David and said, please help, my dear friend is dying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he advised her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he's amazing doctor.  He's just a great guy.  And he's just a great guy.  And I'm very grateful.  I'm very grateful.  And I'm very grateful.  And I'm very grateful.  And I'm very grateful.  And I'm very grateful.  And I'm very grateful.  And I'm very grateful.  But anyway, yeah, he says take statins.  And don't take vitamins.  Yeah, I don't remember what the full rationale is of the vitamins.  I stopped because of him, but I can't remember what the rationale was.  I think his numbers.  It's all data with him.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, data also says you shouldn't eat every other day.  You know that, right?  That's the newest thing is fast every other day.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do intermittent fasting.  Well, he argues strenuously that you have to be on a regular schedule of food.  Oh, see.  Nobody...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why we don't know what to do because nobody agrees.  Right, Dr. Mom?  People on a healthy diet don't need vitamins, she says.  I'm on a healthy diet.  I don't mind expensive urine.  I feel like that's...  I've earned that right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This week in your health.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What were we talking about before we got on that?  Being old.  Can we rewind?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to talk about the Google Doodle.  It was young Aaron and his finger.  And his finger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fickle finger of fate.  So, have you seen the Google Doodle today?  It's awesome.  I couldn't get it to work.  It's maybe the anniversary of the theremin or something?  I don't know.  So, you get theremin lessons.  She says, please repeat after me.  And then you do it.  Lesson two.  Now she's going to do a little more.  By the way, you have to apparently go through this.  You don't have the theremin lesson in order to play the theremin.  Which we'll be able to do as soon as I...  I've done this on a different machine.  I hope they save a cookie.  So there I've done the three notes.  And now there's one last.  G, F sharp, B, E, D.  So let's see if I can master the theremin.  G, F sharp, B, E, D.  And now she's going to play a little song for us.  Theremin, inevitably sounds like a science fiction movie.  Yeah.  Who invented it?  Was it Tesla who invented this?  Who invented the theremin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a graphic that comes up at the end to find out about her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, she's the famous theremin player.  Not a great instrument.  Leon, of course, Leon.  Leon theremin.  Oh, the guy's name was theremin.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know Moog used it a lot.  He started in that before.  And that was Clara Rockmore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who does not rock, in fact.  She inspired Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones, however.  A pioneer in electronic music and a theremin master.  And today is her 105th birthday.  And if you want to hear...  It's the eekiest doodle ever.  ...more of her music, it is in fact on Google Play.  Here we go.  The Clara Rockmore.  She was a Lithuanian virtuoso of the theremin.  What do you want to hear?  A little Bach Suite for Orchestra?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Berk just pointed out the Star Trek theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah, yeah.  Now remember, this is before Moog.  This is before Frippertronix.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This was done in the air between the two...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so the way it works is your hand...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got to go back to the page because I want to...  I hope it remembers that I had my lessons.  It doesn't.  Oh, man.  Oh, it doesn't?  You got to do it again?  Oh, no.  Son of a gun.  Why does it do that?  You know, maybe we should remember also George Martin, Sir George Martin, who passed away...  Yes, that's true.  ...at the rifle show yesterday.  At the rifle, at the age of 90, of course, he was the fifth Beatle.  I think he was the sixth Beatle because there was already a fifth.  Right, exactly.  But really instrumental not only in signing the Beatles after everyone else had turned  them down, but in helping craft them into the legends that they were.  You know, if you want to hear some of his best work, go see the Love Show in Vegas,  the Cirque du Soleil show.  It's a Beatles show, but he remixed...  He and his son remixed all the old Beatles music and the tapes and stuff they had in  the library to make it the music, and it's incredible.  The Beatles and surround sound.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.  We're wide ranging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we are.  Yeah, we're wandering all over the place.  I like the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how about Google Plus?  Okay.  I'm eager to hear what you think about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So are you talking about the fact that Moot, Chris Poole, the founder of 4chan, is a very  Yes.  Chris Poole, the founder of 4chan, has apparently taken a job at Google working under Bradley  Horowitz, and it's not clear what he's doing.  Chris Bradley is running, what is it called, streams and...  Streams and interests or streams and...  Something weird.  But Moot, some say, I've seen tweets say he's working in the photos part of this, not the  social network.  Although, man, the guy who started 4chan would really be a good person to have working on  the social network, if you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, think about, I've met Moot at a Google event.  The nicest, most unassuming guy you can imagine.  Oh, you can't blame him for slash b slash.  Not at all.  Not at all.  But people, I think, you know, so, just a wonderful, wonderful guy.  And very smart, obviously.  And experienced at where things can go wrong, which is a valuable experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know?  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, if you're doing a social network, I don't know about photos.  Is he a programmer?  What is his...  That's a good question.  What is his skill?  He says, today in his blog, Chris hates writing.  We know that's one thing that is not a skill.  Today I'm excited to announce I've joined Google.  When meeting with current and former Googlers, I continually find myself drawn to their intelligence,  passion, and enthusiasm, as well as a universal desire to share it with others.  I'm also impressed by Google's commitment to enabling these same talented people to  tackle some of the world's most interesting and important problems, yada, yada, yada.  He does mention his own experience from a dozen years of building online communities.  So, gosh, it would be really cool if Google hadn't given up on Google+, and said,  who could we bring in to reinvent this?  Yeah, I was thinking about just the other guy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What would you...  What does the world need?  What could Google Plus be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think an antidote to Twitter is a good start.  So, Twitter was not going away, and we need Twitter.  But what's wrong with Twitter?  Well, one's anonymity, right?  And as long as you have somewhere to do anonymity, you don't have to be...  And so I think the real names policy on Facebook and Google Plus is fine.  So, real names.  And the other thing Twitter does very well is conversations,  which is only really kind of an afterthought on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Groups of people is what they pride themselves on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but boy, that was a flop, I think, because how many...  I mean, circles was a great idea.  It didn't work, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, the other one is interests.  The one thing that didn't work so terribly well was photography.  Why did photography work well?  Just because they had Trey Radcliffe?  Because there was functionality that made it work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing that Trey liked, and I know because I've talked a lot with him about it,  is how they displayed the images.  They displayed them big, they didn't unlike Facebook,  they didn't squinch them down.  But even Trey made sure that he posted not just on Google Plus.  Yeah, he posted everywhere, including Twitter and Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, interests are really the key, I think.  They tried to capitalize on that a little bit,  but I don't think they did it well enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What brings you back to Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For me, I can tell you, it's that because I'm into technology,  and because most of the people on there are into technology,  anytime I want to know anything about what's going on in the Raspberry Pi  or making something or LAPs...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you follow those particular groups? Is that how that happened?  Or I just do a search.  Or just do a search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's just a wealth of knowledge on it.  And I do follow those groups.  So I follow Raspberry Pi, I follow Arduino,  and people that I know that are makers, that I want to see what they're doing.  I do follow those things.  And so when my feed comes up, it's full of stuff that's so interesting to me.  I almost have to avoid it sometimes, because I know as soon as I open it up,  I don't go there as often as I used to.  When I do, I'm going to get stuck there for a couple of hours  because I'm going to be following up on all of these things.  So for me, it still works really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it less engaging?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is a good place if you want Google information.  That kind of stuff. Geek stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Geek stuff. It's great.  I have a board game group that I follow because I like board games.  And people love it for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really the case with Facebook, too.  The more you put into it, the better it is.  I'm getting a lot of spam.  And for some reason, Google, you know, that they surface popular posts  not from people you follow or circles of yours.  And for some reason, the popular posts are all right-wing adjut prop.  They're not even like, you know, just conservative.  I don't mind a conservative post, but they're like horrible.  And I don't know why I keep getting those in my feed.  Is there something I did?  But that's a sure way to get you out of a site, right?  Yeah.  By forcing you to look at something bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem is I basically got about five people I know who are left posting there.  Yeah, Lauren Weinstein is like, that's like 90% of the posts I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he's great.  And Peter Vogel.  There's just like a handful now are still posting there.  Even Mike Elgin, I don't see as much.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Twitter, we'll go back to that for a second if I may.  I found the weirdest thing the last couple of days is suddenly I'm getting less, maybe two weeks, actually.  I start getting tagged in other people's conversations.  I'll tweet something, somebody else retweet it.  And then five people get into a conversation.  And the next five days, I'm getting their conversation until they untag me or they just get tired and move on.  That's recent.  Really?  You didn't use to get that?  Not like this.  Was there any change in the UI in the last few weeks that would make that different?  I can't figure out why suddenly it's happening.  It's happening like crazy.  And are you included as an at tag?  Yeah, I'm included as an at tag.  So they reply, they reply, they reply, they reply.  They end up with four people tagged in it.  And it's a canoe.  It's a right-wing political thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So maybe they're using some sort of plant.  They're harassing you.  No, it's not so much that.  They just go back and forth and back and forth.  Yes, he did.  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, he didn't.  And how would you get rid of it?  Only by muting those people, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't know whether there's some client that they use or that's popular in that world  or what it is, but it's so weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, everybody likes to bait you.  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's not aimed at me even.  They're having their own conversation.  That's why you're in it though.  I'm trapped in the elevator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That doesn't sound like fun.  Can you ignore a conversation or temporarily muted conversation?  That would be a nice feature.  Now we're fixing Twitter again.  Yeah, well.  We tried to fix Google Plus and we switched to Twitter.  That's the problem right there in a nutshell.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm getting nostalgic for Google Plus.  I haven't been in it in a while.  I'm going back in this and it's pretty and it's nice and it's easy.  I really liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If there is a thread to my social network participation going back to 2006,  it's that I always go to the place where threaded conversations flourish.  Because to me, and by the way, nobody wants that's why Twitter has succeeded  and Jai Koo and BuzzFeed and friend Buzz and FriendFeed and Google Plus seem to have all failed  because it's a threaded conversation is like too much info.  And you know that Google knows that because in the most recent redesign,  they kind of hide the thread, right?  You only see one comment that you're rotating through.  It's as if there's no thread here.  That's just the post.  But to me, it's the comments, the threaded comments that are what make.  That's why I liked message boards and forums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I actually like the way they do it because it doesn't always.  Oh, this is interesting.  It doesn't always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He sucked into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just pulling apart a seven segmented display last night.  This is a 14 segment display.  Anyway, that's why I love Google Plus.  I actually like the way they do the comments because before I was feeling on the really popular,  the Mike Elgin post.  You'd get long.  Oh my word.  It was like you get buried in it.  No, this is an improvement.  So it's an improvement for me anyway.  And if I'm really interested in the topic, I will go ahead and click on it and then scroll down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You still know there's a threaded conversation there.  Yeah, I think Google Plus did that pretty well where the post is foremost.  It's visual.  That's one thing that they do very well.  There's always images and the images pop.  They're big.  Yep.  They did that right.  I don't know.  Why did people abandon?  Why didn't people?  Why did Google Plus not succeed?  Circles, I would say as good an idea as that was.  Nobody wants to do it because people couldn't get their friends and family into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically, right?  I mean, they couldn't get them off network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They couldn't get the network.  Yeah, they just couldn't do it.  But this is not, I mean, face this would not be as engaging as Facebook for most people.  Really?  Do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Way more engaging for me, but I'm not a people person.  You know, I don't.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a social network for people who hate people.  Well, yeah, there you go.  You nailed it.  There really is.  That's why you and I and Jeff like it.  Kate from Google.  The commudge is like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you were talking about getting the right wing stuff on your Google Plus.  I get way more on Facebook.  And so I tend to turn it out, turn it off and not go to Facebook because I hate seeing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but in that case, at least for me on Facebook, because I followed all, you know, Cruz and Rubio and Trump,  and I wanted to see those posts and I don't mind those discussions.  What I don't like to be forced and this is what Google Plus and you know what?  It looks like they've stopped doing it.  But you know, the hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The hot was always stuff I did not want to see.  Right.  Sometimes I even say, why is this hot?  It's got three comments and two likes.  Why are you surfacing this in my hot feed?  You know, I don't see him anymore.  So well, I just saw one hot on Google Plus.  Think dragons are a myth.  This tiny real life dragging is causing an upward.  See, I don't want to see that.  I might be hot on Google Plus.  I'm not following this person.  I don't want to see this post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the paradox.  The more people abandon it, the more they need to fill your feed with stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This does have five hundred twenty one pluses.  So that's probably why it's in there.  I don't know.  I you I you would think that Google.  Here's another one trending on Google Plus.  Giant grizzly bear attacks workers in their trucks in terrifying video.  It's exactly what I don't want to be in my Google Plus feed.  Right.  And by the way, this only has thirty three pluses and six comments.  Why is that trending?  Conspiracy Club.  I wouldn't follow Conspiracy Club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's definitely not as terrifying as a dragon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're right.  I was a little bit of a hot thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I almost never did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could turn that off.  Right. Can I turn that off?  Maybe I should turn that off.  I just go to my home.  How do you turn off hot?  Well, I'm on home.  You're on. Yeah.  Can't you used to be you could say turn us push a slider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. That was actually a good feature.  Yeah. I don't know.  It's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, we don't even know how it works anymore.  You see, Google, you know, they're listening.  They're waiting for us to solve this problem.  They're on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're not. We're not.  I'm not solving a single problem for you until you solve the multiple sign in problem.  I'm holding any problem solving hostage.  Leo gives that one.  And I we know problems solutions to tons of problems, but we're not letting them out until you solve that.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's so annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What would so what we're asking is what moot could bring to the table if indeed moot is working on Google plus what he could bring to the table and how he could take his vast knowledge of what makes us online communities work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What were the what were the startups he was working on?  He was working on two that didn't didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there was some irony because even though he's so strongly associated with 4chan 4chan lost money like never made any money.  And so he had to fund it with his own startups and eventually started with retired from Canvas.  Can request.  Oh, Canvas was wasn't that a Google acquisition?  It was a 2014 and that was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What did it do again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's draw quest went out of business 2014 and there was another one I think that he did.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Give it all the hoo ha about identity and Google plus.  I'm interested in have someone who was so much around the notion of anonymity there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it wasn't until 2008 that anybody even knew who moot was Wall Street Journal outed him.  Right.  Cute guy.  Oh, OK.  He's in his 20s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Canvas Networks was a website centered on sharing and remixing media, particularly images that I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was in Canada.  I was I used campus.  I love everything.  Canvas was cool.  I didn't realize it went out of business.  So it just shows you I hadn't used it in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It had funding from Anderson Horowitz, SBA, Joel Lehrer, Hippo founder and Joshua Schachter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good people.  Schachter, of course, from delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it was an image board that allows all Wikipedia that allows for anonymous anonymous sharing and commenting on media as well as the remixing of posted images and the adding the music to animated GIFs.  Interesting.  All right.  So this becomes really interesting.  If you try to take just a static photo thing in an age of gifts and remixing where photos still are.  Google photo is the killer.  What if you really amped up Google photo with the ability to share things more and do things more things to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's reasonable to assume that Google realizes that the visual element is the is the reason that Google Plus had as much traction as it did.  And we've just talked about that and they extracted photos from it.  So maybe putting some sort of visual element back in or support for visual back in.  I just realized something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I was holding on to the fact that I was a Google Plus user for all that time and I wouldn't switch over because of the damn two accounts.  Yeah, I count now what I'll care.  Now I will go ahead and switch over everything.  Yeah, I'll switch over to apps.  Well, as they fix it so much as I can, I'll move over.  Fixed it because you don't care anymore.  Yeah, I don't care.  Whatever was going to lose.  I don't care anymore.  So I'll just move it over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is some good stuff in here, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mine is always filled with good stuff.  I think this format is a little bit of a problem.  Restart and install.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here we go.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going nutty, buddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seven seconds.  Six seconds.  Fluff or nutter.  Four seconds.  Three seconds.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Power off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here it goes.  Into inland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're off to inland.  Never, never land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did we talk about PHY opening up, by the way?  We didn't, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you've been waiting because you thought you needed an invite, we talked off the air.  But you can now buy a Nexus phone and get PHY with it.  In fact, you'll get a discount on a Nexus 5X.  Which I think PHY is...  You're a PHY user?  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because my phone is on the corporate plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have been getting...  My 6P is on PHY.  My 6 was before that.  It's the best deal in cell service.  You pay 20 bucks for unlimited voice and text in the US.  And then $10 a gigabyte.  And it's sliced pretty thin.  So, or fractional usage is also counted.  And my bill never goes over 30 bucks.  Because mostly I'm on WIFI.  It also does a great job of seamlessly handing off calls.  In call, from Sprint to T-Mobile to WIFI, whichever is better.  And I mentioned a couple of weeks ago the Signal Spy program  that lets you know what carrier you're on.  One thing that's interesting is T-Mobile...  I was always on T-Mobile in Petaluma.  Until Sprint got better, then suddenly I'm on Sprint a lot more here.  So I think that system really works for them.  And of course, overseas it's going to work too.  Because both Sprint and T-Mobile offer unlimited data and information.  And if you have unlimited data and texting overseas, you'll get that benefit as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You didn't find that that...  I mean, I must be doing constant polling in the background of those networks.  You didn't find that your battery...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  I would like battery life to be a little bit better on the 6P.  But no, I don't think that that was part of the problem.  FI is a really... I highly recommend it.  If you're looking for kind of a no-nonsense carrier.  It's really ironic that the MVNOs, which this is...  Ting is one of our old sponsors.  Straight Talk, all of those networks are MVNOs.  They resell.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Well, Virgin is owned by Sprint now.  So I don't know if it's an MVNO as much as just an off-brand version of Sprint.  But in almost every case, they do a better job than the carriers are reselling.  The experience on Ting and Google FI is so much better than the experience with Sprint directly or T-Mobile directly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now anybody in the US can sign up for it.  I wonder if they'll go international with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  FI is great.  Highly recommend it.  I've been very happy with it.  And what a deal.  I have three different, four different carriers.  I have experience with everything.  I finally got rid of Verizon.  I just couldn't take it anymore.  Mostly because of you, Jeff.  In protest of Jeff's poor treatment.  So you gave up Verizon.  Who replaced you with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no.  I was long off Verizon.  I've been on AT&T, but I had I had devices on Verizon.  My wife's tablet was on Verizon's.  Well, these were in Verizon.  And I had a MiFi and I was I got hacked.  So people were using it to change add phones that just to account.  So I had to go around and around.  I went through like four times.  I had to re-cancel things.  They were trying to build me.  I finally had it.  I tweeted about it.  So it went up to those nice, nice ladies and corporate who have to deal with the jerks.  And I said, listen, all I want is to go away.  All you want is for me to go away.  Divorce, divorce.  Right.  So please, please.  They did.  They did it.  They took me off entirely.  It's OK.  But I'm gone.  I'm gone.  I'm free.  And then what happens?  Two weeks later, Verizon announces they're testing 5G in my town.  Oh, no.  I want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I almost have to email the nice ladies and say, if you want to try and have us make  up, if you want to kiss and make up here, can I have 5G?  You have 5G?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be one of the first places in the country.  That's very early.  It is very early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I live in what is the former headquarters of AT&T.  And then has a huge Verizon facility and Verizon wireless facility within a mile of my house.  And the old NOC is about four miles from my house.  So this is going to be fiber all over this place.  So I want the five.  But now I've been too mean to them.  Do I regret my ways?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we didn't solve Google Plus at all.  But it was worth a try.  We haven't fixed Twitter either.  We really got to get to work here.  We're not doing our job.  Google had 75 million takedown requests last month.  That's a 30,000% increase over the same time in 2012.  This is, of course, DMCA, not right to be forgotten.  I'm sure that number is going up, too.  75 million DMCA requests.  That's 100,000 links an hour.  How do you even do that?  Torrent Freak says partly this is because the amount of pirated content has increased on the internet,  but also because the MPAA, RIAA, and other copyright holders are using algorithms that spot pirated content quickly.  My friend, a guy I worked with in Toronto, he calls himself the blind gamer.  Let me see if I can find the image he posted.  He got the sweetest image from YouTube.  A takedown notice from YouTube.  Well, it wasn't exactly a takedown notice.  It was saying, you know, the Universal Music Group has said that you're using their music in this video.  I hope you don't mind.  But they've turned on monetization and they're taking the money.  I hope that's okay. If this is wrong, please let us know.  That was from YouTube?  Yeah, it was like super sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I got one of those, too. I was surprised.  I did a little video of Fallout 4, and I put Radioactive to the trailer for Fallout 4.  Everybody on Reddit hated it, obviously.  But I felt the wrath of Reddit.  But my kids liked it. They said, Dad, that's awesome.  So I was happy.  But yeah, I got a monetization notice. It was kind of nice.  It was like, we're so sorry.  Just letting you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, it can be civilized.  It can be a mutual benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's the way it should be. It's just gotten way, way, way too out of control and too easy.  There should be some sort of process you go through when this happens.  It's just way too easy for someone.  And if you've been spending any time on Reddit lately or any of the social media networks,  you'll see that people are getting really mad because of their content.  There's one guy I saw just recently got his video taken down for absolutely no reason.  He was outside in his front yard videotaping himself.  What?  And he got a takedown notice. He's like, there's nothing here.  It's my front yard and me. What can you claim?  So I really feel bad for content producers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's done automatically.  It's happened to us too.  And we've always appealed it and saying, you know, we're a news operation.  It's fair use.  And they've always backed down.  And I think then at some point after a while, they flipped a switch that we did.  Because it's kind of hardly happens ever anymore.  It's very rare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they got an algorithm that kicked in and said, oh, these are news. Don't bother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, right.  So they're trying to do it right.  They're a they're not the notices are not accusatory or mean.  They're sympathetic, which is interesting.  And then they're trying to make it better if if this is by by mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a ripe business opportunity, though, for the right person.  To do what?  Come up with the next YouTube.  No, I wonder if you if there was a viable alternative.  I wonder if people would say, see, I'm going someplace else where I don't get bugged as much.  That's what Facebook tried to do. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I don't know if that's that's how that's working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like Vimeo, but they, you know, they don't have the I love Vimeo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Never never really took off.  Never really took off. It's still out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I love whenever I can.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You mostly use it, although it's owned by Hollywood.  It's owned by ICM.  So I didn't know that.  Yeah. By the big talent agency.  I think it's ICM.  Google has extended the right to be forgotten to everywhere.  Well, almost everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's wildly complicated.  So the EU and various countries in Europe were after Google because Google, they thought cynically, just said, if you're taking down the right to be forgotten in Spain, we'll we'll block the link in Spain.  Well, no, it should be blocked worldwide.  Well, no, said Google quite probably.  We're not doing that.  So then it's a complicated formula where I can't remember the exact formula.  But if you if you try to get to Spain, you'll get to Spain.  If you try to get to it from a Google browser in the EU, you won't get to it.  But if you get to it from a non EU browser in, let's say, the United States, you will still get the link because they won't block the rest of the world.  So if you're a European customer in Europe, it's blocked.  And if you're a European customer in that country, it's blocked.  And if you're a European customer outside that country, you're using a European browser.  I think it gets blocked.  But if you're using a non European browser, it doesn't or you can just use a frigging VPN and ignore it all and act like you're American where we have a frigging First Amendment and believe in free speech and not trying to rewrite history.  It is complicated.  I'm going to the reason I'm going to be in trouble for next week is because I got invited to go to see bit Germany.  Fun in Hamburg will be in Hanover, Hanover.  That's right.  As they say, pardon me, and I'll be doing a keynote at see bit itself.  But before that, I'll be on an EU slash EC two panels there on the same stage afterwards with good to it and get the vice president of the European Council, who's the one who's threatening to bring the right to be forgotten to all of Europe.  So it's still very much a hot issue there.  And I'll come over and I'll finger wag like the obnoxious American.  So I just it's worth noting that that's there and I'm going to cause trouble next week.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And but we'll miss you.  I will be missed.  Yes, we're going to now have to look far and wide for replacement.  However, I have the week following.  I'm hoping I'll be in.  I have good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, George Castorani, who's the head of our all of our studio operations and all that is a wonderful guy.  He came back excitedly and said, we're on.  Yeah.  So I presume we will get details later, but I presume what we're doing is we're basically doing the three of us.  We hope Gina's there live before our cameras, switch it in New York and just feed it to Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we'll apply lower thirds locally.  I think we have to do that.  We were talking about that yesterday.  Right.  Jason Clancy.  We can do that.  What we apply our local thirds here, lower thirds here.  Well, you'll do it back there.  Yeah.  It's a little tricky because you're switching it.  So Jason's going to be really quick on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Jeff just said they could do it.  We could maybe do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they don't have our assets.  Oh, gotcha.  I mean, we could try, but it seems complicated.  I don't know what kind of switcher they have.  I don't know what their asset formats need to be.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think what we'll do is for the live feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We won't do lower thirds for live and we'll apply them after the fact.  We'll just do it like this for the lower third.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  And then we'll drop in the names as they need.  Yeah, we'll fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's contact some New Yorkers.  You must know somebody who lives in New York to see if there's anybody else who wants to be on the show.  Certainly Sarah Bartlett could be on the show, but your dean.  But Jay Rosen, if he wants to come over, Emily Bell.  I'd love to see if we can get Baratunde, Oscar Baratunde if he wants to come over.  He works on the Daily Show now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To start with Baratunde, it'd be great to have Baratunde.  It's hard to get him.  It's hard to get him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But since we're in his neighborhood.  We don't have 30 cameras like you.  Well, we can we can huddle together.  We'll even share mics.  Three is plenty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should have mics.  We should have mics.  Three is plenty.  Yeah, so we'll have and there'll be actual operators.  Wow.  Right.  Mancy.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what we'll need, right?  Yeah, we'll need operators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we've got really good people.  Yay.  I'm very pleased.  So that will be on the 23rd, March 23rd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A special New York edition of This Week in Google.  Now, you don't have room for an audience in there.  You process security issues, right?  People can't just wander in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you have like five friends, that's easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Well, I'm going to bring my wife.  Yes.  Son.  But no, no.  So we won't do.  Actually, Jake might be home.  I'd love to see Jake, but we won't do a studio audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just so we can.  Unless we did it in the newsroom.  That's too much effort.  Yeah, we're a controlled studio.  However, students.  Our set is not designed yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Students will want to watch and our new producer will want to watch.  Yes.  And the entire cast of Hamilton will be there.  Yes.  Performing.  Performing.  This is good news.  Yeah.  Thank you, George.  Thank you, George.  Hey, that's great.  The 23rd.  All right.  Let's take a break.  Come back with more Google and Facebook.  There's some Facebook news.  Big hack.

A little bit of a flaw, not a huge flaw, a little bit of a flaw in the old Facebook.  Some guy figured out how he could hack into any Facebook profile.  Steve Gibson talked a little bit about this on Security Now yesterday.  The good news is the hacker, instead of passing it out to all his bad guy friends, alerted Facebook.  In fact, they paid him a $15,000 bug bounty and Facebook has fixed it.  Anan Prakash is a security engineer from India.  He had a great blog post titled, How I Could Have Hacked Your Facebook Account and All the Facebook Accounts.  Turns out, and Steve was really dismissive of this, when you do a password reset on Facebook,  they text you a code, a six-digit code, and then they let you keep entering that code 10 to 12 times.  Steve thought that was a bad idea.  He said, if you just got the code texted to you, if you can't do it three times, you should have to do it again.  Agreed.  However, it's six digits.  That means there's a million combinations.  Nobody's going to guess it 12 times.  But if you go onto beta.facebook.com or mbasic.beta.facebook.com, that rate limiting is turned off or was turned off.  So you could guess as many times as you want as fast as you could until you got it.  Now, admittedly, that's still a million codes or on average half a million codes, but you can use software to do it.  He even made a video of him doing it on his own account, and he did get in.  He brute forced his own account.  So he did notify Facebook, and they were able to patch it so it won't work anymore.  In fact, he must have been really happy when he got this message on March 2nd.  Hi, Anand.  After reviewing the issue you reported, we decided to award you a bounty of $15,000.  Nice job.  A lot more hackers be working on Facebook bugs.  That's a good payday.  But everybody does it. Google does it.  Everybody does it now.  And that's the way to get people banging on your site.  Instant Articles is going to be open to everybody soon, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which I think is really important.  Because it means not only can we all create content there, it also means we can all get revenue there.  Maybe enough to buy a cup of coffee to add to the cup of coffee you get from Google Ads.  But I've been arguing to publishers right and left they should consider starting an entire new media properties on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And even before they open it up wide, if you have a WordPress blog, you can do it right now.  Oh, that's already open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I thought it was still going to be April for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm sorry, April 12th.  That's for everybody.  But if you have even a tiny WordPress blog, you can do that now.  It's a well or soon it's going to be a plug-in.  Now remember, there's an AMP plug-in as well.  So automatic, the folks who do WordPress, it's really right on both of these options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they have a plug-in for AMP and they have a plug-in for this now, which is a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Presumably turn them both on.  In fact, automatic is making the plug-in open source.  So others can work on it and make it better.  WordPress users that use the standard WordPress templates will be able to activate the plug-in immediately to create instant articles.  If you've customized it heavily, you may need to work on the plug-in a little bit to support the extra features.  But that's one of the reasons they open sourced it.  That is good.  So I have changed my tune a little bit on AMP after thinking more and more about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's funny. I've been thinking that it's actually bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the thing that I've learned since our debates is that an AMP page still shows up as regular markup.  So it's not incompatible with any browser.  If a browser doesn't understand the AMP commands, the JavaScript and so forth, it'll just render the page.  So it isn't in that sense. It's not exclusive.  It's not what I learned today.  Yeah. I'm still not crazy about the carousel in the search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah. And I'm told today, I didn't realize this.  I haven't confirmed this yet, but somebody in a paper who should know this said that the blue links, the carousel goes to AMP content, but blue links in search don't.  So if the carousel is the only way you go to AMP.  That's weird.  Yeah. I don't know if that's true or not, but it should be detected.  Because if you use Nuzle, Jonathan Nuzle, then it can go to AMP content if it senses that AMP content exists.  Twitter, I believe, is going to implement that as well.  Why wouldn't Google? I don't know. Google, tell me if I'm wrong here.  This is one of your newspaper players that said there's still debate about the behavior of the blue links.  And I thought, whoa, that's weird. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let me do a search for Trump. I think there's probably a few stories about him.  Yeah.  I realize that the media is really the they're giving him so much free advertising because he's so good for ratings.  Yep. That it's really the media that's made Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Leslie Moonves from CBS has been talking about how great this is for instance. It's just cynical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's great. What could be wrong?  So I've done a search for Trump and then I have this the carousel.  And so we know this is all AMP content. It even says so on here.  But you're saying. All right, let me find one. Here's fast.  Yeah, it's nice. OK, BBC. I'm just going to try to find.  By the way, it also does a carousel just for Twitter.  And you know, you don't get to the search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they usually have a couple of links above the one link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, here's two links. Sports figures, indoor style Trump and Fox News poll.  And then there's the carousel. And then there's one link, which is Trump's page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So the link above for me, what does it say?  The first one for me under Trump is a wired link. Oh, you have that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no. You just search for Trump.  Yeah, but I'm on my account. I mean, maybe there's, you know, because I saw the same link in the carousel that I saw above.  OK, well, then that's the question is if you hit the link above, I can't tell now because I already can't.  Oh, so you don't get the lightning bolt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't see that at all. I don't see the light. Whatever you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm you know, so fast. That's why it's so fast. It's a blink of an eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, so there's a well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what? I feel like all of the and this is part of what we're complaining about.  All the amped content is already in the carousel. Here's one from New York Times.  So I should see a lightning bolt if I hit this. This is the blue link that you were talking about.  Is it going to go to the amped content? Now, by the way, also not using Chrome.  But in theory, that shouldn't make any difference, should it? Yeah, that's definitely.  Oh, yeah, it does make a difference. Oh, it does? I think so.  Well, yeah, so let's go to Chrome.  I'm using the Samsung browser for reasons I don't fully understand.  No, you know why I'm using the is because it's the fastest browser on Samsung devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I know that I just went to a blue link for the New York Daily News and it was in motive.  It wasn't wasn't well, let me let me try it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  New York Times because the Times is amped. Times is all amped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Times is all amped. Guardian is one. I think 100 percent amped.  Washington Post is 100 percent amped. I'm on Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't see a lightning bolt. It's just I don't know if that's it.  How can you tell? That's part of the problem. The URL should say amp in it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'm not even sure. I think it cleans that out. I'm not sure.  So, by the way, I am on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  N. Oh, there it is. Let's see it.  There's the app drawer. Nougat. Exactly like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's an app drawer. If you pull down the so pull down the you can't see very well.  There's there's that simple tray and then you pull it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is nice. I'm constantly double double pulling, double swiping, whatever to get to those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speedy, supposedly quick settings. It's even worse on the Samsung now because  Samsung has changed the behavior just as they've changed the home row buttons.  They flopped flip flop those. Oh, no. Yeah.  So that back is on the right and recent is on the left.  Why do they do that? Why? Why? Don't do that. That's crazy. I know.  But then watch when I pull down now, right?  When you pull down again, you're going to get the settings right. Right. No.  Not only do I not get the settings, I get edit the quick things.  I lose the settings gear. Right. That's weird.  So now I have to go back up to get the settings gear and then I have to tap the settings gear.  So leave it there. What's wrong with you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It used to be if you did a two finger pull down, it took you straight into the really? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now see, it takes you straight into the full. You still don't have your settings button, but you bypassed your notification.  I bypassed everything. Yeah, I guess that's good. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I bypassed settings is wait a minute. Oh, wait a minute. I saw them briefly flash.  I mean, let's see. So if you do it a little bit.  And then it goes away. It's just a tease.  See, there's the gear, but it's just a tease because if I like, oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  peekaboo. Maybe there's an option for that or something. Keep the keep the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There probably is. There's a lot of Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when the drawers fully open, the gears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, all I can do is edit my quick launch settings.  Or press the arrow and I get the gear back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So do you have any idea how I do the multiple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. What do we read? We read it.  Did we read it? Yes, you have to go into.  Open up a few apps here.  Yep. Window. We read it. I can't remember. You have to pull up the the multi drawer.  The multi drawer. Is that reasons? What's the multi drawer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, where you have we have multiple apps open to reasons.  The thing on the lower right reasons. Yeah.  The stack. They call that the multi drawer stack.  Whatever it's recent apps, recent apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And why? Yeah. Now.  Pick one to bar and drag it somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. Oh, OK. Yeah, there I got.  So there I got. Right. Yeah.  And then the other one you can do something else with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the top of his face. I think on the Pixel on the Chrome Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, they do the same thing with another one to the lower half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah. Oh, that's gonna be nice.  And let's see. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm never ahead. I'm never in the vanguard.  You're in the vanguard. You are a leader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Follow that man. The one with all the arrows in his back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice job. Jeff.  Yeah, that's all. Let me drag the other one.  I guess I just go back.  Oh, I just have the second one.  No, now the bottom, that little thing now is like a little hamburger.  It's got to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah, it's a little hamburger. I tap that two line hamburger.  It's all something there.  The all but multi drawer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to go play Burger Time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to go to in and multi multi pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Multi pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a this is a phone and war with itself.  So Facebook on the top, Google Plus on the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's a social network nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mélange app may not work in split screen.  It tells me they still trying to do it.  Otherwise, that the story is funny story.  Funny. I'm sorry. I shouldn't laugh.  I should not laugh at the story.  West Virginia lawmakers signed a new law allowing the sale of unpasteurized milk, raw milk.  They all opened it up and had a drink and they got sick.  I shouldn't laugh. The poor guys are sick.  Anyway, so yeah, so there's terrible.  It is awful, isn't it?  There's Facebook and Google Plus on one screen on an ex.  I'm sorry.  I shouldn't laugh.  I shouldn't laugh.  I know I shouldn't laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, Vince 360 tells me in the chat room the two three lines is a hamburger.  Two lines is called a grilled cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not right.  It's got the grilled cheese.  So then how do I turn this?  How do I stop this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now you're asking close one of the windows, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, your recent screens appear here.  I know that.  How do I double tap the top of the Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it's always been the double tap.  Now we have to send the press the home button back into testing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Try pressing the home button.  I just hold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hold the grilled cheese.  I'm using that now.  I like it.  Hold the grilled cheese.  Hold the cheese back.  Oh, and all you do is if you if you hold the title bar, red loaf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, the square thing, the reasons.  Grilled cheese.  It goes back to grilled cheese.  Nice.  Live demo.  Sounds like Minecraft.  Good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My live demos never work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon error, error, error, error, error.  Amazon doesn't like it.  I could be happy with some of these new.  This is this is this is this.  It's so cool to be in the Vanguard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you happy that Verizon Wireless has to pay a one point three five million dollar fine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Leo, now that I want to get try out five five.  No, I think Verizon is a wonderful company and I would be very happy to work with them and see the wonderful things they are working on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're not easily influenced.  We can't be bribed at all.  This was you remember, in fact, really, this was a good reason to switch off of Verizon.  They were doing a super cookie.  They were doing a carrier cookie.  And that would not you couldn't do anything about that would identify you use your identifier to websites and people and we were selling this valuable information.  It inserted unique tracking codes into your traffic for advertising purposes.  The FCC said Verizon failed to disclose the practice from late 2012 until 2014, violating a regulation on Internet transparency.  So under the agreement, consumers must opt in to allow their information to be shared outside of a rise in wireless and have the right to opt out.  That's something new.  Until March of last year, you couldn't opt out of the super cookies.  But I have to point out as as as our friend Steve Gibson did yesterday on security now that a one point three five million dollar fine to Verizon.  Yeah, it's like cigarette.  It's a penny a user.  They made certainly made far more than that on this.  And in fact, Steve said if you said to Verizon, look, you can do this, but you have to pay us one point three five million every year.  They gladly say, yeah, good deal.  We'll take it.  Who did they pay that to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't find it.  The SEC was the plaintiff.  Yeah, well, it's a fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know who the fine goes to.  Not to us, to the government.  And three year consent decree in which they'll be watched carefully.  Yeah, I mean, they're lucky that wasn't a class.  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A hundred million users and.  I am so glad that Verizon is now doing the right thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, indeed.  That will make their service very, very good.  I can't wait until I always care.  Try that.  I am not being held hostage right now.  I am not a prisoner, even though my lower third is flashing.  Is that the fake me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just reading about the San Francisco House of Latitude is secret society.  Figure that out.  Say my soul.  Yeah, you know what?  This is I've got society.  This is just a way to get your money.  Yeah, I think so.  Shopping subscriptions have exploded.  Thanks to social media says Business Insider.  U.S. Dollar Shave Club.  Harry's Birchbox.  Many of our advertisers affect our next advertiser, Nature Box.  Companies that deliver goods to you for a monthly fee are.  Growing at an astronomical two thousand nine hundred sixty three percent.  Year over year.  Wow.  Wow.  And the reason is, I think not just Twitter and Pinterest, but Twit.  I'm going to take credit for that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And while you're at it, you can subscribe to a mattress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is that's kind of interesting.  Social is driving much bigger increases in retail traffic than any other online channel.  Social media increased its share of e-commerce referrals two hundred percent from 2014 to 2015.  For retailers to maintain these gains, they need to pay special attention to mobile.  Where social engagement with retail content is still kind of weak.  Social media users are thirty five percent less likely to share a brand's or retailers social post on mobile than they are on desktop.  Well, it's a lot easier to retweet and reshare on desktop, isn't it?  Facebook is the dominant platform in this.  It accounts for 50 percent of all social referrals.  Sixty four percent of all social revenue.  Pinterest also big.  Sixteen percent.  Well, given its size, that's actually per capita.  That's probably much higher.  Instagram doesn't drive significant sales.  Why?  Where is podcasting in this report?  Let me I'll just prove to you.  Let me prove to you how effective podcast advertising could be for subscription services.  How would you like a nature box coming to you every month full of delicious snacks like garlic plantains?  Actually, I'm going to let you, Aaron, choose.  I would give you one, Jeff.  I'll bring one out to you if you want.  Strawberry Greek yogurt pretzels.  I want those.  Wait a minute.  There's more.  OK, salt and pepper.  I know. You know what?  Sarah Lane was such a fan of these that when the nature box we order four or five a month came, she would take all of them.  Oh, yeah.  There wouldn't be any the next day.  She's so sneaky.  They're so good.  These are they have hundreds of snacks in a whole variety of flavors.  Sweet, savory, spicy.  You can you can of course say I want vegan or gluten conscious.  There's never any high fructose corn syrup or artificial flavors, no trans fats, artificial colors.  It's just good stuff.  Watermelon mini stars.  Give these to your kids.  What's in this?  Tell you what's in this.  Concentrated apple puree, concentrated apple juice, natural flavor pectin, black carrot juice.  That's the color.  And citrus fiber for chewiness.  Nothing bad's in here.  No red dye number three or anything.  They don't even add sugar on these.  So you say you want the Greek yogurt?  Oh, yeah.  Here's the deal.  You're going to get 50 percent off your first box when you go to nature box dot com slash twit right now.  Healthy, smart.  Don't go buy a candy bar or eat that, you know, leftover french fries.  Go to nature box.  Nature box dot com slash twit.  We love these.  This is this is our employee retention program.  And I know.  Oh, my goodness.  I know.  Would you ever leave a company?  I think Sarah must have been stocking up because she knew she was going and she just she took all of them so that she wouldn't have to worry about that.  Nature box dot com slash twit.  But you know what?  What's great?  So we I don't know if you know this, we separated the agency part, the ad sales out from twit.  So it is just a content company.  And then Lisa's Lisa's running an agency artisanal.  Yes, because that way there's a clear dividing line.  It's just a separate business.  But it's also given her and she's selling.  And by the way, she's going to other podcasts and saying, you know, also smart.  The formula we invented here.  We don't do it like anybody else does.  You know, we do a whole it's really a very different relationship with our audience and with the advertisers.  We're very careful about the advertisers.  But what's great, what's fun is all the new startups, all the new businesses that come to us because they this is an opportunity for them to reach an audience, a sophisticated audience that can really help them grow very quickly.  Yep.  It's kind of cool.  I think we could start to wrap things up because we've got some fun stuff that you brought.  But before I do, Aaron, before I do, is there any any stories, Jeff, that we left out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I wouldn't I would recommend for future reading Danny Hill's piece on from from the Enlightenment to the entanglement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love Danny Hill.  What is he's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he's writing at arguing that the Enlightenment was was was about us learning the laws of the universe.  So we could then figure out how to understand what it was.  And the entanglement were entangled with technology now where we're creating new worlds and new things.  And it's just one of those Danny Hill's moments that's going to work in 20 seconds on the show.  But for the rundown, folks, take a look at that on his.  I thought you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like I have and I should if I haven't.  He's involved with the clock of the Long Now Foundation and really smart.  I like. Yeah. What is what is he doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I should know that because I think a friend was working with him on something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me just Google. He was thinking machines, of course, was one of the first supercomputer guys.  Long Now Foundation does the clock of the long now applied proteomics.  OK, he's too smart.  He's too smart. And he's a professor of engineering and medicine at the University of Southern California's USC.  He was an imagineer. I don't know if he's still an imagineer, but a very smart guy.  Studied under Marvin Minsky and Claude Shannon. That's a good start.  Good. I will read that. Yeah, read that.  I thought I was going to plug. Yeah, he's kind of a legend.  Oh, he left Disney way back when in 2000.  And that's when they founded another company called Applied Minds.  Semantic data storage infrastructure for the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. Deep stuff. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some people are so smart that you just go, OK, I'll never understand a thing you do, but I'm sure it's neat.  All right. We you know what? There's always more to talk about.  Next week, Jeff will not be here two weeks, though I will go into Jeff land.  Yeah, from the University of New York.  Gina is scheduled to join us. I'm sure we can get her to come over the bridge.  And that'll be a lot of fun. I can't wait for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jason, would you warn her so she needs a babysitter or anything?  Yeah, well, of course, we're going to warn her. Yeah, that'd be great.  She doesn't need a babysitter. She should bring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would be thrilled if you bring her family because I have never met her baby.  That's a good point. Yeah.  So don't babysit. Forget that. Bring the kids. Have you met her wife?  Yeah, I'm sure I have. Have I? I've not.  Maybe not. No, I'm not. Maybe not. So bring the fam.

Transcript:  Bit by bit it's kind of a disappearing, but he said that in the coming weeks it will be completely hidden from public view.  However, the impact of PageRank, which he thinks is nefarious.  But I know it certainly wasn't.  He says it ruined the web.  Ruined the web.  He says, you know, I'm going to send you an email asking for links.  Blame PageRank, says Danny.  Ever had garbage comments with link drops?  Blame PageRank.  Ever had to ferret out the how and why of why you should make use of nofollow attribute on links?  Blame PageRank.  PageRank, of course, was a little bar that appeared on top of pages and said this is how good pages are.  I haven't seen that in ages though, right?  It still existed, right?  But it motivated everybody.  It's the unintended consequences.  It motivated everybody to game the system.  And everybody says Google should make its algorithm public.  This is one tiny example.  One data point that Google made public.  That meant everybody created an industry of SEO around trying to improve your PageRank.  Because it was the one thing that Google did make transparent for a while.  A very simple, you know, score.  I don't know what the numbers were.  Like 0 to 7 or 9.  I can't remember.  And it was 0 to 10.  0 to 10.  And then it was the PageRank.  And of course, remember folks, the PageRank was established by the value of the ranks to you and the value of ranks to them.  So it was a, you know, collective little Jenga tower.  So anyway, they were going to just completely make it invisible.  It still exists.  It's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you won't be able to learn what a PageRank is anymore.  What your PageRank is anymore.  Right. So that was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kind of.  Kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, as soon as you give a number, remember how much people cared about your Twitter follower number?  Oh yeah.  As soon as you give a number, everybody says, oh, it gets competitive.  I got to get that number up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, while we're here, I think I'm going to count 3D as a number.  Is this old? I haven't seen this before. 3D pancake printing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  I've seen that. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, of course, you would have seen it.  Can you eat them afterwards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're just printing the batter out with the CNC, you know, a couple axes and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pancake pot. It's on Kickstarter.  You can turn any image.  How did I not?  I've paid for so many Kickstarter campaigns.  How did I not buy this?  Because no one's got one yet, right?  Well, maybe.  You can make your own.  Getting closer.  Yeah, this is another one of those.  We'll get your pancake pot.  That's fun.  It was fun.  Actually, kind of a related story. We talked again about this on Security Now.  But some students made a...  Was it MIT students?  They made a inkjet, ink, and paper that you could use to print circuits, integrated circuits on this paper.  But it turns out that it has another side effect.  It can also print conductive fingerprints.  It was Michigan State.  Oh, that's how they did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw the headline go by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the idea originally was to print circuits on conductive paper and so forth.  But it turns out because these fingerprint readers, at least on the iPhone 5S and the Samsung Galaxy S6,  which they had copies of, because it's capacitive, you could print your fingerprint and put it on the phone and it would work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So a scan or I guess if you could take a photo of somebody's finger, you could probably figure out a way to print it out.  So these are these are because it's conductive ink.  These are fingerprints that actually work.  Watch this. He's going to unlock. Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can get an LAPD forensic style with some clear tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but the reason it has to be conductive is because these are to get the print.  Oh, the print. Yeah, you could lift it from a lot of things. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just lift it from anything. Use a little toner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Printers. Is there anything they can't do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see the story about the new HP ink?  No. Oh, so what it's going to do is basically kind of spray the page with the ink and only conduct in certain places.  So it'll be much faster and better. However, it's a proprietary ink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course it is that way. You have to buy it from HP. HP's pigment ink for office printers can't be bought for cheap because it's proprietary.  Of course, they figured out an ink that they could patent.  Well, I won't be buying one of those printers. Cartridges. Forty dollars each.  That's why I like our sponsor Epson. They don't play those games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep. Yep. I was there on the sponsor. I'll say about HP.  I refuse refuse HP printers trying to set them up is the worst thing in the world.  No, I've never had my Epson printer. I'm very happy with it.  And I don't say that because they're a sponsor. I happen to have it. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Aaron Newcomb brought in this. Now, if you're a nerd, an old school nerd, you'll recognize the 20 sided dice used for Dungeons and Dragons.  Yeah, absolutely. It's a die, not a dice. But this is a little bit of a different kind of a.  Why don't you turn it on? Let's turn it on first because we didn't want the battery to die because Leo would say I'm playing with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, you have been to. I have. So it's good you turn the battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you've been. It would have been talking at us the whole time. OK, so here's the inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't actually want to show that. Yeah, can I show the first? So you 3D printed the outside and careful the magnets will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have we have a shop for you. See that over there. Look at that. OK, you guys are way good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you guys are really good. So here's the here's the 20 sided die.  This is 3D printed. And by the way, there's a tutorial on how to do this on a fruit.  So it's in the rundown. OK, if you want to go check that out.  But I'm a cheapskate. So what I did was instead of buying a fruit, I love a fruit, by the way.  Nothing against that's where I got my Raspberry Pi. But you can also go online.  Sometimes you can get stuff from China for a tenth of the price.  So that's what I did. I had some stuff. I had an old accelerometer laying around.  I had this sound card thing laying around. There was a couple of bucks from China, an old battery that I could use.  So I took their design and I changed it, updated it a little bit and saved myself about 30 bucks.  So what you do is you turn this thing on. What did you get that? Yeah.  Is that you? That's not me. These are the adafruit sounds that I'm using.  Hang on. I've got a wire in the way here. There we go.  So it's kind of neat because the magnet holds it together. So it's very easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now switch over to. Well, we could continue to yours, but either way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So roll that thing and see what I have a microphone.  It's an eight. And it is an eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's 13. Oh, that's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so I've got to adjust the timings.  Sometimes it can hold it too still. It's too still.  It'll think that you're it's done rolling. Yeah.  Oh, too. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's a lot of fun. It uses accelerometer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's a good project for a lot of reasons, right?  It teaches you it uses an Arduino uses an accelerometer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bring this to your next D&D. You'll be a superstar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, they'll they won't let you use it because it's not, you know, official weighted die.  But it is a lot of fun and kids really love it.  Interesting problem to solve, though, is so I've got this thing connected to my computer, right?  And I'm reading the the act the data that's coming across the accelerometer.  But the problem is when the die is open, your coordinates aren't going to be right.  Oh, so how do you do that?  It took me a while to figure out. I'm like, well, maybe I'll put Bluetooth in and read the coordinates that way.  And then I'm like, OK, stupid.  You've got all the numbers as sound files already in the thing.  Yeah. Right. Yeah.  So what I did was you can flip a switch in the program and it'll read out the coordinates that it lands on instead of reading the number.  Oh, you're brilliant.  Then you can program those back into your Arduino script and it'll actually play the right sweet, the right sound when it lands on the right thing.  So I've made some improvements to it.  I think this one I will definitely put up on Instructable.  I know at the beginning we said I don't do that, but I'm going to do it with this one because I think it's going to be a lot easier for some people to implement this.  But if not, you just go to the go to the Adafruit site because they sell all the parts.  They sell all the parts. They make it easy.  So just go to their site. You can buy all the parts and make one yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They even sell the 3D printed die.  I don't think so. I think you've got to print that or you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's plenty of places that will do 3D printing for you.  So you can go out to I think even Adafruit might do it.  So you can go out and have somebody 3D print it and just ship it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now somebody is very sharp eyed in the in the audience and said, is that a Raspberry Pi over there on the table?  But no, it's not.  Okay, I rolled a one.  It looks like a Raspberry Pi. It's got all the connectors.  But I've never seen heat sinks on a Raspberry Pi.  Right. So this is actually brand new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just started shipping this.  This is an Odroid C2.  And I've talked about Odroid before, I think maybe on all about Android and some other things.  Odroid is from a company called Hard Kernel.  Thank you very much.  And they do a couple of things differently.  Number one, if you're just going to compare it to a Raspberry Pi 3, right, that was also just recently announced.  This one has two gig of RAM.  Oh, it's a V8.  It has Cortex A53.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep. Yep. And it also has two gigabytes of RAM is big gig of RAM versus one gig of Ethernet.  HDMI. Yep. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it has a has a serial UART.  It has a built in infrared.  So you can actually if you want to use a remote control, you could use a remote control on it.  And it's just a really, really nice device.  The other critical thing it has is it has EMMC on the back here.  Flash storage. Flash storage.  And that makes a huge difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a lot faster than an SD card. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we were talking earlier about what I use this for.  What I use this for is to run Android.  It's very difficult to run Android on a.  Oh, that's a nice tight shot. Look at that.  It's very difficult to run Android on a Raspberry Pi because the drivers aren't there.  So you need three things to run Android on one of these SBCs.  You need the drivers.  You need a lot of RAM because Android likes a lot of RAM.  And you need fast storage.  And you've got that on this device because here's the doesn't come with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'd have to buy you have to buy this separately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's a little more expensive than a Raspberry Pi 3.  So this is forty dollars.  And then I think this module was like eighteen dollars here for how much RAM for eight gig eight gig eight gig.  And you get a lot. But it's not a lot. But it's so fast.  And it's super fast. Yeah.  I mean, it's like it's like the experience you get on a tablet or your phone.  Oh, interesting. And if you don't have that, you're going to start slowing down,  especially when you run some of the apps like Chrome and other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So think of this as like a little bread box for Android for Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And you can run Linux on it as well.  They have images for Linux so you can do that.  But because it's not the Broadcom chip, the Broadcom logic.  It's yeah. So you've got all the drivers for Android already.  So it's really, really nice.  So what I'm doing with this and this will be another project I'll bring maybe at some point is I'm building a pie top with this.  What's a pie top? So pie top is when you take a laptop, take the stuff out and put a Raspberry Pi inside.  Right. But I'm going to turn it into an Android pie top.  So I guess it's an Android top. I don't know what you want to call it.  But it's going to be it's going to have this board on the inside.  And I'm doing a lot of work to get the keyboard to work and the mouse, the touchpad to work.  I've already got the screen working. So I'm retrofitting an old laptop.  I'm going to turn it into a desk to a an Android top.  I don't know what you want to call that. But that's what I'm going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the Odroid C2 from HardColonel.com.  Odroid C2. They make a lot of other things too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They make an Odroid Zero, which is not as cheap as the Raspberry Pi Zero, but it's a small board.  Twenty five bucks, I think.  And you get a lot of horsepower out of it.  But it's really small so you can embed it into your projects a little bit easier.  And then they have all sorts of other models too, if you want to step it up from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if I wanted to do with my dream, which is to make a Harry Potter style portraits of our hosts,  this Odroid C0 would probably be perfect for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because you could bake that into the back of the frame.  Put it in the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd prefer to have pancakes made of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Alright, so there'll be portraits of all the hosts moving, winking, and then a pancake with Jeff Jarvis' face on it.  And you figure out why.  Just make sure you hold the grilled cheese.  Jeff, have a great trip to...  Sorry, I rolled a 12.  Have a great trip to Hanover.  So you say Hanover.  Hanover.  What is the food of Hanover?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have no idea, but it's fried.  Whatever it is, it's fried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Siebet is the big...  It's bigger than CES. It's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's gigantic.  So I go in, I do the panels on Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you report to us a little bit from Siebet?  Do a final report or two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can try. I've got like a half a day to wander around a gigantic Siebet,  and then I do my keynote, and then I go to the airport.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff's wasting no time. He's a busy man.  Yeah, I don't. I get back home.  Maybe though we could get a Skype or something.  You know what? Shoot some stuff on your smartphone.  And just send us the video.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That'd be fun.  Yeah.  Now that I have my PHY working,  by the way, the notifications are very nice.  I'm going to do my Pixel C tonight.  I'm excited.  So when you bring the notification, you can act on it at the notification.  So they've improved notifications. That's nice.  So those are the changes so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, City University of New York.  We will be back together in two weeks at CUNY.  Can't wait. Can't wait.  Our first show from the CUNY studios.  All of us.  That'll be great. I can't wait. Thank you, Jeff.  Aaron Newcomb, regular around here.  We love having him on. He's been on the screensavers.  He's been on Floss, all about Android.  And he always brings fun projects, works at NetApp,  and of course has his own makerspace.  That's right.  Where you too can get trigger finger.  You can. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You spent too much time on the rope for us.  And we've got the Mini Maker Faire is coming up.  I think I mentioned it last time I was on.  Talk about it.  Mini Maker Faire is coming up on April 16th in Venetia.  If you're anywhere in the Bay Area and you want to check it out,  it's a smaller fair, not like the big one down in San Mateo.  A lot of people like that because you actually get to interact with people.  It's not crazy.  You don't feel like you're...  If you're claustrophobic, go to a Mini Maker Faire.  You'll really enjoy it.  And I don't know if I mentioned this, but I'm going to anyway.  There's a special offer.  If you're a Twit fan, you can actually get a discount right now.  If you go buy a ticket and put in the promo code TWIT,  you'll get 20% off your tickets.  So I thought I'd make that available for our great audience because they're awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very nice of you.  The Venetian Middle School, April 16th, Saturday.  April 16th. Yep.  Thanks to Jason Clanthus, our esteemed producer.  And thanks to all of you.  Always, Jason. Thank you.  He does a great job.  Thanks to you for joining us.  We do TOIG this week in Google every Wednesday afternoon,  1.30 Pacific, 4.30 Eastern.  Now remember, our clocks are changing on Sunday, and UTC doesn't move.  But since we are moving, we'll still be at 1.30 Pacific and 4.30 Eastern.  But we'll be at 20.30 UTC starting next week.  So please adjust your brain.  Since you can't adjust UTC, adjust your brain.  Now if you do miss the show, of course, audio and video are always available on demand  at twit.tv slash twig.  And wherever you get your podcasts, including all those great free twit apps  and paid twit apps on the app stores of every platform,  iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Roku, Apple TV.  There's five different apps, because we didn't write any of them.  They're all from our third party, fabulous friends, developers.  Thank you.  And I'll see you next week on This Week in Google.
