Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a lot of work to type. We gotta have something. I'm gonna have a voice dictation something like that  Look who could invent that Jeff Jarvis is also here letting tau professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig  Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York buzzer machine commises  Your blog home New York New York New York. I just was reading that 25 to 35 percent of New Yorkers  Many of them unwittingly had kovat over the last year  Kind of a stunner. Yeah. Well, it's a small city and everybody's jammed in it hit New York first and worst, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, actually not first was Seattle's first but it hit us badly badly crappy stats for your city

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Depressing and aunt Pruitt from hands-on photography our great friend. Hello aunt  Hello, mr. LaPorte. Good to see you you too before we get into the news  We have some news of our own. We announced this on Sunday and the words getting out  We have announced something we call Club twit. It's a paid tier for twit  And so the genesis of this is when we first started twit  2005 I thought oh it'd be great if the we didn't have to worry about advertisers  And the implicit conflict of interest and all that if we just let the listeners pay so we had a tip jar back in those days  It was it was early days. I don't think people really knew what we were doing  And so, you know some people contributed I paid you way back. Did you thank you Jeff my son my son insisted

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, Jake insisted Jake was a big fan. I know yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we you know, we took we took in about at the peak 9,000 a month, which is good money  I'm not complaining but it wasn't enough to build a podcast Empire by any means or even do a second show  So at some point I think about a year and a half in  We started taking advertising. That's my background  Ad supported media both radio and TV, so we decided to  Take ads and that's been very good for us it allowed us to build, you know  Two new studios the brick house and now this with the help of our audience through the bricks that they we sold at the brick house  And of course grow to many shows and so forth. But then lately after kovat  advertising started to dry up  Audience started to get more interested in news  podcasts and to be honest there were a lot more podcasts to listen to and  We had a you know, our revenue shrank by about I don't know if first was about 30%  Which meant we because we don't have investors  We had to shrink our staff and shrink our and this is a hard thing to do but we had to do it  I know a lot of companies had to during the crisis  Produce the number shows we did and so forth  Advertising has not come back yet  It seems like it might start to come back and I'm hopeful for fourth quarter as as we kind of climb out of this quarantine  Hole, but that's not the only  headwind  Audiences as I said, they've been you know, there's many more choices  Actually a big issue for us is thanks to things like Spotify and a heart by heart media  Big companies who can force you to listen on their platform and thereby can track you  I mean they gave Joe Rogan a hundred million dollars to be exclusive because if you listen on Spotify, they know who you are  They know your home address. They know your credit card number  they know everything about you including when you listen how often you listen how long you listen and  Advertisers are addicted to that kind of information as as we've talked about many times on this show  And so we're just seeing it's we see it as it's gonna be likely to get more and more difficult to sell advertising  In fact advertisers have already started to say hey we want more information. We want more tracking and we're very reluctant to do that. So  The idea is well, maybe if we could have half I don't want to get rid of the free stuff  I feel like our free tier our ad supported tier is so important because not everybody wants to spend money on a podcast  And not everybody can and I really want to make sure everybody wants to listen to twig can hear twig  So I you have this promise for me we are not going to change anything  Everything is the same same podcast same places IRC the twit forums at twit.com  Community the mastodon at twit.social all that will stay and continue to be free  We're adding something which is a new paid tier. It's called Club twit  $7 a month gives you ad free versions of all of our shows both audio and video  You'll get a custom feed when you join that's just for you and that is the ad free stuff  Then there'll be a new feed of audio and video bonus content  We call that twit plus plus we have a discord where you can participate and  Will be using the discord a little later on to take audio questions  from our audience so  But the main offer I want to say is really the ad free podcast seven bucks a month  That's kind of the trade-off instead of listening to ads you give us the revenue  We would generate from your listening to the shows and we'll call it even I think it's a fair price  And I hope you do too, but again, you don't have to subscribe everything else is gonna stay the same  So if you want to support us twit TV slash club twit twit TV slash club twit  all the details are there the full explanation that you just heard is there and and  And you can see exactly how it works  We use a member full which is a patreon company they do I think a really good job  We really spent some time say Lisa especially spent some time  Researching this interviewed a lot of different platforms that we decided member full was the best for what we want to do  They use stripe as a payment provider, which means you can use Apple pay you can use a credit card  You could use pretty much any kind of payment method any national audience members can also use stripe  So if you ever use straight before you know, it's very easy somebody was saying it's actually easier to sign up for club  Twit than it was to get a pizza the other night. So I think that's probably the case. So  Anyway, that's this that's the that's the story. We are answering questions a lot  I know there are a lot of questions in the in the discord once you join or you can email us or ask in the chat  room IRC and we'll answer those two no PayPal lawn dog because  Stripe is a PayPal competitor and that's what member full uses  And they're really I think stripe is a little bit better. We used to use PayPal and I'm actually very happy with a  Stripe and no you can't pay me with a theory in red con

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey Rick, I'll take a theory I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have bad bad change I have bad experiences with crypto wallets as you know, so  Yeah, we won't we won't remind you yeah, I have actually that's one of the places the tip jar went was that Bitcoin wallet  That's why there's no no state bitcoins in there  Well to be fair, the last contribution was in 2015 when Bitcoin was pennies. So it wasn't like people were giving me big bucks  You're right  We don't use that Bitcoin  Nobody is flying to join Google's flock says the verge  Firefox has already said we're not gonna do it Apple Safari won't do it Mozilla  Vivaldi and brave all out  In this article by Dieter bone. He says edge, but I have to say when they asked Microsoft about edge  their response was very  Equivocal in fact to the point where I feel like  Microsoft was head was hedging their bets and said yeah, we're gonna wait and see we might well use flock  I just as a point of information Steve Gibson  Did a very about half an hour on flock yesterday on security now, which I encourage people to listen to it's at the end of the show  He's he says it's a good idea and it works as  He's he says it's a good idea and it works as  Advertised that it is privacy protecting and it's very cleverly implemented to do that  I pointed out it's of course Google, you know has to make advertising work  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google is for it for itself and and many many others

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so Google's kind of got to do the best it can to reassure people on privacy  But still they have to give something to advertisers. That's what I was just talking about and  What what Google did point out is that there are a number of categories that they don't sell ads against  including things like your mental state your  Previous incarceration your whether you're pregnant your how any health conditions  They don't sell ads against those and flock will not add those features to any of its cohorts  So that might have been a little bit  reassuring  Pregnancy is interesting because that's highly lucrative. Well, if you look at what they won't sell I mean liquor  Right the stuff that Google won't do ads for is is actually a list of stuff that people buy ads  ads for  So I think this is why I feel like Google might be a little bit sincere in that  They're do we need to reinvent advertising?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, you need to get past what it was and if we're gonna shoot down everything that comes up  Just because it came from Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're not shooting it down because it came from Google originally and e fucker  EFF shot it down originally because they want to stop the web being built on an ad-supported model that I mean that  That's their ideas that your data should not be your payment for surfing the web  We should come up with something better and it might be something. I mean what we're doing well

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh  Okay, so we end up with a world where everything is behind a paywall  I wrote a tweet about this last week that my dystopia is that everything goes behind a paywall and major media and  That everybody has a sub stack and the only thing it's free is disinformation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With with crappy. I don't think I think that's a little crazy. I think what's gonna I mean like I tweeted just the other day  I realized I subscribe to 11 publications, which is insane. I spend about a thousand dollars. Yeah. Thank you  Yeah, but yeah, no, I know I mean it's it's my job  I mean I do it because I run into paywalls all the time and but it is frustrating also to try to I'm like you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like yeah, I pay for stuff to people to content. Yeah, I pay for more stuff  I know they won't be able to read Bloomberg any money except that I have to use Bloomberg's materials on our shows

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I give I give it's 35 bucks a month and they have the gosh darn Bloomberg terminal

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They make a lot of money on Reuters is gonna charge that much which is ridiculous. Yeah, sorry Reuters. I like Reuters, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so go ahead. I think what's gonna happen is we're gonna reach a point where people start hitting all these paywalls and they  experience the pain of that and we're gonna come up with new models because they're gonna be forced remember I  Mean we always this is what competition does it create you you get this like  Pain point and then people will come out with like aggregators that are like of  Some sort and we'll get to that point. It's constantly evolving and that's good  That's what the way it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's exactly why we never want to get rid of the free tier because I don't want to put everything  I don't why I didn't want to do a paywall per se now. Maybe that's crazy because this is this is patronage

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is support. This is help. Yes fans, but I know people will be involved financial times

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For instance, you can't read their content unless you pay Wall Street Journal. You can read some limited content, but not all of it unless you pay  new, you know paywalls are are definitely a thing is that because this idea of  Freemium it doesn't work

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, because it's a winner take all market one of my numbers below which I will now sacrifice for the good of the show  thank you, sir is a  View of all of the news sites that have over a hundred thousand subscribers  There's 28 of them adding up to 23 million worldwide the English-speaking world. That's a fraction though of the total  It's nothing nothing and the US  63 percent of all subs go to three cut them three publications, you know what they are  Street journal. Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was the third one Wall Street Journal New York Times and Washington Post yeah, I have  So do I yeah, yeah, yeah, so do I I don't subscribe to any of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're the common man. You're the real man. Well, let's see the thing is I  totally get having these paywalls up because  Ideally, they're gonna have legit content out there and legit information  But there's a lot of times that I've been able to click on some of these stories and get a partial view of whatever  They're just showing before hitting the paywall and I'm like, this is bad and it just doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  War but and I'll bring I'll bring up this there is a hazard Knox Harrington in our IRC chat brings us up  If all the good content sites are pay walled  What will be left for it for normal unpaying people to pay to breed is link bait and crap exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm seeing I'm seeing link bait from some of these reputable sources, too. Oh, yeah, and and that's why I'm like  It's not a lot. Why do you bother?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not all crap. I mean mine's free. It's more trade though. I get a lot of people who are cranky that my stuff is too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Technical for them. Well too bad. I mean that  People are just cranky I gotta say people are cranky about anything  Don't complain about anything if you're not tech you'd get just as many people saying you need to be more technical

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I I get each week I get someone telling me I'm too technical and I get someone saying thank you for explaining things  So exactly so I take it all with a okay  You can't please everyone, but I will say there there will always be I do think there's always room for  I'll call it a trade like publication because  the people like  My advertisers are happy to reach the people who  Are legitimately focused on my area and I think there's areas where that  Model will work. I think the narrow where it breaks down the narrower your niche and you have a very narrow niche

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The easier is to do that. I  Think if you're general  It's harder, right  Because you don't have a natural audience  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have a natural audience is just they're not lucrative. They're just like the everybody. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well consider consider what is considered a frequent user of the New York Times  They had to lower it from 20 pages a month to 10 pages a month to five or three  Wow, that means that means people who are paid  You know, they can't get them to convert and they only come three to five times a month three to five articles a month  Yeah  I'm stunned. There's all can we I happen to have in my hand

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Professor Senator McCarthy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Three great researchers Duncan Watts David Rothschild and Marcus Mubius just published and  It's about fake news and they found that from 2017. There were five thousand English language  publications academic papers about fake news  So that what they're saying is they think it's maybe a little overblown and they and what the research we need  But here's some data in this news consumption is a small fraction of overall media consumption  14% of overall news because a media consumption is dedicated to news right 14%  Less than 1% of regular news consumption and less than 1  tenth of 1% of overall media consumption could be considered fake  Three and four Americans spend less than 30 seconds a day reading news online while almost half consume no online news  whatsoever  So we're weird. We are really yeah. We are well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting because as you mentioned writers just went behind a paywall  Their plan is to give you five free articles then it's 35 bucks a month  But they want to quote court business professionals  So that's the key I think you if you're gonna go behind a paywall  You have to find and that's why the Wall Street Journal  Which I think was the first to do it and Financial Times have done it successfully because people who read those papers  Could afford it if they can well not only can they afford it they consider money well spent the information they get helps them make money  Right. Yeah, so that it's just a logical thing to spend 38 bucks a month or 39 bucks a month

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're not buying content and they're buying the speed they're buying speed and I got this before somebody also knowledge

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right information. They're also buying I think the the knowledge and I would say  The insights I mean like I read CIO Journal. I don't read a lot of the Wall Street Journal mainstories, but I do  journal I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Am a fun person you are well, and I bet you know this is fun is CIO Journal a closed circ

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Publication I bet it is well, sorry, that's the CIO Journal is part of the Wall Street

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cuz they have a little segment to be this category that you had to qualify  By showing that you were you know a C level executive or an IT professional and then you would get these closed circulation things like  Information week information week is a perfect example. Yeah, I don't know if are those even still around because that was another  Okay, so that was another model yeah, and you could get it yeah because you're an IT  Yeah, I did enjoy that one. Yeah, I got PC week and those were ad supported because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were closed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it was the right because they they could tell people like right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're right in front of all the IT pros, right just like to it can if you if you're buying an ad on Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you're speaking to tech enthusiasts by it's very much. Here's one more number here  So here's one more number here so

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All the publications they could find that had a hundred thousand or more subscribers was 28 publications in the entire English-speaking world adding up to  23 million subscribers subscriptions Amazon Prime 200 million

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you have Amazon Prime you get

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Washington Post at only $3.99 a month, right which is a great and you get a lot of free content on Amazon Prime video  You get of course overnight two-day delivery rather that's and that's the initial reason for Amazon Prime  They've managed to make that a pretty valuable thing, but it's also expensive. It's it's ten bucks a month

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not as a normal person as you were saying earlier  The problem I have with a lot of these different big-time news publications is trust level  They all tend to come off having their own agendas at times  That's why you have to buy all of them  Right, and then that's the thing you end up going back and forth between three or four different  Providers of the same story and it's like she's that why am I paying for all of this and neither one of them are saying?  The same thing or or or even getting all of the truth out, you know, it's it's pretty that gum frustrating  It's a lot of times why I just I don't even bother with  News consumption at all because it's probably a bunch of crap that I'm going to get that this is this is why I say  You're the normal person. That's I think the normal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should have to I mean you have to read things you have to absorb knowledge into something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absorb knowledge and decide where you stand on I mean that to me sounds like what you should do is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think that what you feel if you hear what I'm saying you hear that from every of the vast majority of people  I know and I mean maybe that is a problem  I think there's it's a problem on on this also the creation guys who create the content as much as it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What makes us elites is that we yeah, we're elites because we read newspapers I'm gonna say something is not gonna be popular  We've had this this stuff going on with  Chauvin and the other police killings here recently  But fact of the matter there's just as many white people being killed by police officers  It shouldn't be and none of that stuff gets reported  You know, that's that's still news the news story should be that we have some poorly trained police officers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you know, yeah, I agree. I mean there's a higher percentage

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Arrest kids for not having bicycle licenses  Yeah, right who pull over somebody for an expired tag all these reasons people are pulled over

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but every story okay  But I also should point out and this is another problem every story has multiple angles there's another angle  90% whatever of police officers are hard-working care a lot try to be fair and honest and they're not killing people  so so my point not turning to defend police officers or not but  That there are angles into all of these stories and there's a and that's why and I think  Stacey and I try to read I'm spend  Probably five hours a day consuming news content some of it general most of it a lot of it for the shows but still  It's a job  To keep up on this stuff and I you don't go home and watch the news in the evening

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't watch the news, but I do  Try to check check out things like tech mean that's gonna give me a nice aggregate and yes that another part of my do try  To check stuff out like that. Yeah  Because it is my job  I do want to come on to this show each and every Wednesday and at least sound like I know what the hell I'm talking about  But a lot of times it's still quite challenging and frustrating to see the different  Ridiculous headlines that have nothing to do with the story or vice versa. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a it's a  Just got this book

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And what is this former Prime Minister of Australia Kevin right? Yeah called the case for courage  I spent 40 bucks to get it delivered to me from Australia  But I really wanted to know this is this is about his campaign against against Murdoch particularly. That's a paywall  Yeah, I guess Murdoch and he's talking about Murdoch and News Corp specifically in Australia where they have a monopoly in some places on news  But he gives a description of what news is what I think is what ants talking about here  He said I worry because we're becoming a nation riven by anxiety fear and anger at times bordering on an uncontrollable rage  These are deeply disabling emotions that crowd out the space in our nation's mind and imagination for almost anything else  They overwhelm our natural sense of optimism enterprise generosity of spirit  transforming us instead into a frightened and fractured people a nation of us versus them and F everybody else and  What the pointy makes here about Murdoch, but it's true of all media  All big media is that they traffic in fear the intention based business model  Which is why we have to change advertising getting us back to that if all you're gonna do is sell attention and  and then the problem is that the way you get attention is by scaring the hell out of people and  That's not good for the country either one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you know the interesting thing is I think sometimes it's thought that Murdoch is  Doing it for political reasons. I know I think probably  He would do whatever makes him the most money. Do you think Jeff?  Yeah, it's money for him it's not it's not about politics for him

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean but fear and conservatism, which is one of Rudd's points kind of go together

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  fear and conservative  Conservatism, but I also think it is incumbent upon the journalist and the papers to make things matter to people  I mean our job is  One to like try to deeply understand issues and explain them clearly to people  But it's also to make them care about something fear is the easiest way to make someone care about something, right?  But there's also you know, if you look at good health care reporting  I mean that is an arcane system that just grinds people up like meat, but you have you always have to find the  The reason to make someone care about it in you know, usually it's someone injured or say  There's a fine line between that for being people. Isn't that a fine line? Yeah, that's the thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're exactly right Stacey  I know whenever you write a story that's probably a big part of what you're considering as you write it is  How do I get how do I communicate?  This is important and you should pay attention to why this matters why this matters  Yeah, and but there's a fine line between that and saying, you know, here's a ten  Here's ten things you have to do before you go to bed tonight  So it's it's interesting. I could see how people might accidentally really veer into link bait  Simply because they just want to get people to care about what they're writing about  People don't care. They're not gonna click

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very challenging say the same thing about thumbnails. Yeah for people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and by the way, what are your thumbnails doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way is why if you go through YouTube all the thumbnails right now are reactions

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They look the same and this it I can't stand it. I can't either  Working, you know, that's what people want to click on. So really I don't have any of that stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The fault is in our stars. The fault is in  who we are as human beings and the things that grab our attention and  and and and it were kind of a  Fundamentally kind of basic system that is easy to game

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well finding what Eli Perez are author of the filter bubble, which I argue is is not the case  We didn't really not look for models when he started up worthy. It was with a good motive  Was saying I want to draw people's attention to news that matters  But by going with the data what they ended up inventing was the and you won't believe what happened next  Yeah, yeah, right and they taught all of media then how to do that for not good purposes  Until we all got sick of it. Of course, then it goes away  But but even in his good motive he was trying to use the tools that then get misused

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let me show you these and this might reassure you Stacey  We're talking about flock and one of the things Google has said is one of the concerns that  Vivaldi came up with for instance is that the way flock works is based on one week of your browsing  It changes every week. You're put into a category of  Interests with other people who share those interests that category which is never identified by name  It's just numerically identified then can be used by advertisers who can say, you know, it's interesting group one three nine seven four  Was very successful for us when one three two two one wasn't so let's buy more ads to one three nine seven four  That's the theory behind it. It's anonymized and  In the advertiser really doesn't even know what segment they're buying but Vivaldi's concern was yeah, but  In a way, you do know because if if all the people who did a search for  Ketoacidosis on the web are in this group  That tells you that those people in that group had a medical condition Google is saying no  Very specifically about medical conditions  But in general we don't sell advertising and will not have flock categories based on this content. I have the page here  It's in their advertising policies help prohibited content  In a but also prohibited practices and then finally  This is content that they will not sell ads against and will not be in flock  Sexual  orientation sexual content alcohol  A lot of this stuff gambling and games you think boy they they're missing out on a whole category. You mean no draft Kings  health care and medicines  Some health care related content cannot be advertised at all  Political content financial services  So there's a significantly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think admittedly the list is still means the shoes are gonna follow me everywhere shoes will follow you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's really what it is. Also the flocks change  They change every week. That's right based on yeah, I was gonna say these are weekly  Redone every week. So I mean again, I'm not sure I fully agree with Steve, but he did a very  He did analysis from the point of view  Of statistics and whether what they propose this K  Distribution actually makes sense and he says it does and what they're doing is privacy forward and does protect people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Privacy forward but it can be is so it is more privacy forward but it also can create links and  I don't know if Steve addressed this or not  If you're on other Google properties like Gmail it is possible for Google to tie your actual identity  To those they say they're not doing that though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Legitly. Well, I believe yeah, I mean like getting caught doing this would be a high cost. Yeah, they could be they could be

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Considerable liability once they make that warrant the Federal Trade Commission to come after them and say prove to us you don't and  If they do they could be in deep trouble so having made that promise there is some accountability impossible whether the government does or not  There's the threat of accountability. I will give you that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well in a company as big and  valuable as Google is gonna be really reluctant to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fall I don't know remember how they were snarping up everybody's Wi-Fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  SS IDs and again when they were doing yeah, we talked about it and and I think it was very clear that that was not a  Intentional policy on theirs. It was it was just the way open Wi-Fi works and  They as soon as they you know, people said hey you're doing that. They stopped. I don't look I  Have mixed feelings about Google especially of late, but I don't think they're actively malicious  I think what they're trying to do here is exactly what you would expect a company that makes its living on advertising would try to do  Right, which is to find trying to make it more palpable, right?  Yeah, so to respond to people's privacy concerns while still not  Eliminating the ad tracking of some kind because advertisers really want to know more  But they don't look, you know, there's that old saying in advertising that you know  I know half of my the money I spent on advertising works. I just don't know which half there's always that right, you know  Advertisers always feel like they're throwing money  Into the unknown and they would the more they can say well at least we're advertising people who might buy our product  That's really all they want to know  Some of our advertisers actually get angry because they say well you you know  You drove a thousand hits to our website, but none of them bought the product. I  Can't help you with that  Hey, right. I can't help you with that  All I could do is get them to be interested enough to go see it if they don't buy it the last mile now  You got a close it close it man  Yeah  And so I shouldn't say that advertisers don't care because they do they did every advertiser wants their dollar to have  $2 return on interest investment, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I did some research this week by chance and came across some interesting things  in the early bit of the last century  Newspapers I  Didn't realize this would advertise that they censored the classified ads the newspapers themselves had really bad advertising  They were selling patent medicines other cuts. Yeah, that's right. Also their advertisers were really bad  And and so the the Postal Department threatened to regulate newspapers and declare them to be a public utility  Along with various states this is just like what's going on now just like before just before then the other thing that happened was newspapers  Have always been anti-competitive as hell with us today  They also fought hard  Against the billboard industry and tried to basically get it outlawed because this was junk that we shouldn't be advertising this with those  It's messing up the public just like they tried to kill radio news years later  Right and and so we've been going through this again and again and again again. It ain't new here is an interesting statistic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is from morning consult  brands  Based on their average net trust rating the share of people who they polled who say they trust a brand to do the right thing  This is rankings conducted between March 1st and 30th 2021 in Brazil Canada China France  Germany Italy Spain the UK and the US  Number one most trusted brand Google number two PayPal  Which is bizarre numbers doing this survey money Microsoft YouTube Amazon Sony Adidas Netflix Visa and Samsung  You know who's not in the top ten Apple?  This is  Facebook well if I wouldn't I wouldn't expect interesting on this list

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I would say Google for all the oh my god everybody hates the internet everybody saw the internet  What you were talking about beforehand in terms of media whipping up stuff?  This is my moral panic argument, and I'm writing a book proposal so watch out there be more of it is  Media would give us the impression that everybody hates Google. I should point out that YouTube is also Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So really Google has two out of the top five positions

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google's trusted and Amazon which people are saying you know after the various labor messes they've had there were five

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's very nice to use services yeah  Maybe that's what this is measuring more than anything else is how they like it  And I think people like Google because they use Google and Google search and for many people gmail

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The list indicates trust to Leo because PayPal the reason PayPal is number two is because people are trusting their money

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that's true  All right  We can move on a little bit, but I can I go to a slightly related you can if you let me pause  briefly for station identification  All right now Jeff Jarvis. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just found it interesting that the temptation to mess you up at those moments. I know you love it. I know I know I don't  I don't we I just real quickly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody wanted to buy ads on the show. I don't know why  We don't do enough link bait. I don't know why but this show is ad free even if you didn't pay for it  You pay for it no I understand in fact  I don't expect more than about 10% of our audience to pay for it that would be a that by the way that's  That's our stretch goal  Public broadcasting you know with all the pledge nights and stuff they do five percent  So if we got to 12  Yeah  Okay, six to twelve is a little more than it used to be so if we got ten  I would be over the moon, and it would be a huge success so that means 90% of our audience is  Not paying for it, and I understand that they're like you aunt they just say I'm not gonna pay for that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't I don't blame you, but that's the thing though. There are things that I will pay for I do pay for  Amazon Prime I do pay for Netflix because I see value there and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's a lot of stuff out there. I'm like do you pay for any content you pay for Netflix?  I guess is content so you anything else besides Netflix

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now that I heard that there's a discount for the Washington Post  I will at least look at the Washington Post now for that discount  Just to see if it's worth it you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  New York Times has become problem. You don't have to buy a newspaper

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Subscription and we're still well I'd like to I'd like to be informed and I would like to see  But I do think journalists should still be paid so yeah, what is the best way to get informed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These days that seems like a pretty imperfect way to that's what we have five newspapers. I don't know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Talk to me is probably asking mr.. Burke at the studio he seems to know he knows everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We we were talking on Windows weekly about a crappy Microsoft news is  Apple news justice as a news product. Yeah, and it's bad if you used Windows you would they actually pay the papers  They have it's awful  And Apple is also awful Google news of the of the three

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the better of the three but even then it has a lot of junk in it so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google news keeps feeding me sports, and I keep telling it like exactly now  I've I've given up literally on all that. I'm like don't show me basketball. Don't show me baseball now. It's showing me cricket

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We know you want sports

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's hysterical okay, that's early next that's if it makes you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See what new sport I will discover, but I'm just curious. I mean if anybody should know  We should know how do you how how should some watch somebody behave to be well-informed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What what is it? What do you do like John Oliver? I think some of the more comic like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why the Daily Show worked right because there was a little bit of sugar with your medicine  politicized but you but only if you're liberal it people on the right right hey hey hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  John Stewart, I know they hate him and Greg Dutton is no John Stewart. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think it's hard because an aunt really drives home. I think  We feel like things should be black and white and like it when you talk about the real issues that we face in society  And I'm not I'm talking about everything from like systemic racism to police  Brutality or to issues with our police departments and even things like health care  These are complicated highly sophisticated things where you have to know a lot and you have to be willing to accept that there are trade-offs  in  You can't like people don't want to think about trade-offs because it's hard and you have to have facts and it feels like  debate club in  News people are all the people who like debate club, right?  We're all the people who are like, yeah, let's research the hell out of this and  pummel people with the information  in  There's no easy way to solve this without  recognizing and getting  Everybody like citizens to recognize that there are trade-offs associated with everything in  I don't know how to do that. You have to start with education like we do it with my daughter who is like, you know, I  Hate capitalism and I'm like  Yeah, we should not be deforesting the rainforest and I'm like, well, let's talk about why that's happening and then she's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh this sucks. It's a lot easier to do a bumper sticker than it is to do  a deep dive I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't think this is a new problem. I  You have quote elite humans  You have the people who dig into this and want to fight it out and that's  But then we get pissed off at them because they've put the effort and they usually put the effort in because they have an agenda

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was listening to a podcast the other day  Among people that you all know very well  and they were talking about kovat 19 and  remedies and vaccines and  They said something like don't listen to the medical elites and it was like  You mean doctors you mean epidemiologists you mean scientists don't listen, but but you see how they twisted that by calling them elites  All right  You know, yeah, I'm a little idiot podcaster for my I'm gonna get my more elite from some idiot podcasters

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but we go back to my my kovat list  That's where I find the best information and so I want systems where I can find experts in multiple areas

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Americans have historically  Hated eggheads going back to Adlai Stevenson, right? That was when he was running for president. He was an egghead a  aka  an expert or a professor  Why is it we're so anti-elite? What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No idea. I will say that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're a culture founded on rugged individualism and egalitarianism, right?  Yeah, but we're also a culture of people who were like, I mean super individualistic super independent  We're people who like literally, you know over through the government when they decided to Texas, right?  You know, it's that is our founding

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah  You know, I I will say that I I am privileged and I recognize that because  You say where do you get your news from? I have the privilege of knowing  You folks and can come straight to you. I have the privilege of knowing someone like Dan Patterson  And yeah, he's something ever pops up in my head  I go I pull them right up on the phone and and just go from there. I have a couple different  People in my circle that I can trust for  News because I go to him. I say, you know, I don't know what's true out there. Can you help me and  They can answer you all can answer for me and it helps but everybody doesn't have that privilege. I know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and there's also understanding the implications if you go to a primary source like  George's election law is a great example actually  Yeah  Like that was 98 pages and if you read the whole like my husband read the whole law because he really wanted to understand what was happening  And he comes away and he's like Stacy. I don't think it's that bad  And the reason he didn't is because he didn't understand all of the historical  precedents that particular aspects of the law set and that's  so it's also because we  in some areas occlude the meaning and the intent of things  Intentionally, which makes it also difficult for people to understand and also engenders more distrust  so I  Don't know. We're not gonna solve this. This is not a solvable fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a fascinating but I think we do have new entirely new opportunities, right and it starts with I remember Dave Weiner  talking about the early days of blogs and  and you could have  Economists could now speak directly to the public right and you could go to the experts  Economist  But you know, I was gonna say economist is experts Jeff, I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I go to my co-village. I'm a very good source of information. It's just too expensive  Yes  The guy the economist is quite good don't you but I just  For 150 bucks a year  I also subscribed to the New Yorker and I can't keep up with it, but it's another pile of guilt. Yeah pile of guilt  You know what? I thought this might be a good time to go to our stage and ask our our listeners  How they keep up with what's going on in the world around us?  So if you're in this stage room on our discord server, it's called twig live  raise your hand if you have  Thought about all this. Let's just try it. Let's just see we may regret this  Especially because the first person up on the stage is named captain Jack  Mr. Sparrow you may you may you may jump right in go ahead and pot this up John the stage. Are you there Jack?  Leo hey, well the group. How's it going? It's going great. Thanks for listening to the show. Thanks for joining Club to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely, so I can't show you on screen here right now because obviously we don't do video yet. Not yet. We're working on I keep  Yeah, I keep up four different browsers with YouTube TV and they've got my BBC Al Jazeera and  NBC and Fox and whenever they sync up on something, I know it's important  That actually is pretty good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fox and Al Jazeera agree on anything I'll be amazed but but that's it. I think that's a reasonable algorithm actually Wow. Yeah  It is an algorithm. How do you watch all four of them at the same time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll put it in the chat, but four different YouTube TV  Windows on a but you must have one one mute

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mute them all except one you must rotate through them or something. It's kind of you know, it's kind of like  the NFL red zone  And if something interesting happens you unmute that one is that kind of how you're doing it  You can see that you can see the lower thirds closed captions closed captions on all of them  I don't have audio on you can probably read faster than they then they can speak all of them. Yeah, that's makes sense  That's a good plan to nice heck. Thanks. Thanks for sharing with us. That's great. How about  That don't judge these people based on their  Chat handles. Okay. I'm just saying oh I am King Wing 27. What do you think? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I I mainly just use Google News, which  Is not great, but it's better than you use that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the the main thing is those top five stories for you  And I actually find that those are usually pretty close to what I'm interested in

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  well, I like lately I haven't been using it just because  It's all about cove it and I'm just kind of don't want to hear all done with that. Yeah. Yeah, like well  Unfortunately where I live we're not  Where are you calling from? I just I'm calling from Ontario, Canada. Oh, yeah, and we're we're in our third wave walk down  I'm sorry. She's sorry. We're deeply we're doing it. So yeah, so we're so I just I use that and then I use I follow  mainly tech news so I go to mean like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a lot easier that's what most of my news consumption is that and that's a lot easier as I said a tech meme  And nuzzle there's lots of ways to kind of keep them on tech news  And there's a few enough voices that you can kind of get a consensus opinion on anyone one subject  So that is easier than politics politics is a little harder. I think  King we don't call it politics call it policy policy. Yeah, King Wing. Thank you. I'm gonna let you  Wander from the stage. I appreciate I want to do one more before we move on and that's Joe Joe  I'm inviting you up onto the stage  We're finding out what people really think an education for this panel. Hey Joe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I I like Apple News Plus more than I thought I would they have quite a few sources  The Wall Street Journal is on there the national reviews on there  Obviously they have magazines on there like wired  I know that they don't necessarily offer all of the Wall Street Journal for example  But it seems to have a good cross-section of a lot of good content. It's a lot cheaper way to get number of her  Oh, yeah  Yeah, and they seem to have a number of respected sources across the political spectrum, right?  I mean, I think you know the national review and  You know and then PR don't necessarily agree on I've actually enjoyed listening to reading the national review

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I also read a libertarian magazine called reason and may it well, I rarely agree with either  They at least are what are thoughtful and well thought out and intelligent and you least get to see are they reasoned?  Yes, they're reasoned. I don't I'm not a libertarian but but but at least there there's some you know intelligence behind it  Hey Joe good good good suggestion. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you. Yeah  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like hearing voices to go with people's avatars and names. That's kind of fun  That's awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's good  Yeah  So I think we'll just do this from time to time especially in something where we can't really decide what the answer is and we can we can  We can choose to go to them too. We have a small I have to say we have a smart audience  And one of the reasons we've always used the chat the IRC chat and now we're using discord is I've always wanted to make  Everything we do more interactive. I don't want to be sitting up here  preaching I  Think it's a conversation and you know, everything we do is somewhat of a conversation  But the more voices we can get in the better. I really appreciate that. Thank you for those of the all for you  Thanks folks all of you have joined the  the twit club  Oh, by the way, I was so I created a new tab in Firefox and Firefox uses pocket for news suggestions  I just want to give you an example  So this is a magazine you read eon  Stacey, I know you like eon the obesity era as American people get fatter  So did marmosets vervet monkeys and mice.

What do you think? Dr. Higginbotham? Should I see a specialist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Suspenders, yes sweats. I think suspenders. That's what I did. I think I've heard it is suspenders

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you get your thigh circumference and then tailor a minute the waist that's there you go. Yeah, we're a lot of belts  And wear a lot of belts. The ratchet belt is awesome. Yeah. Why is the Daily Mail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Found this amusing so the Daily Mail is a notorious  Trash sheet. Yeah, yeah, it's awful. So they're suing saying that Google doesn't favor them in the algorithm  Stories in my go exactly that's why it abused me it fits right in who's doing its job. Yeah, that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can we talk about something that I'm really excited about or should we not it's even a highlighted green story we can

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not jeans after this station identification  You're listening to the twit podcast network  Stacey Higginbotham

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Has a story for us. Go ahead Stacey. Okay, so I'm really excited because this morning the EU  Issued its proposal for legislation around AI  And AI apps no Jeff. This is actually really good legislation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You read it so you're but you don't think this is good. I was impressed. I thought I was good as  We know I guess doesn't like any regulation of technology. No, it's not true. I don't I'm gonna let

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm gonna tell you what they're gonna do or what they want to do  They're they're basically trying to classify the outcomes of your AI algorithm on  What it is intended or what your AI is intending to do and on the outcomes  So the risk levels are unacceptable for like they talk about things like  coercion of minors and things like that  they also have the high risk areas and this is where things like biometrics that would be DNA scans facial recognition and  Iris scans all fall into high risk and in the high risk category  What they're asking for companies to do is basically document their process of  Like how how their algorithm was built the annotated the data that goes into it and then to actually test it when  You know test it  I guess in a lab function to see what the implications are and then to come back and continue to do that. So to me I  Look at that and I think  Okay, that makes sense it's fundamentally changing the way the software industry has worked which is like hey  Let's throw some beta out there and see what happens  But I think the EU is trying to make a distinction in areas where it it's not just a cool feature for like your email provider  But this is like I'm setting bail for someone or a real life and death. I'm sorry life-changing kind of thing  They're like hey  Let's have you show your work and test it out a little bit before you release it to the public

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's my take very sensible Jeff. What's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and I think as it stands Stacy, you're right. This is not bad  But I can see danger at every bullet in the list here  So  I said this the other day on the other week on the show  I think that the biggest mistake the technology industry made in the last couple decades was naming an artificial intelligence  Because those became scare words, right if it's and even algorithms a scare word data is a scare word now  What is math  Yes, that's true  Maths  Which I never got why is it plural math? Well, it's funny is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But so sport is singular. I don't know. No, we're not gonna go there. Okay

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think is down your slippery slope man. That's called link bait where you got me  Right by the oh you got me right there. Yeah, like a hook and them fish in the mouth  This is a sign film moment. Yeah. Yeah, why is it? Why is sports plural but so singular?  So look, okay, I'm gonna go through these bullet points you can tell in hospital

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why is it in hospital? I'm sorry. Yeah, so so for example, you have to make his point  How do people create credit scores now?  How do people create credit scores now, right? There's there are algorithms now  When you go to the bank, right?  They have formulae based on their experience and say people who do this are good credit risk people who do that are bad  Cardinal federalists. They've always done that and they did it  You know with Scriveners and pens long ago and then they did it more and more with formulae  Now there's some more oh it's artificial intelligence, right well now it's an evil thing  Yeah, no, I think any algorithm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Conflated with AI and they're not the same thing  But I want to go through these bullet points because I agree with you Stacy  This doesn't seem like a bridge too far for instance a ban on AI for indiscriminate surveillance  Including systems that directly track individuals  Okay, so this is this is  The problem is the law has been leaked  It's a proposal that's circulating online is the is the draft out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah here. Where do you want me to drop this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just tell me where to find it because I'm reading the urge article, but it was from a couple of days ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they go to the EC dot Europa dot EU. Okay, and if you go to the Commission's press page

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Europe fit for the digital age Commission proposes new rules and actions for excellence and trust in  artificial intelligence

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I agree. Yeah, you can scroll down to like where they start class here is high-risk

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Critical infrastructures that could put the life and health of citizens at risk. I think this must be self-driving vehicles things like that, right?  Educational or vocational training that may determine access to education. Oh AI systems should not be used in  dot dot dot critical infrastructures  educational or vocational training

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not saying they shouldn't be used and they're saying that if they're in these categories you have to follow  rules about basically explaining it's basically showing your work and then auditing your work and here is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here the here are the obligations adequate risk assessment and mitigation systems high quality of the data sets  In other words, not just a bunch of white people for face recognition logging of activity to ensure traceability of results  This seems fair detailed documentation providing all information necessary on the system and its purpose for authorities to access its access its compliance  clear and adequate information to the user  Yes  appropriate human oversight measures to minimize risk  CF RoboCop and a high level of robustness  security and accuracy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you look at Jeff like your credit card scoring, you know, yeah, you're like your FICO score  This is actually really good. I think this is useful because it gives  Transparency to how those things are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Calculate this not that you can't calculate it. But how did you get to this and like that's fair

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like we saw this with Stanford actually in their coven vaccine  Algorithm or flowchart, however, you want to call it when they decided who got the vaccine and then suddenly they were like, oh  this prioritized  Who were you know, not on the front lines and  They Stanford published it and then everyone said oh, here's your issue  Yeah, like that's the process that we want these things to go through and this law says  These following classes will have to do this. So you can't just shrug it off. It's basically I mean  it's basically doing what Stanford did and companies don't want this because  They don't want that transparency. Some of them may feel it's competitive advantage  And it's also it does change the way that we release products and will slow things down somewhat

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's also actually these companies may be in favor of it because  They can afford to do this where startups can't right they do distinguish

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think you should be a startup

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're gonna put out an AI algorithm that like tracks someone's bail and says I think  You are morally responsible. You have to be responsible for those  How they calculate that I agree with you it's like it's like you have to have a license to be a lawyer or a doctor  I'm not saying all licensing is good, you know rating hair seems a bit excessive

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think quite importantly they make distinction between uses of AI with limited risk and  Minimal risk they say for instance the proposal allows the free uses of applications such as AI enabled video games or spam  Filters the vast majority of AI systems fall into this category and the draft regulation does not intervene here. So they do at least  Say well, these are these are this is uses of AI that are de minimis and these are the ones that might be more significant

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think that right but I guess part of my question is why is it just AI though?  Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should be algorithms, but you know, this is a regular regulated, right?  This is algorithms and that's really I think they say AI because AI is understood and well known and all that  But they really should just say computer algorithms because yeah, that's what they define that they they so they talk about AI systems

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They talk about apps. I  Think they talk about the definition somewhere in here, but I can't remember  But

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ideally like I mean this stuff is not AI for instance. They say biometric identification systems

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's basically saying when you put when you put a computer in charge of making a decision about a person or a thing  This you know, here are the cases where we probably need a little more oversight, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is completely appropriate to be honest with you and and at this level

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I won't disagree, but I you know, the funny thing is I fear fear, you know, I understand here  I completely agree. I fear them going over, you know  And I see how your regulation has worked out to date and it's and it's pretty crappy  I don't like that cookie. That's a gay is an awful law

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's out of out of fear. So but but Jeff you would I think agree  That it is prudent and reasonable to consider  AI and its use and to put some limits on it or at least some requirements on it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I tend to think that that that if you want to regulate surgery you regulate surgery and whether it's AI or not  Doesn't really matter. It's how you regulate

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't call it a I call it decision or a computer decision making either way

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, even why is it computers? Yes, humans make a lot of bad decisions, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can ask them  If you know it's a I mean, that's why people hate bureaucracies, but there's you can go to a person and say  Stop doing that right you have the chance to say let me talk to your manager  When you go to Facebook because you disagree with their algorithm or you find it harms people  You're stuck in this there was actually a really good article about getting stuck in the Facebook  Bureaucracy where they've intention. I don't know if it's intentional or not. They built systems that when you're badly affected by it  There's no where to go  There's no way to really address it unless you can get media attention and then people call in, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I I'll say regulate the companies for any behavior not just AI  Then whatever behavior you find difficult and dangerous whatever the cause of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, that's fine. Of course. That's fine  You need to regulate at a technology level here because it's not if you regulate by the company's  Individual deployment of something  It's to one off you need to have these are broad

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  General rules of our big class, but every company will have their own algorithms and they'll all be different. They'll be proprietary  I know but we can see them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the beauty when you go to Facebook and you say hey our presidential election is all screwed up and we have anti-vaxxers everywhere  We would like to understand why this is happening  Facebook can say here's the process by which we were feeding information to people  Here's why it's doing that in companies. Just so you know Jeff companies already have there's a field called ML Ops  They already have the things in place to document their data science like how they how they built the algorithm  They document their data sets. That's already in existence at any company building this because if their data scientists like  Kills over they need to be able to say oh, well that they're gone now  We have to do this ourselves right so it's not a new burden for anybody who's doing data science at any level  Accountability two weeks ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two weeks ago on this weekend enterprise tech Treveni miss Treveni Gandhi, I believe was her name. She was  Pretty much talking about all of this. She's a data science senior data scientist, I believe  For data coup and it they talk all about this this ml ops and all of the issues with  ethics behind it and I believe we even got into a discussion about looking at it the way  Asimov had the robotics law was it the yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's widely considered to be bogus, but okay  The laws of robotics are make laws of robotics internally consistent, but that's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My only other point Stacy is is this will go to your favorite thing for me is  What leads to a fear regime that leads to moral panic? I can give you an example in the US  Representative not Tom Malinowski  Who's my representative in New Jersey who I think is great and I've supported him full disclosure and given him money and when we  Could knock on doors. I knocked on doors from him. He's come up with probably the best effort to slice off 230  I still think it's bad  I still think it's a lot of problems with it night and I attended a session  With him and then talked to a few people on Capitol Hill about this  One of my biggest complaints is that is the nickname of the bill the dangerous algorithms bill, right? And so when we start  out  artificial intelligence and dangerous algorithms we have a larger impact on the adoption of technology and the use and  And some of the stupid regulation that can then follow so I'm always sensitive  To that and how its position that's part of my problem here. So so that this is about  Artificial intelligence if we've never named an artificial intelligence, I don't know that this law would exist  There might have been something else. I think you're right. You had an ML ops operation  There were other things to know but by putting it up in that kind of labeling  It often leads to problems. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Am talking well, okay  I'm just gonna go with I think you agree with me and you're mad at the fact that it uses AI

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I worry about how they'll f this up because I saw how they f'd up  Privacy in a lot of ways not as bad as other areas actually not a terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  GDPR in the EU is actually a decent law. I mean GDPR is an okay law, but it has problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It has some wackiness in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, there's no such thing as perfection. We're making a  Attempting to make progress towards perfection and I think you've got to take a step. You can't take no steps saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we can't get it right. Let's do anything. You also need a voice of caution about this, which I am

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm glad you are and you're absolutely right and sure they have screwed things up

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sometimes you say Stacey we have to have a conversation about it and this is that conversation  Yeah, what could go wrong with fury and everything that go wrong is the conversation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and one thing I note in the at least the and this isn't the law but the proposal is they don't actually define AI  They talk about the benefits of the definition here  They need a definition and I think that's part of the that is actually a problem because that's that's what are you regulating?  What's the line but computer algorithms that impact human behavior should probably be?  Regulated to some degree at least at the very least requiring transparency as is is that's that's kind of minimum  So what what the balance you know does they have

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go ahead go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was gonna say they kind of have divided this up into  They call it the machinery products, which is like  The hardware right and then the AI is basically  Pretty much the software side is really kind of what it looks like they're doing here and they have new machinery regulation  So they're using I mean could they say software sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know how politicians well and that so that kind of  Supports a little bit Jeff's argument because until you say what you're regulating in a way right clear better said than I did  Yeah, then I then I think maybe you need to go back to the table and say well  What exactly are you regulating here? And if you if you're placed AI with algorithms computer algorithms  I'd be comfortable with what they're proposing here  You know you can't say it's AI  The tick-tock uses or Facebook uses to cultivate the newsfeed or tick-tock uses to put on you know the front page  That's not AI. That's an algorithm  Transparent I think it totally malanowski bill

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Says basically algorithms are bad, but if you do things in chronological order, that's okay  Well, I can get not true as anything. That's not true. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Algorithms are per se that we should know we should it should be transparent  Because if the algorithm says no fat people on the front page you would want to know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the issue isn't what you want to know is the impact of it  Whoever made that out of it. They may not know it. It's more about studying. That's what this is calling for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is saying when you put out an algorithm you have to before you put out the algorithm  You have to assess how it will affect people. Yes  You may not know until it's out  Well do your best and then you need check well you have to you have to do it and then there's  Presumably this is what the appropriate human oversight offers is  saying  That oversight will be used to it says measure to minimize risk. So that's saying hey when we see that this algorithm is causing  You know harm we can go back and say yo, this is happening, you know fix it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's at it again. They're moving profits offshore a  Google subsidiary move 75 billion in profits through Ireland 2019 using the double new about the Irish I  thought that we

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pull the big change is the the Biden administration  Treasury Department is finally  Suggesting international agreements on how to tax these companies. That's what you need is  Is international agreements to  Crack down on this stuff right now. They're just doing what their stockholders want  And no it hasn't gone away. This is about law and and diplomacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the way they're avoiding taxes on that 75 billion in profits is moving it through a subsidiary of Google  incorporated in Ireland and  then  Registered I'm sorry for the purposes of paying taxes  Domiciled in Bermuda where the tax is  It's called the double Irish  The company that these profits move through has zero employees  So it's not really a company  It's an entity created specifically to avoid taxes  And I guess it's not illegal or Google wouldn't be doing it. And of course, that's Google's defense is we're just doing what we are legally  To do but of course we have to remember that the reason that loopholes like this are in the law is  Because lobbyists from Google and other companies went to legislators and said by the way  Google's not the only business doing this no not Google by any means. Absolutely. Yeah  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, how many of y'all protest your tax of property tax appraisals I don't am I allowed to  Yes, you can dispute well in Texas you could dispute your that's Texas you can dispute anything in Texas

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And your arms sort of scared of you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go. Well, I just say that like that. I'm sure I couldn't in yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure I could go and take advantage of hey, my house isn't worth that much

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do you ask one time Stacey? I did ask one time my guy and he was  Incredibly knowledgeable about every house of the block and what was different and he beat me down  I wasn't even trying to fight so much and say I don't understand this but he was unbelievable

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me explain to you. Mr. Jarvis. Yes, and he did he did if you want me to do my job  I was left speechless  This was by the way the last year 2019 that Google was taking advantage of the double Irish with the Bermuda rach around  But it changed its tax structure that year and Google was quick to point that out  in December 2019 line with the OECD's BEPS conclusions and  Changes to US and Irish tax laws we simplified our corporate structure and started licensing our IP from the US not Bermuda  Including all annual one-time income taxes over the past 10 years our global effective tax rate has been over 20%  What is our global effective tax rate honey?  30 what 48%? Okay, just checking Google's only paying 20

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know just checking well that's the thing about the fight over the infrastructure bill  And the tax rate its tax rate is is is show it's meaningless. It's the effective tax rate you want to yeah  25 28 percent 21 percent whatever that's that's means

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'll have to have you explain that sometime to me Jeff, but for now I'm gonna have to appeal my property tax  No, I think it's probably something  I'm sure I could do it, but I suspect that something's done more often in the great state of Texas than here in  People's Republic of California, we don't do those kinds of things

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well I I was always against it, but my husband was and did you win were you able to get a rebate?  Yeah, you usually get you usually get your value. It's your you're protesting the value of your house

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're saying it's California is weird because of prop 13 Jarvis can right we still get a test

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You get assessed on sale you get a set. There's still a plenty of

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  On sale, but then you're only allowed to go up one percent a year, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In Texas you can go up, you know if you're assessed at a huge amount your property tax will suddenly go

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you're not paying income taxes. You just pay your darn tax and shut up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was my argument to my husband, but he was he was like  That's why this is here and that's kind of the Google argument. I mean it is the Google's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Legislators job to say what's what to define it we wrote the law that way we pay we bought our legislature  We pay good money for him and we should do whatever they say

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want to hear what you have to say about Facebook pivoting to audio  I'm dying to hear what you think so I you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I heard on Sunday that the Mark Zuckerberg is gonna make some big announcement on Monday  Then I didn't see anything about the announcement. What was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He talked to was a Casey. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Always want to see a fleck, but it's Casey Newton Newton

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  a  suite of audio products  But clubhouse of course because all social networks do what all social networks do a push into  Podcasting an argument that he now favors content creators because also on the news side  They've also announced a whole slew of products to help a news people with external blogs things off of Facebook by the way  We talked about that a few weeks ago  a plan to integrate Spotify's music player into Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This almost tells me that Facebook has not you know  I feel a long time thought that Zuckerberg was a smart guy making all the right moves and maybe he was for a while  But lately it's just like  What are you guys doing? Oh, we'll do that  What's the hot thing now clubhouse oh we can do that  By the way, I should point out that the technique that the technology that we used  Earlier to bring people on into discord was in it was like an exact duplicate of clubhouse  Apparently, there's nothing to stop anybody from doing that so everybody and their brothers doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think even slack is gonna be doing it every guy's gonna do it everybody so which also goes against the monopoly argument

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's no monopoly yeah  Facebook users can record brief voice messages and post them in their news feeds. I'm surprised you couldn't you could do videos  So now you can do audios  Just weird  Do a video and people go I don't I don't understand that and then the podcast discovery product  So Apple announced also a big podcast push Tuesday yesterday including  subscriptions very much like we do with Club twit  We wouldn't do it with Apple because it would be you'd have to use Apple podcasts to listen it'd be Apple centric  So that's that's silly. Why would we do that? But?  You know I think some you know a lot of podcasters who you know are just starting would be thrilled Apple does take 30%  Compared to member falls 4.9 percent. That's a significant. That's a significant difference  But they also said they were gonna change or update their spot the podcast discovery mechanisms  It has always been the case for any podcast included and including ours throughout the ages  That if you were highlighted on a platform, especially on iTunes  Apple podcast or if you were highlighted on Spotify or you were highlighted on Stitcher or you know  Any one of these places it makes a huge difference  We'd see you know all of a sudden I would see numbers on Stitcher go through the roof and say Lisa what happened on Stitcher?  Oh, they featured us this week and but the problem is it goes way up and then it goes way back down  So it doesn't make a big difference in the overall, but it's certainly something you want  The fact that Facebook's gonna use Spotify to do this is I guess  Good sounds like Facebook's actually gonna be sending them to Spotify, which is  Interesting it can't be that hard to create a podcast product on Facebook  rooms is their version of  You know Clubhouse

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did I even know there were rooms on Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still don't have spaces on Twitter. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't have rooms because I don't want it Facebook. I don't have spaces cuz I don't know what I don't know why spaces do you?  Everybody I check my Twitter client to see if I've got spaces. It's only yeah, it's only on your mobile client. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  But they supposedly rolled it out to everybody on the Android side now, right? Oh on Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you hit the plus like to start a new you don't get spaces photos gif or text

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I think I can do hit record. I can do an audio of what's happening  Well, I'm just sitting here right now. You look at that edge. Yes  No, sir, and then I'm done and what is that the plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right even I even saw you supposed to do the long press or whatever I get none of that Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Man, I can't do the voice record. I don't get stages

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, this is what so weird spaces so what's weird about these platforms is not everybody has a different experience  Yeah, so I don't so if I can do a space this looks like I can that's the audio thing. You don't have that Stacy  That's me. Let me see. Oh, you don't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's going on. Oh  That little blue purple little squiggle. That's audio. Yeah, I don't have that then there's a picture I could post a picture  Yeah, I don't see anything that looks spaces like what about this place what does this do?  That's a story. Maybe if I just read I could just many more tweets  canceling on  All right, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know I can do all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I can't I wasn't super interested in it  But I was gonna try it one Saturday while I was just sitting out there in the backyard because people have added me to their  spaces on Twitter and  Like I never got the notification that I have that capability  But what I saw in one of those tech ads tech stories that I read they said yeah Android people should have it by now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's messenger. They haven't they haven't heard your dulcet tones. Here's rooms on Facebook. It's in messenger Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's messenger rooms a new way to hang out with your favorite people on video chat  It's not it's not Facebook proper. It's Facebook messenger. I see so it's like a video call for multiple  Look, you don't have to have a Facebook account to join the room. Oh boy. Oh my otherwise nobody can call anybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, right. I can call you have to have messenger

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess that means you have to have a Facebook account  No, it says you can click a you can click a link. So if somebody sends you a link you'll just join right in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me create a room. That's actually good because there are a lot of people who hate Facebook. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can't create this in Firefox I have to do it in Chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all flocked up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why doesn't Facebook have its own browser

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shouldn't they just have a Facebook offer computing as a service. I have so many questions about Facebook  They have the resources they could do it they do they could offer some really compelling things especially around I'll hate to say it AI  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good story on Axios about all  everybody cloning Clubhouse dollars flow to live audio as  moderation problems loom  Here are the people rolling out products that are

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  suspiciously like Clubhouse face add reddit to this list. It's brand new since then

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook Spotify Twitter  Discord we just used it Apple  It's gonna do its own audio news, but I don't know if they're gonna do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but this story is this moderation problem, how do you moderate audio?  Cuz it's it's fleeting. Yeah, it's ephemeral, right? Yeah, it's a lot harder to  Moderate it. You don't know it's gonna be there's gonna be awful stuff going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And and it's a club outside to shut down rooms discussing Jewish white privilege. Oh  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In other words anti-semitic rooms, right? Right? Well, we'll hire a tone version of an

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Privilege if you call it privilege, it's not discrimination. It's elitist  Medical elites the Jewish elites  Facebook's oversight board has decided to delay its decision for a few more weeks on the Trump ban so they can take comments

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They've been taking them they can read all 9,000 of it doesn't take weeks to read 9,000 comments, but okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have people to do that for do I sense a little?  Nervousness about their decision. What do you think they're gonna decide? So this is all about  President Trump being banned from Facebook  the Facebook oversight board which is a  High level group of how many it's like 30 people 20 20  But prestigious high quality people who can make binding decisions on Facebook's  Bans and other things and they took on the Trump ban  If they for instance announced that no you have to reinstate him Facebook would have to reinstate the former president

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Meanwhile Apple's putting parlor back under political pressure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're saying with some with some stipulations, right? Yeah. Yeah sure  That's really this you think they cave to political pressure  Apple who put perlina who who wants parlor back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they had the letters from the senators demanded Ted Cruz. I'm gonna say that they have a huge following so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody's gonna yell loud enough at the right people and clearly they did

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting should Twitter reinstate the president former president  No, it's so nice. It's been so quiet. Hasn't it? It's been so good Facebook reinstate him

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not quite the same. No, if he's not the president anymore. It kind of is an interesting question. Yes, because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's no longer a national leader. So he's not protected  If if he says something that others would be banned for I think you ban him, right?  Yeah, you don't give him special privilege. Maybe when he's the president you did they certainly did  But once you're not the president  If you say something that would

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anybody else to be banned for why wouldn't you be which would bring the argument that the stuff that was said was during the presidency  Shouldn't this like be white queen move white clean now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or a sins a sin and it's still on his record his permanent record as we said in high school

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if the issue isn't that he's sinned but the issue is that he's a powerful person deliberately spreading misinformation that has real-world  implications then  You could say he's no longer president so he can be as crazy as he wants to be as chop says

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's still a national leader, even if he's not in office, you know, he's a secret service  I mean, he's the titular leader of the Republican Party party. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think that's how you have to judge this call we can't just judge it based on the fact that you know  He's a crazy racist old man who's spewing vitriol all over Twitter. We have to say, okay  You know, is that any different from the other crazy racist old men's been a spilling picture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When you took the Twitter quiz we all took the Twitter quiz together  I think I remember what are you saying that that that prominent people should be held to a higher standard than the white boy?  Hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  higher standard or lower standard

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My my are you get some protection and higher. I did  powerful people should tell people the truth I think is kind of where I was I  Don't I know I do remember it is hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I know it's a really interesting question that was silly Stacey  I  Vote that they're scared of they're they're nervous about the decision in there. I think they'd oversee the way  Of course, right? It's a no-win

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean I I'll I think the oversight boards decision  I thought the oversight board was a decent idea well done and then the oversight board's decisions to date. I think have been awful  All in all and so I'm ready to you know, we'll see how they do on this one. Amazon is opening a hair salon  You sound through Alexa a little more off the top, please

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In partnership with the prominent UK stylists  The salon will includes tablets at every chair screened over we laughed on Amazon  We said Amazon said we're gonna open a grocery store  We're laughing out of the other side of our barcode desk this now  Salon will include tablets at every chair screened to virtually  Try on hair colors in a station to display information about products when a consumer physically has hair color  Points at them that one. I want that one mommy  I'm the marketing and technology thing. They said they didn't want to do more salons, but it's only open to employees at first  Yeah, this is just like Amazon go fashion  Didn't they do the same exact thing with Amazon go they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Know they bought Whole Foods and then they launched

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  SpaceX has won the contract with NASA to take people to the moon  And there is somewhere to get out on the moon. There's a lot of places you can get out  You don't need fire suppression because there's no air  This is this is actually  Big deal NASA did not was not funded really for the moon mission  Even though President Trump was a big supporter of a Congress never allocated the money  So they just didn't have the money the bids were out to the  Jeff Bezos is Blue Origin  and to a space company called Dynetics but SpaceX dramatically underbid those two and  Since NASA didn't have any money. They gave the contract the 2.9 billion dollar contract is SpaceX  Because NASA already has a launch system in progress  Even though the Starship that  Musk's building is capable of launching the astronauts from a launching pad and take them to the moon and taking them back  They won't be doing that  Because NASA has to use its SLS Orion project, which they have spent crazy billions of dollars building  so the astronauts will get in the Orion they'll fly to the  SpaceX Starship which will then take them the rest of the way the moon. So there's a transfer and  And  And then I just hate that on the subway. I know I know I just hate having to make a transfer  Yeah, and then what's cool about the about the Starship is it it's not good  There's no lunar land or the other companies bids were much more conventional with a separate lunar lander  As as you may know because we've seen the video of the Starship landing on earth  That's how Starship is gonna land on the moon. Just like a  1950s rocket machine Gordon. Yeah, it's gonna turn around  It's gonna fire its thrusters is slowly lower to the moon and then and you can kind of see it in this picture  The astronauts let's see if I can get zoom in a little bit on this picture are gonna get into a crane mechanism  Like for window washers and they're gonna be lowered my lord from

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're hoping for  2026 I think 2025 it's they're hoping to do it pretty soon NASA originally Trump originally promised I think 2024  But I think we're thinking maybe it's gonna take a little longer than that  So you got time your daughter might be grown by the time you can go  So really you would you would go to the moon cuz so would I I think it sounds like fun.

Yikes  That's pretty dominant. Yeah next down to Shopify  Three and a half. All right Joomla  To one and Squarespace and Wix are tied at one point six percent  Huge how their WordPress is dominant blogger bless its little surviving heart until until Google realizes we have that still  Why did we kill that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say 41% of all websites  I think that that's actually just as accurate because most websites are content management systems of some kind  So forty one percent of the entire web  Runs on WordPress when we were doing the ads  It was about thirty percent so I take credit for the final eleven percent

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My pick of the week  Oh  It is a power supply out door outlet. This is IPV or IPV

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  65 rated but if you want to pee outside, it'd be a very handy thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Say it is it's not IPV. Is this a cassette?  This is a cassette. So what you need to know about this. This is a connected outdoor outlet  It is expensive a F y'all it is 79 95 Wow  And you might be like wow, I can buy two outlets that are home kit certified for like 50 bucks and you can  And I recommend you do that if that's your jam, but this is good because it is  Lutron  It's also  But this is this is temperature rated to below 20 degrees to 50 degrees Celsius

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is for your Christmas lights

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your word like Minnesota Minnesota

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Christmas lights

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think most of the outdoor outlets are not IP 65 rated  They're usually IP 64 rated which is a little less water resistant  This guy I have not tried this one, but I have one outside  I went out and bought one because I live in Seattle and there's tons of rain and my string lights  It would be more convenient to have them not under an Eve for the outlet  So they've been outside for four weeks in Seattle weather granted the last week has been very very nice  Y'all but prior to that super rainy and so far it hasn't shorted or done anything terrible  Because it's caseta it will it links back to any  Cassetta bridge that if you have the cassette a bridge in your home  It's so easy to set up any and this is why I love all blue trunk products one  We try will back you up and they have the greatest technical support ever  But be to set it up you literally plug this in you go to the app and you're like, I want to add a device  It's like what device do you want you pick this device and then you hold this button right here down in  Ten seconds later. It's linked to the app and you're done. It's so nice  Is it pictures?  No, it is oh it is radio. It's not radio. I'm so sorry. It is their caseta clear connect is the  And this is a thousand feet  Yeah, this is a great protocol

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I were gonna if I were gonna get a lighting automation you think Lutron would be the way to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you were putting smart lighting in your home  Lutron like it's bar none my favorite King of the Hill hands down the best

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, and it works with the Google Assistant it works with home kit it works with Amazon echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to have a hub to connect it to Wi-Fi because this is remember it's it's the the  Clear connect. Sorry, they have a fancier version. It's important to know that Lutron has caseta, which is their DIY smart home stuff  and then they have  Fancy Lutron that it like a control for vendors or someone will say yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's a big that's expensive to that stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's radio  outdoor Lutron like lights  Very expensive. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah, and this is this again this is expensive  But and I'll tell you in a year, but it's it's a much you could feel it. It's a much higher quality build

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks it looks powerful  Looks powerful looks like the kind of light plug Darth Vader might have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, very glossy black and powerful looking well, I haven't there's there's plastic on this. Oh, no, it is glossy  Yeah, I never take the plastic off of anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trust me. That was that was just a prelude to the problems of that thing never was very good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But at least it you know once you took the plastic off it looked a little bit better  So now I make it like a religious fetish of it to go through and make sure all plastic is removed  time of use  And it is it is it's very satisfying to peel peel the plastic off  Although I found a plastic covering on my PC. I guess when when stuffs made in China  It's just their habit to cover every glossy surface with film of plastic  So I just I didn't even realize month after I get the PC there's a very thin film plastic on the  Thank You Stacy, I'm glad you found the box cutter
