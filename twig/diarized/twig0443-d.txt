This week in Google, a show where we cover not just Google-ish,  but Facebook-y, Twitter-y, and that kind of thing. Stacey Higginbotham's here. She is an IOT  maven. So we also cover a lot of IOT with Stacey. Stacey on IOT.com. Hello, Stacey.  Hello. Thank you for agreeing to appear on our panel at South By.  Yes, March 9th, very early in the morning. Yeah. Well, you know, that way you have the rest of the  day. Oh, yes, that's it. You can drive your daughter to school and come to the panel and then  have the rest of the day to enjoy South By. Yeah, it's the first day of Interactive and we'll be at  Anton's, the Capital One house. And we're going to have a panel on security and we've got some  interesting guests to be announced. But Stacey's number one in my list. Thank you, Stacey, for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  doing that. Appreciate it. I can teach everyone how not to be secure. Put a lot of connected

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  gadgets in your house. Yeah, really. You can come to Anton's. I think we'll be starting around  8.30 a.m. or 9. So come to Anton's in the morning. We'll have breakfast for you. You can have  something to eat and see that before the festivities of South By, really. Also with us, Mr. Jeff  Jarvis. He is from the City University of New York. He teaches journalism there, CUNY. He's actually  more than just teaching. He is leading the CUNY graduate program in journalism. No, no, no, no,  no. Leading. I got a boss. I got a boss. Yeah, everybody's got a boss. As I was once told,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  there's always a man. Yes, it is. There's always a man. My boss is a woman. Yeah. Well, your woman's  the man. It's confusing, but true. Yeah, I'm not. Dig that hole, Leo. And meanwhile, no, I mean the  man as a concept, not a man. And we have Mr. Rogers as our host today. What? The sweater,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  kind of Mr. Roger-y, I think. Oh, it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood. Hello, everybody.  I am Fred Rogers and I'm here to do the show. Big story breaking moments ago. Well, an hour ago.  That's moments ago. Nest is done as a, according to Ronam Audio at Ars Technica, as a standalone  alphabet company, it's merging with Google. How do you think, Stacey, this is your beat,  how do you think that changes what Nest's up to and why would they do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is a face saving effort. So, you know, 2014, they bought Nest for $3.2 billion.  That's a lot of money. And so far, according to CNET, they did an interview, Nest has only sold

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  11 million devices. So they're not making their money back. That's for sure. Not a lot. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the idea, they're spinning this as, oh, we're going to be closer to Google. We're going to have  access to their AI and this is going to allow us to better compete with Amazon Echo and, I guess,  HomePod. But this really is just a face saving thing. They had access to Google's AI chops.  Nest Cam has had that in it for a couple months. They've been putting Google Assistant on Nest Cam.  So my hope is that if they do this, they will help Nest maybe launch cheaper products because  that's one of the things holding Nest back. And then two, somebody brought up, and this is a  really good question. They were like, so when Google bought Nest, we really cared about what  was going to happen to our data. And Google said, we're not touching it. So what does this mean?  That's why they kept it separate. Well, it's one of the reasons. But I emailed Nest and here's  what they said. Ta-da, this is from Matt Plagle, who's a Nest spokesman. Nest users' data will  continue to be used for limited purposes described in their privacy statements, like providing,  developing, and improving Nest services and products. But here it comes. As we develop  future plans and future product integrations, we will be transparent with users about the benefits  of those integrations, any changes to the handling of data, and the choices available to consumers in  connection with those changes. So basically, keep an eye on the DOS. What do you think it'll  amount to? I think you could do things like if they have access to Who's Home and data from like  the Nest thermostat, for example, you can already, you have to manually link that to your Google  Assistant. It's possible that one day it could just show up naturally. It just kind of gets eaten  up into the Google services and happens automatically without you opting in, if that makes sense.  And then with the security system, they're going to have a lot of information about coming and  going. And that might actually be good, because one of the big challenges with the smart home  today is there's not a lot of context about who's in the home and where they are in the home. So  presence in the home. So this could help with that. It's not merely the cost of buying Nests. They had

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  virtually unlimited funds, a huge influx of resources, Ron describes it. It quadrupled

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  employee headcount. It bought DropCam. Google bought DropCam. They started the deal for DropCam  before Nest was bought. But they merged it with that can. Yeah, and I don't think they were happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  about that. Yeah. Tony Fidel left two years after the DropCam acquisition. And at that point, they  had two products. They had the Nest Thermostat and the DropCam, actually rebranded as the NestCam.  Since they've added under their new CEO Marwan Fawaz, they've added the security system,  the $300 NestCam IQ, which I bought and you called me a doofus. And it's right behind me.  And now I saw it on the Super Bowl, a Nest ad for a doorbell, which I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. They also had actually a smoke detector. I don't know if you remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yeah, the one you waved at it and it disabled it permanently. Yeah, that was good. That was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  useful. In case while your house was on fire. Yeah. They fixed it. Yeah. When you hear a sound

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  from the smoke detector, wave at it. We just won't bother you again.  They fixed that by the way. That was an easy firmware fix. Hardware, software and services  will be combined according to Google, all built with Google's artificial intelligence and  assistant at the core. I guess this makes sense. I mean, according to the journal,  they'd already combined their supply chain teams two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well then they're not going to lower prices. Dang it. No benefit to that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do you think of the Nest products as put your reviewer wig on?  This is my reviewer wig. Okay. Okay. She's already got it on.  What do you think of their products? I mean, you did call me, I do remember Adufus for buying the  IQ. I think you wanted me to buy the Lighthouse instead, which I ended up doing, and they became

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a sponsor actually. So that worked out. I think they have, they're good products.  They're just expensive. You can get very similar products for less. And so that's always been

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the key. We were all in on DropCam when it was still an independent company. We still have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  bunch of DropCams all over the place. Yeah, but the DropCam started out not crazy expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it was cheap. You know what's expensive in all of these? And I had never really thought about it  until we set them up is the bandwidth. Oh yeah. They use it too. If you set them in HD mode,  anything that's always on is going to consume a megabyte, a megabit a second all the time.  And so you really don't want an always on camera. You want a camera that wakes up sometimes.  But all the Nest stuff, I think you could, because I know, because I could scroll back

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in time for my Nest cameras. And a lot of people like that because the motion detection doesn't  always catch things in time and start recording in time on some cameras. So I had somebody who  was like, oh, the Arlos are terrible because they didn't catch a burglar, but my Nest cam did. And  then so there's trade-offs. Now the challenge, what we should be hacked off about our bandwidth

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  caps. So that's, if I didn't have anger in the right place, but I routinely go over my,  two or three, no, I have two terabyte a month bandwidth cap from Comcast on. So I actually  have a second network, which is good for security anyway, for the cameras because bandwidth is,  you know, they're just, they just eat up bandwidth. On the other hand, I do, I have to say,  I do like always on, you're right, because what I frequently do with it is go back in time. By the  way, that's good also for the company because you have to pay for storage. That's, they're going to  get you a month, not only they get the $300 for the camera, but they're going to get a monthly fee  as you record, like here's, here's my driveway. I can see, you know, what's going on. Somebody's  stealing my car right now. So it's kind of fun though, to be able to scroll back through this.  And this is what always on gives you is this ability. I said, what, oh, I guess nothing's  happening. No, no, there's, it's not doing it. Well, anyway, you can scroll back in time. Oh,  I see. Here it is. Yeah, it's slow. Again, that's more my bandwidth issue than, than the nest  cameras. Again, anger at Comcast. Yeah, nothing but. All right. So  it's not going to change how they do business. It's really more, it's a, it's a financial

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  thing. It's a, it's a, I think it's just a logistical thing. I mean, they're just like, fine,  you guys, you're not, you're not doing it. Come back in. The other option was they were going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  sell them. Does it mean Ruth Porat now starts paying closer attention to what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think she's probably been paying close attention to those other bets for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So who's in charge of hardware at Google and at this report to Rick Osterloh is now in charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's all Marwan Marwan was the CEO Marwan was was the CEO of nest. And now he reports to  Rick Osterloh, Rick, which we don't mind, right? We like Rick. Rick's good. And both Rick and Marwan  have telco type backgrounds. So yeah, he came from Motorola. He was

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the guy who introduced the Motorola X, the Moto X, which I really liked.  Yes, we all did. Yeah. Another acquisition, which just broke well yesterday, right before the show.  Well, was it yesterday? Oh, no, you're right. Six 53 Pacific. So this morning Vidcom, this is  from variety announces the acquisition Viacom announces the acquisition of Vidcon. That's the,  the conference where all the YouTube stars get screaming crazy mad fans. Jeff, you go every year

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to video. I go every year. It changed my view of media. It's really a cool conference. It's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  vlog brothers that own it, right? John and Hank Green, John and Hank Green. And so there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  lane, Jim Lauderback, our old friend from podcast three and Jim, of course, was in tech TV. My  colleague was running the industry track there at Vidcon and I'm on the advisory board for that  set industry track. And then he took over CEO. And I think probably to do this.  How much money do you think Viacom paid for this?  So it's a good enterprise. They get, they get 30,000 people in Anaheim. I think 40,000 people now

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  internationally, 80 sponsors, 45 exhibitors. Now that's not a CES size by any means. No,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but it's, but that's good. Is it? It's very good. It's very healthy. I'm sure there's a metric like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  $10 per attendee or something, but it's gotta be more than that. And I think probably if Viacom's  buying it, it's not just to continue business as usual. They must have plans for the brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would, I would imagine there could be shows, you know, obviously the green,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  they probably want to do, I would guess they want to do a comic con style expansion, right?  Oh my God, my daughter would pay so much money. YouTube, it'd be like ice capades, right? Ice  capades would tour around with the most recent skating stars. There'll be a VidCon capades,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Vidcapades, Vidcapades. Except there's, there's something about being in the one place.  When they went to Europe, Europe's really going to be pretty much business to business. It's  going to be industry. Yeah, but VidCon Austin, you know, we've got at least one person going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep, exactly. Yep. And VidCon Australia got a lot of people out. The adult, adult companion.  Um, Hank Green will apparently be continued to be evolved. Isn't he the author too though? Didn't he  write, um, the, the best sellers turtles on the way down? John Greenwood, his brother wrote that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but then Hank just put it, it's just putting out a novel as well. Wow. These guys are such  overachievers. They've got all their educational efforts. They've got all their other things that  they do on their own. Um, and, uh, so that'll obviously continue on their own. I don't understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  how do you be a bestselling novelist and run a video convention and run the, this vlog business  and how, how I don't, it's all I can do to get my clothes on in the morning and come in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's when you're young, you have a lot of energy. Are they young? I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot younger. Um, no, when you add, add to this when, you know, cause John's latest novel,  which I read, which is very good is about having OCD, severe OCD. Yeah. And you think about that  burden on top of everything else. So he had, he is OCD. Oh yes. He talks about this. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, he's apparently going to stay with the novels. Yes. I, everybody loves them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love them both. They're really, really quite something and very generous with their fans. And  my daughter is a big fan of both. She has her autographed bobblehead green brother dolls.  So they are YouTube stars in their own right. Oh, absolutely. And authors. I mean, the YouTube  stuff they do, they do the vlog brothers, which is just them talking. Then they have  the educational series that they do, which are pretty amazing. What are they called? Stacey?  You've mentioned that before. I forget suddenly. I have. Yeah. I thought you had, I think your

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  daughter said, oh, maybe not. I'm blanking. I don't know. Let's see. Uh, the most recent post  is called sawdust bread in which John discusses the quality of 18th century French bread in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  nearness of history. Oh, I have, I've referenced these. I didn't realize. Yes. Crash course. They

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  do a lot of, uh, of history. John does more history and Hank does more science put together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is a YouTube channel. It's a place, you know, where like YouTube videos go here on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  particular YouTube channel, my brother and I have two years teaching courses and quick 10 to 15  minute episodes. John has taught world history, American history, and some literature while Hank

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  has taught biology, ecology, and general chemistry. Now, when people ask us why we do this and how we  want these things to be used, we don't really have a coherent answer. We're just trying to  create educational content in the hopes that it will be useful to people. That's pretty altruistic.  And now in 2014, we're teaching new subjects. Thank you. Teaching psychology, literature,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and expanding upon. Um, I should know that. Uh, well, let's see here. Here's YouTube money.  They get the YouTube ads. Oh, I'm YouTube red. So I would never know. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. I  don't get to see the, uh, so they make money on this, but I'm sure they make more money on the  novel or Hank makes more money than novels. And John, I would imagine movies and yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there's also the, the merge when you go to VidCon, don't forget to be,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I am being very crass. Of course. Who cares if they make money? They're doing wonderful things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you, you have to make money even, or even if you want to do wonderful things,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but they don't have to make a lot of money if they're just doing wonderful things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cause the other weird thing is that, is that Hanks and Missoula and John's in Indianapolis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh wow. That way. Wow. Oh, I didn't know that. Interesting. Yeah. And then  but VidCon in LA, louder backs up here in half moon Bay, unless he moved. Right. VidCon is just  in LA when it's there. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. I could, I could tell you know what I,  I'm going to channel Viacom. I could, I think what Viacom is thinking is  Comic-Con knows how Comic-Con is really branched out all over the world and making a lot of money.  There was even a Comic-Con channel. Lionsgate did a $5 a month Comic-Con channel. I'm sure Viacom's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  thinking right down those lines. Yeah. Events. They have other events and they won't be in the  events business. And the events business is a great hedge against pure advertising and pure content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's not scalable and that's the challenge. Everybody always said we should,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Twitch should do events and I just, I'm again, it's all I can do to get up in the morning. So,  but highly profitable. Is it, it's probably, yeah. You, because GigaOM did events, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  GigaOM, our events were hugely profitable, but they were not, you couldn't scale them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cause you have a limited. Tent quality. Yeah. Stacy, I think the difference here is though,  I think, I think you're right on a pure B2B level, but on this fan level. Yeah. You could scale.  The, the event, the event is the highlight of an ongoing membership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  True. And I mean, there's, there've been a couple, what's her name? I think it was Miranda or no,  it was another YouTube comedian came into Austin and we paid an exorbitant amount for standing room.  You know, I say, I say it is like, I'm like, oh, I'm not seated. It's terrifying,  but standing room at her show and it was, you know, us and a million preteen girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Set expectations for your South by Southwest appearance with us.  There will be seating room. There may even be empty seats, but I think, I think we will surely  have a 10, 12, maybe even 15 people in the audience. So just to set expectations. There'll be plenty of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  bagels for everybody. No, what is it? We're getting breakfast, breakfast tacos, but breakfast,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  if there are bagels, no bagels, breakfast tacos or burritos. No breakfast tacos. I loved,  you gotta do regional tacos. That's right. You gotta do regional Joanna Stern. She's reviewing  Naples news speaker, which comes out Friday, the home pod and, and likens it to bagels  and says it's three stacked New York bagels. And it just shows you, and you know this, Jeff,  cause you lit, you work in Manhattan. There's nothing more provincial than a Manhattanite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What? They're provincial. No, no, we are the center of the universe. Oh, that's, oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right. That's it. Yeah. That's, that's the ego center. That's what provincial means.  Cause we deserve to be the center of the universe. What do we need? Yeah, we are. Sure. We are. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You, yeah. You and you and the chicken capital and you and the tattoo capital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. But we at least know that Petaluma doesn't have any cache. In fact, worse,  it smells like manure half the time. Our cache is woo. If we had, if we ever do a perfume,  that's organic. It'll be Petaluma. Woo. Alphabet announces fourth quarter in fiscal year,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  2017 results. We buried the lead. Nine. No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,  wait, I'm waiting. The lead has to be spaceman. God, was that, was that amazing? All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, forget Alphabet's results. This is no longer this week in Google. It's this week in spaceman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wasn't it awe inspiring? Wasn't it so wonderful to look up, not down? Wasn't it just phenomenal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You had a great tweet, Jeff. You said, this is reminds me of the sixties where it's hope above

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and anger or hate or distress. Anger below. Yeah. And it is true, isn't it? And the Guardian

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  wrote a very miserable editorial. They were, what a surprise. They've gone so anti-tech.  I know you're no longer a Guardian fan, but they basically said, you know, there's people dying in  Syria and we're celebrating, you know, a billion die. The headline literally is why Elon Musk's  space launch is utterly depressing. Oh, geez. I know. Come on. No, this was not depressing.  This is moral panic. Well, it's just, Oh, there are people dying in Syria. It's not a zero sun  game. We have enough to do both. Trust me. This is a fraction of the cost. It's a non- Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we integrated the schools and had Tang at the same time. That's right. That's right. Thank God

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  for that. So this, Elon is by the way, if there's one takeaway from this, besides just excitement  over, you know, just the gorgeous miracle of it is, Elon's the best marketer in the world.  Oh God, is he brilliant? So before he goes on, before the flight, he goes on the Today Show  yesterday and says, well, they, the engineers tell me two, two chances out of three, it's just  going to blow up right there on the pad. I'm thinking I'm optimistic 50 50. So now you have

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to watch, right? Right. You're like, Oh my God, it's going to either take off and be awesome,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  or it's going to explode and be awesome. It's going to be the biggest rocket ever exploding on the pad.  So you have to watch. You watch and it's perfection. There's 27 engines. Even one of them is off by one  millimeter. The rocket doesn't go up. It goes perfect straight up in the air. Then the pièce  de résistance as the three boosters come off, the two side boosters land like freaking synchronized

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  swimmers. Flash Gordon time. What did happen to the main booster? I never saw a report. It did fall

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  into the ocean. It didn't make it. And fortunately, no pictures to spoil your memories. Yes.  And you know what? This was still a total success. But the best part, and when I read this  a month ago that Elon said, I'm going to put my roadster on this, I thought, oh yeah, come on,  Elon, it's going to have a dummy in it. Spaceman and it's going to be playing in a loop. David Bowie's  space out his ground control to major Tom. Okay. I thought he's not going to do it. Star man,  star man, not star man. So I thought, okay, fine. So he does it, right? Oh, that's cool. What I  didn't know is that when the capsule gets into earth orbit, the fairing come off and the star  man and the Tesla are floating in space. Oh, coincidentally, there happened to be cameras

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  all around it. Yeah, of course. With the lighting just like perfect. Well, the lighting provided by

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the sun and the earth. I mean, it's stunning. And of course it's, it's a subtle ad because there's  the Tesla logo on the steering wheel. He could have put the Tesla logo on the screen. Instead,  he puts Douglas Adams, great words from hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. Don't panic on the screen.  And we're just watching this and I want this as a screen saver. I mean, well, I put my favorite

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  picture just up on the chat. Leo. Oh, good. My favorite star man pictures there on the chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just so stunning. And by the way, a massive ad for Tesla, ultimately in a way, right? So Elon's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's just, isn't that amazing? Isn't that phenomenal? So right now, for those of you on  audio right now, it's the, it's the, it's the side image with the earth in the background,  just driving along, cruising past the earth. Unbelievable. Isn't that gorgeous? And the earth,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  of course, the star man is wrote to is in earth orbit. So the earth is slowly setting out.  He's on his way, right? They're going to send it out to the asteroid belt. Yeah. It was a, I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it was a little off the plan trajectory. So it's going way past Mars, almost to Ceres and into the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  asteroid belt. Yeah. And Elon's saying all these things like, I can't wait 2 million years from now.  And, you know, alien archeologists find this. What are they going to think? And so the asteroid is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  going to bang it up. Well, there are those who say it won't this. Yeah. It's going to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  pulverized as it probably will by space dust. So how does it, so this is the question I really,  I was looking for a story on this and I didn't see it. This is Jeff's favorite from, from

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  of four O coaches.com and your dog recognized it immediately. I think that's interesting.  She was very intent. She's, she says, I see a dog in space. I'd like to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to know how the, the camera is transmitting. That's a lot of data to come down from space.  I know we have satellites sending data all the time. It's all made up, Stacey. We didn't go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the moon. The Tesla is not up there. It's all in a studio somewhere in California. It's too perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was, I really wanted to read like what kind of a communication setup they have. So that was just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  my, how long the batteries are going to last and is it still broadcasting? Yeah. It'll, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it's got a pretty big battery pack in that thing. I imagine it is of course, by the way, understand  they're in a vacuum. So you can't hear it. It's a, John just showed me the circuit board that has  the music loop on it and it has printed on the circuit board made on earth by humans, just in  case, just in case. We have control. Vager, it's going to come out a lot of Vager jokes. It's going  to come back and be looking for a supercharger, things like that. Yeah. It didn't hit the orbit

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that they planned. No, it's slightly off. It doesn't matter. That's what they were doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. They're testing the rockets. I mean, they don't, you know, that's nothing. This is a massive  success. You couldn't. Yes, it is. Yeah, you're right. That should be the lead because-  Sorry, but we had to. This is a science loving show. But it's also-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You haven't had quits in. It's happy. We got an answer on the chat room saying that  SpaceX paid NASDAQ to use their TDRS network. So-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's where the pictures are coming from. Yeah. I mean, it's not that far from earth. You won't see  pictures now, right? I mean, it's not going to continue to stream. Well, that's what I wanted,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but yes. That's what I'm asking is how long did the streaming continue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I'm sure. John's going to tell me he's our space exit. Elon tweeted the last picture recently  because as it gets outside away from the earth, you can't, you know, it's not, I mean, they're not  going to spend money sending, peeping back the same picture. Although if he gets, if he,  Space Man gets to Mars, wouldn't mind seeing a little Mars set.  Yeah, you want to see it. You want to wake up then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Okay. Oh, the network provides six megabits per second and 800 megabits in the KUKA bands.  So now I know. Now I feel like better. How about this picture? Give Apple Maps

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  another try, they said. It's gotten a lot better, they said.  A dog. There's so many jokes about this.  That last picture is amazing. Oh, let's go see it. Oh, we got to do it.  Elon Musk Twitter. It's Instagram actually.  It's Instagram. Okay. Yeah. Geez.  It really does bring back the blue marble, you know, that everybody talks about and  you get, you get a great sense of, Oh my God. Isn't that beautiful?  It's going off into space. The last picture of Starman and Roadster  on route to Mars orbit and then the asteroid belt. Wow. Wow. And of course the earth is,  is receding in the distance that yeah, I want that as a desktop picture.  Yeah. Yeah. That is, that is something. And of course, again, he's in a Tesla.  Yeah. I mean, come on. What I mean, you know, if Pepsi did that, people would be infuriated.  Yeah. If he was holding a Pepsi in his hand, people would have hit the roof.  But we don't, we don't somehow, Elon, we don't mind. Oh, here's the,  this is also from his Instagram. Here's the image of the circuit board made on earth by humans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. The only thing more perfect is if,  is if a star man had brought out a flame thrower, boring machine, flame thrower.  I'm sorry. My other tweet, my other tweet was that's the biggest damn flame thrower ever made

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  as soon as it was going off. Here's the, here's the picture of the two rockets landing as if in ballet.  And you know, whatever the guardian says, yeah, we've got troubles here on earth.  And we're, you know, but the science is important.  You know what? I wouldn't even argue that this is science. It is, but that's not even  important. Inspiration is important. One of the ways you solve problems here on earth is to remind  us we're all in this little blue marble in the middle of nowhere, all together at once, that we  are, we as humans have aspirations that are phenomenal and that we are capable of amazing  things. All of that, some school kid is seeing that launch. And as I did when I was a kid watching  Gemini and Apollo and getting excited about life, about what's possible about, yes, STEM,  but even more than that, I think this is huge. I think it's fabulous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tweeted this, but I will say that my daughter was like, this is awesome.  But now he's littering in space. She's very concerned.  Well, yes, no, it's okay.  We had a whole discussion about space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It will be worse in earth orbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's going there. Every flight does environmental damage. Think about the amount  of fuel it's consuming, the pollution that that causes. There's a lot. In fact, some have said  that SpaceX's launches are just barely offset by how much energy Tesla's have saved.  That's a point.  But again, it's not a zero sum game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, the other thing that with this anti-corporate,  and I do still love the Guardian, but they're sometimes a shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just an op-ed. I don't know if it represents their entire...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they've been going so anti-tech lately. Next time I see them, I'm going to beat them  up a lot of them. But anyway, it did occur as I'm doing research on this notion of the mass,  I was reading some stuff and it occurred to me that if you look at some of the exploration  back in the day, whether it was the Pilgrims actually being subsidized by venture capital  of the day, the Hudson's Bay Company into Canada, the Indian venture for Britain was...  The venture started as corporate. The future was explored by companies and by capitalists of a  sort. Imperialists.  Imperialists. Yeah, and all the bad things that come with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, it's an interesting point because imperialism, and it did create horrific  disruptions that we still suffer from in the Middle East and Africa and elsewhere,  was also a civilizing force. So yeah, I mean, it's not completely... It's not black and white.  Here, but I did not know this. Did you know this, John, that on the dashboard of the Roadster is  a matchbox Roadster with a tiny star man in it?  Oh no.  And in the matchbox Roadster on the dashboard is another even tight... No, I'm just joking.  It would be good though if there was...  There was also somebody else...  ...with Roadsters all the way down would be very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It would be very good. There's also some kind of new mechanism to try to store all the  all-terrest knowledge and a new format was put on the Roadster.  Interesting.  Yeah, I wonder what else is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just put Wikipedia on it. Put a little thumb drive with Wikipedia on it.  That would be easy. Not that aliens or anybody you were getting it would be able to read it,  but at least, you know, kind of fun to say you did it.  There isn't the equivalent of the big gold disc that was on Voyager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but there was a little disc. What the hell was it? Oh hell, I saw the story.  It was some kind of new format for... But it didn't store much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's from the Verge. SpaceX flight included a copy of the Foundation novels.  What didn't store much?  On an Arch storage disc.  So not the DVD of the Will Smith movie?  Not the Will Smith DVD. It's a 5D laser optical quartz storage device  that is meant to be able to survive even in the harsh conditions of space.  So the Arch Mission Foundation's goal is to preserve libraries of human knowledge for  interstellar travel. So that's what you're talking about. The Arch Mission Foundation.  That's not very good searching.  Our chat room. They're the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good chat room.  So I bet we're going to find other things. There's a Pepsi in the glove compartment after all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't mind if it's in the glove compartment as long as it just doesn't become an ad for Pepsi.  Yeah, I know.  And you know, for some reason, nobody seems to mind that it's an ad for Tesla.  No.  It's a subtle ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's his $90 million rocket.  I know.  I was about to say he built it.  He could have put concrete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's much more, frankly, inspiring than what he did was much more inspiring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is. And it has a sense of humor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. You got to admire Elon. He thinks outside the box to say the least.  King Elon.  No. I've now come to the conclusion after...  Okay. So now we learned Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook hired a pollster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's more common than you know.  I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Far more common than corporations.  Well, we know that, for instance, the board of Uber, when it was trying to get rid of  Travis Kalanick, commissioned a survey to find out how people felt about the CEO.  And that was some of the ammunition they used when they approached Travis and said,  you got to go look at your numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I just found out about a major tech executive, I won't say who,  who has his own, who commissions his own political polling and polling in the country.  Okay. Why does he do that?  I think wanting to get the zeitgeist and understand how to cause change and things.  I mean, these folks do fancy themselves the Hudson's Bay Company of the future, right?  And so they want to know what's what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess public opinion is part of business.  You know, you...  Yeah, it is.  And the ebb and flow of the economy is certainly something you'd like to be able to prepare for.  So I understand that.  But I think it's interesting that this pollster, Tavis McGinn, who actually was a market researcher,  he wasn't, he didn't go to the standard Paul's to hire somebody.  This was a guy who worked with advertisers on marketing campaigns.  But he was asked during the interview process,  would you like to track the public perception of Mark Zuckerberg?  This is April 2017.  And, you know, so already Facebook's in trouble for the election, right?  This is already they're getting heat.  And Mark was on his tour, right?  Where he was the listening tour, where he was kind of doing a quasi political thing.  McGinn told The Verge,  it was my job to do surveys and focus groups globally to understand why people like Mark  Zuckerberg, why people like Mark Zuckerberg, whether they think they can trust him and  whether they've even heard of him, not just in the US, but it's especially important outside  the United States.  And it turns out he did the same thing for Sheryl Sandberg.  And one of the things they had him survey was,  do you associate Facebook's CEO Sheryl Sandberg with Facebook or with Lean In and Option B,  her personal initiatives, obviously trying to figure out, hmm,  is Sandberg becoming more famous than we are?  I don't, I, anyway, the reason I brought it up is I feel like we already know Dwayne Johnson  wants to run for president.  Oprah Winfrey wants to run for president.  Guarantee you Bloomberg, Zuckerberg and others want to run for president.  Celebrities and technologists, both are looking at the White House and starting to be their  beady eyes on it.  And I do not want a billionaire or a famous person to be elected just because they're  a billionaire or a famous person.  Oprah and I know Oprah doesn't want to run.  Mark doesn't want to run.  Nobody wants to run until they run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it reminds me of, OK, I'm just going to say it, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,  because you don't have the real power isn't the president.  What's happening is.  It's all a performance is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't know.  That's that may be true.  I mean, I think Jeff and I went as Democrats when Obama was elected, we had high hopes.  And just as every president before him, he went in with hopes to change the world and  ended up being able to do very little because of a lot of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And that's I mean, that's life.  You go in with big expectations and the world and experience kind of beats you down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, Trump may have been more effective, frankly, in his first year than Obama was  in his first year.  No.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Talk me down.  Nice try for going for the contrarian thing nearly.  Oh, but no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm like, he did one piece of legislation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look what he's done with the EPA.  Look what he's done with.  He's destroyed a lot.  Yes.  Look what he's done with life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you want to blow up a system, it is much easier to blow something up than it is to  build something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, there you go.  Just ask the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the excuse.  It's not.  Well, it's true the Internet, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can tear down Egypt.  It's harder to build it back up.  So I'm listening to Ron Chernow's Grant biography right now.  Yes.  And it is striking how up through the civil up to the Civil War, he was just a horrendous  loser.  He was a nice guy and a chump, and he kept losing money on business venture after business  venture.  And yet the man became the head of the army in the Civil War, accepted the Appomattox  defeat and became president of the United States.  Not to mention he was a drunk.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that'll be interesting.  That'd be a great book to read.  He Chernow wrote the Hamilton book, of course, and it is very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's depressing, actually, in the beginning.  Oh, Jesus.  Another thousand dollars gone.  Grant was a complete loser.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  So yeah, it's not as if presidents came from being.  Oh, no, we've had some brilliant people.  We've had many, many bad ones.  Was he a bad president?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  That's a funny point, though, right?  Was he?  I don't know.  Not there yet.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was affiliated with scandal, but I have no idea if he was a bad president.  I mean, how do you measure a president?  That's the other thing.  I mean, like what you measure by legislation.  Oh, we're learning how now.  That's that's.  I mean, there's there's lots of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See the new floor for which to judge.  Sorry, people.  I know I get in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, when we have our military parade in July,  you're going to be the guy standing in front of the tank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love a parade.  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  do we want to talk about Alphabet's revenue?  Let's take a break.  Let's go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, let's come back to it.  OK, we'll get to it.  We should get to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, this is about there is some there is some stuff and actually even related stuff  because Alphabet had to pay nine point nine dollars in tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Explain to me how that happened.  I can explain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what I figured you could.  I can't explain.  Well, after this, they actually lost money because of it, but not really.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Revenue is up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Profits are down.  It all has to do with nine point nine billion dollars in income tax.  But first, or corporate tax, do you call corporate taxes income taxes?  I guess not.  No, they're just corporate taxes.  Because corporations, even though they're people, don't have income.  See, that's how you have to do it, Jeff.  You got to just the shots need to be subtle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just like little subtle subtly.  True subtly.  I was like, that's about as subtle as my hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on, Leo.  That's subtly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been thinking about dog whistles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm in the market.  I just figure, you know, if we could come up with see, that's what we need to do.  We need better dog whistles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what I'm saying?  That is that is not what we need.  OK, that's part of our problem.  Let's go advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Next time you're ready to buy a house, can I make a recommendation?  Actually, I do notice interest rates.  One of the reasons stock market plunged last week is because the market was convinced interest rates would go up.  The Fed has already said we're going to raise them a few times.  It's a good time maybe to refi.  You don't even have to be in the market for a house.  I know it's a lot of houses on the market, though, right now.  This be good time.  Good time to buy.  Good time to refi.  And if you do, I want you to remember this address.  Rocket mortgage dot com slash twig.  See, this is a mortgage entirely on online mortgage approval process.  It comes from our friends at Quicken Loans, who are absolutely great.  Number one in customer satisfaction.  Eight years in a row, according to JD Power for mortgage approval.  Even with all those awards, they weren't satisfied.  Don't you love that?  They said there's something wrong with the mortgage approval process.  It's it's dated.  It needs a client focused technological revolution.  And they created Rocket Mortgage.  You can do the whole thing.  Oh, I love did you see the Super Bowl ads for Rocket Mortgage?  Go see the website because they're hysterical.  Hysterical with Keegan Michael Key.  Just doing a great job.  Anyway, they created Rocket Mortgage.  You can do it entirely on your phone.  No, there's no jargon, no mystery.  You simply set up an account rocket mortgage dot com slash twig.  Give them some basic information.  You don't even have to look it up.  I know you know it.

Rocketmortgage.com slash twig equal housing lender.  Licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access dot org number 3030.  Rocket Mortgage, Quicken Loans.  Thank you for your support this week and Google.  Did you either of you watch the Super Bowl?  Most of it.  TiVo did a funny thing.  You know, they have a skip commercial button and it's not for all shows.  But if you TiVo a show, some shows, I guess they have to have permission.  You skip the Super Bowl and go to the commercials?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Oh, brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wasn't that brilliant?  So instead of skipping the commercials, you press D and it skips all the football.  It goes right to the commercial.  That's brilliant.  So Lisa and I, the day after the Super Bowl, we watched it but I had to work and stuff.  So we watched, it's the day after, I said let's watch the commercials.  Let's watch the Super Bowl.  We sat down, I had it on my TiVo and we within, it took us only, you know, maybe 15, 20 minutes.  We saw all the commercials one after the other.  Which was the best one in your view?  Tide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, with David Harbour?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  Stranger Things?  Okay.  He did his Stranger Things dance in one of them?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was so cute.  I thought the Amazon was good.  The thing that, reason I think Tide won is because after that you thought every commercial,  what Tide did was they set it up that we're going to, every commercial is really a Tide  commercial.  And so they had parodies of all these commercials and it was really a Tide commercial because  everybody's wearing super clean clothes.  And so they set it up so that everything you saw from then on, you thought is this a Tide  commercial?  They got people every single commercial thinking is this a Tide commercial?  And some of them were.  So must have cost them 10 million because it's $5 million for half a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And nobody was eating pods in any of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, they didn't even mention Tide pods.  But you know what?  Fine.  I wouldn't expect them to.  No, no.  It's a Tide ad.  So what did you, you said you liked?  I liked the Amazon.  Amazon with Jeff Bezos?  Should we play it?  Yeah, let's play it.  I think it's appropriate for us.  Because it's very funny.  But we were talking about this on Windows Weekly and I think that maybe Paul Therotte  got it right when he said, okay, fine for us who know who Echo is, that was funny.  But no one else.  Oh, it's in the culture now, I think.  Talk to people.  He said nobody understood what it was for.  Let me see if I can find the full ad because there's a lot of...  It's in the rundown, I think.  Well, but there's teasers.  Let me see if I can find it.  Oh, we're losing Stacey.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that was again, still working on the caffeine withdrawal.  Oh, you're still doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like now I'm totally awake for you guys.  It's just, normally I have coffee, but I'm not.  I have coffee beforehand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  YouTube Super Bowl ad views were up 16%.  We're about to make it 17% with Amazon's Echo ad, the most watched ad on YouTube.  How about that?  Number two, Groupon, which was a terrible ad.  Who even knew Groupon was still in business?  Right?  That is what a lot of people felt.  Yeah.  So maybe that was a good ad.  Then the Pepsi ad, which I don't remember.  Oh, it's all the generations.  A lot of people watched that.  The Bud Night, again, stupid.  The end, I hope, to God of dilly dilly.  Yeah.  Let me go to YouTube because that seems to be the place to go for Super Bowl ads apparently.  And see if we can find this Amazon.  So Jeff Bezos was in it, which is uncharacteristic for him, isn't it?  Very.  I said it was a victory lap for Amazon's Echo.  I think it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly what it was.  Yes, I think you're quite right.  Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi has now passed the longest speech.  She's still talking.  She's still talking.  More than seven hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is her DACA filibuster.  Is it a filibuster, officially?  No, I think it's not a filibuster.  It's just a speech.  It's a long speech.  Seven hours?  Mr. Chairman.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Yes, he's wearing exactly the outfit that he...  Isn't it?  Yeah.  That's the vest he wore in Sun Valley that makes him look buff.  He still doesn't have any hair, but he's also the richest man in the world, so  I think he's extremely attractive.  I'm even kind of turned on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I lost her voice.  How is that even possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good boy.  Thanks, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's with the nobody does it better music?  Is that just to say nobody does it better than her?  I guess so, yeah.  Not Google.  I thought it was good.  It's, well, it's notable for a couple reasons.  Well, yeah, because it's more than 30 seconds.  That's...  And it's stars they got to pay a big amount to.  That was three 30-second ads.  And they showed that entire thing.  So that's $15 million in ad time alone.  Add the stars, you're well over $20 million, right?  In production for one ad.  It does...  I don't know if instead of talking about what Echo can do,  it doesn't at all talk about what Echo can do.  I guess it shows music.  No, it makes Echo part of our lives.  It makes the A-lady part of our lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it shows you what people are doing with those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, because he was listening to country music and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell me how to make a grilled cheese sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, how to make a sandwich.  Yeah, you're right.  But I think it really is a victory lap.  It's more, we know, you know who Jeff is, you know what Alexa is,  and it's great, isn't it?  It's just great.  That's really the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and in the numbers, tell me if I'm wrong here,  but the numbers, Echo has a major contribution too.  Amazon's sterling quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and yes, that's right, huge sales for the Echo,  and one week later, 41.1 million views on YouTube.  So you had 100 million Super Bowl watchers, give or take, seeing it,  maybe with half attention as they dip into their hummus,  I'm sorry, bourbon hot wings.  Queso.  Queso.  But 41 million people sought it out on YouTube,  went and found it and watched it.  That's the magic now.  Yeah, that is the magic now, isn't it?  That's what you're going for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what did you all think of the Dodge Ram ad?  Offensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep, I agree.  But I talked to a lot of people, said, what are you talking about?  It was very positive.  It was Martin Luther King talking about serving, so the text was great,  but it was in service of, yeah, a lot of serving people,  but ultimately of selling a truck.  But somebody did a really good cut down of, or a re-edit of it.  Let me see if I can find it,  in which Martin Luther King's actual thoughts about advertising are heard.  I'm not going to play the original Ram ad,  but let's see what Martin Luther King really thought about car commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The presence of this instinct explains why we are so often taken by advertisers.  You know, those gentlemen of massive verbal persuasion,  and they have a way of saying things to you that kind of gets you in the bind.  In order to be a man of distinction, you must drink this whiskey.  In order to make your neighbors envious, you must drive this type of car.  In order to be lovely to love, you must wear this kind of lipstick, or this kind of perfume.  And you know, before you know it, you're just buying that stuff.  I've got to drive this car, because it's something about  this car that makes my car a little better than my neighbor's car.  And I am sad to say that the nation in which we live is the supreme culprit.  And I'm going to continue to say it to America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so there you go. That's maybe a little more accurately  the Reverend Martin Luther King's opinions of advertising.  I'm sure the the king of state had to give permission for that.  They're very, very judicious about how they allow his voice to be used.  I know because remember Eyes on the Prize,  that great documentary about the civil rights march and movement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which you can buy on Amazon and is still worth watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can buy it, but they don't show it anymore because they lost the rights  to the I Have a Dream speech, I think. Right? Wasn't that the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they didn't in the Selma movie, they didn't allow his words to be used.  So basically, it looks like they're just profiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The family said, Ram trucks, that's a good thing.  Forget that march on the bridge thing.  So I wasn't that offended. I was offended because they used it.  But the message was very strong and very good.  Serve, you know, and you don't have to be,  you don't have to desire to be rich and famous and popular.  Just serve and you can, you know, so that was okay.  If you just close your eyes and you didn't see the images of the Ram trucks.  How about, how about, how about Alphabet's revenue?  This weekend, we talked a lot about the advertising on Twit before the Superbowl.  So I think we can wrap it up a little bit.  Alphabet's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 results.  Revenue, 32 billion. This is three months.  32 billion dollars. That's a growth of 24% year over year.  Not bad. The operating income was up 24%.  The net income was a loss though.  They lost three billion. Why?  Because they had to pay, well, that doesn't make any sense.  Nine billion dollars in taxes.  It wouldn't have, wouldn't have made, wouldn't have,  well, maybe it would have erased their entire profits.  Revenue from Google properties, 22 billion.  From advertising, 27 billion.  Other bets revenues, a mere 409 million.  That's the nest, right?  That's the nest and everything else.  Other bets, not exactly huge revenue.  So their operating income, 8.7 billion.  The operating loss for other bets, almost a billion.  916 million dollar loss for other bets.  That's why you're-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's less though.  That's down.  They had lost, it's down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's down. From 1.08 billion a year ago.  So really the thing that you want to pay attention to though is the ad network, right?  Oh, and cost for acquisition. Total acquisition costs skyrocketed, right?  Went up a lot. And so that's something cause for concern for the market.  Cost, total acquisition cost as a percent of advertising revenue is 24% compared to 22% last year.  And then the paid clicks, the change from Q3, they're still going up,  but the acceleration's gone down. 18% increase over year over year in aggregate paid clicks.  That includes Google properties and the ad networks properties.  By the way, it's interesting.  Much more growth on Google property clicks, 19% than paid clicks on network properties, 9%.  Aggregate cost per click, negative 6%. Drop of 6% in the cost per click.  7% of Google properties and an increase of 1%.  So the big input effect was the 9.9 billion dollars in tax.  But that's the tax that they pay to repatriate all that money that's been stored overseas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much did they repatriate? I was wrong by the way, a few weeks ago on Apple,  I gave the tax, not the amount they were... Yeah, the 38 billion in tax brought back

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  more than 250 billion in offshore. So it's 50, whatever 9.9 billion is 15% of,  somebody do the math. It's more than a hundred.  That's why God invented chat rooms. More than a hundred billion dollars back.  Let's put it that way, roughly a hundred billion dollars back.  So what will they do with it? Not clear. Apple has said we will spend all of it.  And I think Google will have to do the same because the money has to be allocated either to  revenue generating expenditures or paid to the shareholders. Apple's going to give a lot of it  in dividends and stock buybacks to shareholders. Stock buybacks benefit shareholders. I've learned  from, and I'll give them credit again, Horace Dediu at Asimco who explained all of this.  Stock buybacks help shareholders because it means that value of one share goes up,  right? Because it's a bigger percentage of the company. And of course dividends directly in the  pocket. You can't just spend the money on something fun. You can't put a rocket in the space.  You have to do something that's going to benefit shareholders ultimately.  And the definition of that varies widely. I think Apple is spending some of that money,  30 billion on a new headquarters in Nevada, but that's going to house their call center  and save money I guess in the long run because it's cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's going to spend two billion buy against building in Chelsea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Did you see that? Is that an attractive building?  The next door building.  Do you know that building? Chelsea Market? Is that what it's called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chelsea Market. They're in their Port Authority building which is the huge full block building  where Google's New York headquarters is. They keep on getting more space in that and it's  huge. It's an entire New York block. Because New York is the center of the universe. Our blocks

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  are really big. It's the second largest acquisition deal ever in New York City.  Yes, behind that is the Chelsea Market. It looks kind of like the San Francisco  Armory which is currently the home of Kink.com. It's actually an old Nabisco factory I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it? It's a biscuit factory. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Nabisco. We're back to the beginning. I think it was Nabisco, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow. Now, Mondalez.  Now, Mondales. What is it pronounced? Mondalez?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, is it Mondales? I don't know.  They make the best crackers. Yeah, Nabisco. It was Nabisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The ground floor is a lively meandering hallway filled with food shops, restaurants,  and things like that. It is. Very good. Very good.  Sounds like the fairy building. Yeah, sounds like that. Or L'Azal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Since you have to put this in your provincial terms, yes, I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. I'm just going to keep doing this all day long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The food network is in there. Oxygen. YouTube had a lot of space in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Major League Baseball. I think the YouTube maker space is in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Will they kick all these people out and just put all YouTube in there? Or all Google in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. I think bit by bit as leases go. Same thing with the  Port Authority. But I also know that, for instance, Cornell, which has a new campus  on Roosevelt Island in New York, their temporary space while it was being built was in the Google  headquarters building. Wow.  Google has tons of space. And they need more, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep. They're growing. Getting bigger. Is this the same Douglas Hofstadter  as wrote Godel, Escher, Bach, John? Do you know? Doug Hofstadter wrote in the Atlantic.  Must be. The shallowness of Google Translate. The program uses state-of-the-art AI techniques,  but simple tests show it's a long way from real understanding. Actually, can't be.  Is it or is it not? I don't know. Anyway, it's a-  What's the bio? Look at the bottom of the story.  Look at the bottom. See if there's a bio. See? Jeff's giving us a little lesson in media literacy.  It should be at the top. So you say, who wrote this?  I know. Because you always got to scroll to the bottom, unfortunately.  There's a professor of- Yeah, it's him. He's the author of Godel, Escher, Bach,  the professor of cognitive science and comparative literature at Indiana University of Bloomington.  Very revered man. That book, Godel, Escher, Bach, was very big in my generation. Big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, I have no idea what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Goodel. I would say Goodel, Escher, Bach. But-  Yeah.  Yeah.  Goodel. So if you've never read Godel, Escher, Bach, and you've got a little free time and some  extra tabs of acid, you just really have to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. I'll keep that in my agenda. Next time I'm bored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's what's happening here, Stacey. Leo and I really are reliving the 60s right now.  Oh yeah. Space shots and turmoil. Now the drugs come in. We're too old for the sex.  But other than that, the short of the 60s stuff is coming out.  Basically, it's the only thing we remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the 60s were so good to professional women, so I'm going to let you all relive it,  but I'm going to stay up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's fine. That's fine. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have to say, Stacey, the 2010s haven't been much better.  It's not like any era really was a golden era.  Yeah. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I have much more opportunity now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's true. True.  True that.  Thanks to the hard work of your sisters in the 60s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, people like my mom and my grandmother, they both were totally in blood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's not forget. Okay. Let's not forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I'm not saying to stay, I'm not doing a nostalgia with the 60s.  I'm just saying that it's just flashback time.  Got it. That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We could flashback to my childhood or my teens in the 90s.  Yeah. No, that wasn't a good era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh no. John Perry Barlow has passed.  Oh no.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh no. That makes me so sad.  He'd been ill for quite some time. John Perry Barlow, one of the,  he was a grateful dead lyricist.  One of the great gentlemen of the open internet age.  A classy guy, a Montana rancher who also helped founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation  and did so much to promote the free internet.  But he wasn't that old.  No, he was, he'd been ill. In fact, we went to a really wonderful benefit for him in San Rafael  last year with Bobby Weir of the Grateful Dead and Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Sean Lennon.  It was a really amazing tribute to him to raise money for his hospital bills because he had been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was the beginning of his ailment? Do you know?  It just piled on, I know, but I don't know where it started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It says in his obituary he'd been dealing with one health issue after another in recent years,  died of sleep. He was only 70. You're right. It wasn't very old.  He led a very energetic life and maybe he just burnt the candle faster than some of us.  He was a fellow student at the Fountain Valley School in Colorado Springs with Bob Weir  so they went to high school together and were of course friends for years.  He wrote many of the dead's iconic songs with Weir, including Cassidy, Throwing Stones,  Hell in a Bucket, Lost Sailor, Saint of Circumstance, Black Throated Wind,  The Music Never Stopped, Looks Like Rain, Mexicali Blues. It was really fun to  hear Bob Weir and his pickup band play many of those songs for John at the tribute there.  John joined it via Skype. He joined the Well in 1986. I was there too. Then four years later,  in 1990, founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation. He and Mitch Kapoor and John Gilmore,  who was one of the cypher punks and EFF of course remains to this day a great  fighter for the freedom of the internet. Many of us remember John Perry Barlow's,  in fact I think you asked me to get him to read it again when I interviewed him on  Tranquilation. I did. What was the, We the People of the Internet? Yes. Did he do it? He didn't do it,  right? He kind of, I don't know, we'll have to go back and find it. He was kind of- He finally did  redo it. Yeah, he was kind of pooh-pooted. He was embarrassed. Yeah, but then I think he recognized

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  how much it meant to people. It was a wonderful document. It is a wonderful document. Kind of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  first kind of statement that something was happening, that it was a nation of its own,  sort of, right? The Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace. Written in Davos.  Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh. Give it some more,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  give it some more? Do it for John, do it for John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel. I come from Cyberspace,  the new home of mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are  not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather. We have no elected government,  nor are we likely to have one. So I address you with no greater authority than that with which  liberty itself always speaks. It's just beautiful. I can't do it justice because it's so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And maybe I could find him reading it. He did. He did finally read it about two years ago, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anyway, yeah, I was privileged to have met him many times and talked to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, same here. I went to like early blogger cons with him. He was just a true wonderful

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  gentleman. Yeah. I remember going to his home for a meeting of the EFF and others. And yeah, he was  graceful, brilliant, fun, funny, and yeah, a gentleman to the very end. We're really going

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to miss John Perry. I think it might be the last post that he put up on Facebook. It's just a  beautiful little picture. I presume it's a granddaughter, grandson. I mean, getting to  brisk, I think. And he loved his daughters dearly. A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  as written by John Perry Barlow at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on February 8, 1996.  Governments of the industrial world, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from cyberspace,  the new home of mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone.  You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.  We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater  authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space  we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us.  You have no moral right to rule us, nor do you possess any methods of enforcement  We have true reason to fear.  Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited  nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world.  Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it  as though it were a public works project. You cannot. It is an act of nature,  and it grows itself through our collective actions.  You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create the wealth of  our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the unwritten codes that already  provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your external impositions.  You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse  to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't exist. Where there are real conflicts,  where there are wrongs, we will identify them and address them by our means. We are forming  our own social contract. This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world,  not yours. Our world is different. Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships,  and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications.  Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.  We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race,  economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone,  anywhere, may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced  into silence or conformity. Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement,  and context do not apply to us. They are based on matter. There is no matter here.  Our identities have no bodies, so unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion.  We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the common will, our  governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions.  The only law that all of our constituent cultures would generally recognize is the golden rule.  We hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis,  but we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose. In the United States,  you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform Act, which repudiates your own constitution  and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, de Tocqueville, and Brandeis.  These dreams must now be born anew in us. You are terrified of your own children,  since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants.  Because you fear them, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities  you are too cowardly to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions  of humanity from the debasing to the angelic are parts of a seamless whole, the global  conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.  In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy, and the United States,  you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of  cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but they will not work  in a world that will soon be blanketed with bit-bearing media. Your increasingly obsolete  information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws in America and elsewhere  that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas  to be another industrial product no more noble than pig iron. In our world, what is the value  whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost.  The global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.  These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position  as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject  the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual selves immune to your  sovereignty even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves  across the planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts. We will create a civilization of the  mind in cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.  Davos, Switzerland, February 8, 1996, and Red in New York City, July 30,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  2013. So he wrote that 22 years ago, John Perry Barlow. Thank you for doing that. Yeah,  well worth playing it. John Perry Barlow, I'm really touched today at the age of 70 and I'm  glad he recorded that and thanks to Idealog and the Q department for a department of records for  making that recording and for posting it on Vimeo. You can find it on Vimeo if you search for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did ask him once to do that and he did say, ah, you know, I find it a little embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He was a little embarrassed by it, but it is definitely a relic of the early internet, 1996.  But you know, after, as I'm listening to it, I'm thinking, oh yeah, so then I realized, no,  that really was, that really is the spirit of the internet. And it is still potentially what it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  should be. And that's what we still want to capture and preserve. I mean, that's what Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Marx does. Yeah. Yeah. I'm like, I'm like, oh, this feels so naive almost today. And  we have clearly lost, I mean, the idea of ethics and civility, you know, in self-governing  communities. No, that's not happening. But temporarily, there's still a chance. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the point. It's temporary, but I'm hoping it will, it will reassert itself.  See, I'm so sad, so sad to read Cindy Cohn's obituary. It's at eff.org, John Perry Barlow.  Yeah. What a great man. And one of, you know, many who of his generation, who really gave us  this internet, we are still just bits. And we, you know, I'm really glad we have it. And we have a  lot more to do, I think, to preserve his vision and their vision. I put two pictures of him up in

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the, in the, in the chat, just the robust John to remember. Yeah. Yeah. He's, he's been ill for some

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  time and he's, he's been posting on Facebook though. And I guess that's, I gather that's where  you got these. He's been posting pictures for a while of, of this is, so John was a rancher.  Right. Oh, I love this picture. I saw this. There's one, that's a late one with him and Bobby Weir  enjoying a burger. That's probably not so long ago. I saw that recently. This is the picture.  I prefer to remember of John as the Montana rancher with his rifle on his shoulder  and an early Macintosh on a fence post. Whether he's about to shoot it. I don't know.  But yeah, John, John was one of, one of the people from the sixties, Jeff, who never stopped living  that life, you know, and I think it took him early, sad to say. But yeah, nice, nice image  from John. There he is with his daughters, beautiful daughters who loved him dearly and,  and his ex-wife and yeah, Elaine Barlow and Justine and Leah and Anna Winter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, so for some of you in the audience, I know that this may not be quite as meaningful, but,  but it's a tribute worthwhile to somebody who really did help us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Here's the, the, the picture from the, the concert. They got together to,  and there's Sean Lennon on the right and Bobby Weir with the beard and his Jerry Garcia t-shirt.  Uh, this was an amazing show. I was so glad we got to see that. And it was, uh,  at Sweetwater in Mill Valley and a very small venue to see such great artists.  Really, really a lot of fun. So thanks for doing that, Leo.  Yeah. Okay. Sorry, you guys. Oh yeah. So do you, when Stacy, uh, when you hear  that declaration of independence for cyberspace, does it sound like an antique to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, it sounds ideal. No, it doesn't. I mean, it, it doesn't sound antique. It sounds like  the beginning of an era when everyone's hopeful and now we're living in what,  what became of that era. So I think certain principles like I'm, I had this great vision  for IOT based on the open web and that's, that's not happening. And the open web has been killed.  I know Kevin, you know, we can talk about this forever, but it's dead for most consumers. And  so the question then becomes, God, you mean Facebook is the internet. It's for, for people.  Yeah. Facebook, Twitter, all of these things are the internet. And if you go on your phone,  cause most people access the internet through their phone. The phone is a terrible ecosystem  for that. So yeah, I would argue that voices, voices hideously closed and the networks we're  setting up right now for connected devices are there. They're not closed so much as they're just  so fragmented. You can't pull anything together to make it meaningful. Like I, I wanted there to be  standards. So my sensors could talk to my other sensors and it would be very easy to pull things  together. Yeah. No, I mean, but that is, that is like the, you know, I wanted the hyperlink of  things. So you could, you could actually create cool stuff in that didn't happen. And I had all  these like long tail visions and again, we still have to fight for it though. That's the point.  And I do, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's a star man and then it's star man up in space going around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's still, it's still a baby. I mean, that was only 22 years ago. It's still a baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if it's a baby. I think, I think technology has grown up very fast and we're in,  I mean, I don't want to think about internet years, right? But I, I think,  I feel a little dismayed. I feel like we've.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you read Tim Wu's, the kill switch, basically what he described has happened.  Yeah. And he, in the book, he likened it, if I remember correctly to the early long distance  or just telephone companies where in the early days there were many, it was unregulated.  It was vibrant and exciting and innovative, but eventually, you know, the big company, Ma Bell  came in and squeezed it and took control of it and it went from being open to closed.  And Tim Wu predicted several years ago, the same exact thing would happen  to the internet. But he also pointed out that it's a pendulum and it swings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's not just the internet. It's also society itself. And during the research I am on,  on this notion of the mass, I read a Frank New York Times in 1949 did like a 20 page section on  this new thing, television. Fascinating, just, just amazing to go through the ads.  The ads are spectacular. If you have, if you have a few minutes, go to the Times  full archives and I'll find the date for it if everybody wants it.  But Frank Stanton wrote a piece talking about media now and how media had to appeal to everybody.  They had to make things that everybody would like. That was the, that was the business  imperative because that's what mass media meant. We're past that. There's no, we're talking  the beginning about VidCon that the people can create. Yeah, they're making some junk now.  Of course they are. So did they were the first books. So did they were the early TV.  But we're, I disagree with Stacey. I think we're very, very early days still.  I think that we can still grab on. I think there are plenty of places to create

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  plenty of opportunities to go beneath the commercial surface. And I think the web has made  that easier, but I think it's always going to be an alternative  vision or activity. So to dig in, to dig underneath and to really play with the open internet as it is,  I think is going to be very much a hacker mindset, very much an alternative  thing about like zines back in, you know, the seventies and eighties, right? It's going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that kind of. Yeah. But I also think I'll go overboard Stacey, which is what I do.  But let's go back to the Hudson's Bay company. Let's go back. The pilgrims were,  were, were not a religious venture as Bushraina Boston points out in his book. They were an  economic venture. They were backed by capital. They were here to take riches back to Europe and  the hell with the natives. And it was a purely economic venture, but eventually  for the gold of all things. Yeah. Why were they wrong?  We did have a nation of principles that rose from that. Yeah. It took a few hundred years.  It took a lot of time. It took, it took oppression. It took difficulty,  but something rose from it that had principles that we fear now we're losing.  I'm not ready to give up. I'm depressed too. I agree with you, but I'm not ready to give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm just, what will it take to see that and when will it happen? And that's the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  question. I'm going to be too old to see it. Your daughter, I hope we'll see it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but just remember star man is above. Thank God. Star man is above and rapidly leaving this  orbit. Get the hell out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'd rather be in an asteroid belt. So to, to bring us down to earth Sunday was Facebook's 14th  birthday. And Mark Zuckerberg posted his thoughts in which he admitted many mistakes.  It's a moment to reflect. He says on how far we've come from that dorm room at Harvard  and how far we still have to go to bring the world closer together. A moment to think about  what we need to do better. People ask what I've learned along the way. I was 19 when I started  Facebook and I didn't know anything about building a company or global internet service. Over the  years, I've made almost every mistake you can imagine. I've made dozens of technical errors and  bad deals. I've trusted the wrong people. I put talented people in the wrong roles. I've  missed important trends. I've been slow to others. What is Mark in a 12 step? I've launched the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  product after the product that failed. They're all practicing self-flagellation over there.  Oh, is it time for self-flagellation? They're all doing it. They're all doing it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa. The reason our community exists today,  not because we avoided mistakes. Oh, wait a minute. Here's the turnaround. It's because we  believe what we're doing matters enough to keep trying to solve our greatest challenges,  knowing full well we'll fail again and again, but that's the only way to make progress.  Isn't this what they've been saying all along, which is,  Okay, this is Mark's just fail fast.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, let's revoke everybody's privacy on Facebook. Oh, guys, are you so sorry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  God, I didn't mean to do that. I pushed this button instead of that button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like, wait, my bad. Okay.  My bad. I know it's not my bad.  So I'm like, eh, mea culpa. I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're still early in this journey. We'll keep working. Compare this to John Barry Barlow.  We're still early in this journey and we'll keep working to improve. That focus has always  been our strength and that's what this year is all about. Bringing us closer together with our  family and friends matters. And 14 years in, I'm proud of what we do and grateful to be a part of  something so meaningful. It's an honor to be on this journey with you, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, it's very kind of a problem, but I don't know. It doesn't, it's, you're right.  It tested well.  It tested well. The pollsters said, Mark, this is the, you should release this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would love for Mark to be sincere. And, you know, I wish that people in charge of our companies,  you know, we can hate Travis Kalakannick all we want.  But he was sincere.  But he is sincerely.  Sincerely an asshole, but he was sincere.  So you could see him coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you knew it.  Well, I think I, Stacey, I, you know, it's been many years since I've been in face to face,  but I think, I think Zuckerberg is sincere.  That's my question.  The world's a better world. The problem is I think that,  that their definitions I wrote about this two weeks ago, I think their definitions  are too simplistic and shallow and temporal.  And, and, and, and the problem is, you know, I've talked to people in various of these companies  and I think they think that they've, oddly for a company like Google that has,  you know, become a mobile company and a car company and everything else.  And Facebook has become a VR company and all this kind of other stuff.  They're so wed to the data they have that they, they're, they're,  the bad assumption that's built in there is that their tools are done.  And we're just listening to what people are doing.  Well, they're, they're doing what they can with the tools you gave them.  And the tools are too simplistic.  And you have to have a much richer and more nuanced view of what community is  and what society is.  And you're, you, you've got to, you know, that's not about throwing stuff against the wall and  failing. It's about having, you know, deeper thoughts about what you can do with this power.  And that's where, that's where I get disappointed.  I don't think they're thinking big enough, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The numbers are down this quarter and some say it's, I think Facebook says it's the change in  algorithm. And we were giving up some daily active users.  We're giving up some time spent reviewing to be more responsible.  Or others say, Hey, it's Facebook on its way out.  Finally. Boy, did you read the, the article or the tweet actually storm from the,  from funny or die how Facebook is killing comedy.  This is actually an interview with Sarah as well as split cider.  Um, Mike Farah, the CEO of, um, funny or die wrote on Twitter, Mark Zuckerberg just walked in and  laid off all my friends. He didn't, of course, but he says there's simply no money.  Actually, uh, uh, his colleague, um, Matt, uh, Matt Klinman wrote this on Twitter.  Uh, there's simply no money in making comedy online anymore.  Facebook completely destroyed independent digital comedy and we need to effing talk about it.  It's so they, uh, so this is the interview with a Klinman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I put this up on the, on the rundown. It's, it's, it's scathing.  Um, but it's interesting if you look apart from the news world,  now you look at the comedy world and the impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's let's just call it the content world. And I feel like I dodged a bullet because  when Facebook started doing live video and everybody said, oh, you got to, I was trying  to talk into it. I was put Twitter on Facebook. Oh, you know, I got, I'd heard the same arguments  for YouTube. Uh, this is, this is Klinman. The whole story is basically Facebook gets so much  traffic that they started convincing publishers to post things on Facebook for a long time.  That was fine. People posted things on Facebook. Then you'd click those links, go to their websites,  but then gradually Facebook started exerting more and more control of what was being seen  to the point that they, not our website, essentially became the main publishers of everyone's content.  Today, there's no reason to go to a comedy website that has a video. If that video is  just right on Facebook and that'd be fine if Facebook compensated those companies for the ad  revenue that was generated from these videos, but Facebook does not pay publishers. So there's no  more money to make content. Cracks, same thing. And people get,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the oatmeal had a funny comic about, no, the oatmeal did a funny comic about this a while back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Um, gosh, he opt to try to find it. Klinman feels bad because he says people  blame the companies. He says, I'm a labor dude. I'm a proud member of the WGAE.  I'm more than happy to get mad at management about something, but that's not the problem.  The problem is Facebook is our editor and our boss. They decide what's successful  and what isn't successful via seemingly meaningless metrics. They hide behind algorithms.  They change constantly. And it seems to me they're not favoring things that are high quality.  They're favoring things that are clickbait, things that are optimized for Facebook,  low quality things that appeal to the lowest common denominator, and honestly, just things at random.  Facebook has, this is the thing, this is in direct apposition to the hope we all had in 1996 when  Barlow wrote the Declaration of Independence of cyberspace. Facebook has created a centrally  designed internet. It's a lamer crappier looking internet. It's just not as cool as an internet  that is a big chaotic space filled with tons of independently operating websites  who are able to make a living because they make something cool that people want to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I dropped that comic in the chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's look at the oatmeal. Let's see the oatmeal. Let me do it because I can use my magic powers,  aka my Microsoft Surface Studio, and zoom in on it here. Let me copy this.  Every time I look at a page now on Microsoft's Edge browser, somehow Chrome pops up and things  saying, you know, the web looks much better on Chrome. Reaching people on the internet,  how it used to be. Come on over. I've got some neat stuff here. Matt's website, email,  Netvibes. Remember Netvibes? RSS. What happened? Actually, follow me over there. It'll be easier  for us to reach each other. Facebook. Welcome new active users. Where we're at now. Hey,  I made some new stuff. Can you show it to my followers? Facebook. Doors locked, door locks  engaged. Oh, F. Promotion. Boost this post for $10,000 and reach a fraction of your followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's where the moral hazard does lie for both companies, but especially Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep. Both companies, you mean in Google and Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. But especially Facebook. It is definitely more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Klinman says Facebook's running a payola scam. You have to pay them if you want your own fans  to see your content. That's basically what the oatmeal was saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. In some ways. That's true. I mean, I'm lucky you're lucky because our audience isn't  as Facebook focused. But if you were like, if I were a blogger about family life or something  like that, I would have to be on Facebook. I guess you would. But at your peril.  Well, yes. But there, I mean, like many moms who, you know, let's say I'm doing a recipe blog.  Those people aren't always on Twitter. So I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did the all Jeff go out of business because of this too, you think?  All who? AWL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The all. I think you meant ALL.  I think it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, I'll tell you why the all went out of business. I just went to their website  and it got taken over by an AT&T ad. OK,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the least Facebook doesn't do that.  Well, that is the issue is the advertising. We still are trying to replicate a scarcity based  ad model in an abundance based world. Prices go down, desperation goes up.  And you can't get enough audience to the ads when there's unlimited competition.  And the first things that go away, by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  are things like the all, which are nichey, cutesy, fun. They don't have the resources  or funny or die or cracked. They don't have the resources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's also because advertisers and agencies are stupid because all they'll buy still is volume  when they should be in a different world where they value something like the all because it's  could have a different relationship. Don't get me started on that one, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, people who read the all are probably not your ideal consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, no. But we have the same problem.  No, we have the same problem with ad buys for Twitter, too, because we don't have the mass  numbers. We don't get those big, tight ads. But when people try us, they go, wow, we've never had

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  such good results. Thank you for teaching us. We'll use these lessons elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know. They immediately. I can name them. You know them. You've seen them on shows over the  last 10 years. And now you see them on Super Bowl ads.  I think I'm going to shave on my mattress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You see him on Super Bowl with my with my special snacks that come every week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but OK, but that's I don't mind. No, no, I actually don't. You're right.  No, Stacey, you're right. I don't mind that. That's success.  And there's always going to be another company that I can help make this into a bigger company.  I'm not complaining. We actually it's interesting. I think really, if there's anything  going on in podcasting, the softening of advertising podcasting, which is as far as I  could tell universal, is because there's so many podcasts. So many. And I saw it.  By the way, it's been announced all the time. Yeah. If you're listening to this show still,  thank you. Because I know it just as they say on an airplane, you have many other choices.  Thank you for flying air, twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's true. And man, they're really good. That's the hard part.  Shut up. Sorry.  We went from we went from like just a few things, but there's a lot of really good shows there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sorry. It's in fact, it's it's kind of like it  happened with peak TV, with Netflix and HBO. And we're now in peak. I think peak podcasting where  there's two there's so many good shows, many, many great shows, much more deserving, frankly,  than any of my shows are just buried because nobody finds out about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's simply is not enough time. Yeah. See, this is where I think the problem is that an  information base. So the one problem is an abundance versus scarcity based model.  Another one is a is a is an attention based versus value based model. And attention is  not the only asset out there, but but but it's what we're all fighting for. And there's a limit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what do you think of Wired's decision to go behind a paywall?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm going to go ahead and do my my number of the week since you asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you can save it if you want. We'll save the discussion for that.  We'll come back to that. We'll come back. Yeah, let's come back to that because it's related.  Right. Very much. And by the way, as long as we're talking about the good old days here is  thanks to CERN, the very first website, actually, let me let me do a nicer font that was well,  no, let me do the simulator. This is a 300 baud simulator, the World Wide Web. This is Tim  Berners-Lee in 1989, his first generation. And it really looks a lot like gopher, right? I mean,  it's text based. He was a physicist at the particle accelerator in CERN Switzerland. He had one of  Steve Jobs, beautiful but poorly selling Mac next cubes. And he said, I think I could write something  that would be able to let my colleagues and I share our physics papers and comment on them,  link crosslink and so forth. And so he created something he called the World Wide Web. And this  is it, the very first page. And CERN is brought it back info.cern.ch. And you can browse it. It  really is very much like gopher, frankly. And what's nice is they've simulated a 300 baud modem as well.  Oh, so it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't have the sound. You can get your modem sound on YouTube. Yeah. Should you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the modem sound? Yeah, yeah, that's pretty cool. The World Wide Web. We have come a long way.  Let's see. All right, let me just quickly say, oh, I should mention the rumor. And it's not a fact,  but it's an interesting rumor that Google is going to launch a streaming gaming service.  Let me find the article here because I skipped past this. Yeti is the code name. This comes,  of course, from Jessica Lessens, the information. She's found a way. Don't even see, this is the  problem. We go to the Verge article, but it really comes from the information. How much does the  information cost? $400 a year. I subscribe. I do too. It's behind a paywall. And so often what'll  happen is the tweets and the Facebooks and all that, they have to mention the Verge's  rehash of what, to their credit, the Verge says it's from the information.  Service code. They know they're getting the traffic. Yeah, but Amir O'Frady, of course,  has great sources, Kevin McLaughlin. The service code named Yeti would put Google at the forefront  of a nascent part of the video game business, streaming gaming. It's a $109 billion video game  market. The company is developing a subscription-based game streaming service that would work,  well, hard to tell, on Chromecast, maybe. I bet, though, more likely a Google-made console  still being developed, according to people with knowledge of the project.  So that's an interesting new business for Google. They'd be going up against some pretty big  competition on that. And companies that went out of business. What was the first one of these?  I'm trying to remember the name of it. It was pretty cool. And they ended up folding,  getting sold off for scrap. We'll be getting the HomePod on Friday. We can do a head-to-head  comparison against the Google Home Max, the Sonos One, bigger speakers, but those who have played  with it and the reviews have started coming out on Tuesday say it sounds amazing for its size.  Amazing. Yes. So this is the Google product?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It should. No, this is the Apple HomePod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's got Siri built into it. It's direct competition for Google Home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's not. It's, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's really, and Apple even doesn't want to position. Actually, truthfully,  I think what Apple's doing is interesting. They don't want to position as another,  you know, echo or assistant in the house. They position-  They don't have the ability.  No, I think that they weren't even aiming at that. They want to reinvent sound. They want to reinvent  speakers. And remember how we've been talking so much about computational photography, how  a smartphone can do so much more with a really simple, inexpensive lens because of the software  and the hardware, the processing that can make a better image, and the Google Pixel 2 is amazing  in that regard. Apple wants to do the same thing with speakers. This computational audio, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So one speaker does what? When we got out of college, we had to have eight speakers around

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the apartment? Yeah. And if you had eight of this speaker, they would all know about each other and  automatically shape the music to fill the room in a unique way. And the only reason I think this is  because Renee Ritchie from MacBreak Weekly and Imore and others went to Apple for a briefing.  The Apple really, they showed them the testing rooms and they really focused on the acoustics.  And I got the message that you should stop thinking left-right stereo.  That you have to have two speakers left and right. That one speaker with computational audio  can give you a full sound. Do you believe that?  Well, I'll find out Friday. But the people I've read, like Neelai Patel, who is an absolute  stereo nut, a speaker hound was raving about this, which really surprises me.  Really surprised me. Did you have quadraphonic in the day?  Oh, you bet. Of course you did.  With a little joystick that could make the music go around and around.  That, funnily enough, really has its successor in surround sound. And all of my stereo systems now  have a center channel, left, right and rear speakers. Music isn't mixed for it, but TV is.  Some music is mixed for it. So I'll be very interested. This is what I'm going to say about  it. And again, we don't have it yet, so I can't say. I think it's interesting because I think that  Apple's going for not just another voice assistant. I think that's secondary to what Apple's really  trying to say is computational audio. We could do something different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But is that?  On live. Thank you, Marzware.  That's not sustainable long term because if it's a wonderful technology, others will figure out how  to do it too. Whereas the assistant has a relationship with you that you start to depend  upon. That is going to be higher value. Apple has a better relationship than the assistant.  Apple has the ecosystem. I'm sorry. The dog disagreed with me. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Apple's one. I didn't know the dog was an Apple fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The dog is an Apple fan. No, dog has Apple has a dog has ecosystem. That's a bigger play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I was going to talk about that just in context of Apple's health moves because  I think Apple is really good at some things and really terrible at others. So if you think about  the relationship I might have with Apple as a consumer of digital services, I loathe them.  But as a consumer, as a repository for my information, it looks very interesting as  like a health consumer or as a place to store my contacts. So I think that's kind of an interesting,  I don't know, bifurcation. I don't know if a lot of other people have this, but  the things that make Apple awesome privacy, et cetera, are good in some spheres.  And the things that it's so terrible at, like cloud services make it really bad and things where  I want it to predict what I want and deliver things to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe, maybe. And that's why Siri isn't as a big a part of this play as it could be.  Right.  Remember that Apple Music, according to the Wall Street Journal, is about to  beat Spotify in the US. They're growing at 5% a month now, Spotify only 2% in the paid tier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who is buying this? I can't understand why you would want Apple Music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ecosystem. It's an ecosystem play. If you have an iPhone, an iPad, a Mac, and now the HomePod,  the HomePod only works with Apple Music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I know, but that's to me like a huge reason not to go into that ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unless you're already in it, in which case it's like,  Yeah.  Ah, the balmy waters of Apple, I'm just going to lie back and let go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My dog. I think she was upset because I was trying to say something and then,  you know, we stopped and she's like, oh heck no, you're paying attention to Stacey.  It worked.  Now she's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Cardiogram study, by the way, says the Apple Watch can detect diabetes with 85% accuracy.  That is amazing.  This is a clinical study. This is another holy grail of wearables is this massive and growing  rapidly market of type two, type one, type two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The first place are ongoing blood sugar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  14,000 Apple Watch users. No, it's not blood sugar because Apple Watch doesn't have any  blood sugar capabilities. Using the heart rate sensor, it detected that of 14,000 users, 462  of them had diabetes. 90, oh, wait a minute, I'm sorry.  Abnormal heart rhythm, 97% accuracy. Sleep apnea, 90% accuracy. Hypertension, 82% accuracy.  But diabetes, that's the holy grail. You get that and it's 85% accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's not the holy grail because the holy grail is actually insulin detection without  blood sugar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Blood sugar.  Blood sugar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't even know. My mother was a diabetic, told her, well, obviously when she got it,  type one. But the new monitor that you leave on your arm, did you know about this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No. Oh, it's still intrusive. I did know about it.  It's still intrusive.  Phil Linden was wearing it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it constantly checks in.  Right. It's very valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm a type two diabetic, early stages. In fact, so there's two things to say here. One, early  detection is huge.  Yep.  And that's what this does.  That's what this does. But being able to measure it constantly is huge too because then you could  start making correlations between behavior, blood sugar. You can respond to problems with your blood  sugar faster. This is all going to be, this is all very important. There are 100 million Americans  with pre-diabetes or diabetes and 25% undiagnosed according to the CDC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And for people who deal with aging in place or with kids, this actually gives you the capability  to monitor them from afar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Very interesting. Yes. Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or a, sorry, not this, but a connected device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is another one, Jeff, like computational music that Apple can't patent and own. But  there are a lot of Apple watches out there. It's just one more reason to come on in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would buy an Apple watch, you know, if it were slightly less expensive and I didn't have to have  the, I mean, cause it only works with the phone. So to buy into the ecosystem, how much is the watch  now? 350?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  350 you can get it for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So 350 plus an $800 phone to buy into basically something I would want to use only for healthcare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's healthcare prices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now what happens is though it starts that way. That's the whole,  Well, I know.  That's the, this is the strength right now of Apple's ecosystem play.  It's an, it's just one of many entry points. Most people get in via the iPhone and then they get  the watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So now you have Amazon, which is going to have a health company is going to have the drugs is  going to, has the watch that they've just patented for their workers, which they'll do other things  with the Amazon ecosystem could be very competitive. It'll have the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think Amazon health is fascinating and I would never bet against Jeff Bezos in any respect.  He's impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, Amazon's income was pretty good too. We had on the, on Twitter this week,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  we had Sam Meshkovich Mars Technica who had the headline of the week,  Alexa print money. Even Bezos stunned by Amazon's Q4 Amazon, Q4 income operating  exceeds operating income estimate by 69%. And this is what you were talking about.  The Echo has been very, very good. They don't break out Echo sales, but Jeff Bezos said,  optimistic projections for Echo are, have been exceeded along with a vague sales figure of tens  of millions of Echo related devices throughout all of 2017. Tens of millions is an interesting  number because it took Amazon 10 years to send tens of, sell tens of million Kindles.  So yeah, Echo is pretty successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was just a sipper. Is that the consumer or something, research something? They did a  report saying that there were like 34 million Echoes sold. So that's tens of millions. Yes.  And it's certainly more than 11 million all in on Nest devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. But 34 million is nothing to sneeze at.  No, I am not sneezing.  And I wouldn't say they've saturated the market. I think there's still a big upside.  Oh yeah.  Yep. Let's, oh, actually this one is for you, Stacey. Sprint says they're going to launch the  first mobile 5G network next year. You think this is hype or do you think they'll be able to do it?  They do have big money, right? With Softbank now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do. In 2019 is when we should start seeing the first mobile,  like the chips for mobile handsets. So yeah, I mean, it's not crazy talk. It won't be widespread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're working with Qualcomm and network and device manufacturers in order to launch the first truly  mobile 5G network by the first half of 2019. Oh, first half. That feels iffy.  It's very optimistic. The reason they think they can do that is they will actually use existing  cell towers, put MIMO antennas, massively MIMO antennas on top of those. And then they,  so they can add these capabilities to about half their existing towers. And then  they will do these macro towers. They'll increase those by 20%. And then 40,000 outdoor small cell  solutions and then 15 strand mounted small cells in cable boxes. Something called a sprint magic  box. There'll be a million and it is magical, a million sprint magic box. So that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. So that fits because the spectrum, I'm trying to see what spectrum they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They have the 2.5 gigahertz. They have about 160 megahertz of the 2.5 gigahertz band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. And that's actually a decent, that's good propagation. I mean, it's not awesome propagation.  It's not 700 megahertz, but. Right. But it's not like 34 millimeter band,  which is what some people are looking at. So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. AT&T and Verizon are going to do millimeter wave. And so this is a better place.  I love it when you're talking millimeter waves.  Hmm. Sprint CEO said Sprint's the only carrier that doesn't have to compromise what 5G  can deliver because we can deliver super wide channels of more than a hundred megahertz  while still delivering mid band coverage characteristics. That's the propagation

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we're talking about. That is, and that is, that is pretty powerful, awesome stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yay. I would, you know, I got rid of my sprint phone years ago because they just really fumbled  the future with Ymax. I would love to see them come back. Competition's good for everybody.  It'd be good. It'd be very good for the world. Yes. Okay.  All right. Let me see. I'm just making sure that we haven't missed any big, big,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  big stories. I think we're doing pretty good. Google has a new access chief. I only bring it  up because they announced it today after the earnings and I'm thinking, Hey, the nest news  came out today. Oh no, they announced it yesterday. So apparently just lots of things are happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Eric Schmidt has left the board and they have a new chairman of the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So he's left entirely now. I think so. Was he out as chairman? Maybe he's going to MIT. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. So access is new chairman is trumpeted at the Google. Or CEO.  Oh, I'm sorry. You're right. Google has a new chairman.  Who goes as a new CEO. Dinesh Jain or Dini as he's called. He was CEO at Time Warner Cable  and he's the CEO of access, which is amazing because you probably wouldn't leave Time Warner  if Google fiber were dead. So, or maybe you would. I don't know. I would leave Time Warner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Time Warner Cable was bought, I mean, as part of the charter stuff and it's now Spectrum. So,  you know, he probably needed a new job anyway because you don't need two COOs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. I don't know. Now Eric was not chairman. He was executive chairman,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  which was a kind of crafted title. Okay. Thanks for clarifying. Yeah.  Let's wrap her up here. Coming up, our number, our tool, our thing. But first, word from WordPress.

I just have to tell everybody to read this article in the  New Yorker. I think it's available for free without a subscription. Why paper jams persist?  And it's actually not about like paper jams per se. It's about technological issues proposed by  paper jams and the fascinating industrial design that goes into preventing paper jams  in your fax machine, in your copier. Good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, yeah, I don't know. Chester Carlson, Chester Carlson, whose name just passed by  as an important inventor because he invented the xero graphic process. Yes. And by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Xerox is no more. No, isn't that sad Xerox now and by a, what's it? Chinese holding firm or something?  Fuji. I don't know what Fuji is now. Japanese. Japanese. I used to make film.  Fuji film? I think it's even the same Fuji. No one knows. No one knows. No one knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Xerox park gone. Sad. It was such a fun amusement park. I used to love to go there and ride with the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  kids in Xerox park. So it's just one of those pieces that only New Yorker could have on

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Joshua Rothman on the kind of the, the, the engineering challenges proposed by paper jams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't you love that? And go ahead. Yeah. No, no, I was going to  have reminiscent of it. About paper jams or Xerox machines. Yes. Paper jams. Go ahead. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  way back when what got me into all this whole technology thing, I'm going to date myself  very badly and Stacey, you are not allowed to say the versus when you were born. But in 1974,  I was at the Chicago Tribune and I was the guy in the newsroom. Wasn't scared of computers because  I was 21 years old and I, I trained everybody in the computers is a brand new, big thing. New  newsroom never had such a thing. We didn't know what a cursor was, had to all that. So I was the  guy who knew the computer. That's what got all this started. The problem was people in the newsroom  would think, Oh, if you know how to do computers, you must know how to get a paper jam out of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  copy. Oh God. Were you the key operator? Were you, it always says call key operator. I know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know exactly. That's right. Yeah. I was the, I was the keyless operator. Paper jams have bedeviled

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  mankind since paper movement has been invented. Yeah. I mean, even modern printers or you think  this would be solved or constantly tortured by the, the, uh, there's actually Xerox had a facility  they called the paper torture lab. Uh, and it's fascinating. It's just, you know, it's just,  Oh man, I just love these kinds of think pieces. Cause you know, it's about stuff minutiae that  actually is quite interesting. Uh, one other thing, which is that Google is, uh, now putting,  Google research app called motion stills and they've added, which, which is a good thing to  have on Android anyway, but they have now added to motion stills and AR mode. So you can place  not as cool as the star wars figures, generic figures into your world. Actually I'll, I'll show  you. Cause I think I, let me see if it, if it got to my Google photos here, I did a couple of videos  in the driveway. Oh, it's not on my Google photos. Why isn't it? It shouldn't it be,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's on your nest cam. Maybe one day they'll be together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I can, I can show you, I guess on, uh, on, I don't understand why.  I guess it stays in motion stills until you save it, I guess is the depressing fact of the matter.  So I'll, I'll just see if I can, or maybe I didn't save them. Oh, even worse. All right. Well,  I'll just have to do it. So let me put a little, um, a little, uh, I don't know. You can't see it.  A little dinosaur somewhere here. There you go. Oh, it's a gingerbread man. You can't see it though.  Cause of the angles, but I can make it really big. Yeah. Uh, they've got a dinosaur. I could place a  dinosaur right there. There's a, there's the dino. You can make them really big, uh, really small.  Uh, it's not like that or what you do. Yeah, you can record it. But of course, if you don't save it  like a nitwit, uh, there's an alien. There's a robot. Yeah. Me. I like the giant chicken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, I thought the chicken was cute. Yeah. But stupid. Yeah. Still stupid. No, I didn't say it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  wasn't stupid. So check, check out the motion stills app. You've got some new features and now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, your number of the week. So, so, uh, wired just put up a, a paywall. They've joined, joined  the, uh, the brigade here. So disappointed. And well, yeah. So, so, and again, I'm not, listen,  if I, if you can pay a charge, you can charge. That's wonderful. But so I last less than two  weeks, I've been doing a little test and every time I get hit by paywall, I'm now recording

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  what I would have to spend. So the way wired doing it, you get like four articles and then you just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  can't read anymore. I think. Right. Right. And so what happens is I'll, I'll follow a link to  somebody and say, Oh, you've gone through, you've already, you've just gone through half your  articles. Well, I didn't want to use it for that. Right. Right. So now I added up in, in less than  two weeks, $3,070 and 57 cents. Oh my God. Yeah. What I actually spend is about $248 a year.  I brought the New York Times, the Washington Post and talking points memo,  wired 20 bucks, economist, 152 bucks, New Yorker, 90 bucks, Atlantic, 25 bucks,  statutory a hundred bucks, business insider, a hundred bucks, wall street journal, 444 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you're including like the big subscript, like strategic has a big subscription

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  like the information. Yeah. Because I hit it and I want to read it. Yeah. Yeah. I can't read it.  Medium is 60 bucks. Gannett, my local log paper, 50 bucks. The Burrowsville News.  Ain't nobody going to do that. No, no. And, oh, I counted the statutory twice. Okay. Subtract  a hundred dollars. So $2,970. Right. So, and that's just two weeks and I'll get, I'll hit more of them.  Um, and God bless them. They've all got to try to figure out how to make a living,  but this notion of selling content, my content is valuable. You should pay for it for a whole year  when I only want a little of this or that and no micro payments aren't the answer either. Cause  A, we're not going to do it and B, um, it's too expensive. So, uh, it doesn't raise enough money.  So when people come after me about paywalls, I'm just going to say, well, $3,070 and 95 cents,  you know, it's not going to do it. That's my number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's kind of, I, as an independent media person who wants to reference stuff and bring  stuff, I, I've done these same calculations and, but we both, we all, we're all understanding  though of the conundrum. And I do. I mean, I buy, I spend at least a thousand dollars a year on

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  subscriptions for various news things. I make a point of buying things like the information,  not because I need to really, cause I can get that information. As you see everybody re  rehashes it anyway, but because I want to support Jessica, uh, I buy Ben Thompson's strata query.  I buy Paul Thuratt's, uh, blog, but there's, there's a limit. And truth is most of the time,  you just want a casual article here, article there, right? I pay for Stacey's newsletter

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  cause it's free. It is free, but you have to give me your time and eyeballs clicking my ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does that, yeah, but does that work? That's, I mean, you wouldn't want to charge for that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  would you? Um, I decided no, because I have a hard time asking people for money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly. Really, it all boils down to that, doesn't it? I can, I can give you, you can give  all sorts of, you know, it's democratic, blah, blah. It's just, I don't want to ask for money.  That's not my thing. I'm awkward. So Stacey, you have a thing for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did have a thing, but it's not set up. And until I get it set up, I'm not going to tell you about  it. Cause cause why would I do that? Um, so until that I have a book and I'm pretty sure everybody  knows this book. So it's old. It was published in September. Do you guys still want it or not?  Yes, I want it. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a ton like humans and autonomy and she's like a biohacker. I mean, it just like all the threads  of your future that we all kind of talk about and think about. It's like in a nice story.  According to, is it all dystopian or? It's like now Jeff, actually, because there's an underground  collective of people who are trying to, there's a, it's a huge IP. They're the evil in the story is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  IP lawyers in anyway. I think Annali knew it should be on triangulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, she should. She's so amazing. She's such a good writer. She's such a big thinker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. We're going to contact her. And if you're friends of Annali, tell her we're looking for her  covers robots, future drugs, slavery, and patent reform, the big four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Oh, and it doesn't even talk about AI and what makes a human a human or what?  I'm sorry. Bots becoming autonomous and their rights. Oh, it's so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It also has, according to reviewers, a weird romantic subplot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it does. Yeah. That made some people may not go for that, but you know, I, it didn't mind. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  didn't mind. You don't have to call yourself it unless that's your pronoun. That it could be. I  don't know. It is Stacy Higginbotham. She's at Stacy on iot.com at gigastacy on Twitter and is  just fantastic. And we, we can't wait to have some time with you in Austin at South by Southwest on

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  March 9th. I'm really looking forward to it. You get to be together. Jeff, you should come.  Come on down. You can bunk with me. That and the breakfast tacos. Breakfast tacos.  I mean, breakfast tacos. What kind do you get? Do you like Stacy egg and all that? Or,

Transcript:  So I, you know, Torchies is good for breakfast tacos. I would actually do  taco deli because I like their beans better and I like their doughnut sauce, but that's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Kids, kids, if you come to our event, I can almost promise  you we'll have breakfast tacos for all, unless more than 10 people come.  Okay. Maybe I should rephrase that breakfast tacos for 10.  And then we'll see how many other people come. I'm trying to bribe our way into a giant,  we want to fill Antone's and by the way, that panel will not be streamed live because of its  ungodly early hour, but we will, we will, uh, package it up as a twit special.
