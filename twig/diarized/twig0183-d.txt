Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of those things is not like the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very good. You caught that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great to be here. Good to have you. As always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's right now, she's Googling Super Bowl. Who's playing?  Is that one word or two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I know it's Super Bowl. I just didn't know who was playing. I needed to know what cities.  So now I know it's San Francisco versus Baltimore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I care. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't be so excited.  I would watch it on TV, but I wouldn't be so excited.  Also with us, Mr. Jeff Jarvis. Are you a Jets or a Giants fan, Jeffrey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My son is a Jets fan. Ergo, I'm a Jets fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Next year, when the Niners go to the Super Bowl again, it will be in East Rutherford, New Jersey.  Yes, yes, right here.  I'm thinking that ain't the Meadowlands. That must be the Jets stadium.  That's the Meadowlands. Same thing. That is the Meadowlands.  Same stadium. Yeah, it's one stadium.  I knew the Meadowlands was in East Rutherford. I mean, it was in New Jersey. I didn't know it was East Rutherford.  Yes.  They should just say Meadowlands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not the New York Giants. It's the friggin' New Jersey Giants and the New Jersey Jets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The place where Jimmy Hoffa sleeps is what I call it.  Yes.  Jeff is the author of Public Parts, a wonderful book about living in public, what would Google do, and blogs at BuzzMachine.com,  but is also best known as the man who went to Davos. He's back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm back.  Well, talk about that.  I'm back and I have a sexy voice because I have a cold.  A little scratchy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  With some high-falutin germs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very high-falutin germs. I'm figuring it was a Nobel Prize winner.  Or Chancellor Merkel. You could have the Chancellor Merkel cough.  I won't say what it was, but he leaned toward me so I could hear him at the Sean Parker party and the spritz occurred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you actually knew when it occurred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At that moment, I said, doomed.  Come on, who was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was it the scene in Big Bang Theory where you could see the green kind of like plowed and bloated?  Did you pull a Sheldon just like, ah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's nothing I could do. It was too late. It was there. It was it.  Who was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to sing Soft Kitty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on.  You're not supposed to talk about it. It seems to me, because I think, well, I can't say a name, but it was on PATH,  which is supposed to be private, and the person who said it said PATH only and then talked about the party.  And wasn't this supposed to be the Davos of austerity and nobody was supposed to have parties  and Sean Parker has a multi-million dollar blowout party?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With a flying in famous DJ from London who I'm suddenly forgetting and John Legend.  Yeah.  And taxidermy galore like a 13 foot bear.  That's creepy.  Mooses with laser eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I saw the picture of the laser eye moose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I got one on my Google Plus feed of me with a laser eye.  And amazing wines, incredible wines and they were nauseous from Jean-Georges Vondrick and the amazing New York chef.  And here's the kicker. Here's the whole thing.  It was called a party for philanthropy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you got to spend money to give money or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was it was Davos was trying to tamp down the parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't they say that there were even say this that there weren't any there weren't going to be any big parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Yahoo! Marissa took over Google's spot.  Google's party was canceled.  The Excel wine party, which was amazing every year, was canceled.  And some other things.  But then, yeah, Sean Parker outdid himself with his co-hosts Mark Benioff and Ian Osborne from London.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He can afford it.  He's worth over two billion dollars.  I saw.  Yes.  So he's doing all right.  Hey, let's welcome joining us now, Matt Cutts of Google back from the real world.  Yeah.  You know, Matt, I just want to say that when Kevin Mitnick, the famed hacker who was served time in jail for hacking and then was on probation and not allowed to use the Internet for some years, when he came back off of that Internet drought, he did it live on the screensavers.  And you're following in his footsteps in only that one respect, I might add.  And it wasn't such a long drought.  No, it was a week off.  You took a week off the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I took a week off the Internet.  And in fact, this entire month of January, I haven't done any news, no social media, no Twitter.  So I feel like a caveman who's, you know, sort of emerging and he's like by the side of the interstate and he's like very confused.  There's a lot of noise and it's very distracting.  So my monobrow is sort of scrunched like what's happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do you work at Google and not do the Internet for a week at the same time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I did take a one week vacation at the beginning and I love to read.  So I just took like 10 books with you know, what you read from John dies at the end, which is, you know, your classic tale of spoiler alert, horror comedy like Buffy.  And the guy did his own stuff and he got a publishing deal and then he got like a major motion picture with Paul Giamatti.  So moonwalking with Einstein, just a whole bunch of different stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you only read novels with people's names in them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pretty much, actually.  That's about right.  It's a new game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how was it?  Was it fun?  Was it great?  Were you glad to get back?  Were you just were you kind of not happy about getting back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's kind of interesting how there's a lot of tempests in a teapot where if you're not there, somehow they magically kind of blow over on their own.  And so I'm dreading a little bit coming back and people saying, oh, I can't believe this horrible thing has happened.  And you're like, well, that's the 17th time that's happened.  So that's not a huge surprise.  But it is kind of wild.  Like you don't make as much time for taking care of business.  And so I've like worked down most of my email.  I've taken care of most of my tasks around the house.  So, you know, I feel like my attention span has doubled.  And so you're making all the rest of us look bad, Matt.  Stop it.  It's going to be fun to see what I've missed, though.  I'm kind of curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who wants to tell them about Google being sold?  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Rupert Murdoch bought Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I knew Mission Impossible was the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Matt, the dark, dirty secret is that you miss nothing.  Like I've taken time off the Internet before and I felt that worry that I was missing something big.  And, you know, unless it's like Sandy or 9-Eleven or something, you know, really huge, you really just don't miss stuff.  You know, you just don't miss much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, even when there was, you know, some stuff that was actual news in my sphere, people would email me.  So I'd find out about it either way.  It's a good chance to sort of take a step back and say, well, how much do we really need to be consuming the news?  And with that, let's consume some news.  What do you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I certainly I don't I used to watch the news kind of compulsively on TV.  And boy, that was just that's a cesspool.  And it is true that if you stop watching it, when you go back, you go, wow, this is awful.  This is they do nothing but report.  You know, they search the world for the worst possible stories to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's no actual utility to it.  My favorite thing about TV news is standing in front of the place where nothing's happened for the last 12 hours.  But I'm standing here to act like I'm where things are happening, but nothing's behind me.  But I'm just here wasting a lot of money standing here so I can make video.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the ones that frustrated me the most are the sort of human interest stories that are reported as if they're actually news like, you know, if one person, you know, the type stuff, it's like a large fraction of the news when you get back.  And it's like this is this is not really going to affect anybody else's life unless you want to wallow in it.  So I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me try this on you. I have a new theory about the paradox of news.  All right. Get the get your no does out, folks.  That information that has an impact on your life that is really useful for you or your community in a sense is the most valuable, but it's also the most easily commodified because it's just information.  Everything else is entertainment.  Right. The New York Times special thing about avalanches. I don't go to avalanches. I don't ski. It has no effect on my life. You already you really you don't you don't write columns and opinions.  It's all entertainment.  And that maybe if it's really, really, really good, like a movie, maybe you can actually charge for it. But the highest value is in the thing that you that will become modified immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's interesting. I allowed myself to look at like whether you know these are things that are actually directly really useful for you.  And what was interesting is even trying to go off the Internet, I keep a lot of stuff in the cloud.  And so I had to struggle with whether that was, you know, on the Internet or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it's on the Internet. What's the struggle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I keep my to do list. I used to keep it on a sorry my pocket.  You don't get it anymore.  Goodbye to do list.  Yeah. So that's a little strange. But I do agree, Jeff, like there's so many things we can't really affect.  And so worrying about them or struggling with them doesn't really matter.  There's a very sliver, fine sliver of stuff where you actually can make a difference. And that's maybe worth paying attention to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's it's pretty local. It's like right here.  And you probably don't need the Internet to use it to look at it or about your company or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. This is part of your 30 days, your 30 days thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Something new every 30 days. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's next? Next month is gluten free.  I'll be you know, at the end of the month, I'll be like, give me bread or no, you won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You won't. It's easy to give up. Oh, OK. Cool.  Yeah. Doesn't even say that's why they call it gluten, because it doesn't even sound appealing.  It's like glue. Oh, yeah, I can give up glue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I can give up bread, though. Bread. Oh, bread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's different. I'm not giving up bread.  So I go to pizza places now. They have gluten free pizza.  I don't know what the hell it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got a whole store near me that's almost all gluten free stuff. I could eat gluten.  I don't need that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think that it really is wheat, but they don't want to say it right.  Right. Because that would be like gluten.  I can give up. But it let you get this is lent. Right.  You can give up something like really good for Len.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. Hmm. My wife, I've been alternating.  So like an exercise one and a diet one and an exercise one and a nutrition one.  So this is it's a nutrition month.  We're actually doing February because it's a short month.  So if we really love bread, then we can get back to it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I noticed you didn't do 30 days minus the Internet.  Yeah, that's a long especially since it's your job. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a lot. I'm dreading the month when Matt gives up fighting spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the nice thing is other people, the people on my team do a much better job than I would do at this point on fighting the spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's a bad sign. You've worked your way out of a job. Yeah.  You're supposed to do that. But I always thought that seemed like a counterproductive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Me thinks Matt is very humble. Yes, he is a good engineer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a good leader. So Google plus now number two after Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As Victor Godotra and I each said at the same time, that's a lot of ghosts. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? Vic said that. Yeah, he did.  Because that's kind of acknowledging something we've all thought, which is, well, yeah, if you make everybody or encourage everybody who gets a Gmail account to make a Google plus account, then they're technically Google plus users.  But are they really using it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Number two social network better than Twitter. What's your current attitude toward Google plus, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I keep trying to use it and it's just, you know, it's not it's nothing wrong with it.  It's wonderful. It's just it's it's.  You forget about it. You forget about it. Communities. I really thought, hey, this is great.  This is going to turn it around. And I just never get over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you don't forget about Twitter. No. And you don't forget about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then Twitter comes up with this thing called Vine.  And that's kind of, you know, there's something missing and I can't figure it out what it is because it's possible to create a new social network like Vine and be very compelling.  And you really want to use it now. I doubt I'll use it after a few weeks, but you really want to use it.  Google Plus, it just doesn't. What's wrong? I don't understand. What is wrong?  Matt, you don't have you can recuse yourself because you couldn't say there's something wrong with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I have to say one of the very first things that I hit after my my fast of Internet was over was Google Plus.  But it was also internal Google Plus. There are versions of that's different.  Use within your company. Right. But to me and I actually follow a lot of people within Google.  And it turns out that makes it a really fascinating conversation.  And it's incredibly interesting to me. And so I think part of the challenge is finding the right people.  Absolutely. Here is finding the right people to follow on Twitter or, you know, coordinating who to who to contact with or, you know, get together with on Facebook.  And so making that an easier thing to do is always going to be difficult.  But if you can find the right people, I think you really can get a hotbed of interesting stuff going on, because I've seen like people talking about Tesla inside of Google.  And it's incredibly interesting. It makes me want to like borrow somebody's Tesla and try it out and, you know, swap notes and all those sorts of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It must just be me, because to me it's like, you know, it's kind of like the mildly interesting magazine you get at a dentist's office that's better than just staring into space.  But not much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I say I baited you so you can get in trouble, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean, I'm being honest. And it's just and I and maybe I'm sure it's just me.  But that's kind of how it feels like. Yeah, that's mildly interesting.  It's not that engaging. And then I quickly move on to something else.  Am I the only one who feels that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but it doesn't have the addictive hook for me either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say something missing and I don't know what it is. I go back to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it's a very efficient way to get the attention of Googlers, which is very handy to me.  You know, there's I mean, there are a lot of Googlers like that are very active on it.  And, you know, this is what we do. So I like being there for that.  There's a lot of really great tech folks.  But, yeah, I have to remember I have to kind of force myself to remember to go there.  And it's just that addictive kind of hook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It used to be my start page and it isn't any more tech meme is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. OK. This this way, you have a start page in your browser still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you? I don't. I just I have to open a blank page.  That's worse than the dentist's office. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a couple of pin tabs and then, yeah, I have a blank. I have a blank page.  I don't know. Yeah. I love I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, I am not rooting against Google Plus.  I am rooting for it. I love I think it should be.  It's you know, I always thought threaded discussions would be the best.  I just I want it to succeed. I think there should be.  I don't like how Twitter runs its business. I've always been critical of that.  Facebook. Oh, my God. It's a nightmare.  Google has you know, Google Plus should be wonderful.  And I just don't it's not compelling to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think one one thing you have to consider and let me let me try this out on you  and see whether you buy it is, you know, Facebook's been around for nine years.  Twitter's been around for quite a while.  If you look at how far Google Plus has come in roughly a year and a half,  it's pretty good amount of velocity.  And so if we can get the people on there where they're interested, it's kind of funny.  I was exercising with somebody recently and they sort of mentioned out of the blue  that they really like the Google Plus app on the iPhone.  And you know that it was really richly compelling and you know, very nice and a good experience.  It is gorgeous. I feel like, you know, as Google keeps working on trying to make sure  that Google Plus is completely integrated into Google, then over time,  hopefully there is more value add there and people find it more addictive and enjoyable.  And they just find it more compelling.  So I think if you if you compare against people that have been around for a very long time,  yeah, that's always tricky because they've got a pretty far lead.  But if you look at how far Google Plus has come in, you know, 18 months or something like that,  it's pretty good by that yardstick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, certainly. But then the article that we're referring to that says it's the number two social network,  you can't have it both ways. Is it the number two social network or is it just this youthful thing  that's just trying and starting and isn't yet great?  That's what I mean, is that, yeah, it's number two in raw numbers.  But but that's mostly because of Google's strategy to incorporate into every damn thing Google does.  And so it's separate there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's it. That's it was interesting to me that YouTube is separate in that in that.  Right. So I mean, it interrupts you, which which which would make me think, oh, is this I need a clarification on that number.  Is the Google Plus number across all the products or is that people going to plus dot Google dot com interacting there?  You know, it's kind of fuzzy. Right.  And the one nice thing about Facebook being kind of a walled garden is very clear.  You're either on Facebook or you're not. Right.  You know, you're liking from someone else.  I mean, the other thing about that chart, too, is Facebook is by far number one, like far and away.  Number one, like double double Google Plus at number two.  And then everything else kind of trails off your points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, taking you add Google Plus and YouTube, it's close to Facebook size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, I think that's true. If you look at Google for years and years and years, we didn't even want to know who you were.  Right. In any way, shape or form, you come to us, we give you search results, maybe some ads, you click on either one.  You're happy. We're happy. Life is good.  And so I think Google was actually very slow to sort of wake up that if we know a little bit about you, if you're willing to tell us a little bit about where you are, what you're interested in, we can return better search results.  We can find more interesting content for you.  So it's kind of interesting. It's like all these independent groups came up with their own silos of like a version of identity.  And only now are we getting around to kind of getting that unified, which really well overdue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, I've been arguing the same thing with media companies that they only saw us as a mass.  And the only way they're going to succeed is by learning from that lesson and treating us as individuals, which means you know about us so you can feed us relevance.  Google's goal is to give you relevance. The only way it can is if it knows you as a person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I also I'm just I'm suffering from from total speaking of not remembering to go there.  I'm just suffering from serious social network overload.  Like I just it's like Twitter and Tumblr and Facebook and Google and Path and Quora and like so many of these are really good.  You know, Quora, I love I could spend I could spend two hours and Quora every day just reading answers and questions.  But I forget to go there and I wind up just going to the thing that sort of popped up in my face at the time, which I don't I don't like reacting that way.  I don't like to I like to be more mindful about where I spend my time and what I do.  But it's just it's so hard to figure out.  And it just turns out to be the thing that's like the easiest, you know, they get the most amount of value with the least amount of effort.  And so far, that's been that's been basically Twitter for me.  But I you know, but I hate that, too, because there are a lot of things about Twitter I don't like.  So it's it's it's it's hard. I just I just feel like so many things are competing for our attention at all times.  There's so many great communities out there that sometimes I just feel like, oh, I'm going to take a week off the Internet.  I think that's really it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think if anything, maybe the only thing Google Plus did wrong is it came too late.  It came late if it had, you know, I mean, I would have loved to have seen it best Twitter and Facebook because it is more I feel more open and more friendly.  Although I still want to write API.  Now, didn't we hear a rumor?  I heard somebody say, oh, no, there's a right API.  It's coming any minute now.  Did we not hear that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if we have we heard that.  Maybe I I keep thinking like next Google I.O.  There's going to be a huge API announcement.  But I thought that last year and it didn't quite happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I understand Google's reluctance because what you don't want to be is just a place where people port their tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Right. Right. And we saw that with Buzz.  You don't want to just have it get polluted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, that's what happens to almost everywhere.  So I completely understand that.  But it does may mean that you can't have a client.  You know, you have to use the Google client.  I mean, just there's there's you know, that's how Twitter built its passionate fan base with third party clients.  So and then and then they killed them, of course.  Yeah. But that's another story for another day.  I think the reason we maybe Gina like Twitter is it's supposed the way it's turned out to be is a signaling engine for everything else.  So by looking at my tweet stream or flip board, which is essentially looking at my tweet stream, I see it's aggregating.  It's an aggregator.  And so it's not just now, I guess, in theory, so is Google+.  But even when I go to the explore button on Google+, you know, people might say, well, you're just following the wrong people, Leo.  So I go to explore, which is the hot stuff on Google+.  I even find that just kind of mildly interesting.  But but nothing that I would just say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Say that tends to have too much Paris Hilton for my taste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, maybe I need to make my own explore feed.  Here's a pure white gold Mercedes Benz. Fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's friction in the posting, right?  Like to do a really good Google+, you want to have a giant image, you want to have a video, you know, that the app looks great because it's kind of multimedia focused.  You want to put in a little bolding. You want to have a link.  I always feel bad about sharing something without saying something about it.  But on Twitter, you can just retweet without doing that.  So a little bit a little bit of friction with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't use it to say this happened and that happened.  You don't live blog there. You know, the world.  By the way, there's a strange thing that happens not to put you in the spam bucket here.  But learning from Elgin that that big pictures work and I put a big picture up.  And then a lot of times suddenly one post, which was a really sad post about about a girl suicide.  I have a picture of Amanda Palmer there and I have 350 spam comments, mostly from some fake Asian names saying, wow, hip, good picture.  What's the what's the benefit they get out of doing that?  That's why I don't understand. I'm not the logic of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep. Yep. And it's a slightly different team.  But I'll give you my best guess, which is, you know, they're trying to look real because if they can build up some signals where they look real over time,  then maybe when they finally do their big payload and they drop a Viagra link or something,  then the algorithms might be a little more reluctant because they're like, oh, well, you know, this guy has commented 50 times and nobody's claimed that it's spam.  But a lot of times people are just trying to build up some reputation that they'll then abuse later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That makes sense. I've been waiting for somebody to explain this to me because it seems like a zero.  There's no benefit at all. All right.  It doesn't work that well, I would guess. Right.  Because don't don't doesn't everybody go through those posts and go spam, spam, spam, spam, spam. Yeah.  In some ways, it could have a counterproductive effect. It's identifying you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and if you're really smart as a spammer, you might do some some tests posts, you know, and you might figure out the people who don't work things as spam.  Right. And then comment on those. So, you know, it's always an arms race where whatever we do, they try to figure out how to get around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. What what a fun job you have.  It is fun. I do enjoy it.  All right. Let's talk. We're gonna take a break. Come back. I want to talk a little bit about BlackBerry.  Not rim, by the way. They don't call them. They don't call themselves rim anymore.  Mostly because people just felt it was weird to say I want to get a job at rim.  I'm glad somebody got that. But now now they're showtime.  But now that was a rim shot, by the way.  But now they're calling it BlackBerry and we'll look at it.  And actually, I want one. But maybe you can talk.  You want everything. I want everything.  So maybe you can talk me down.  I'll tell you what I would love to have.  I would love it that I would never have to go to the post office.  I'll tell you what I would love to have.  I would love it that I would never have to go to the post office again.  Well, I don't. Hey, wow. Isn't that amazing?  Thanks to Stamps.com. Stamps.com is like the pro tip for people who do a lot of mailing.  You don't need a postage meter. You don't need special ink.  You certainly don't need to go to the post office.  Everything you could do at the post office you could do from your desk.  Print your own U.S. postage with your printer, your computer.  You got it all at Stamps.com.  And yes, the rates are going up, but Stamps.com handles that automatically.  In fact, with that great scale, you never pay a penny more in postage than you have to.  You plop that letter or package on the scale. It's a USB scale. Tell Stamps.com.  You then print out the postage if it's a package.  Or you can even put it right on the envelope if you're just sending out invoices or mailers or whatever.  If you do a lot of that, boy, it's fantastic.  It prints not just the address, which it can get from your address book, from QuickBooks, from the website you're using.  But it also prints your return address, prints your company logo if you want, and it prints the stamps.  I mean, it is a total solution. Click Print and Mail.  And the best part is, even if it's a giant package, the mail carrier comes to you, picks it up.  You don't have to get up from your desk. You can even schedule free pickups.  You get discounts you can't get at the post office.  It prints out the forms for international mailing.  And if you're an eBay, Amazon, PayPal, Etsy seller, you can use Stamps.com.  And it will automatically take the recipient data, the mailing information from the website, and put it right in there.  So it just saves you a lot of time.  If you use ExpressMail or PriorityMail, not only do you save, you also will get automatic emails to the recipient with tracking numbers and all of that.  So here's the deal. If you want to try this, and you really ought to if you're a small business, if you do mailing,  if you do maybe more than five or ten letters a day, actually if you do more than a few letters a day, it's probably worth it.  Go to Stamps.com. Click the radio microphone. It's certainly worth it to the trial offer.  And enter our offer code TWIG, T-W-I-G, and you'll get a $110 bonus value, including more postage, $55 in free postage,  coupons you can use over the first few months of your Stamps.com subscription.  You also get a free digital scale. It's really pretty.  $5 supply kit, four-week trial. All you have to do is go to Stamps.com, click the microphone, use the offer code TWIG.  If you've heard me talk about it before and you've been putting it off, don't put it off any longer.  I've tried them all. This is the one. I've been a Stamps.com member for ten years. Stamps.com.  So we actually, Tech News Today got up early. Got up early and did a special edition, 7 a.m. R-TIME, covering the BlackBerry announcement.  BB10, the new operating system, looks very sweet. Gina, have you looked at this at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the problem. No. This is the problem. Nobody else has. Wall Street tanked rim stock by 12%.  So maybe even Wall Street isn't excited about this. Really, the problem is it won't be available in the U.S. till mid-March.  It's already late, delayed, and frankly, there's Android, there's iPhone. I mean, even Windows Phone has a lead. It's got to be tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I make fun of all my Canadian friends for holding on dearly to their BlackBerrys. Who has an act of patriotism?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say this is a pretty modern operating system. It's real-time, it's fast, it's got some nice features, some nice redesigned features.  There's two models. There's the Z10, which is a keyboardless version of the BlackBerry, and then the BB10, which has a keyboard.  Okay. Just can't get anybody interested in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We talked a little bit about this on All About Android last night about there's a new number that like 92% of smartphones shipped maybe last quarter was either iOS or Android.  It kind of confirmed what I was feeling is that as long as my interest is concerned, at least, it's still a two-horse race.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  4.2-inch screen, that's kind of tiny. 1280 x 768, though, it's good resolution. That's more pixel density than a Retina iPhone, 356 pixels per inch.  Dual-core, 1.5 GHz processor, well, gee, dual-core seems a little, not too many given that we're about to see the Galaxy S4 with eight cores.  Two gigs of RAM, though, that's good. 16 gigs of storage, a micro SD card slot so you can expand it. It's really got beautiful multitasking.  70,000 applications, although that number is a little deceiving because a lot of them are ported applications. They were literally paying developers to port their stuff over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does it run Chrome? I think that's the litmus test for anything I want to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it has Angry Birds.  Need Chrome.  It has Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Need Google Chrome.  Need Google Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  RDO, Angry Birds. Did I say Angry Birds? It's got Kindle?  Chrome.  No Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google Maps, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you know, that's actually, what does it have for Nav? I don't know.  It has Bing.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  I think.  Didn't mean to hurt you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the funny moment at I went to a Facebook thing this week yesterday to show off Graph Search.  They had all these media people. It was an entire table of they went around to introduce themselves. Hi, I'm social media from NBC.  ABC from CBS.  It was all social media, a big table.  So anyway, they show and then they show a web search and it comes up with Bing and the whole room kind of quietly chortled as once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God. You know, Dvorak went for this was years ago.  Dvorak would ask people what search engine you use.  And if you said Alta Vista or Yahoo, he'd know you weren't a geek.  If you said Google, he'd go, you know, yeah, but this was like when Google was first starting out.  But Google has been the litmus test for 10 years.  It still is.  Yeah.  If you say it out the Vista today, people would really laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a mental block. What was the one that came out of Berkeley?  Ask?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Berkeley. Inked to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Inked to me. That was it. Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I always thought it was Inked to me.  I think it might be Inked to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No one knows and no one cares.  It's dead.  It's gone.  They got bought by Yahoo.  I think Yahoo.  Yeah.  Well, we know what happens then.  And then, of course, Yahoo no longer does search.  So, in fact, somewhere there's a machine with the Inked to me code sitting on it and it's not turned on.  Poor thing.  That's it.  Goodbye.  Yeah.  Really, seriously, what happens to old search code when it dies?  Yahoo bought Overture, all the web, all to Vista and Inked to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Broadcasting.com.  It's like all the other search engines Yahoo caught up, sucked together and then they decided,  oh, we're just going to turn the search code off and use Microsoft.  And so, I kind of wish they would open that code up or kind of increase the number of search engines.  Open that code up or kind of increase the diversity a little bit because you're just running along.  And then suddenly, four of the people you're running with all landed on the same team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think when Marissa went to Yahoo, first started her job the first day, she goes in,  they say, here's the keys to the executive washroom.  Here's your office key.  And here, this is the key to the closet where we've stored all the old search technologies.  It's in there.  And I would like open the door and look.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would be unzipping that file for sure.  Give me the tarball.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Open source it.  Do something.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What repository?  CVS most likely.  Yeah, CVS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Probably too old for Git.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, God.  Yeah.  And subversion.  Git was just a gleam in Linus's eye.  It's true.  I think Linus was just a gleam in his father's eye.  We're talking a long time ago.  Internet time.  So all right.  So there's literally no excitement whatsoever for BlackBerry.  I tried.  I did, folks.  Sorry, Leah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I tried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tried to gin up some excitement.  I wish them well.  OK, here's another exciting thing.  Microsoft Office is here.  Wow, you're just.  You're a barrel of laughs.  I don't want to sit next to you at the football game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I'm an older person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I remember when these were important products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What happened?  This is it's so funny how this stuff changes.  Yeah.  Microsoft had a big tent in Bryant Park in New York.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I thought I'd wander over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Office is still alive and well in corporate environments.  I'm paying for it.  Big organization.  I bought it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's $100,000.  I bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I bought it.  I bought it.  I bought it.  I bought it.  I bought it.  I bought it.  I bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's $100 a year and you can install it in five computers.  Microsoft won't be happy to hear that three of them are Macintoshes, but they count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it does cloudy things, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, by default, it saves the SkyDrive, Microsoft's cloud solution by default.  So if you're not paying attention, you're not saving your documents, your hard drive  at all.  Oh, isn't that interesting?  Yeah, it is.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The power of defaults on a Microsoft platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, more so than anywhere else, right?  Yeah.  How many people still use the Internet Explorer start page?  Everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eric Schmidt.  Well, Leo, we need to get back to life back in the show for those two topics.  Would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please, Jeff.  I know you're sick.  I know you're dying, but you got more cheerful and chipperness than I do.  Give us something.  While you were about to go this Eric Schmidt, Eric Schmidt, Futurist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, here's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is going to depress you, too.  Oh, no.  Oh, yes, because the future is cyber terrorists targeted by drone strikes.  Online identities taken hostage and held for ransom.  Parents explaining online privacy to their kids before sex.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm trying to imagine sitting at a down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Virtual is my favorite virtual kidnappings.  Ransom mean your ID for real money.  Rather than keeping captives in the jungle, groups like FARC may prefer a virtual hostage.  That's how important online ID is.  Somebody needs to goose Eric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, when he says FARC, it's F.A.R.C.  They're a Colombian rebel group, not the FARC report out of FARC dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like the goons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could see a host of renegade FARCers doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's another one.  Terrorists and criminals could use drones to carry improvised explosive devices that could result in conflict between civil and military drones.  Well, it happened over the US Mexico border.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that what Eric, I mean, Daniel Suarez wrote about in Kill Decision.  Kill Decision was all about privatizing the drones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that brought a lot of happiness to the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he was speaking to a student group at Cambridge University.  The first of a number of speeches, get ready, the first of a number of speeches outlining his view of the future.  I don't think he's going to be invited back.  You know, that was really great, Eric.  And I think it was so good you could stop right there.  We don't need any more of your uplifting futurism.  Many people, I talk to many people and it's easy to have a dystopian vision of the future.  It always has been.  Look at George Orwell and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is odd for Eric because Eric is usually, of course, technology is good and leading to good things.  But we rarely see that.  Maybe it was a strip to North Korea just made him.  He said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He kind of said, you know, after coming back from North Korea, I guess it was kind of bleak of five billion people not connected to the Internet.  Not in all of North Korea.  Five billion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But at the same time, it feels like, yes, it's true that you can see a lot of this happening already.  I see all kinds of reports of people getting their identity hijacked online and offline and all that sort of stuff.  But for me, this represents some opportunity.  Right.  If you can be the company or the entity that helps people protect their identities, then that's a huge way that you can protect people going forward.  And then you can unlock all kinds of interesting things.  I just realized my passport is about to expire in August.  So I'm filling out a paper form with a picture of me and doing all this sort of stuff.  You know, and in theory, if you could do a better job of that, you know, then life could be more seamless and more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Part of it, when I do work with around the Postal Service and all that part of the thought about the Postal Service is identity could be a huge, important job for them.  That's depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's uplifting.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, well, let's flip it over then, Leo.  Suppose we know who you are.  You can walk up to your Tesla or whatever and the door automatically pops out.  Right.  And it already knows who you are.  And it already has all the preferences you like.  You walk up to your computer, it unlocks, it knows who you are.  You know, it's maybe doing fingerprint or it's looking at your eye, doing a retina scan and all this sort of stuff becomes seamless.  And now you don't have to carry around all this junk in your pocket.  You know, you can get better stuff.  You walk up to anybody else's computer and you can get the programs you're used to using.  So there are positive aspects to this.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think it's probably the case that, you know, you think about things like climate change, the fact that there are what is it, three automobiles per person that are unused or whatever that is.  Those those you have to the way humans are.  You have to have a crisis before we before we acknowledge it and say, OK, let's fix it.  We have autonomous vehicles.  Perfect. I mean, we know how to do it.  The technology exists.  It's clear the benefit.  You know, private ownership of automobiles is really wasteful.  It's really dumb, but it's not going to happen until there's a crisis.  Right.  Or am I wrong?  It just feels like that's how humans work.  We have to live in crisis mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I want to have that moment.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to go hang myself now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am not helping.  Am I?  But no, I'm trying to turn this into a positive.  I do, you know, because for every bad thing that's coming like, you know, drone warfare, there's amazing medical breakthroughs, you know, breakthroughs in in the understanding of how the brain works.  Technology breakthroughs.  There's still wonderful, amazing choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what the society is making choices.  We're figuring this out.  We ran a session at Davos on norms and we're just negotiating our norms and figuring out, given the choices we have, how we should operate together, what societies do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But who makes that choice and when do they make it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We all make it together.  We negotiate.  Right.  I mean, how do you negotiate that that we in America all walk on the right side of the sidewalk?  Right.  Unless there's a Brit coming down the sidewalk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny because somebody did that a long time ago, I guess.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I was doing my usual codec camera 1890s codec or stick and Davos.  And somebody said he saw, you know, if he saw somebody in a park taking a picture of his kid, he'd smash norm is you don't do that.  Really?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  You don't take a picture of your kid in the park?  No, somebody else's kid.  You don't take a picture of somebody else's kid in the.  Yeah.  No wonder the world's depressing.  Is that really true?  Is it is not is not OK to take a picture of somebody else's kid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Aren't there laws about you can't even be at a playground in some cities unless you're with a child like like just an adult kind of on your own?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean not you don't even have to be a sex offender.  Do you like anybody?  I think I know I'm not allowed there, but anybody.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, I'm just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a joke.  Bad joke.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was funny when I visited China, a lot of people wanted to do.  I was with I was with a group of Americans who had children.  Some of them had children.  Some of the children were visiting the orphanages from where they were adopted.  But the Chinese wanted to take pictures of the kids and the Americans I was with were kind of uncomfortable with that.  And so at one point, I heard one sort of explaining, well, you know, in the US, you ask permission or that's not something you don't take pictures of other people's kids because and the Chinese person was kind of like, why?  Really? Why?  What is wrong with you?  Are you?  Well, you know, sometimes bad things happen.  They're like, no, that doesn't happen here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Terrorists won the terrorists won the terrorists.  This is proof positive.  The terrorists won.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I put a picture of myself in my Android hat up on Google Plus and somebody came in and said from China said in China, if a man wears a green hat, it means his wife is cheating on him.  Oh, oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And somebody does this voluntarily.  How about a green headband?  Is that is that why?  Wait a minute.  Tell me the truth.  Does that make any sense?  So like your wife's cheating on you.  So you say, I know what I'll do.  I'll wear a green hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know that she's cheating on you with a newer Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My wife's using a note to she secretly ordered the Nexus four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you do it?  Did you do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did.  I didn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm trying to be really responsible.  I got a kid now.  Jeff, come on.  Last year's model.  I'm trying to I'm trying to get a Galaxy Nexus.  It's good enough.  I'm trying to I know I egged you on, which is totally not fair.  Which one are we trying to get her to buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, she was the biggie.  Now you can get the Nexus four now.  It's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's only 300 bucks and it's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I played with one yesterday.  It really is nice.  It is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, you know, and by the way, it was Gina who said, no, no, Jeff, go ahead.  Open up the box.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead.  She really wants to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's a push of man.  But why do you have to Jeff?  Ruth is.  Oh, I see.  There's two different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're right.  It's not that different.  Right.  It's nice phone.  But no, you can probably wait for the next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's that wireless charger thing with the daydream.  I mean, I know I've got daydream on the wireless charger, though, really kind of tempted me.  But yeah, I think I'm going to try and just I'm going to try to wait.  I'm kind of going to try to be restrained here.  But, man, it is a nice looking phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is nice.  It feels good to once I figure it out, taking off the plastic around the edges, it really  feels good as.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Except for the 10 and the four, I've had every Nexus.  So I've kind of I feel bad about like breaking my Nexus streak.  I'm not I'm not as interested in the 10, but definitely the four.  I'm excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think as the host of All About Android, you actually have to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know this is a dangerous road to go down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If I have so many Android heads, handsets around the house that my wife is just like,  OK, no, really?  What what is going on?  I'm like, I have to test.  I'm a developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's not in the tech industry, is she?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's not a big fan of the extra because, you know, every device has a charger and the  cords and the case and the thing, you know, that everything has kind of extra cross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually I actually have a large piece of furniture.  In my house, that's designed to hold things that are charging.  It was purpose built.  Yeah, this was purpose built by the Wood Whisperer, Mark Spagnolo for me.  It's beautiful wood.  It's this big.  It holds like 12 phones all with your USB cables.  It's gorgeous.  That sounds really nice.  Get that and your wife will say, oh, it's a beautiful piece of furniture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get more.  My problem, Leo, I'm going to make a confession here.  So we have a shelf.  We have a shelf.  We have a shelf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have a shelf.  I'm going to make a confession here.  So we have a shelf when you come into the garage mudroom there.  There's a closet and there's a shelf that is just one long strip and we can charge everything,  which I loved for years.  Now, when I wake up, I pick up my Nexus seven or my phone.  So I need to charge it next to the bed.  Yeah, that's kind of sad.  That means it glows, which is not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like I'm trying to cut down the glow after you have about five or six phones  at your bed.  It actually is a whole room.  It's like daytime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's like microwaving your brain while you sleep as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what I do is I put a plate of eggs there and they're scrambled in the morning.  It's fantastic.  They're ready to go.  A couple more phones, I could fry bacon.  That'll be set.  I love this guy.  Steven J. Crawley, consulting engineer.  He says, he's a consulting wireless engineer.  He says, Google, you know, Google, I didn't know this, filed an application at the FCC  last week seeking permission to conduct secret testing of an experimental radio system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If somebody tied down Matt Cutts until he tells us what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll tell us Mr. Cutts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cutts is one of those, if I say then I'll get fired kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you know?  Can you say if you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, yes, I do know.  But the beautiful thing about working at Google is that they trust you.  Right.  So these sort of stories come out in the Wall Street Journal and every week we have a TGIF,  which is actually on Thursdays now instead of Fridays.  So I don't know why they still call it TGIF.  Because they're always ahead of things at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they did it so that people could dial in from around the world and not have it be, you know,  you know, the weekend or something like that.  So that was actually the number one question.  And because, you know, they trust you at Google pretty well, they told a lot of people,  Yeah, this is what was going on with that particular thing.  So I can't actually talk about it, but I can say, hey, you know, in Google you learn about all kinds of cool projects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so, Chad, I want you to zoom in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zoom in on Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can see the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I'm going to read some stuff, Matt, and just listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I won't do that to you, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would take Matt and, you know, I'd be able to look in her glasses,  which were the thick 70s Coke bottle type glasses, and you could read her cards right across the screen.  A game or two. And then I felt guilty and had to tell her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, no fun playing D&D with somebody you can read their cards.  And exhibits. Now, so Stephen J. Crowley, consulting engineer, did I mention that?  He's a consulting engineer in his blog post, says,  see, Google requested that the application be held confidential by the FCC.  In fact, even the request that it be held confidential has been redacted.  So you don't they don't even want you to know it's confidential.  So he says, based on what he could see in this, they're going to test.  It's going to be around the campus and Mountain View, up to 50 base stations, 200 user devices.  Stations will be indoors and outdoors with a range each of 100 to 200 meters and 500 to 1000 meters, respectively.  Both directional and non directional within a two mile radius of the campus.  So it's a dense network that is might have could be supposed to have a very high carrying capacity for data.  The bands requested are currently allocated to the educational broadband service and the broadband radio service,  which happens to be clear wires frequencies.  Google did sell at stake in ClearWire.  But remember that there was this whole thing going on where Dish was trying to buy ClearWire, Sprint wants to reabsorb ClearWire.  These frequencies are kind of interesting. They're they're they might even be in play.  So he supposes it could be a super dense LTE network using the ClearWire frequencies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Density affecting what?  Well, it could be. TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, could be just high density gives you more bandwidth.  Yes. Yeah, no higher carrying capacity, so it's it's higher bandwidth.  Very high bandwidth.  It's their first experimental radio application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Matt, Matt, answer me this. There's 200 devices. It's reported.  Do you guys is like, do you go sidle up and be nice to somebody in the hopes that you get one?  You want one. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I love working at Google because you get, you know, I was playing with something on Google Apps earlier in Gmail and something new popped up and I was like, oh, and then you have to search the string to see whether it's available to the outside world, which is why you never want to project your screen because you might have some little weird sense.  Yeah, experiment.  I do love one one real perk of having been at Google a while is when there's something neat going on, like some device or something like that, I'm like, oh, I would be a happy dog fooder and give you lots of yes.  And usually there are people have been very nice about letting me see Matt cuts, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they actually do open up to dog food for a lot of different people because it helps them if they can test any sort of, you know, whether it's a new, you know, laptop or a new tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, tablet or the show us your wrist.  Do you have a Google watch on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's got something on.  I do not.  It's disguised as a Nike fuel band, but I don't buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's just a Nike.  Wow. It's a good disguise.  It's a very good disguise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've been lazy today.  Get to work.  What's your goal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, just 2000.  Yeah, I need to keep working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to have I used to have my goal 3000 and I never won.  I made my low.  I look.  Oh, what's your goal?  Twenty five hundred.  Yeah, that's what mine is to 2500.  It seems like a good number.  I can get that many, many days, but not all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's BS because the truth is, I just stickulate like an Italian.  Work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's work.  Still the day and you're sort of doing this in place and you're not even moving your legs and you're like, yes, fuel band.  I am running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a little easy.  It's you know, it doesn't sound like that.  Biggest story.  Sounds like you're going to test some sort of high speed data, wireless data network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, cool.  Of course, there's a lot of stuff going on like that.  Like always, projects.  So it's nothing like, you know, it would like.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Big deal.  Right.  I like this.  Google giving is giving a grant of one million dollars to fund free Raspberry Pi for school kids.  I think sugary treats for school kids is a great idea.  Yes.  But this is not the Raspberry Pi you're thinking is a microcomputer, of course.  Fifteen thousand UK school children are going to get Raspberry Pi.  This is the kind of thing you want to promote stem.  Yeah, people give give grants to schools.  The Raspberry Pi is 30 bucks.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Give it's like half of it is for the device and the rest is for training, which is important.  So good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's true.  Yeah.  Don't you see that all the time where they dump technology on a school say, good luck.  Have fun.  You got to train them.  You got to show the teachers how to use it.  That's so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It looks like this.  It's the pies plus support and teaching materials.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  People get people really hooked on it.  But my favorite is they're giving one million to pi hackers and they're giving pi million  to Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google always loves those numbers.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Three point one four one five nine million dollars actually goes out to several more  decimal places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  They'll give you a fraction of a cent.  So it sounds like the idea behind this one is, you know, Google has given money if people  are able to crack, you know, at Chrome, you know, we try to make sure it's very secure  runs in a sandbox, all that sort of stuff.  So they are now giving up to three point one million dollars.  Wow.  And I think you can earn up to one hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the most successful  exploit.  So if you can crack that version of Chrome OS, you know, in a persistent way, at that  point, you can pretty much take the rest of the year off because you've earned your hundred  and fifty K salary for the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  No kidding.  Wow.  Does that I mean, I imagine that that's a very popular among Googlers and they kind  of line up.  But it's not just Googlers.  It could be anybody, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's open to anybody.  And I think Googlers are obligated to actually just disclose the bug if they want.  Oh, yeah.  But there's a there's a contest in March called Ponium.  And it's it's one of my favorite things because it's like the Super Bowl of Chrome hackers  and, you know, other hackers because they see if they can hack these machines.  And so every year you're like, is somebody come up going to come up with a new attack  for Firefox or Chrome?  And last year they came up with two attacks on Chrome and they chained like 12 vulnerabilities  together.  And the Chrome guys to their credit love to find out about that because it makes things  more secure for everybody else.  Yeah, no, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is every company does something usually does something like this.  It's a really good idea.  But Google is easily the most generous of any company I've ever seen for paying for these  these bugs and these bug hunts.  That's really great.  I presume Ponium will be on Pi Day March 14th.  Right.  That would be cool.  Yeah.  And they can award it.  No, I don't think we can go on to too much on that.  Let's take a break.  When we come back, is YouTube launching a pay per view channel?  Interesting thought.  Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.  It's not a law firm.  It helps you get your business, your legal business done, self help, legal documents,  business and personal.  And by the way, if you feel like I gosh, I'd like to talk to a lawyer about this.  They've got a great legal network with fixed rate pricing.  So you can talk to a lawyer as well.  But so much of this you can do yourself.  I did it myself for the LLC.  So if you want to start a corporation LLCs at LegalZoom, start at 99 bucks.  Try that at a law firm.  And it makes a big difference.  I got to say it's very easy to step through on the website.  You walk through the Q&A and you're really you're there.  You're done sooner than you think.  You can do an S corp.  You can do a will to last will and testament trusts.  If you're a blogger, did you trademark your blog's name?  It's not a bad idea.  Trademark your logo.  Easy to do copyrights.  They've even got patents, NDAs and more.  A living trust at LegalZoom or a will.  Sixty nine dollars for a will.  If you don't have a will, you know, if the government decides what happens with your money  and your kids, if you have kids, you really should have a will.  In the past 12 years, two million Americans have used LegalZoom for LLCs, wills, trusts,  trademark and more.  They've happily gotten this stuff done without paying big legal fees.  In most of these cases, it's so simple.  You can do it yourself.  But if you do have questions or you need advice, you can access their extensive network  of attorneys through their legal plans available in most states.  And by the way, when you when you're choosing a legal plan attorney, of course, they vetted them.  But you then also have access to their online profiles and completely unedited customer  reviews as well.  So you really can choose with confidence.  This is such a great service.  LegalZoom.com.  They're not a law firm, but you can get self-help services at your specific direction or speak  to a legal plan attorney to get your questions answered and get ongoing advice.  For a special thank you for mentioning us, use the offer code TWIG and you'll get 10 bucks  off at checkout.  It's you know, I know it's not a huge amount, but it's just a way of saying thank you for  letting them know you heard this on this week in Google.  TWIG is the offer code.  Ten bucks.  You know, it's a lunch.  A Starbucks.  LegalZoom.com offer code TWIG.  We thank them so much for their support.  Really is a great company.  I've known them and used them for years and I can recommend them.  You know, this is a rumor unless Matt wants to confirm it.  This one I have no idea about.  Okay.  It's YouTube.  YouTube is really kind of run autonomously, isn't it, from Google?  It's like a separate company.  So according to AdAge, a new revenue model for YouTube, YouTube is prepping launched to  launch paid subscriptions for individual channels.  And really where the information comes from is the channel producers have been approached  by YouTube and asked to submit applications to create channels users would have to pay  to access.  First paid channels, according to AdAge, will cost somewhere between $1 and $5 a month  in addition to episodic content.  And you know, actually this makes a lot of sense.  If you've had a show you've been pitching and you want to go direct to your audience,  this gives you the ability to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Still what I think Howard Stern should do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Imagine.  I mean, we wouldn't do that.  But I can imagine a Howard Stern.  Huge.  Think how much he'd make.  More than he's getting, I'm sure.  And right in his pocket.  Yes.  No middleman.  Well, YouTube's kind of it.  I'm sure YouTube takes a cut.  YouTube is also considering charging for content libraries and access to live events a la Pay-Per-View  as well as self-help or financial advice shows.  You know what I want to try?  You know, G4 recently changed format and they have all this old tech TV content.  Do you think people, if we were able, we're trying, we're talking to them, try to get  the tech TV content.  If we put it on YouTube and charged a buck a month, do you think people would pay for it?  No, it's too old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's probably too old.  Some absolutely would.  The question is how many?  Yeah, not enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have fans.  Now Machinima, Maker Studios, those guys are already millions of views.  Is it because it's free?  Salar Kamangar at All Things D last year talked about the potential to poach second or third  tier cable networks that were having trouble building big enough audiences on cable, which  is very expensive.  Move them to YouTube, charge subscriber fees directly, or maybe even to internet distributors,  other internet distributors.  He said at the time, if we have a subscription model, then that's absolutely something that  becomes possible.  So obviously YouTube has been thinking about this for at least a year.  They have had rentals.  They have video rentals, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the one hand, it's depressing to think, oh, well, you can get Nickel and Dime to death,  but the truth is that's what happens with cable.  I pay for all these channels that I use.  Pay a la carte.  And a lot of $1 a month so you could get 100 channels for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not going to work for everything.  It's a paywall.  So I don't think we could ever do that.  We could maybe make special content.  You get direct access to Jeff Jarvis's brain, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But there are big fans out there.  I've been training for a big race, and so I did a 24-mile run.  So what I listen to, we're through twigs.  Because if I listen to music that's too pulse-pounding, then I run too fast.  So twigs are nice to run a marathon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We slow them down.  We make them go marathon speed.  Moderate speed, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I could imagine a lot of people paying for the equivalent of back issues.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it.  All right, let's get the change log.  Ladies and gentlemen, break out the...  Somebody said I look like a Sriracha bottle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's a compliment because Sriracha is delicious.  It is delicious and spicy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And spicy.  I got a red...  For those of you listening at home, I've got a bright green headband on,  like the top on a Sriracha bottle, and a red Niners jersey,  like the bottle of a Sriracha bottle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm Google image searching Sriracha bottle right now.  Because I'm testing out a new item in the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have a Sriracha right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead, screen cap.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we bring you the trumpets, which signals the change log.  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You should go to Google image search right now and search for a Sriracha bottle.  Because not only will you see that Leo looks like it,  but you'll also see that Google is slowly rolling out.  I got it.  So I think it's pretty far rolled out.  Google's rolling out a new image search interface.  It's very similar to their tablet interface to image search.  It's really nice.  It reduces the number of clicks that you have to see the larger version of an image.  You can use your keyboard to move from one image to quickly kind of flip through a set of images.  Really nice.  It used to be that you had to click on an image,  and then it would load the page, the originating page in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's way, way, way better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always hated that transparent background of the page that we saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I did too.  I'm going to bet some copyright complaints here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because I guess that was why they did the page, right?  You, the source.  But there's still a link to the source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, I think there's four times as many links.  And I think the blog said that the net average click-through rate actually went up.  So as long as people get their traffic, they're happy.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't mean, but hey, lawyers got to eat, you know, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was interesting.  Google's blog post introducing this kind of had this whole section for like webmasters.  Don't freak out.  This is what's going on.  So yeah, beautiful image search going on there.  And I have it, and you have it, Leo.  It looks like it's going out to everyone.  Google Forms gets updated.  Google Forms is one of these like awesome drive products.  I feel like that just doesn't get the kind of attention that it should get.  Google Forms is just a way to kind of create a questionnaire input.  So an easy way to ask and do a survey or to collect information into Google Sheets.  And it got a couple of little updates.  You can collaborate with others during, while you're editing a spreadsheet.  You can chat with people and you can see real-time edits.  You can edit, collaborate on a form with your coworkers at the same time.  And a nice Google Plus functionality.  If you share a form directly on Google Plus, anyone in your circles can respond  without leaving Google Plus, or they can do it inside Gmail as well, which is really nice.  Let's see.  What else do we have?  Ah, Google added a couple of kind of cool flags in the latest Chrome beta for Android.  Have you guys seen this?  On Android, latest Chrome beta, if you type in chrome colon slash slash flags,  you get a few different options here.  And one of them is that you can enable WebGL, which is JavaScript animation technology  that lets you kind of see animation without an extra plug-in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you couldn't do that on mobile before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could not do that on mobile before.  So you have to get the latest.  And it's the Chrome beta.  Okay, so the latest Chrome beta for Android.  You can go to chrome colon slash slash flags, and you can enable the WebGL.  And then reload the browser, and then you can see WebGL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How's the performance on your Galaxy Nexus?  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I switched the Chrome beta as my, it's my default browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean, WebGL site pages.  Because it's basically animation, right?  Basically animation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not bad.  It's not bad at all.  That's cool.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always assumed it wasn't enabled because the phones weren't fast enough to handle it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  That could be.  They could be kind of slowly introducing it, see just how it goes while they optimize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  I think they might have also needed, and they might still need more time so that the Chrome  on mobile can sort of know what the capabilities of the CPU or the GPU are.  Because if you can pass it through directly, like as direct calls, you know, that's very  fast.  If you're manipulating it, then that doesn't work quite as well.  Does that make sense at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Two quick iOS, Google app iOS updates, YouTube capture, which is that shoot direct to web  application now supports 1080p uploads, which is nice.  And Google currents got a new UI update.  I believe this is two points.  It's got a new sidebar that sorts additions by category.  It's got new controls.  You can swipe vertically to scan an edition or horizontally to skip to the next one.  It's got a new catalog design.  Breaking stories from Google News and the ability to save articles by labeling them  with with stars.  A couple of couple of the updates.  I'm not a huge currents user, but Leo, you're a flip board guy, right?  Or do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I like currents a lot, though.  Currents number two only to Google plus for great iOS design.  But this makes it even better.  It's still not quite Google.  I'd love to see that Google plus interface percolate throughout all of Google's iOS apps.  It's just great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, speaking of Google plus, and this literally just came in.  Thanks, chat room, for letting me know during the show earlier.  The Google plus app Android just got an update, a small update.  You get a couple of nice community features.  You can just can now promote, remove or ban members from their community from the from the Android app and restore  remove posts that were marked for review.  And separately and by popular demand, you can you can you can attach clipboard links to posts.  So it's kind of easier to share links and there's more room to read your notifications as well.  So I literally just updated this on my phone and haven't had a chance to play with it too much.  But if you if you've already got the Google plus app installed, you'll get the update notification from the Play Store very soon.  If you haven't gotten it already.  That's it. That's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the Google change log.  Do you like that feature, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which one? The change log.  I do.  I love the drums.  You know, I listen to twig usually rather than watch it.  So, you know, when you hear the boom, boom, boom, you know, enjoy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just doing a little focus group test in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I do love the music at the very end.  That's sort of the light, you know, trilling.  You know, you guys keep talking about replacing it with some techno or something.  Oh, you do. You like the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You like our little our little fugue.  The medieval. Yes.  Yeah. It's so stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a fan. I'll stand up and say I'm a fan.  All right. We're not changing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to have Jonathan Colton do a cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, all right.  Let's talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Miss Gleek here.  This is good.  This is going to challenge your nerd, your nerd loyalty.  Because you've got two things that you love in the world.  Yes. Well, more than two. You've got Etta.  Yes.  So that's three.  But you got but you do love Glee.  And you.  I want that hat.  And I'm sorry.  Oh, Lord.  Chad just put a spicy sriracha bottle up.  I want that for a Halloween costume.  That's good.  It's a little sriracha costume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We know what a green hat means.  Don't we?  Oh, gee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's give you the Jonathan Colton story.  So Joko, who we all love, is very popular with the geek crowd  because he writes very cerebral lyrics, but he's also very musical,  really writes wonderful music and a former programmer who decided  he did not want to go the traditional music route.  He talked to his wife.  He said, I'm bored to tears programming.  I like music.  I'm a musician.  Can I quit my job and pursue a musical career?  She said, OK.  He was smart because the first thing he did is he did something called  a thing a week where he would just come out with a song every week.  It's kind of like your thing, Matt Cutts.  If you do something continually for 30 days, it becomes a habit.  So he knew that if he just forced himself,  he had a deadline every week he would get in the habit of creating music.  And he did some covers as a result because you run out of musical ideas.  He's done some wonderful covers.  One of them was Sir Mix-a-Lots.  Baby, you got back and it was great.  Banjo, it's beautiful singing.  It's really hysterical.  It's really goofy and funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now give us the Glee side of this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the Glee side of the story.  And I just want to say I was a really big Glee fan,  but recently the show has been atrocious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had stopped watching last year.  I'm afraid so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a lot of plot problems just because of music.  But now I can't even, the music's not even worth the plot problem.  So my feelings about Glee have changed.  But the Glee side of the story is that, you know,  the last episode of Glee, I think it aired sometime last week,  there was the show choir at the school in New York where Kurt and Rachel go now,  do this version of Baby Got Back.  It's a really funny, like, slow down, you know,  led by sort of this goofy white dude.  And it's very funny and it sounds very familiar to Colton's version.  In fact, when John and the Colton did it,  he changed one line in the song and Glee, and it included his name.  It's like Johnny's coming home or something like that.  And Glee actually had that exact line.  It was a direct, direct, unapologetic cover of basically the Colton cover on Glee,  but no attribution, no credit, no mention, nothing like that.  Just straight kind of ripoff.  And I guess Joko had seen, because, you know,  Glee will publish previews of the songs that are going to air for that episode  that week to kind of tease the episode.  And he had seen it and he was like, that sounds like mine.  And then he watched the episode and was like, that is, that's my cover.  And I guess the Glee folks had contacted him and basically said, like,  hey, you know, this is well within our rights to do,  and I hope you'll take it as a compliment and, you know, consider it free PR.  You're welcome.  And Joko was kind of like, what?  And so Joko has actually kind of taken the high road.  He hasn't really made a big deal about this,  but his legion of Internet fans has flipped out.  And so over the past couple of weeks, it's gone for a couple of weeks,  people have been asking me like, how come you haven't commented on the Glee thing?  You know, Glee versus Joko, which one are you?  And it's like, I'm so clearly like team Colton on this one.  Now, his songs are Creative Commons licensed, are they not?  Leo, I'm pretty sure that he Creative Commons licensed this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's interesting.  So, but that would demand attribution.  And yes, it is because he said it's non-commercial,  and this is obviously commercial use of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is commercial use, right?  So then, of course, Glee is a selling machine.  Every single song that they do, they release on iTunes.  It's usually extremely popular.  They generate tons of revenue.  But so Jonathan Colton went ahead.  I guess he had done this Baby Got Back cover a few years back.  He went ahead and released a new version of it.  He called it the Glee version, kind of in the title.  And the title version has outsold the official Glee version,  which has suffered from many angry one-star reviews from Joko fans and iTunes.  So, yeah, a little Glee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that he's outselling the official Glee version.  That's great.  And we played on Twitter a couple of weeks ago.  We played the Glee version and the Jonathan Colton version  exactly at the same time.  They're the same song.  It doesn't sound like two songs.  It matches perfectly.  So it wasn't a recreation of it.  They took it.  And we've talked about this before.  We have a fan who actually mixes the music on Glee.  That's how we got some of this Glee music early on.  And he said, no, they never ask permission of anything for any of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. They basically don't ask.  They do songs.  And then once they get to the stuff that they haven't bought license for,  they pay for it afterward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So are you going to do that? Is this both of them together?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So this is both of them playing at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's...  I believe if you're listening in stereo, which...  You kind of hear the other...  Yeah. But we actually mix down our audio to mono  for anyone listening to the recorded podcast.  Yeah.  Can you tell the difference?  An homage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not a re-creation.  It's the same song.  And a great song too, I might add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the line you were talking about, Gina, is Johnny sees in trouble.  It was normally Sir Mix-a-Lots in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't change it. But of course they didn't change it. You know why?  It's the same song. They just took it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's fine if it had given him attribution.  This was a cover of another song to begin with.  So this wasn't like Jonathan Colton's song that they took.  I mean, it was his arrangement.  It's fine.  They needed to give him a heads up, give him attribution.  They needed to talk to him about the creative comp.  If it was a non-commercial license, then there might be some sort of...  I mean, I'm not a lawyer, but there might be some legal issues there.  But they were just jerks about it.  And I'm disappointed because from what I've seen, Glee is a pretty internet savvy production.  And the crew and writers seem to be.  So you would think that they would just handle it better.  This was an issue of communication and just kind of give him a heads up.  I mean, this could have been a completely different story.  This could have been him saying, hey, cool thing happened this week.  My song is on Glee.  That could have been the story, but Glee just mishandled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want them to do Mr. Fancy Pants next week.  That's what I want them to do.  And I could star in it.  So Google says, you want our Gmail? You get a warrant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, Google!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right on. Now, is that new behavior, Matt, or is that just a reassertion of what they've always said?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that that's actually existing behavior because...  I think so too.  Way back in the day, the Department of Justice back in 2005, 2006,  tried to get two months' worth of user queries.  And we were like, look, that's way too broad.  So Google has a long history of fighting overly broad or come back with a warrant.  But I guess the hidden story here is there's something called the ECPA.  I think that's the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.  It was written in 1986, and it's incredibly outdated.  It assumes that if you leave things on a server for six months, oh, you're not using that email anymore.  Well, we all leave our email on servers now. It's all in the cloud.  And so the ECPA needs to be revamped to have better protection legally for your email, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, what's interesting is that's the spin on this story.  On the other hand, if you read the story, Google also announced that more than two-thirds of the user data  that Google forwards to government agencies is handed over without a warrant at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I think those are subpoenas.  So I think for criminal cases, we require a warrant.  I'm not a lawyer, so maybe some Google lawyer will come hit me over the head later.  But I think if it's something criminal related, then we do require a warrant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But some of the consumer data doled out without a warrant, according to Wired,  includes names listed when creating Gmail accounts, the IP address from where the account was created,  where and what time a user signs in and out of her Gmail account,  Google hands over without warrants the IP address associated with a particular email sent from a Gmail account  or used to change the account password, the non-content portion of the account.  And this is all probably Google has no choice.  I suspect this is all stuff that's covered under the Patriot Act.  But the non-content portion of email headers, the from, the to, and the date fields, those are not considered content.  So that's handed over. And by the way, this is kind of SOP.  Certainly all the phone companies do that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Gmail does different things.  So, for example, Hotmail and Yahoo, as I understand it, when you email, if I email you, Leo, it passes along my IP address.  Gmail doesn't do that by default. So by default, it's more private.  Right. But, you know, if you actually want to get the content of an email or do a criminal case, you know,  there are definitely cases where we can make a good argument. Look, you need to come back with a warrant.  But if it's something like what was the IP address, you know, that this email came from and all the other email providers are providing the IP address with the email,  then that might be a little bit of a harder thing to push back on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In six months, United States agencies demanded 8,438 times the Google fork over data on some almost 15,000 accounts.  This is in six months, ending December 2012.  In those requests, probable cause search warrants were issued 1,896 times.  Subpoenas, 5,784 times.  The remaining 758. No one's talking.  By the way, requests under the Patriot Act do not show up in the transparency report because the Patriot Act does not allow it.  One of the features of the Patriot Act is you can't even tell people that somebody's asked for their information.  You know, I don't blame Google. I blame our federal government, obviously.  And this law has to change.  And I know Google is among many companies leading the fight to change this so that you are protected.  Update the ECPA, in other words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and it would be really nice if national security letters.  I don't know. You know, this is just me speaking personally.  But, you know, if we were to get one that was I have nothing about, you know, the actual request.  But if we were to get one that was crazy, I think it would be great if we could challenge it and say, hey, you know, this is not the sort of thing that people shouldn't even realize the government is asking for.  I have no idea. I assume the vast majority of these are actually responsible.  But the problem is you don't know, you know, and sunlight is the best disinfectant.  And so I just it feels like hopefully in a few years, you know, that kind of mentality will peak a little bit.  And people will realize, well, maybe we do need to make sure that there's checks and balances in place here.  But that's that's in a larger effort.  That's not something that Google could easily do by itself.  You know, try to fight a court case for something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really I have to, you know, kudos to Patrick Leahy, who's Vermont Senator, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, because he tried to sneak this in on the Netflix bill.  So Congress acted quickly when Netflix lobbyists said, hey, you know, you really make ought to make it OK for Netflix users to share their video viewing habits on Facebook.  Man, that law went through. Boom, boom, boom.  So Leahy, over the objections of law enforcement, put a clause in the Netflix bill requiring government officials to get a search warrant for emails over 180 days old.  Of course, it was stripped out before the bill was passed and signed by President Obama.  So you can now share your Netflix.  So that's the good news on Facebook.  The bad news is they can still get your emails if they're more than three months old or six months old.  Leahy says he's going to reintroduce that legislation.  We'll keep an eye on that.  We'll let you know when he does and we can start a letter writing campaign or something.  The FBI says don't make our jobs more difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please. It's hard enough.  You know, we should have to go to a judge and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just too much too much to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yahoo also asks for warrants when appropriate.  Let's see. Mark Zuckerberg is holding a fundraiser for Chris Christie.  What really surprised me?  What? What?  I don't know what to say.  You know, everybody has the right to do whatever they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I just I just it's an odd couple.  It's a very odd couple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is actually it's more like three people, really.  But that's another story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do Jersey people just stick together?  Yo, yo, yo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Zuckerberg became a fan of Christie as and as the governor geared up for his 2013 election bid reelection bid, the tech mogul approached the campaign about helping him get another term.  Mark and his wife Priscilla expressed their interest in supporting the governor for reelection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I do love that whenever people have have, you know, given Christie a hard time, he's like, look, I'm less worried about the politics.  I'm more worried about taking care of my people.  Like he comes across really well, you know, whenever you're watching him engage with somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he's done brilliantly with the storm and everything else.  I got to say. Yeah, I think.  Yeah. And apparently it's his education policies that the Zuckerberg's particularly don't forget Zuckerberg gave him one hundred million dollars to Newark schools.  Right. This is a big thing for them.  Yeah.  Jersey.  I'm just looking through the Facebook stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's so much stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess we could talk about the fact that Facebook was through access to Vine.  What's the story there?  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Vine is a Twitter owned.  That probably is a value to this story, at least in understanding the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vine is an application that, like many iOS apps, says, would you like me to find Vine users amongst your friends?  And you can look on Twitter, you can look on your contacts and you can you could when you first got it, look on Facebook.  But Facebook cut that off right away saying, well, our policy is you have to reciprocate.  And but the thing is, you could post through Vine on Facebook.  So I'm not saying that you should do that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've inherited Jarvis's rage about this.  Like, this isn't about this is our data, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you if you say find my friends.  No, no, it's good.  You had your job is to infect others with your rage.  But not your cold.  Just your rage.  You're sick.  You're cold.  This is why we're on Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, this stuff just bugs me so much.  I'm like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.  Now, this stuff just bugs me so much because this is not Facebook's decision.  These are my friends I made on Facebook.  So I should be able to access it from wherever it makes me crazy.  So what was their reasoning?  They want a reciprocation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but there is it says they modify their platform policy to say Facebook platform enables developers to build personalized social experiences via the graph API.  That's getting your contact list.  If you use any Facebook APIs to build personalized or social experiences, you must also enable people to easily share their experiences back with people on Facebook.  But Vine does do that.  Vine does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I really don't get the reciprocity thing because for a long time you'd take your contacts out of Gmail and put them in Facebook.  But Facebook wouldn't let you export them back.  And then Google put reciprocity in place, which is why we said, look, if we're going to let you export contacts directly to some other network, then they ought to provide that back.  But even when Facebook provided your friends exports, it was like clear text names of your friends.  It wasn't the actual links or the URLs or anything like that.  So it's very weird to hear reciprocity being cited as the reason why Vine and Yandex get cut off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For instance, they allowed Snapchat to do this until they had Poke, which was a direct copy of Snapchat.  And then suddenly Snapchat.  No, you can't.  It's an anti-competitive move.  It really is.  And Instagram and Twitter don't get along.  I mean, it's just it's an anti-competitive move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now, it's not user.  It's not.  It does not put the user first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's this is a relatively new thing.  Like in the past couple of years, right?  Anil wrote that post about the Web we lost.  There was a time when everybody wanted to generate file formats that were easily importable and exportable.  I mean, you wanted to share data with their other services.  It was a feature, right?  That your data could go in and out.  Right.  And now it's flipped and it's becoming this who's cutting off who.  It's so frustrating.  It makes me really I've really inherited the rage.  I hope I hope that I don't spend a lot of time.  I don't spend a lot of time angry.  I choose my battles carefully.  This one is under my skin.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's a there's a really good T-shirt from Maker Faire, you know, the Make Magazine guys.  And it basically says if you can't open it, you don't own it.  Oh, I like it.  You know, they're talking about getting inside of physical boxes.  But the same thing applies to your data, really.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Twitter has taken a page from Google's Playbook.  They have a now Twitter transparency report, which is great.  Transparency dot Twitter dot com.  One thousand eight hundred fifty eight requests from governments and right holders.  Forty eight removal requests.  Six thousand six hundred and forty six copyright notices since the beginning of the year.  That's in the month of January.  Essentially, you have a copyright notice, I guess a photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We can dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can drill down because a tweet is not exactly copyrightable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  You must be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Big kudos to Twitter for doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's fantastic that they're you know, the more people that are watching this, the  you know, the more people realize that these things are going on, the more educated they are about,  OK, well, maybe we want to push back on this because, you know, this is the sort of thing that  makes you feel like Twitter was acting in my interest in this case to let me know, you know,  how often they have to take stuff down or how often they get, you know, DMCA complaints or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dalton, Caldwell is trying to get more people to use app dot net, the paid Twitter clone.  Now he's added a an API for a storage, 10 gigabytes of cloud storage and file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so since we all signed up, who's actually used it since then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Matt Cutts, you use everything.  Well, that's actually where I forget to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll admit that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And I would like to go there more because the conversations are great there, but it's just too we have too many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I dare you to have one month of using the app instead of Twitter, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's actually a pretty good one.  Maybe I'll do that sometime.  That would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'd be a test to see if it's just inconvenient or, you know, if there's really something better about Twitter.  By the way, don't use the phrase hashtag in France.  It's a mode the as I love it.  France. I don't think any other country does this.  They have the Commission General de Terminology et de Néologism.  The Commission on the General Commission on Terminology and Neologisms.  They have a committee.  They have, of course, there was always the Académie Francaise, right?  That would keep track of the French language and make sure foreign isms didn't migrate in.  This committee has decided that the word hashtag is too American.  It's an anglicism.  And they've said, please use more de as I guess the S is sharp.  So it's the sharp sharp word.  And of course, you see a lot of that on Twitter with French people saying, good lord.  It's technically incorrect, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now I have to learn how to do the E with a fancy thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the accent grave.  It is a sharp sign, which was a left leaning hashtag.  The hashtag leans right.  OK.  Bazinga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd like, you know, break this tie and say, no, no, just call it hashtag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pronounced GIF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Vim, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My name is Linus Torvalds and I pronounce Linux Linux.  That's the web we lost right there in a nutshell.  Elon Musk says the Dreamliner is fundamentally unsafe.  He should know. He knows he does.  Batteries he builds in those Teslas are with lithium ion.  He says, unfortunately, the pack architecture supplied to Boeing is inherently unsafe.  The way it's built is wrong.  Well, that's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's alarming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're all they're all, you know, they're all they're not flying.  They've got they've pulled down the Dreamliner.  Well, pulling down is not the right word, but they they took it out of service until they figure out why they're you know, the batteries are catching fire.  By the way, a professor of electrical engineering at MIT, Donald Sadoway, said I would have used the same words.  I'm glad someone with such a big reputation as Elon put it on the line.  The Teslas engineered to prevent that domino effect.  Boeing apparently doesn't have that engineering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was very strange to me that Donald Sadoway is a professor of electrical engineering at MIT, and yet he's citing someone else.  I'm like, it's OK. You can be an expert.  You're a professor at MIT.  Yeah, I believe you, Donald.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and he's actually I think Donald Sadoway.  Yeah, he's the guy that did a TED talk about like this huge molten battery.  It's actually a really good TED talk about, you know, how you can save the energy and get it back very efficiently.  But his idea is you have like a battery that's the size of a cargo container and you heat it up with a molten salt kind of thing.  So he should know what he's talking about for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd like to see that experiment.  Yahoo made money.  Marissa's done well.  Yeah, she has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw her speak at Davos where she was popular and she's still impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Her three goals for Yahoo, a better UI, bigger international reach and broader demographics.  What do you think Yahoo's demographics are these days?  Is it older people?  I bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but she also said she said she would list for friends all of the top uses of a mobile phone and then people would say, what are you describing to me?  Yahoo's features.  So she clearly sees mobile is a big area for where they go.  She also said when asked, I'm going to get the list.  There's one of four things you need a mobile OS, a web OS, a browser or a sleepy ww.  The fourth thing.  And she said, no, we don't have those things.  But that means we can partner with people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm thrilled.  I mean, actually, you rarely do you see this kind of instant result.  That's fantastic.  Well done.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, she's doing great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I love it that the New Yorker has hired Matt Buchanan.  It gets better esteemed literary journal BuzzFeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, please go check out the hashtag BuzzFeed New Yorker.  Oh, boy.  Oh, it's great.  Matt's a good guy.  You know, Matt, he looks like he's 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's got that funny red hair, but he's actually very he's he's smart and he's he's a good writer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm happy for him.  What's the hashtag BuzzFeed New Yorker?  BuzzFeed New Yorker.  And it's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what is his new job at the New Yorker?  Is he in charge?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, this is a funny hashtag.  He is going to be editing their tech section, I believe.  Oh, well, that's good.  That's appropriate.  It is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was on BuzzFeed recently because someone had had complained about there was some, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why does Google still reward content scraping that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Someone was was asking about the issues involved in that.  And the number one story was 25 things that cats are secretly obsessed with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  That's a perfectly legitimate article.  I look forward to seeing that as a cover story in the New Yorker soon.  Yes.  Twenty eight parents who love embarrassing their kids is the current headline on BuzzFeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm right in the middle of thirty five great moments to ever seen on Ellen DeGeneres show.  Oh, love that.  I'm still in the middle of it.  I'm on twenty two.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm hmm.  So this BuzzFeed article, I don't even want to even give it credence.  How a copied and pasted excerpt of a story can still outrank an eight thousand word original and why publishers aren't  the ones to blame.  You've seen this complaint before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've spent a fair amount of time talking about it this week inside of the ranking group.  And I think it's important to realize that originally I think Huffington Post put up basically an exact duplicate of the article.  And so you had the article on two different places and you have to guess which one is the is the real copy, so to speak.  And so you make those kinds of ranking decisions.  And then later, if Huffington Post gets, you know, Joshua Topolski says, hey, please take this article down, then we might still have decided which one's which.  Anyway, the nice thing is that often when we look at these kinds of cases, like several different things have to go wrong for us to sort of see, oh, this is a quirk.  And OK, what do we need to do to fix it?  But we're continuing to talk about, OK, we always want, you know, whoever wrote the content, we want that article to be returned rather than someone who scraped it.  But fundamentally, that's a hard problem because if someone scrapes it, then immediately post it somewhere else, then it can be hard to say where it popped up first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now it's just an excerpt, which is a much more common, you know, John Gruber does it every day on Daring Fireball.  It does. It may get better search results based on the Huffpo having more links.  I mean, is that do you do anything to say this is the original?  We should point to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We you know, it's difficult to do.  But yes, we do try to figure that out.  I wouldn't claim that we do that perfectly.  There's actually a Russian site that analyzes different search engines.  And you can see over the last year, we've gotten much better at that.  But it's a really hard problem.  So we do try to figure out ways that we can do better at it.  A human can do it, but you're doing it algorithmically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's just too much on the web where a human could try to do all of it.  Right.  But there are people in Zurich and now there are going to be some extra people in Mountain View kind of trying to tackle this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, are you encouraging people to use rel canonical?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Rel canonical is awesome.  Yeah, it's basically a way where you can put a meta tag on a web page and you can say there might be different versions of this article.  But here is the one true version of this article.  You can also do what's known as a 301 or permanent redirect.  And those are all just hints that we try to use.  There's lots of different ways that you can try to tell us that you've got original content, including, you know, sending us things, all that sort of stuff.  And we try to incorporate a lot of that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ironically, HuffPope put rel canonical in its link.  Yes.  So you can't, I mean, if somebody's going to lie and say, no, this is the original.  This is the canonical version of the article.  I mean, that's an outright lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and yes, in this case it was.  And I think they were only trying to make it correct within Huffington Post.  They weren't thinking about other copies.  But even then you could say, oh, this is contested because different people both say that they have the canonical version.  The tricky thing is those pages can change over time.  People can add comments, content rotates in and out.  And so finding out exactly what the duplicates are can be a really hard problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, at the end of this BuzzFeed article says Google's head of a web spam and longtime search quality point man Matt Cutts has not responded to a request for comment.  Well, now he has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, John was very nice to email me and I, you know, I was trying to reduce my email.  This was the week you were offline.  So he was he went ahead and wrote that.  But I pointed him to the, you know, the official press alias to ask for future sort of stuff.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you got to I mean, I don't know.  I've always thought the Huffington Post was a little bit over the line in the aggregation of other people's content.  And I can understand Josh was upset over the entire article appearing on the Huffington Post.  And so so rel canonical would certainly be something the verge would use on original content on the verge post.  And and in theory, no one else should use that on their content on their on their link to it.  And if everything works well, it wouldn't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And the fact that most people don't see this happening where you search for, you know, a snippet of text from your blog post and you get something from a Russian or, you know, Hungarian or whatever scraper.  That means it normally works well.  It's just it attracts a lot of attention when we get it wrong.  And we do appreciate the feedback.  You know, we've actually been talking to folks at BuzzFeed and taking suggestions and huddling on the engineering side to say, OK, how do we make sure that the right people do get credit as much as we can tell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I can see how it's a tough problem.  We're going to take a break. Come back with Gina's tip of the week.  Jeff's number of the week.  And in Matt, if you'd like to do a tool or a tip or a number, you can do that, too.  But first, a word from Carbonyte dot com.  We talk about the cloud, but you know, the cloud is a great place for backup as well.  I talk to people all the time who say I lost my guy.  He was sailing to Catalina Island in Los Angeles.  And he has laptop was on the deck and they hit a wave and it went overboard.  It's gone. Am I sinking away?  And he called to say, but I wanted you to know I was using Carbonyte thanks to you and your ads.  And I didn't it was I lost the laptop, but I didn't lose the data.  And sometimes it's the data that's the stuff that's irreplaceable.  The you know, the great pictures of your baby being born or your wedding or financial records, those emails you've been saving Carbonyte keeps it safe in the cloud.  It also gives you access in the cloud.  You can always get to your Carbonyte data.  Just log on to your Carbonyte account on any computer or use their free apps.  And it's just like cloud storage of any kind.  But it's very affordable.  Fifty nine dollars a year for everything on your Mac or your PC.  Fifty nine dollars a year is less than five bucks a month for and there's no it's not like for the first five gigabytes.  It's unlimited. After 200 gigabytes, they slow down the uploads.  200 gigabytes is probably too much for most people to back up to the cloud anyway, just based on your upstream bandwidth.  So don't think of this as an infinite storage thing.  But for most people, those precious records, that precious data, the stuff you've got no other copy of, that's important to make sure you got a copy on the cloud.  Automatic, continuous, secure Carbonyte cloud storage.  I want you to try it free right now.  No credit card needed. Two weeks free.  Just go to Carbonyte.com and use Twig as the offer code.  If you do that and you decide to buy, you'll get 14 months for the price of 12.  And by the way, there are numerous plans.  There are small business plans, unlimited computers and servers.  You can get external drives, etc, etc, all at a low flat monthly rate.  But the basic plan, fifty nine dollars per year for a Mac or a PC is the one most people want.  It's really great.

Gina Turpani, your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tip of the week. You can now get notified on your phone if there's been any suspicious activity on your Google account or failed login attempts.  This is this is this is kind of nice. If you're worried about your account getting hacked, you have on to off.  No, to off, which we've talked about before. Two step off. Excuse me.  But now if you have a failed login attempt, if you go into your Google account settings, there's you can get notifications for a password change and for a suspicious login attempt.  Excuse me. So you get a notification via email and now you can get a notification for your phone.  So you just you check off phone and then you have to re enter your password and you re verify your phone.  And so you'll get a little little notification if that happens.  This appears to be only available for vanilla Gmail accounts, not Google Apps accounts yet, but I enabled it for for that and hopefully it'll show up for apps users as well.  Cool. And that's an account. Your Google dot com slash settings security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mr. Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week. So I found this interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google and Facebook led the private tech M&A of 12 companies each last year out of a total of 2200 deals.  But this is what it should be. According to the next web, 76% of the companies bought out of the 2200 did not raise any capital.  What happens to the VC business?  How many what percentage? 76% raised no capital. They bootstrapped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're bootstrapped. Yep, you are.  You know, we're not exactly a tech startup, but it's interesting the number of companies I look at the gay Brevara tech meme was said I'm never I don't want to take any capital.  I want to own it. I want to control it.  He wants to take an afternoon nap. Yeah, I want somebody snooping around 76% and that's not because of a lack of the capital.  I mean, there is money out there, right? There is not people are saying, oh, I couldn't get capital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't want it. Who wants to deal with VCs? You don't have to A, B, there's things that go ahead, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, sorry. I was just going to say it's so much cheaper to do a startup or, you know, try to do a company.  You can throw something up on the web or do it. Yeah, that's true.  And you know, you don't need the money. Very low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there were presumably successful companies because they got bought. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there were two reasons that people would get venture capital, partly the money.  And, you know, if you're a web company, you need to scale a lot of times.  It just means you need a lot of money right up front. You know, dig.com.  You got to have servers. You got to have bandwidth and you're just not going to have that revenue yet.  But the other reason they always tout, you know, people like Paul Graham always say, well, you put the more mentors.  We help you make connections. We bring in the right people and all of that.  And some people decided, yeah, I didn't really need that.  And now that I don't need the money, see you. Well, it's also it's also being disaggregated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can go to General Assembly in New York and get the training that that Y Combinator gave you without having to give up any equity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So so kids, the moral is keep that equity.  Yeah, you can do it. Use EC3 or Google App Engine and do it yourself.  It's cheap. And then, you know, that's what happens is they do a demo.  Like, look at Vine. Vine was not made at Twitter. It was bought by Twitter.  But when nobody ever saw it until Twitter bought it, it was like they probably, you know, they probably did a proof of concept on EC3 or Google App Engine.  People looked at it and said, yeah, that's good. We'll buy it. We'll take it.  Next. I love that. That's see something positive, Jeff. Yes. Forget drones.  Yeah. Yes. Yes.  Maddie, you have anything you want to share with us?  Anything you're excited about? Sure. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So while I was off the Internet, I used my free time to work down my to do list.  And so a natural question is, OK, well, what's the best to do list app for an Android device?  And there's one called Tasks. And so if you if you try it out, it can use multiple accounts.  You can slide back and forth so that, you know, you can you can work on different sort of things.  If you've learned that Raspberry Pi has gotten some funding and so you want to make that more important, you can just click and drag it up.  It syncs with Google Tasks. The only downside is it costs ninety nine cents.  So it does cost you a dollar. But there's also a free version that will be completely unrestricted for 10 days.  And then after 10 days, it will start showing ads. So that's plenty of time to decide whether you like it or not.  I've used a lot of different to do kind of apps.  And this one's really nice because it uses Google Tasks for the back end.  But it's just got a very polished, very jelly bean, fresh sort of UI. And it works very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's OK, Gina, we'll never invite him back again.  I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is this is good to know because I often have people say, like, hey, I want to think the Google Tasks, like what's the best app to do it?  And I didn't know. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And to be fair, Gina, I had used to do, you know, in the past for a little while, it's just I really want to try to use all the Google Tasks kind of stuff.  And so that was kind of a weird thing for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of course, you know, this has like due date reminders.  And I mean, you know, it's yeah, this has got kind of like the extra to do features, which it looks it looks really cool.  And thinking the task is is a really nice, you know, a text file and they kind of go so far.  You know what I mean? With with with to do so.  But it can work really well for simplicity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it all depends on where you're looking, you know, to do dot text is also for those who want to work in text files available on Android and App Store.  And it's written by somebody named Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like this. This task app that was made by Team Tasks.  I'm waiting for Google to release their official. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why isn't there a Google Tasks? The official Google Tasks to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I keep waiting for that to drop. That would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this looks almost like Google did it.  It has that Google blue and it does look like Google.  Google, you give me Google.  Well, I want to thank you, Matt.  Kutz for a.
