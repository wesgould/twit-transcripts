Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's beautiful New Jersey, actually.  That's New Jersey.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not so many trees grow in Brooklyn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not so many. Just one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought you like lived in the botanical gardens. I didn't know. So that's Jeff. Okay, not Gina. Okay.  So what's cool about this, I gotta say, is that  you get that thing that only happens after there's snow and then a melt and then a refreeze where you got ice.  Oh, it's so much fun. Yeah, I was just breaking the branches.  Yeah, I love that.  Love that when that happens. Well, I hate you Californians. Jeff Jarvis for the City University of New York. You're just so obnoxious.  No, it's pretty. It's really pretty.  I love seeing all the Instagram pictures when I woke up this morning, a beautiful sunny day in Northern California.  I see all the Instagram pictures of ice, snow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should see, we should get video of me with a snow blower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I talked to mom this morning. She's in Providence.  She said,  Grady, her nephew, lives around the corner, my nephew, her grandson, came over to shovel the walk this morning very early.  And then he came back an hour later and shoveled it again.  That's depressing. Hey, that's Matt Cutts laughing.  Hey there. Matt and I are in California.  Good to see everybody. Where do you get a giant Tyrannosaurus Rex decal? That is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can get it from Amazon, you know. It's on the internet. It was a Christmas present. For you or your son?  No son. No son, so it had to be you. Just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, that's the best part about kids. You can get dinosaur rep decals on the wall and blame the kids. Right, I'm just weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It used to be Hello Kitty, so I figured I'd have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, this is an improvement. Much more macho.  Also with this  Gina Turpani, she's in her mom's basement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am. I might as well just own it. It's the paneling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought the paneling would give it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we would have known. I hate to say it.  The maple paneling.  The tchotchke cabinet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to be a grown up and have my own place.  So, by next week, I'll be a new...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're just confirming what Aaron Sorkin's always known, that bloggers live in their mother's basement.  ...mother's basement.  Sorkin's watching this right now going, I told you!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lifehacker, my ass!  Nice PJs, Gina.  She hasn't figured out how to pay bills, let alone hack life!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, nice to have you. Gina Turpani, founding editor of Lifehacker.  And now, ThinkUp, which is a wonderful startup that analyzes all your Twitter and Facebook posts.  Very nice. Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes indeed. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nice.  How much is that?  It's from roommates. 18 bucks.  18 bucks, that's well worth it.  Dinosaur peel and stick.  How big is it though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's pretty big.  It's like 4 feet? 36 inches?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  36 inches. 3 feet. Wow.  It's pretty large.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It turns out you can get all kinds of weird wall decals.  So I'm trying to resist the temptation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a company that makes those for sporting figures.  Fatheads?  Yeah, fatheads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I knew it was a weird name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not only did you know the weird name, you remembered it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did. Well, I guess that worked then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you can get a giant clay Matthews or something on your wall.  Which sounds a little scary frankly, coming at you.  You can also get a princess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want a giant Leo Laporte.  I think that's the next twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fathead has not contacted me, but I'd be willing to do a licensing deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What position? You have to be like holding a keyboard or maybe a phone.  Here's a giant Richard Sherman head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good thing to put on your wall.  Wow.  They jump right on those trends, don't they?  Yeah. Look at that.  So ladies and gentlemen, now let me ask you,  because Matt, you work at Google.  We should mention this, Matt Cutts is the guy who fights spam for us all,  keeping spammy results out of our search.  He's been in the news a little bit lately.  We'll talk about that in a bit.  But there's a couple of big Google stories today,  including Google and the European Commission  settling their three-year ongoing investigation, antitrust investigation,  putting that behind them.  Do bells ring? Do the church bells ring on the Google campus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'll say in advance the standard,  don't fire me, I'm speaking from a personal perspective, disclaimer.  A lot of different people helped out with this  and when it's three years long,  you're always happy that you can find a good way to resolve it  and have it be constructive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google will not be fined  and there is no finding of discrimination against competition.  FTC dropped their investigation in the US a year ago.  The FTC said, which must have made you feel good,  Google was motivated more by innovation than by trying to stifle competition.  I think actually that's true.  I think it's true.  The pledge to the European Commission for five years  says that you can add new services,  you can alter your search page as long as  this is always the weird thing, these stipulations,  you grant three links to rival services  next to your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kind of love this, it's like Google as a genie.  You rub its lamp and it grants three wishes to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if you have specialized search results like Google Shopping,  Google Shopping is an ad,  all those results are paid,  then competitors can pay at least three euro cents  to bid for a spot in a shaded box next to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is bizarre.  Just bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When regulation, I'm going to Brussels, to the EU,  next month to talk about government and the internet  and of course you know what I'm going to say is just  stay away!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It will be a very short address.  It will be, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually if the bidding is real bidding,  Google can actually make some money on this.  It starts at four cents but it doesn't mean it ends at four cents.  I would imagine you'd want to be in that shaded box there.  Anyway, good news, that's over.  I think it happened after our show last week.  Yes, Lenovo buys Motorola.  We talked about it last week.  It happened as we spoke.  In fact, that's right.  We were doing it basically as breaking news.  And then finally, there's a new head of YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so it sounds like Salar and Susan Wojcicki  are going to sort of trade roles a little bit  in that Susan is going to come over and be the head of YouTube  and Salar is going to presumably work on some new project  that they'll reveal at some point in the future.  This doesn't change Kinsel's role.  I don't believe so.  And I think Salar has built up a great organization.  They've done a fantastic job.  If you think about it, several years ago people said  YouTube has to be costing Google a ton of money  and now everybody realizes that it's a great outlet,  it's a great opportunity.  Sure, there's more we could do.  I always hear the complaints that you mention  about the spurious DMTA complaints  and I pass those on to people at YouTube.  Oh, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought it was thoroughly ignored on all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no.  It took a little while for me to get to the threshold  where I was like, okay, I need to go find someone  to mention that about.  Thank you.  But Salar, Susan, and even Sridhar,  who is now taking, it sounds like  he will be the sole person responsible for all of ads,  they're all fantastic people.  They're all data driven and they're all extremely capable.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a bit redundant to Google, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, there are some people  with outsized personalities, but for the most part  we try to be polite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now we're going to get some juice.  That Larry Page guy,  I tell you, he acts like CEO.  Who put him in charge?  We're going to get Matt fired one way or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, we're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we don't know what Kamangar will do  the former head of YouTube.  Susan Wojcicki was the head of  ad sales at Google.  Yeah, it was a shared responsibility

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for ads between Susan Wojcicki and Sridhar.  And so Sridhar is doing all of ads  and Susan is going to take over YouTube  is what it sounds like from the public reports.  Okay, she was  senior vice president

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  in charge of product management and engineering  of advertising.  Of course it was her garage  that was the...  Well, that's the greatest story, right?  Her mom's garage  was where  Google started  in Menlo Park  in 1998.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mom is a magnificent journalism teacher  at Palo Alto High.  Such a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, now I don't feel so bad about being in my mom's basement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Ann, her sister,  met Sergey Brin  as a result of that, sharing the garage.  It's a time-honored position.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Do you have a brother?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Two.  Two?  Very interesting.  We'll get some people over there right away  to start a search company or something.  Okay, so that's like  those are the big stories  and I think there's not much to say at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and  speaking of search companies, it's interesting  that Satya Nadella is now the CEO of Microsoft  and he started  in Bing.  Back in 2008, he was at search conferences  like SMX and PubCon  and then he went on to the server group at Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He ran R&D at Bing  and that's actually in a way  that's a big part of I think why he was  able to become CEO  is they needed somebody who had  experience in a broad range of  areas  and he runs currently  until Tuesday, run  cloud and enterprise  from Microsoft.  But having had a little bit of techy experience  as R&D, having had a little bit of consumer experience  at Bing, I think  made him the front runner, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a fascinating pick  because a lot of the  old guard at Microsoft might be more  thinking in through a client PC  sort of framework  but Satya, he understands the cloud natively  and I'm very curious to see what Microsoft  does following that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He has been very, in his 22 years at Microsoft  very available to people.  Everybody's interviewed him except me  but everybody's interviewed him  and has nothing but good things to say about him.  We will watch with interest.  Do you think maybe that will end  the scrugelled thing or that will continue on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds like Mark Penn  is still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mark Penn, I saw him at Davos.  You did? Was he there?  I wanted to go up and I wanted to have a smart ass thing  to say but I thought no, it's not worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Scrugelled!  If he manages to turn Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  into an internet company that would be  tremendous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so what he said  at his accession speech  the first all hands meeting  we talked about this on Windows Weekly if you want to get  more excessive detail  is  software, software, software.  Innovation, innovation, innovation.  But that is an important  maybe distinction between  him and his successor  Steve Ballmer because  it was Ballmer who  began this transition to  a devices and services company.  That doesn't sound like software, software, software.  In fact, it sounds like hardware, hardware, software.  And so he was at great pains to say  look it all runs on software.  And in fact  Paul Therot and I came up with a new  because you go to the Microsoft web page  it says software and devices  and services  and Paul and I said you really got to  rename that to  Microsoft makes the software  that power the devices  and services you use.  And that's probably  more of the angle he's going to take.  And he is a techie, he's a programmer.  It's devices and services.  It sounds like operating systems though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what it sounds like to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But no, you know this. Think of software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  It's web software. That's different.  Microsoft's whole thing has been  But Microsoft is still Windows  and Office.  I know there's a lot of cloud components to that.  But that feels tacked on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but that's what they're saying.  That's what devices and services  as their tagline says.  We were Office. We were Windows.  We are now devices and services  and even Windows and especially Office now is SaaS Software as a Service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what? I just realized recently  that I don't use  except for this moment when I'm on Skype thanks to you  I don't use a single bit of Microsoft software.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not because I'm anti-Microsoft or tried to stop using Microsoft or any of that.  It's thanks to my Chromebook Pixel.  You don't need to.  But you know what's interesting is you could use Microsoft Office on your Chromebook Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know what's interesting is you could use Microsoft Office on your Chromebook Pixel.  But you know what's interesting is you could use Microsoft Office on your Chromebook Pixel.  The web versions of those run quite well on Chrome.  But I don't need to now because I'm on Drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't need to now because I'm on Drive.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And of course Nadella ran Azure.  Ran the cloud services.  So he's very familiar with cloud.  So he's very familiar with cloud.  I think this is part of the transition to the cloud frankly.  But he's emphasizing.  What would you say Microsoft's key skill is these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What would you say Microsoft's key skill is these days?  What would you say Microsoft's key skill is these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there was a really interesting thing.  There was a really interesting point.  Whenever Satya wrote his letter about who he was  Whenever Satya wrote his letter about who he was  that is posted on the website.  He mentioned  innovation, talent, all the right notes.  But he also mentioned perseverance.  And I think that's something that  Microsoft really shines at compared to  a lot of web-based  companies that expect to just get a 10x  multiplier in one week and then you  call it a day. Microsoft realizes  they need to sometimes show up,  talk to the customers, grind things out,  support things for years. That's something they're really good at.  So, we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He says, it's an incredible honor  for me to lead this company.  He mentions Bill Gates is going to come  back as a  support. He says, while we've had great success  we're hungry to do more. Our  industry does not respect  tradition. It only respects  innovation. This is a critical  time for the industry and for Microsoft.  Make no mistake, we are headed  for greater places as technology  evolves and we evolve with and ahead  of it. But as we  start a new phase of our journey together  let's consider  tradition. Let's consider  persistence is one way to say  it, I guess.  He says, this is a software  powered world.  I think that's also the correct  way to look at it. In fact, it may be a response  a little bit to Microsoft's kind of failure  in the hardware space surface has been  a little bit of a flop. Certainly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still don't know what that means though. What  software do we need them to make?  Well, everything is software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sort of echoes.  Is it Andreessen who said software  is eating the world? So it sort of  echoes that in a slightly different way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they still have to get  then if software is everything then saying  your software is saying nothing, you  have to get down to decide what  kind of software. Where  is your value?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And they have to make that shift from  being the desktop PC,  the company that builds software for  locally on devices to  being more web centric.  That's what I was saying earlier.  That's a really big cultural shift. I think that  companies that started after the web or started building for  the web or in the cloud,  to begin with, it's in your  DNA in a certain way that I don't think  that it necessarily is at Microsoft.  And if he can make that shift for them, that would be  huge. And I should say Microsoft R&D  does some amazing, amazing,  amazing things.  Photosynth. I mean I've had a chance  to see a couple of really neat  things. And I would just love to see them ship that  stuff and get just more  press for that stuff.  You just don't hear about it as much as...  He very much acknowledges this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He says in our early...this is also in his  letter. In our early history our mission was about  the PC on every desk, in every home.  A goal we have mostly achieved in the developed  world. Today we're focused on a broader  range of devices. As we look forward,  we must zero in on what Microsoft  can uniquely contribute to the world.  We are the only  ones who can harness the power of software  and deliver it through  devices and services that truly  empower every individual and every organization.  So I think he's clearly  positioning himself. We...where  we really add value is in the software  that goes through these devices and services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So who is their primary competitor?  Is it not Google now?  Is it Apple? Is it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Apple is a very good example  of a company that doesn't have the DNA to do  cloud. Is it Salesforce?  It's doing a terrible job of it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it Salesforce? No.  I don't know. No. Well, who's their...  Who are they? Who are they? Who do they go after?  Well, yeah, maybe. Maybe you're right.  IBM. Two old  dinosaurs. Yeah.  I don't know. It's interesting because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the competitor question is a good one to ask  but I really like Gina's question about  whether they make the transition to a web company.  And by web, it doesn't  just mean devices like mobile  or the cloud, which I do think they'll chase.  I think there's going to be a really interesting  fork in the road because web companies  are brought up to believe in  interoperability and open standards  and federated data and all this sort of thing. Right on.  Yes. Yep.  I'll be very curious if Microsoft,  which way they go on that fork, because if they make a  decision that says, you know what, you're not allowed  to run Chrome on our latest operating system,  then that's kind of the old Microsoft still poking  through. Watch with interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You nailed it. The bell  weather will be, for instance, can Chrome  ever be installed on RT?  Or, and this is the one we're watching  with interest right now, how long  before Office, which is admittedly  a great important product for Microsoft,  appears on iOS and Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Skype on Chrome.  And so on.  I think your reference to  IBM is right because the  invention that IBM did of itself  around open source and around services  and other things is probably a good  roadmap for what Microsoft needs to do now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, they very much like  it. Google had a good  fourth quarter. We'll talk about the results.  Find out what it all means in  just a little bit. There's also  lots of news.  Including  Jeff's new glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  wait to hear about this.  Oh, I want to have this conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  First, let's let's deviate a little  bit and talk about personal capital.  This episode brought to you by personal  capital. Today, I want to  share with you a free and I got to  emphasize secure tool  called personal capital that solves  two barriers to building your net  worth.

You got to build your net worth at least  so that you can enjoy  your life in your older age.  Trust me, I know.  First barrier, of course, in doing this is hard to keep  track of your life as it gets as  you get older. Your life gets more complicated.  You've got, you know, mortgages.  You've got loans.  You've got credit cards, bank accounts.  One hopes you've got investments  401ks.  Stock investments all on different sites,  different usernames, different passwords. And then, of course,  you have to pay somebody to manage all of that stuff.  And you can really overpay on  that and get kind of not such good advice  either. Personal capital solves this problem.

Alright, well, let's start with the glass.  I did see that NYPD is going to be  testing glass. That is not a good  thing, I don't think. No, it's not, because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they add the new  opportunities. Is that different  from a dash cam? Our cops  are on the street. It's a dash cam all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess it is.  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, they're not using them.  It's a trial run. Law enforcement  officials said, we signed up, got a few pair  of the Google glasses, we're trying them out,  seeing if they have any value in investigations,  mostly for, as you  hypothesize, patrol purposes.  We're looking at  them, you know? See you now at a wake,  says a New York City law official.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Forget about it.  Forget about it. You got a problem with

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that?  So what's your problem, Mr. Javas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, alright, so here they are.  So,  I didn't mean to cause a  kerfuffle, but Business  Insider chose to write about my little  Google Plus post and tweets last  night.  And because I had  gone after Business Insider some time ago  for dismissing glass offhand,  so when I came out being critical of glass, aha!  See? See? We were right!  So here's the box, right?  So these are the prescription glass  frames. Now the problem is  that I've had with glasses, I have to wear them over my glasses,  they don't really work, so I really haven't been using them.  So I feel very impractical. I'm $1,500  in. So then I get, I think  finally I can use  glass with prescription lenses.  Okay, fine. So here is  the case.  It's big enough to be a bum.  You can put that in your back pocket, can't you?  You've got to carry  you know, you need a short one to carry your glasses.  Yeah.  So then you get this, so then I open them up,  here they are, right?  Okay, so they're fine. So I'll take them off,  put them on, I'm blind.  Okay, so find the glasses.  But here's what gets me. Where's glass? I don't see glass.  Oh, nice! Yeah, where's the glass?  I've got to send my first pair back  to get the second pair to  put on these, because the first pair doesn't work on these.  Which is my first  primary problem, right? So I'm at $1,500  for this. For something I really  don't use, to be honest. Google's  out another $1,500 because they're not making profit on this,  so it's probably that much. Instead, they made another pair,  thank you very much, but that's a lot of money.  These cost $2.25.  With my old screwed up  eyes, my lenses cost upwards of $300.  So,  all in, their money and my money,  we're talking about a $3,500 investment.  Oh my god, you could have bought a Mac Pro for that.  Well, yeah,  or two Chromebooks.  And... Two pixels.  Two pixels, ten  Chromebooks. Yeah. Ten Chromebooks.  And five Golden Rings.  And, you know,  so that just  started to really bother me. But what  got me last night, I guess, besides the Merlot,  was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you admit you were a little  toasted when you wrote this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I confessed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I talked to a nice guy from the Google  team today named Chris Dale and  told him there was a little Merlot in there. And I didn't intend to cause this  fit. But what gets me is,  as you can see here,  this...  What is that point at the end there?  This is where you put the glass thing, but it's a sharp-edged  thing. So, what  hit me with the hubris, the design over  functionality of this, is that I can't use...  I'm just going to spend probably upwards of $600  on these glasses. And you can't use them without  glass. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or you could poke your eye out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what they meant when they said that it doesn't work  unless the electronics are attached,  right? So the arm isn't complete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Plus, they don't bend, right? They're titanium  fine. And so they come with this  huge, fecacca case. So I need to  carry a briefcase to carry my glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, the case is because you're going to put your Google  glass in there as well, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but still,  they couldn't... What I said to them today was,  the nice guy called me and he said, I just want  your feedback for the team. And I said, you know, I'm happy  to give it  for what it's worth. And I didn't mean to cause a huge  kerfuffle. But my advice  is, get this friggin' thing to  market sooner than later.  This is design over market sense.  And the market is going to yell at you, instead of  just me yelling at you, and say,  no, no, no, no, no. And they've got to talk to customers.  They should have been talking to customers. You know, it occurred to me  that they should have been using Google Plus  and the glass groups there to say,  all you blind bats using Google  Glass, what would you like  the glasses to be? They didn't use their most  powerful tool, which is this incredible  community of explorers they put around it  and Google Plus, to  avoid what I think is a mistake.  Danny Sullivan was rooting  me on last night, so he agrees.  And it  just, at some point I just got offended  by the total cost of something that is  still a novelty I don't use very much. I still  salute them for making it. I still say  that Glass is to whatever follows  what the Newton is to the smartphone.  This is an important advance. I know  it's a beta. I know it's just a start.  Yes, I get sick of all the first-world  problem jokes on Google Plus.  But having said that, I don't know what to do now, so I'm going to go to my optician and see what the lowest price is I can get for lenses for me, but my lenses are really expensive because they got five levels and all kinds of stuff. And it's just really expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you still want to, do you still want to, you started your post saying, I want out. Do you still want to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I can't get out of Glass. My point was, yes, I knew there was a 30-day return on the original Glass. I almost returned, but I do that too often. Don't I, Twig fans?  So I didn't, and I kept them.  But now I'm going to go to Google and Google's going to send me another, they're out another $1,500.  And that actually just actually kind of bothers me for something I use that much.  And so then I'm out another, you know, $600 on top of it for the total of frames and lenses.  And if I'm stuck with the Glass, I might go ahead and get this.  But then I have another problem, which is in my case, and this is this is unique to me.  I want to use this in education, but Glass is tied to my account.  And so I can't really pass the Glass and will soon be tied to my screwed up prescription.  So I can't really pass them around in school.  So it becomes less and less useful to me and more and more kind of offensive.  I enjoyed having the first. I enjoyed demonstrating them.  I've never worn them on the streets of New York because I think I'd look like a dork and they wouldn't work on top of my glasses and I'd get hit by a car.  So, you know, if I if I go ahead and fill these with lenses and get Glass, you know, maybe it'll change my mind entirely.  But I just think the Glass ought to get in the marketplace and get to real consumers.  And I'll probably be a lot happier about whatever that product is than this sandbox.  End of spiel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I got him with you. I didn't buy Glass in the first place, even though obviously I could have.  Well, I paid for it and I gave him an adjacent.  Actually, that's right. I is worse than didn't buy him.  I did buy him. I just didn't wear him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The arm, the arm not bending while I appreciate it's like clearly a difficult technical problem.  It makes it really impractical.  That case is crazy. But Jeff, those those lenses are really nice.  I mean, much nicer than the visor, you know, the original Explorer version visor, in my opinion, just from seeing you sort of hold them up.  And you haven't you haven't gotten the electronics yet.  So you haven't even gotten a chance to try to wear those right.  But you're going to you're going to swap in the new version and then you need to get your lenses.  So you know what? That helped me see these glasses are nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I if I could wear them with and without glass, I might actually wear them.  That's what I'm that's part of my point is that I don't go off and spend six hundred dollars on glasses just to wear occasionally when I'm going to be a geek.  And neither am I. I'm not going to wear glass all the time.  You don't wear glass all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But no, no, I don't. I don't. I have to tell you that when I saw these frames, I saw the bit that said these frames won't work unless glass is attached.  And that was a little bit of a red flag. I was like, wait a second, you know, because look, if you're going to spend the money on your prescription lenses and the and the frames, then you should be able to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I would love it if you could snap the electronics on and off, particularly if I have someone who wore glasses or for that matter to put a little give me as an as an add on a little plastic thing to cut this sharp thing so it doesn't cut into my skin.  So if I go to the effort of taking them off, I can still use these as six hundred dollar glasses.  Yeah, that would be helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just something, you know, a little plastic for a piece that would let you, you know, use it dual use.  That would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody's got a maker bought somewhere that can print one of those out for you.  Yeah, exactly.  That's good. That's definitely going to happen.  Oh, yeah.  But yeah, I mean, I agree.  I hear you coming from, but I also kind of feel like you kind of knew what you were getting into.  But I also want to hear your review once you get the whole setup on your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're telling me you're costing me another seven dollars.  So you're shaming me into spending another seven hundred dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So wait, you paid for the frames and you paid for the electronics.  So the other seven hundred is the are the lenses for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the lenses for me, this is two fifty for the frame, two and a quarter for the frame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the frame does include the lenses?  Of course not. Of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I got my special lenses. I've got I've got, you know, trifocal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't realize that. So the two fifty is not for glasses plus lenses.  It's just for the frames.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the cost of these frames, which are these are very nice frames. Right.  And frames are expensive, but that seems a little high.  My lenses cost as a rule upwards of three hundred dollars.  And I can only use those lenses when geeking out with glass.  That's the part that just made me say, oh, geez, really?  Yeah, I hear you.  So I didn't mean to cause a big fit. I really didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think it was good for you or a little bit the canary in the coal mine.  Like, I think it's good to realize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very good. But ask you that, you know, I gave them I gave them earnest advice  and said, you know, get the sucker to market because the real market is going to tell you better than I will.  I think this was a designer not being forced to deal with real customers.  And Google, the point of the Explorer program is that Google has real customers.  Crazy first adopters, nicer customers.  But I think they've done a better job of using the original rumor was that we're going to go with Warby Parker to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Warby Parker has equivalently nice lenses, glasses for like 90 bucks.  So that's true. It's a lot cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My optician hates people going to work. Yeah.  Because he makes profit on the frame. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to 800 contact lenses, 800 content, whatever it is, because that no, they don't.  So that's why their services are going up.  I'm just I let me search on Warby for some titanium frames for you and just and just see what they have.  Because, you know, I think that they're like 100 bucks.  Really? Yeah. These are nice and light.  I would have expected Google to say to this guy, hey, look, you know, we're going to give you some profit,  but you shouldn't charge more than cost on these.  You shouldn't make the usual shape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you know, these these frames, these nice, these are the plastic key bending ones, which I like quite a bit.  They're like they're like the titanium ones I had.  Very, very light, extremely light.  You know, these cost two hundred fifty three hundred dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but you're overpaying because Luxottica has this monopoly.  Exactly. Warby charges 100, including lenses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, including lenses. No, they don't give you lenses.  They just sell the frames. No, you send them your prescription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They put your yeah.  You know, I'm really feeling like you're paying a Luxottica prices when you pay 250 bucks.  He's a nice guy. He's in the town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I support local business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I support Google. Like here the Marlowe's.  OK, these are one hundred forty five dollars.  It's copper, not titanium.  And that includes prescription lenses with anti-reflecting coating.  You get a nice box and wiper rag, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, Google sent me.  OK, so I got I got a and a wiper rag, a glass wiper rag.  Oh, that's worth $50 at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Extra nose pads. Oh, you don't get extra nose pads from Warby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, and somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's these are these are platinum.  Brushed platinum.  Wow, cool. That looks as good as titanium.  And here's a nice selling point.  It doesn't have a pointy eye poker on the on one of the side of the.  Yeah.  I poker special eye poking unit.  Well, now I'm in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't find they send a little screwdriver.  Oh, you lost the screwdriver.  Oh, no, here it is.  Yeah. So I also got a little tiny screwdriver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, so if you have trifocals, they tell me that you have to where we won't do those.  So what you see exactly.  Yeah, I have progressive trifocals as well.  Or not.  It's a terrible thing.  Infinite.  And that don't get old.  OK, fourth quarter results for Google and fiscal year results for 2013 coming up  in just a bit.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm being Scottish.  Scottish.  Right.  Because it's all about saving money.  Google's going to do a stock split.  Are you happy about that?  I don't mind that.  You know, it doesn't mean anything right, because the value of your stock does not change one  wit.  You just have more shares for the same amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it a more shares or is it a different kind of shares?  Stocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  It is.  You get a dividend, which is technically a class C share, which is basically the same  as a regular share.  So it's basically almost exactly like a two to one stock split.  And the lies exactly right.  It's mathematically it means nothing.  It's just psychologically stocks tend to go up after a split, which is very weird.  Isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, because the price of a single share is lower.  So I can buy one now.  Google stock being well over a thousand dollars for one share.  I couldn't afford it.  That might be more of a factor.  But yeah, but you need evidence that stock markets are not.  Now, it is interesting that these are non-voting shares.  You'll be new shares are non-voting.  Yeah.  Right.  So you retain your class a single class a share and you get a second class seat share,  which is non-voting.  I guess that's not unusual.  That means that they don't want to double your vote.  So that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and the well, the there's a third part of the split, which is Sergey and Larry hold  on to super boarding shares.  They get class B shares, which are really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like 10 votes to 10 X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.  Ten times more than the class A shares.  But you know what?  That's great.  I think founders should retain control of the company.  You don't really don't want a Carl I can to come along, buy 1% of your stock and suddenly  change the company's direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were they were very clear in the founders letter that they were going to try crazy things.  And if you don't like that, don't buy Google shares.  So it seems like, you know, read the disclaimer before you buy Google is the high order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It also is important to you, Matt, because having this non-voting stock means they can  give out more stock to employees without diluting Larry and Sergey.  Yeah.  So the part of this is about getting and this is really the currency in Silicon Valley.  It ain't it's not just a salary.  It's how much stock am I going to get?  So having more stock available to give employees is very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some question more shares, same price.  That means that the company was valuation.  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The price drops.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The price.  Basically, think of it twice as many shares and the price drops in half.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if you have 100 shares worth a thousand dollars, you'll have 200 shares worth $500.  Gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And full disclosure, I own some Google stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you're going to have twice as many shares.  Yeah.  But not twice the votes or twice the dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have we have the twig vote.  That's right.  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The twig vote is probably more important than the share vote.  Yeah.  No, I'm serious.  Like I was so I was running, I was jogging and I hadn't listened to last week's this  week in Google.  And so I was listening to it yesterday and I don't remember exactly what the subject  was.  All I remember is at an hour and thirty nine minutes in, I have to go and find that podcast  again and report a bug.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wow.  Well, I think it was Leo Laporte.  I think it was your Audi, the Google Earth.  But that's not your fault.  Well, no, but it's a fair bug report.  Like, hey, you sent us through a lake or whatever.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it does use Google Earth.  But I think I think Google Earth is not the fault here that the Audi is saying to Google  Earth, he is in Bodega Bay right now.  What's that look like?  And then all Google Earth does is say, well, if he's in Bodega Bay, he's going to see the  continental shelf from here.  It's the funniest thing to drive on the continental shelf.  I got to tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So basically, you know, reports and bug reports via Twig.  Thank you.  Thank you.  They carry a fair amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From now on, we should have a little bell or something that we ring when it's for Matt  Cutts attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think Jeff's rant clearly got, you know, you know, people's attention even before  Twig started.  Well, yeah, sorry.  There was somebody in the in the chat room who was like, we should have a section called  Jeff's rant of the day or something like that.  So that was on my mind.  It's been done.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's been done.  By Jeff and others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't need no stinking rants.  I think I have a picture of me in the back.  Let me just look through my Google Plus photos.  I've been taking some some of the more interesting pictures.  Yeah, here I am driving down what looks like a typical California street.  But according to Google Maps, I'm just off the coast of Sea Ranch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if you pulled out your phone.  Oh, the phone would be fine.  Yeah, the phone would be fine.  Yeah, that's a car bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a bug.  By the way, apparently not only did Matt Cutts truncate his run during this podcast, but  somebody at Audi did because I got a call from the dealer shortly after saying Audi  America wants us to fix your car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  That's great.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's probably a little screw.  You can use a little screwdriver to twist the GPS coordinates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's actually of course there is a screw and they fixed it once.  I brought it in and they said, oh yeah, we'll reset that.  And they reset it and it worked for a day.  And then I sent them this picture saying, you fixed it.  Sort of.  Sort of.  But you know what's nice about having Google Earth in your car GPS?  You get some vivid views of where you aren't.  You know you're in trouble when it says, because you know it gives a credit on the Google  Earth to where the satellite photos came from when your credit is the United States  Department of Agriculture.  That's when you know, and it literally it is.  And then this one is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association and the U.S. Navy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what would happen to me, Leo?  What?  I would get fear of that.  When I go over, honest to God, you know my bridge problem?  When I go over bridges and I have my phone with with Waze on it and I see blue on the phone,  I get nervous and I turn off the phone.  I'm on a bridge!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So on your car, I'd be driving on the street and that's something gets sweaty pumps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm literally four miles out to sea.  I don't think there's a bridge out here.  You know what?  Actually, this is cool because you can you turn the knob on it and you can zoom in.  I've zoomed out to a four mile scale, but you can zoom in and you then you tap the knob.  If you zoom into the 30 meters level and then you tap the knob, you get street view as you're  driving down the street.  I can see you.  It's so weird to get street view of of where you are.  See the fishes?  Well, I don't know what happens in the water, but you can see you can see there.  I'm actually getting the topographic oceanic topographic map.  Courtesy of Noah and the US Navy.  We got a sub out there somewhere.  It's fun.  I love bug reports on the show.  So we'll get to the.  Well, let's do the quarterly results right now.  Consolidated revenues of survey says 16.86 billion dollars for the quarter ending December 31st.  That's up 17 percent year over year.  Nice.  Disappointed some folks.  Don't listen to the stock market.  Traffic acquisition costs.  That is what the cost of getting people to use Google, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, like it's marketing or payouts to partners, for example.  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, like like like Wikipedia or stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twenty four percent of revenue, three point three one billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, or like AOL, you know.  Yeah. OK. Acquisition costs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AdSense is going.  I saw AdSense is is going down.  It's getting weaker, which is probably a commentary on competitive things like programmatic buying and other things on websites out there.  But that's that's a concern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Net income was good and using the gap method.  Three point three eight billion dollars up considerably from two point eight nine billion a year to year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they just saved a five billion dollar EU fine.  So that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  So all in all, a good quarter for Google.  Now, mobile would be one of the things to watch carefully.  Right. Mobile revenues.  And this is one of the things that surprised me with Facebook's quarterly results that that mobile suddenly they flipped it was more important than desktop revenue.  Google a little soft, I think, on mobile revenue still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Facebook has been surprising on mobile.  I'm not sure exactly why.  That's what I'm saying. Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a big deal.  Yeah.  Just looking through these numbers.  So Apple's effective tax rate was 20, I think, 22, 24 percent.  Google's effective tax rate, 16 percent.  So good job on the accountants there.  That's thanks to the Irish reach around.  Cash assets sandwich sandwich in the Irish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Loop loop loop.  There is a term I don't remember.  I prefer reach around anyway.  The cash cash holdings, fifty eight point seven two billion dollars.  Well, that's an apple, but not not chubby, not chubby.  Forty seven thousand seven hundred and fifty six full time employees.  About almost four thousand Motorola.  So those will be disappearing.  Although that might take a while, incidentally.  That's got to be approved not only by U.S. regulators, but Chinese regulators for Lenovo.  So mobile struggles continue, but revenue and profit up.  Mobile's tough. It's a tough nut to crack.  But you've got to crack it because if you can't get mobile advertising to work, you don't have much future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, my contention has been that mobile is not as simple as just putting ads on here.  The mobile strategy, and I've said this on the show many, many times, is that Google is in the signal industry.  And that absolutely this generates signals for Google that Google uses across all kinds of parts of the relationship.  So it's not directly attributable.  The value of mobile to Google is not directly attributable to the banner ads sold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, really, yeah, if you think Google is an advertising company, this is very important.  But really, I think it's become clear Google is not an advertising company.  It's a data company, data driven data collection data.  What can we do with data? What can data do for us?  And and so this is yeah, they're getting the mobile signal.  That's a valuable piece of information, even if you can't monetize it immediately.  Nevertheless, you still have to figure out how to monetize mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  True. But I think we're also pretty well positioned.  It's kind of funny because if you go back six years ago, you know, the bet on Android was a pretty big bet.  And, you know, not every company bet on mobile the way that Google did.  And they've benefited. But I remember in the early, early days of Google, everybody thought cell phones and wireless would take off and WAP and WML and all that.  Yeah. And and so I remember when Google's mobile strategy was half of one engineer's time.  Right. You know, and it really took smartphones and give Apple a lot of credit for for opening up those new vistas because, you know, a lot of companies just didn't see mobile come in at all.  And I think it's it's interesting to see how many companies are now shifting to OK, we have to go mobile first.  Yeah. Hopefully Google will adapt well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and Facebook with their new paper app really has shown that they have they've kind of no found the way to success in mobile.  Admittedly, paper has no ads yet, but it's really beautiful and it really is a better, frankly, a better Facebook experience than anywhere else, including the desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The issue I don't have iOS is I just don't know.  I've got to drag out an iPhone and play with it.  Paper is is a subset of Facebook or it is a new a new skin to all of this on my desk chat if you want to go get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the it is a mobile app designed kind of as a skunk works and and Facebook brought in really good designers like Lauren Brickter.  We've talked about before Mike Mattis.  And then what they said in effect was start from scratch to design a new app.  Ostensibly, it's a news app.  You know, it's a it's more like a competitive flip board.  I'm running on an iPad, by the way, but it is not a it's not an iPad app.  It's an iPhone app.  But you see you can see it better on an iPad.  So this is the interface.  There's there's kind of two rows here.  The top row I could choose content.  So I'm seeing my Facebook content here in the bottom row.  But I can also go more like a newspaper to news headlines.  I've chosen the categories.  You could choose your categories.  I use news, tech scores.  They're sports category.  So you see, as I change cooking, compare this to rich Twitter, this is a lot richer.  It's gorgeous.  So exposure is a good one because these are pictures.  Right.  So down here, this is these are not my Facebook friends.  These are major content players and images from them.  Now, wait, I mean, look how gorgeous this is.  It's still Facebook content.  I can like it.  I could comment it.  I can reshare it on my timeline.  It does this kind of beautiful kind of parallax thing with it.  I can I can scroll down.  There's a lot of scrolling involved when I go back to you.  Are you playing with this, Gina?  Or do you have an iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't.  I actually haven't had a chance to look at this.  I appreciate you doing that.  So this is my face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This would be my timeline on Facebook.  These are all Facebook friends.  So these are all things that would appear in the timeline.  But even when they share something, it's kind of more beautiful than it would be on,  like, for instance, Ryan Shroud of PC Perspective shared a picture,  a layer of ice on the sidewalk of his office.  And and and that's a big deal because he lives in Kentucky.  Look how they move it around and stuff.  And, you know, I mean, it's very tactile.  I think they've done a great job with this.  It still is Facebook.  If I pull down, I get all of the same.  Things I get in the Facebook app, including actually if I pull down and go to settings,  I keep getting its settings that I have much of the same kind of collection of settings,  including things like that.  The app did like the code generator, which is kind of, you know, very this replaces the Facebook app,  I think, in terms of full functionality.  Wow.  And I still have friends and I have comments and I have.  That's a fascinating thing to do to know that you can do that.  Yeah, because now I have content in here that is not Facebook content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I can, you know, I can't remember.  So there that's how I scroll through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have a very good to I didn't pay attention to the tutorial and I should have when you first start off,  it talks to you, shows you pop ups, explains how to use it.  And if I paid any attention, I would if it needs a tutorial, dot, dot, dot.  It kind of does because I have a lot of friends and I have a lot of friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it needs a tutorial, dot, dot, dot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It kind of does because it's pretty intuitive, but it is all swipey.  There's no there's no menus.  There's no this is the new thing.  Right.  Swipe. Try it and try swiping.  See what happens.  Kind of a thing.  But you know what?  This is Facebook's never done a good mobile app.  This is gorgeous.  I'd love to be pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The panning and the big images reminds me a little bit of Facebook home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, it's Facebook home, but it doesn't take over the the launcher.  Right.  It's just it's just an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just I've never gotten into like the Flipboard magazine type like media apps.  Personally, I know a lot of people really love them.  I've just never I'm never like in this part of me is just being busy and being a new parent.  All those things.  But I'm never like I need something to read.  I always feel like I've got this like pile of things that I'm behind on reading.  So I would go for like Instapaper before I would like something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is the first time I can remember Facebook doing this.  This supports Instapaper.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So in the settings, you can select a read later service.  Oh, nice.  It's got a pocket pin board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Safari reading list.  Wow.  Safari reading list.  And then well, you're on Instapaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what I use, you know, I use a play newsstand more than I would have thought.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you're subscribed to?  I don't subscribe to anything.  No, I don't pay for anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you use it for?  Oh, I read I read Ver.  You know, it's a way that I can quickly see Verge and Daily Beast and then Gadget and Gizmodo without going to all their sites.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if I were the Virgin and others, I would worry a little bit about the same.  Same with footboards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Same exact issue with footboard.  Right.  And what you have to do, I think, is we have to start building the business model in.  I've talked on the show before about repost.us, how it makes articles embeddable like YouTube videos with the business model, brand, revenue, analytics and links all built in.  So I'm going to be in Mountain View.  By the way, Matt, I'll say hello next Friday.  And when I talk to Google Plus people, I constantly wish that we could embed entire articles into Google Plus with brand, revenue, analytics and links attached.  Then publishers would look upon it as a friendly thing to be there because they could get, you know, new audience and new advertising opportunities.  And so I think that content has to travel with its business model and has to travel with its credit, credit, right?  Versus copyright.  We have to rethink how that happens.  And then and then you can enable things like Facebook paper and flip board to be beneficial because the reader likes them and the publisher gets something out of it.  But we haven't thought that far ahead.  We keep on saying, no, you have to come to our site.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this came up because you're talking about mobile revenues.  And I think the big issue with mobile revenues isn't so much that people aren't clicking on the ads or maybe it is.  But the ad rates are going down, both YouTube and mobile ads, making less money through advertising because the rates have gone down.  So that's a cause for concern.  And I think that's saying advertisers saying these don't work.  So really the issue is coming up with ways to monetize mobile that work for advertisers and they have to work for consumers.  One of the reasons they don't work is because consumers don't like them.  Let's take a break.  When we come back, lots more.  We get the change log from Gina Trapani.  Gear up there.  Go over to that Encyclopedia Britannica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look up a good article for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no Google on Britannica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What if you look under G, you don't see Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Internet is my encyclopedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Internet, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We were talking about this before the show.  I have in my office a world book encyclopedia from 1998.  At least your Britannica was from an era when encyclopedias made sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did book reports and school reports using these encyclopedias when I was in fourth grade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bought the leather-bound guilt pages, all this beautiful world book because I thought my kids will really cherish this throughout their high school years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now it's a really good monitor or laptop stand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they put their stuff on it.  Actually, the reason it's at my office is because I found it and my Oxford English Dictionary on the ground, on the floor in the garage where they had been moved because nobody was ever looking at them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, a dictionary is a different thing.  I still am hanging on to my paper dictionary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, but you don't understand.  It's the Oxford English Dictionary.  It's 20 volumes.  It's bigger than the world book.  It's huge.  And they were all sitting on the garage floor.  I was like, I'm coming, Weasley!  I was anyway.  Oh, my God.  This episode of Twig brought to you by Legal Zoom.  Legal Zoom, it's not a law firm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And here she is, Gina Changelog-Trippany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Google Wallet app for Android and iOS got some updates this week.  You can now scan in your loyalty cards.  And Google will push, the Wallet app will push notifications to you letting you know if you're nearby a store that you have a loyalty card stored in there.  You just take a photo of your card with the device and the loyalty program information will just auto update in your Wallet app.  And then if you walk by the CVS or whatever, you'll get a little push notification if you want that reminds you to shop and earn rewards.  Google Maps app also got an update this week for iOS.  It's constantly looking for faster routes.  So as you as you're driving, if traffic conditions change or something changes, there's a faster route when you go to where you're going.  The Maps app will show you a little update and and let you know, hey, here's a faster way to get here.  You see a screenshot of that right there.  There's a brand new Nexus 5 available.  It is a very bright red.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, is it product red or is it just red red?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's it's red, bright red.  It's extremely red.  It's so mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The name is bright red.  The name is bright red.  Yes, it is entirely red back and a black front.  And even but the front ear speaker has a little red.  You've got kind of a little red dot on the front.  The specs are exactly the same as the black and white models.  The pricing is the same, too.  It's three forty nine for sixteen gig and three ninety nine for thirty two gig.  And it's in the play store right now shipping in stock, shipping one to two business days.  I tell you, that's a really good looking phone.  I kind of pause.  It's a little too crazy for me.  Crazy for me.  Like, I don't want to, you know, it says it says here I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Steal me, steal me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's still so if it's true that they're they're phasing out Nexus, I'm going to be so upset because I do.  I do love my Nexus things.  You know, even if I have come, I really believe it's true.  I love my Nexus.  I believe it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Leo, what makes what makes you think that's true?  Where are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's my thinking.  I have a big elaborate story you might you might imagine.  And we'll get back to the change log in a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, I didn't mean to derail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No problem.  No, no, I want to hear the elaborate story.  A big elaborate conspiracy story.  So Google does a little thinking.  They bought Motorola.  By the way, I'm sad about that because I love Moto X.  That's the phone I carry and I just got Wood and I love it.  Oh, by the way, this was less than a Nexus.  Thirty two gigs for three fifty because they had that sale on Monday the day before they announced they're selling it.  OK, but it's going to take a while.  I don't know.  I'm sure Lenovo.  I think Lenovo is a good company.  I'm sure that they will see the value in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, take it back to put the Chinese of this.  I wear it.  That's OK.  The NSA spyware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's fine.  I don't mind.  Believe me, my life, nothing to follow here.  It's keep moving.  But what I do hope is that Lenovo put a higher res screen and so forth.  And I believe it when Larry Page said, look, we couldn't go all in on phones and mobile is one of those areas you've got to go all in on.  But here's what I really think between the lines.  What he's saying is we're not we shouldn't be selling phones.  This is a channel conflict because we make money not on the phones, clearly not on Motorola phones.  We make money on Android.  We want people to use Android.  We want people to use Google Apps and we don't care if we make the phone or not.  So why are we pissing off Samsung chiefly, but every other Android handset manufacturer pushing them to create their own operating systems like Tizen or to hide the Android operating system and to take Google Apps off like Amazon.  We should be we should be it should be friendly, not a, you know, a competition.  So by selling handsets, we're getting in their cheese.  Let's get out of there.  Get out of their way.  Let's let Lenovo sell handsets.  It's nice because it brings another manufacturer with a lot of clout, a lot of class into the United States and Western Europe where Lenovo isn't but wants to be.  It's good for Android and interesting.  I don't know if it's a coincidence.  At the same time, they announce a side deal with Samsung, a to stop suing each other.  But B, it's for Samsung to stop crapping up its versions of Android to not only put less crapware on there, but to make sure the crapware is uninstallable.  So end users don't have to live with it.  This also has something to do with the fact that the South Korean government passed a law to the same effect.  But I but I think they made the agreement with Google as well.  And I think that that's Samsung saying to Google, OK, you're getting out of our business.  You're not going to compete with us.  That's nice.  We can work something out.  And I think part of the deal was, oh, and we won't make Nexus phones or tablets anymore either.  Now, they never really made them.  The Nexus five is made by LG, but it but is to Google's specification and is sold on Google Store.  So what they said is, no, hey, we don't need to make Nexus phones.  We'll do Google Play editions.  You want to make a Galaxy S4 Play Edition, Galaxy S5 Play Edition, Galaxy Note 3 Play Edition, HTC One Play Edition, a Moto X Play Edition, whatever.  Great. We'll sell it.  But it's your phone and you make the profit.  All of that is Google's way of I think saying, well, first of all, I think probably buying Motorola.  They knew this going in.  This was all a very cagey chess move by Larry Page to get these concessions out of these companies to get the patents, which notice they kept.  And they were able to sell off enough of it to I don't think they even lost any money on the whole thing because they sold it.  Because they sold off the set top box division and everything.  So I think this was actually very cagey 19 month play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's one further conspiratorial note, which is a consumer disturbs me.  Google was also showing what a phone could be and showing what a price could be.  Right.  And we're losing that that that non market influence of Google.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So when Microsoft tried to do the same thing, by the way, we were talking about this on Windows Weekly with a signature PC.  They were getting pissed off that HP and everybody else was crapping up windows.  So Microsoft had this initiative called Sickle.  Hard to do, but go ahead.  Well, you know, there's a set aesthetic judgment.  But believe me, you could make Windows worse by putting trial wear on of crappy antivirus software, things like that.  So they created these signature PCs that were crap were free and none of the partners made them.  And that's why Microsoft, by the way, did surface.  I'm convinced they finally said, look, we've got to make a version of Windows.  That's that's the way it should be.  And I'm convinced that's why Google did Nexus.  But I think that Google's declaring victory.  They're saying, first of all, they got Samsung to offer everybody's offering Google Play editions.  They sell well. Huh?  Except Verizon.  And and I think they can declare victory.  And I think that they always have that threat that they could come back.  I mean, this doesn't say we'll never do it again.  I think they've they've demonstrated effectively to Samsung, HTC, LG and others that consumers want the pure, pure Google experience.  You're better off if you don't chunk it up.  You know, the rumors are hearing now about the Galaxy S5.  No more eyesight tracking.  They're getting rid of features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which for the first time, may be interested in the Samsung phone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I do agree that, you know, with the Motorola deal, there's a lot of nice compliments as far as what Lenovo brings to the table.  And, you know, I'm not privy to those sorts of discussions by a long shot.  So I have no inside knowledge whatsoever.  But it does feel like the Nexus line has always served as a really good way to demonstrate a vision and a best of breed, whether you, you know, even down to like the Chromebook Pixel.  Like, no, not everybody wants it or is going to buy it, but you can really see just what's possible.  And some people, Jeff and me, we love pixels and we use them.  And then some people are like, OK, I'm going to use for the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Larry was very clear.  We're not getting out of hardware.  We still got the Nest.  We still got glass.  We still got pixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Nest is indeed now in charge of the hardware division.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We were getting out of is one category, phones, and that they're smart to because they never made any money on phones.  They had they did phones for that exact reason.  I agree, Matt, to say here's what it could be.  But you don't want to do that to the loss of Android entirely.  And they're about they were about to lose Android.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if I'd go that far, but it is the case that it's true with Motorola.  You had to hold them at enough of an arm's length to reassure everyone else that Motorola wasn't getting special treatment, which in some sense was almost not fair to more of it.  So I still you know, whether you call it next to this or not, I have no idea what will happen.  But it feels like Google will still want to demonstrate that best of breed and that vision of what maybe maybe and maybe they will do that as long as they can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe they have side agreements on publicized side agreements with all the manufacturers that we will offer Google Play Edition because if you can get a Galaxy S4 or as Gina has an HTC one Google Play Edition that demonstrates it.  And it lets and it lets the hardware manufacturers show their best stuff.  But you don't get the reference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't get a reference device for developers, particularly with new sensors.  Right. So like it's like if there are new sensors that Android supports or new Android features that require hardware complements.  Right. Like Google. Yes.  Google still wants to release devices that that they can develop in parallel with the Android.  I hope so.  I think it's a good idea to launch a new Android version on.  I mean, that's that's kind of my my concern and my thing.  Look, the Nexus devices ever really sell.  I mean, they weren't about making money.  It wasn't about trying to make the best phone.  Right. It was it was a marketing thing for developers and super nerd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the risk. Here's the risk.  You got Samsung, which makes 80 percent of all Android devices doing a developers conference, doing ties in.  And I think that Samsung was saying, you're going to lose us.  We're going to skin Android.  We're going to take off Google Apps.  And they're already starting to move Google Apps off in favor of their own.  And I really think that Google was afraid of that.  Android is much more important to their long term strategy than Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure. Without a doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll just put my vote in.  Since I have no knowledge and necessarily no power in this, I'm just like if if Sundar or whoever is listening to this podcast, I vote.  I'll just leave Nexus around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll find out. It is just a rumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We throw a big vote behind that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is just a rumor. And I don't think they'll drop the brand name.  I just think they will.  I think it makes sense for them to stop making Nexus phones, do Google Play Edition, you know, and it doesn't have to be permanent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hopefully some Googler just cut off his or her run and is going to talk to the right person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it would make sense for Google, as long as the other OEMs play nice, to say, OK, we don't want to hurt you guys.  This is your business. We don't make money on phones.  We always have the Nexus hammer behind our back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we don't have to use it.  I love Gina's point about a reference device that especially includes like with the Moto X, you have a complement of other chips that show it's not just about the software.  And that's kind of, you know, vision only gets demonstrated if you've got that opportunity.  So who knows what will happen. But I hope it does make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Google has collaborated with other manufacturers.  I mean, all the Nexus devices are from other manufacturers. They're not developed in-house.  Right. Like the Moto X was the only Google. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I would guess that the Nexus five, given its differences from the LG G2, is somewhat to Google's specification.  Not made by Google, but somewhat to their specification.  I do think you make an excellent point, Gina, that if you wanted to add hardware capabilities to Android, you'd need a platform, a reference platform.  So maybe Google continues to sell Google Play Edition and Google Developer Edition.  And maybe just doesn't. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And maybe the Play Edition or the Developer Edition essentially becomes the Nexus.  I really don't know. But, you know, it seems like that kind of cooperation between Google and hardware manufacturers is really useful.  Oh, yes.  To show people a path forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't disagree at all. But I think Google wants to go to great pains to demonstrate to Samsung particularly, we're not competing with you. We're partners.  That's my only thinking. But you know what? Your vote carries a lot more weight than mine, Matt Cutts.  I wouldn't say that.  I would. But I think that's Microsoft seeing that right now with Surface and with Windows Phone and buying Nokia.  Nobody else wants that. Now that Microsoft owns Nokia, nobody makes Windows phones but Microsoft.  Nobody makes Windows RT but Microsoft.  Wow.  And that's the risk you run of making hardware to compete with your channel.  Yeah, that's true.  And so I don't think I think Google looked at that and we don't want to get in that situation.  We don't want to be the only ones making Android phones.  I love Nexus phones. But you know what? I love the Moto X even better because it was like a Nexus phone with some really cool additional hardware features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I hope they fold that into the main Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you look at what Lenovo did with ThinkPad, I think what will happen is Lenovo will build a 1080p screen around the same platform.  This M7, you know, Google kept the R&D, the OSHA and all of that. They kept.  So I don't know where the M7 chip came from, whether it was a Google or a Motorola thing.  That's the additional hardware that lets it sit and listen all the time without depleting battery and shows you the active notifications and all that stuff.  Yeah, Google needs to keep doing that. Or somebody.  Anyway, back to the changelog.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Back to the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry, Gina.  Not M7, X8. You're right, X8. Sorry. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So back to changelog. Two new Chrome features launched.  First, a feature that warns users when their browser has been hijacked.  So the Chrome team says that settings hijacking is one of their number one user complaints.  And that's when malware like screensavers or free games changes the user's browser settings without their knowledge to do bad stuff like inject ads.  So Google engineers added a new feature to Chrome.  And I believe this is just on Windows that automatically warns users when browser settings have been altered by malware.  So if it gets triggered, there's just a pop up shows up and it reads something like, you know, Chrome detected that your browser settings may have been changed without your knowledge.  Would you like to set them back to their original defaults?  And this new feature is designed to kind of complement that feature that we talked about a couple episodes back where you can reset Chrome to kind of factory settings, you know, brand new original defaults.  If it gets mucked up, if you added a bunch of extensions or if you change a bunch of settings.  So yeah, nice new feature.  Hopefully this will reduce the Chrome team's user customer service duties.  And I believe, like I said, I believe that this is just on Windows.  And Google now Google now notifications are now in the Chrome beta.  So I think a couple episodes ago I talked about how it was in Chrome Canary.  It's been graduated to the Chrome beta.  And this is for Mac, Windows and Chromebook computers.  I was really, really excited about this.  I enabled this instantaneously.  I was running stable Chrome and Canary Chrome.  So I ditched them both.  And now I'm just in the beta, which I think is nice.  So how do I turn on? I'm in beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do I do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you go to Chrome colon slash slash flags, they're enable Google now.  There's a setting to enable Google now.  You change the setting to enabled.  You relaunch your browser and then you'll see a little welcome to Google.  Now you're going to get you're going to get the notification cards here.  So Google now is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Careful these experiments may bite.  OK, Judge, come on.  Enable canvas to daily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's too much stuff in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot of experiments.  You have to know what to search for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just search for now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google now.  There you go.  Enable Google now, enabled.  OK.  Relaunch.  And then restart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, relaunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Matt must laugh when he sees all this.  All right.  He is.  That's him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Matt probably had this for, like, ages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So far beyond that.  He doesn't have Google now.  He has Google tomorrow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What am I doing tomorrow?  Now, where does this show up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you're on a Mac.  It should have shown up a little welcome card.  If not, there's a little bell in the menu bar.  You see the little bell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Little bell in my menu bar?  Yeah.  And it's Chrome notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Google now.  See anything about Google now?  Yeah, it's telling me right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's 35 and overcast in Brooklyn.  Oh, these are now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's now.  This is now.  That's now.  Oh.  So it added a menu.  Even when Chrome's not launched, will that be there?  That's interesting.  And these are my now things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those are now things.  I don't believe it'll be there if Chrome isn't.  I believe that that's a Chrome notifications bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then these are all the things that I can have.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's non-now related.  Those things are just extensions that you can get.  That's notifications.  Yeah, yeah.  That's extensions that you've granted, permissions to show you notifications.  Learn more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google now for Chrome.  This is really nice.  If people haven't used now, this is, well, I guess everybody's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now it's doing a really good job of seeing the stuff that I read, like articles that  I read, and then recommending articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's a good point.  It's a two-way street because now it's seeing your browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it was doing that on my phone anyway.  It was clearly, I mean, Google obviously knows a lot of my browsing history if I'm signed  into Chrome.  So it would say like, oh, hey, you search for the good wife.  So here's an article about the good wife or whatever, on my phone, which when it first  started to happen, I was like, oh, this is pretty good.  And you could say, don't show me this again.  Or you could do the, is this card useful?  So you can kind of train it.  Nothing location-based though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or is it?  Well, no, no, it definitely does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google now does do location-based.  It's like if you have, if there's an airline ticket in your email and you arrive at the  airport.  I'm seeing the weather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It knows I'm in Petaluma.  So yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it knows you're in Petaluma.  Yeah.  I've only got a weather card right now.  You've got a few other, few other cards, but so I'm pretty happy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm having the Google now.  This is neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's, that's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's the change long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With a little diversion for Leo's conspiracy theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was good.  I like to talk about the Nexus.  I especially want to hear Matt had to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you both made very compelling arguments for keeping Nexus alive.  So maybe they won't get rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just happy to see the malware stuff because that's not my team.  It's like a sibling team, but I'm so excited to see them.  It's like a Seattle Seahawks fan just watching a route, like, you know, 29 to nothing.  No, I want to see 43 to nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In that line, Vane, let me ask you, because we've, we heard a couple of weeks ago about two Chrome extensions that have been sold to add guys and they started popping up ads, you know, overlaying ads on the website.  Is that related to the settings thing or is that something different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's of the same basic umbrella.  I mean, the thing to remember is, in my opinion, search has your back and Chrome has your back.  They care about speed, stability and security.  And Chrome by auto update is able to protect you and Chrome by moving the extensions away from third party toward the web store are able to protect you.  And then the spammers move to like using enterprise policies that businesses usually use and then they lock that down.  And so the next place that the spammers are going to go is just try to do sort of the equivalent of expired domains for web spammers.  They buy existing extensions, but that's OK, because then, you know, that's just the next vector.  And then we'll respond to that back.  You just kill you just kill those extensions when you see that.  Yeah, exactly. So, you know, it's in some sense, it's fine to hear about this trend happening, but it's not like the Chrome team is going to let that go.  They are going to protect people and they're going to keep iterating and finding ways to protect people.  And that's why I love Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm a big fan.  Chrome's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The permissions model of Chrome, though, like I feel like has a little bit of the Android permissions model problem.  I've talked about this on the show before, like about how I mean, when you make a Chrome extension, often if you want to do kind of almost anything, you have to ask for permission to the person's browser activity across all websites, which seems like very broad permission to ask.  But often, you know, I just dabbled a little bit in Chrome extension development.  But like that's what you need as a developer to do, you know, what you want to do if you need to do things across across websites or on any website.  But that kind of and then when you know when you have the extension sold that permission, which I just wish was more granular or if I wish it was just clear to the user, you know what's happening or what data is getting sent back and forth.  I mean, pretty much every extension that I've got installed could be just logging all of my browser activity without me knowing because of the kind of the permissions model.  And I've had this rant about about Android, too.  I mean, I love Android's permissions model because it's very granular.  When you install an app, you get a list of all the things it needs access to.  But but I often am left wondering, you know, why?  Why? Why does need access to my contacts?  Why? You know, I wish that it was kind of inflow or that it was it was a little more sandboxed or there was just more kind of information about, you know, what's going on behind the scenes?  Because, you know, I mean, all of our devices are just always connected.  And with broad permissions like that, I feel like those kind of situations where extensions get sold or apps get taken over and then, you know, bad stuff gets injected.  And I just have no idea because, you know, it's installed and running and doing what I need it to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's hard to think of a better solution, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think Chrome was especially good for, you know, 2009 or so whenever they started to install extensions like to give you that transparency.  But, you know, I think there's also always room to iterate and do a rethink and say, OK, is there some way we could make things more clear?  As far as extensions getting sold, I'd rather focus on that specific problem, because usually you are establishing good faith.  You're saying I trust this extension and you're going to usually keep trusting that extension unless there's some reason to change.  Like change of ownership.  And if you can spot those kinds of transitions, then you can save people from doing a lot of work or stress or mental overhead while protecting the vast majority of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You definitely don't want to get too granular on permissions because people just go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah. Well, then you have the Windows Vista problem, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the way iOS does it is, I guess you called that in stream, the idea that it asks you before an application wants location information.  And you can give permanent access then.  But iOS can do that only because they don't give you really you grant blanket permissions period.  Really, what happens when you install it?  You never told what permissions an app has.  You trust that Apple wouldn't have approved the app if it was inappropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you are sort of depending on their review process, but they've sandboxed certain things, right?  Like the sandbox photo access, location access, contacts access.  So like in the course of using the app.  Just those three.  Yeah.  So things like camera.  I mean, I don't know what else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You see that all the time in iOS.  An app will say, can I access your photos or in your camera now?  And you say yes.  And you can do it permanently or one by one usually.  Right.  But at that point, I mean, but it doesn't.  So there's other things like just recently, what was it?  Was it some app just added a huge number of permissions in a very scary way.  Was it ever note when I'm Android?  Yeah.  Facebook.  So the new Facebook app and I guarantee you nobody noticed this.  But it but but I think Google handled it as well as you could do.  The new Facebook app on Android.  One of the permissions it asked for was the ability to send and receive text on your behalf and to read all your texts.  Pretty scary, right?  So before I could install it, because it was a changed permission, the Play Store said permissions have changed.  You have to read this.  And it said no.  And it put it right at top.  Actually, there were several new ones besides that.  Yeah.  The place handles that very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's as well as you as well as you're going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Apple doesn't have a place for that.  Right.  That would have just I don't even know if it happened.  It might have happened already on iOS.  We don't know.  Yeah, there's a there's really there's a balance right between like simplicity and then obfuscating information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what I mean?  Like Apple would argue that's a bad user experience, right?  To have to like read through a generic list of permissions and decide whether or not you trust Facebook enough to read all your text messages, which is sort of a jarring experience.  Right.  I would have I would have paused and really think about but but but the other flip side of the coin is like, you know, I'm not going to do that.  The other flip side of the coin is that you should know you should know if an app is looking at your text messages, particularly text messages.  That's that's pretty personal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I think it's fair feedback.  There's always room to ask ourselves, is there some other better way we could think of to do it?  I think that's a fair question to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook did post a page why it's asking for this.  And a lot of this has to do with the fact that permissions are clumped.  So in order to do one of those things, it has to ask for permissions to do all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the other thing I would like to say.  I would say no, you can't have my text messages.  You can have everything else, but you can't have those.  And then that breaks the app.  Well, but but but but you should be able to say, you know, give me all the functionality of the app except for the functional.  I know this puts a lot on developers and I know there's a whole different thing.  But like there's the Facebook app should be able to function.  I should be able to read my news feed and send a Facebook message without Facebook having access to my text messages.  Like, that's not unreasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the reason they did this, and by the way, it wasn't to send text messages, but merely to read incoming text messages.  The reason they added this is so that when they're confirming the phone number, you know, you enter the phone number, they confirm it.  You don't have to wait for you to see the text message and enter the number.  It can all happen automatically. Right.  So that's reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What? It's so it's funny.  So WhatsApp does it that way.  When you when you give WhatsApp your phone number, it just goes, OK, got it.  And, you know, you wait a little bit.  What's really happening is a text message is being sent, received and deleted.  I think Facebook, you had to see the text message, see the six digit number, enter it in.  And now you've got a confirmation code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And from that point on, they don't need access to your text messages, but they have access to your text messages.  This is what Facebook's saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Another one.  Another one.  Download files without notification.  That's risky.  But they say, well, this is how we can preload newsfeed content this way.  Preloading newsfeed content. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they can they also do the updates themselves.  They push their own app updates.  They don't mention that. But yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Read, write your contacts.  This allows us to import your contacts to Facebook and sync Facebook contacts.  So yeah, I mean, it's you know what?  You said the word trust. Was it you or Matt?  It was Matt.  Ultimately, it comes down to do I trust this app?  Then I'm going to give it these permissions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  And trust matters because if Google or Apple or whoever don't handle these things well, then people lose trust in us.  And so that was the funniest thing about the Chrome extension kerfluffle because I think a lot of people said, oh, Google is somehow looking the other way.  No, no, it's just hard to be aware of all the different attack vectors and these all the different bad actors.  But the Chrome guys take this.  The Chrome team.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought you would take action because I thought it seemed like yes, it wasn't I didn't look like it was something done on purpose.  It was a new vector, a new attack vector.  And it does it is a flaw because I have to approve the extent you have to approve the extension to get on the store.  But you don't have to approve updates.  So a malicious update can be added to a non malicious extension after the fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is so I do.  So it is about trust, but it's also about control.  Right. Like so the platforms have to build in ways for users to be able to control, you know, to say you can have access to my text messages for the next 10 minutes.  And after that, then you can't.  That would be better.  Yeah.  But this creates like a lot of UI and could also, you know, tedious and maybe, you know, you're risking going Windows Vista.  But there's trust.  And then there's also there's also control.  And I think that there has to be a balance.  Right.  Like and part of that's on Android to give you, you know, give users the ability to deny, you know, certain permissions.  Part of it's on developers to be clearer in their communication.  I mean, if Facebook needs access to my all my text messages forever and ever, just so they can read one text message when they're setting up my phone, like that seems crazy to me.  Like that, they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you have Facebook on your Android device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do, but I'm going to install it after this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because if you update it in the last couple of weeks, that's what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I don't use the native messaging app like I use Google Voice.  Wasn't messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was the Facebook app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  But when they were asking for access to my text messages, they're asking for access to my native messaging.  Right.  So, you know what I mean?  I don't I don't text that way so that they actually wouldn't be getting, you know, Google owns all my text messages.  So, you know, I decided to trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, you got to trust somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll host this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I'm going to just look at the Facebook because I was just updated description review.  I guess you can't go back and look at it must be somewhere I can see the permissions that I've granted to this app.  That is that is available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's under app info in the.  Ah, OK.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you can go back and look at Gina and you actually probably approved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I probably did.  Didn't look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think what Facebook at one point in Facebook's changes to privacy, they got better about telling you what you were doing at the moment you did it.  You're sharing this with blank.  And I think that's that's it's not always workable, but it's not a bad way to do it.  That at the moment you're taking an action, if there is a choice involved, give you the choice then unless it becomes too wearing and you don't ask me again.  Let me understand in the context of what I'm doing.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, it's a huge challenge, particularly on mobile to to give that kind of information.  I mean, creating more and more friction, right?  Like, you know, frictionless sharing that that adds friction to sharing, you know, reading, you know, seeing the thing, just like the new permissions of dialogue.  You're like, oh, wait, but there's a balance, there's a balance between control and being informed and also having an easy experience on a tiny, tiny touchscreen with your thumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, so, by the way, I've also apparently I didn't know this given Facebook, the Facebook app to directly call phone numbers.  Phone numbers. You can read my text messages.  It could take pictures and video record audio location.  It does. You know, so, yeah, this you're right.  If you go into the apps interface, you can read all the or was it Chad or Jason that said that you can read all the stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the app info.  And a quick way to get to it is from your launcher.  If you're in the thing, you can click and hold and instead of uninstall, just drag over to app info.  You're on Kit Kat or something similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm curious, Gina, if you actually gave it permission and just weren't paying attention.  Which just shows that the mechanism is broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you're a smart person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At some point, I enabled Android to automatically update my apps, but it doesn't automatically update if there are new permissions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right. This is one where it would have said Facebook can't be automatically updated unless you say yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that but that's via the Play Store and Facebook's app Facebook's app updates happen in app, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, this was well, this is not this one.  And of course, you can't do an update that changes capabilities without asking permission.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it's those are intense, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to you have to have OS level permission to do that.  Right.  You can't just say, no, I changed my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to read text messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it seems like maybe Facebook wanted to do it that way.  And we said, no, all updates that require new permissions have to go through the store or something like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, Chromecast is now open to developers.  I don't know what this means.  Gina will explain.  The Google Cast software development kit for developers who want to build Chromecast support has been released as of Monday.  You still have to get permission from Google, though, right?  Or no?  What I want is that I can write an app right now that works from that Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so. I think it's just porn is is prohibited.  So I guess they find a way to kill that.  Why would you prohibit porn? Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know.  Wait a minute.  Come on.  Yeah.  Who cares?  I downloaded a porn app and I want to send it to my porn Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's me in your lonely apartment sitting there.  Your porn is not illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You bought the device.  Yeah, no, they can't really.  They're blocking porn.  I actually I don't know whether they require permission now.  But but I think the big step here is the SDK is available for everyone to start to use.  So I don't know whether there's still one gating factor beyond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think because we haven't seen a flood of new apps, there must still be the issue of you then have to be approved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The terms of service developers have to agree in order to make their apps Chromecast compatible.  One of the conditions explicit content is a no go says giga ohm.  Oh, stop it.  Come on.  We don't allow content.  No, get this. Get this. Get this.  Right.  So so so this would this would actually get rid of HBO.  We don't allow content that contains nudity.  That's Game of Thrones.  Graphic sex acts or sexually explicit material.  That's Game of Thrones.  That's cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that's Cinemax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They might also be HBO.  Go is Chromecast enabled those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So maybe it has maybe people don't want Chromecast to be known as porn cast in the beginning or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe maybe they'll lighten up later on.  I mean, that was this is the whole Steve Jobs thing.  You can't do porn on iOS.  But I got to point out porn is not illegal in the United States.  Right.  And if it's adults downloading, you know, porn to the dot com app.  And why should Google get involved?  You have to promote it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't have to list all the apps that you can do.  But but somebody wants to enable the chrome button in their app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's a sidelight.  What I really want is that the twit apps and we don't develop our own app, but there are a number of people who do can be enabled for for Chromecast.  I suspect that that's still we're getting closer.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And well, and I think the Chromecast there was a person who had like reversed engineered the API.  Coach, coach.  Yeah.  And I think people sort of said, well, we're still working actively on the API and getting the SDK.  So so now if the SDK is actually released, I mean, you own the device.  Yeah, you could.  You could in theory, if it's, you know, frozen in stone at a one point, oh, in theory, somebody could reverse engineer.  That's his that's his app, all cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So now it works again.  So Cotick to immediately went back, fixed it, and it works.  Oh, that's great news.  He was upset because he had used a non approved kind of hack around Google disabled it, probably not.  And I think he even agreed not aimed at him, but just, you know, that was never approved.  It was deprecated.  But it broke all cast.  All cast is working now.  That's good.  Very, very cool.  By the way, you can stream your porn with all cast.  Or right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Because it's from your device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My god, Leo is going to have his porn on the big screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't care if it's three forty P.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How big is that curved screen of yours, Leo?  How big is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and there's something I think Plex like also works.  So, you know, at the point where you can stream whatever your own content is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's probably one of those things where, you know, we just want to make sure that it's.  We say it.  Yeah, we say it.  We don't have to enforce it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gigantic sexual organs.  Google brings you gigantic sexual organs.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a double standard, because if it were your gigantic sexual organ, you wouldn't mind so much.  It's just other people's.  You don't want to.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've you know, because we haven't moved in our new place yet.  I've been sort of I've been in transit and staying with relatives and Airbnb and the whole thing.  And the Chromecast is so small and so easy, like I just had in my backpack.  I've been just that's been my primary media center basically for for over a month now.  And I just I just absolutely I just absolutely love it.  It's so easy to set up.  And I but I've often wanted to, you know, I come home at night and be like, I want to show pictures of the baby to my, you know, my mom.  I just want to throw those photos up on the TV without having to show her on the phone.  And so I'm really excited about this.  This is this is really good.  I'm down. I've installed all cast right now because sending up my personal media is definitely something I wanted to one thing I would like to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's ridiculous because it's a thirty five dollar device.  I wish it supported five gigahertz as well as two point four gigahertz Wi-Fi.  Yeah, I'd agree with that.  And that's mostly because I use a Sonos, which is on two four.  And basically, I cannot use two four because we have so much all over the house.  I can't use two four.  It's just not reliable in my house.  So I use five G for everything.  The five gigahertz band.  And it would be nice if so.  The Chromecast doesn't work so well in the distant reaches of the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Other than that, I was I was this close to buying a new TV so I could use it better with my Chromecast because Chromecast actually supports CEC.  So you can like switch channels without your input source.  And I've got an ancient TV that doesn't handle that well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I was about to do the same thing, Matt.  I have one TV that only has one HDMI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The thirty five dollar dongle that's going to cost you four grand.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then they stopped making the Panasonic ST60.  And now I'm like, OK, I'll wait a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Get it while you can get.  No. If you could find anybody still selling it, get it.  Yeah, Amazon and Best Buy have stopped.  They've stopped. Oh, that kills me.  That's a great TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have plugged my Chromecast into many TVs in the past six weeks.  And I have yet to find one that powers it.  Like I have to plug it in every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think it's MHL.  I don't think it does power.  I have an MHL port.  I know an MHL port and didn't work.  You still have to plug the little USB thing.  It's another, you know, it's little things you can improve.  I thought it could take power from the HDMI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it needs to be MHL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If it's MHL and it's an MHL port.  Only in that case, yes.  But I think it's not because I tried it on my MHL.  It didn't power it.  I'll try it again.  Maybe I just missed something.  But you know, many TVs now have USB ports.  So you just plug.  Oh, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you can just plug in the, oh, yeah, yeah, no, that's smart.  That's way smarter because that's the only bad part of the experience.  It's like, oh, where's the plug?  Because, you know, behind the entertainment center is always just this like massive,  you know, unavailable, you know, outlets.  So it's always a pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why we all think of the television as the $4,000 dongle for Chromecast.  That's the right.  Now you've got your priorities straight.  CEC is really cool.  It works very well with the Chromecast if you have a properly implemented CEC.  Actually, I think the Vieras are a little funky.  Oh, OK.  I'm using it.  It works great on a Samsung device.  CEC is funny.  Yeah.  Everybody has a different name for it.  Yeah.  Samsung calls it Any Share or something like that.  Standards.  Twitter results out.  Twitter results out.  Twitter crushes, says TechCrunch, with fourth quarter revenue of $242 million.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you're talking profits, Apple profits of $13 billion, Google profits of what,  $3 or $4 billion, revenue of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, Leo, give him credit there.  I was not that long ago when I made fun of Fred Wilson and many of us did,  saying there was no discernible Twitter business model.  So Dick Costello as...  No, I agree.  He's got real revenue.  Yeah.  It's a start.  The stock went down after the result because of the supposed user growth issue.  But there is a path visible now for Twitter, which just wasn't at the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Earnings per share of two cents.  Analysts had thought they would lose two cents.  Nick Bilton said an interesting thing when he was on our triangulation show.  He's the author of Hatching Twitter, probably now knows more about Twitter than any human alive.  He said they completely have the dials to how much profit they make.  That's up to them.  They tweak it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that also, the trade-off is how much you piss off your users.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, even more than that, how much they reinvest.  I mean, they can...  Sure.  They have control of...  They've got the revenue.  That's the point.  Yep.  And how much profit they make on $242 million in revenue is up to them.  They can be 5%, 10%, 0%.  And so they decide to make a little bit of profit.  Not a lot, just a little bit of profit.  They can't control user growth, and I think that's why stock market maybe a little bit.  So what happened with user growth?  It slowed.  They still grew.  But the growth slowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, using ThinkUp, it's been really interesting because it shows you the people who follow you,  and it has this notion of the people who are kind of interesting or important.  And it's a little scary because whenever I check these people out, I'm like,  oh, that's 30,000 fake followers this guy has.  Oh, no.  That's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That means our algorithm is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ThinkUp should not make you insecure.  Well, hopefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, ideally, Twitter wouldn't let these guys have 30,000 followers in the first place.  But yeah, maybe it's more me in the area that I play around in.  Like me and Danny Sullivan, we probably have a lot of fake followers.  Oh, yeah.  You probably do, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

So, okay, this tip is kind of nerdy, but it's really, it's kind of amazing.  So I had to share it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a blog post by Mihai Paparita, who actually I think is currently a Googler.  I know at some point he was on the Google reader team and he did a post.  Matt, do you know if Mihai is still at Google?  Yeah, I think so.  I think so.  I think so.  I think so.  I think so.  I think so.  I think so.  I think so.  Mihai is still at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think Mihai has actually left.  But yeah, he was on the Google reader team.  He's a fantastic dude.  Mihai has left the building.  He's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's like published all these Greasemonger scripts.  I mean, he's a really great coder writer, always great at sharing a code.  And he wrote this post about these internal system Gmail labels.  He actually kind of reversed, or he didn't hack, but he watched requests back and forth to Gmail over the line  to see how users would mark messages certain ways if they were muting conversations or marking them as spam.  Because Google had that bug where for a very small percentage of users,  messages that shouldn't have gotten marked as spam did or wound up in the trash.  And they said, hey, you should check to make sure, just take a look through your spam folder  and make sure that everything there is legitimately spam because we did have this bug and it's been fixed.  But check it out.  Mihai found these internal system labels that you can use to search your Gmail.  So he published a little search query that you can use inside Gmail to say, show me all the messages that are spam,  which I explicitly marked as spam.  And it's using one of these kind of system labels.  So the search is, is colon spam, which is a normal regular user search,  minus label colon and this internal system label is a caret OS.  So you're basically saying, show me all the spam that Google didn't mark automatically.  Show me just the spam messages I marked.  So which comes in really useful if you've, you know, if you fat fingered something,  if you accidentally feel like you marked a legitimate message as spam,  you can go back and see them without having to go through all your spam messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank God. I do that all the time. I go accidentally click it and I go, oh, shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  I feel bad.  And if you're interested in how Gmail works, this post is really kind of amazing,  especially that he's not Google anymore.  I mean, he obviously knows how some of like Google's web services work,  but he he writes in detail how he kind of figured out what all these hidden system labels are.  And there are quite a few of them.  You can say, show me all the messages which I've muted.  Show me all the messages that were marked as phishing attempts.  Show me all my chat transcripts.  And a lot of these are exposed as regular search terms, you know, for users.  But some of them actually, some of them aren't.  So you show me all my Google voice messages.  Show me all the messages which have the option for Gmail to unsubscribe me from them.  So really, really cool stuff here if you're interested in how Gmail works and being a total search ninja.  This is like the internet's secret menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it is. It really is.  Pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Really good find. Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And how Gmail smart labels work.  Yeah, some really good stuff here.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Sergey adds into the discussion with a few of very, very nerdy points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really? In the comments?  Yeah, fabulous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He shows up and he's like the C machine stood for crawl.  And so we skipped the B rack and just named them A and then C and all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, this is so thank you, Sergey.  That is awesome.

Transcript:  Bye bye.  Really good show as usual.  Take care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See you next week.  A tip for all you all you webmasters out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, if you don't see Matt's webmaster videos on YouTube, you've got to.  There are requirement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you're an SEO, it might be worth your time.  So I did a post on my personal blog last week that basically just said, look, you know, guest blogging has gotten out of control in terms of for SEO purposes.  So if a random guy writes you out of the blue and says, hey, I'd like to do a guest post, you should be suspicious.  You should be especially suspicious if they offer you money or something like that, because at this point it's gotten to be really, really spammy.  And so we just wanted to telegraph that so that people know to be on guard and be a little bit cautious.  We've been taking action on some pretty large link networks and some pretty large websites across the web that have been using or abusing these types of techniques.  So if you get a random email solicitation, be skeptical about that.  You know, if it's if it's Leo Laporte and he wants to do a guest podcast, of course, that's the sort of thing you want.  But if it's just someone you've never heard of, there's spelling errors in the email, just just be pretty suspicious of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the YouTube channel where your webmaster videos are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I forget. But if you search for webmaster videos, it ranks number one in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What a surprise.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It ranks organically.  Exactly. No worries about that.  So it's YouTube dot com slash user slash Google Webmaster help.  But I always search for Webmaster.  Yeah, that's easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Matt Cutts is, in fact, according to Adam Curry, the most powerful man in the world, simply by his role at Google or most hated.  We'll see.  Always, always great to have you on.  Thank you, Matt.  We'll let you go to.  OK, thanks very much.  My tool of the week.

Transcript:  Floppy Bird, Floppy Bird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I knew it was on Android all along.  In fact, I'd already installed it.  I just was trying to forget.  Do not install this app on anything you have.  It is the most it is.  It is totally viral.  I cannot figure out why, because it's really hard to play.  Who's the Flappy Bird record holder at the Brickhouse?  I think it's Josh.  He's got like 40.  Yeah.  How many?  The idea is you're flapping this bird to get him.  Oh, crap.  Get him through the holes.  That's it.  That's all there is to it.  And I don't know why it's so addictive, but it is.  It is literally number one in like 20 different app stores.  You always go from below.  I noticed that.  Stay low is the tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like you have saved me four hours now, Leo, because I've seen enough where I don't  have to install it.  Yeah, I'm doing you a favor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If this makes you want to play this game, you shouldn't.  You should just go hide, because this is the most frustrating game ever.  And yet it is it is absolutely viral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Flappy Bird.
