Transcript:  This is Twig.  This Week in Google, the news show that covers all the stories about Google, the cloud, Chrome,  Android, Facebook, Twitter, publicness, privacy, and any topic really related to that.  I'm Gina Trapani and I'm filling in for Leo, who's taking a much deserved vacation.  But fear not, he'll be back next week, back into the big chair.  Actually, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, who's usually my co-host, isn't here either today.  He could make it.  The reason why I'm not freaking out though, too badly, is because I've got amazing panel  here in studio.  We've got Mr. Aaron Newcomb, host of Floss Weekly here on the TWIT Network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, thank you so much for being here today and holding down the fort in Petaluma with Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you bet. Anytime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, appreciate that.  You're a frequent guest and co-host on all about Android and Twig.  And it's very comforting to have someone I know well in the chair there on the table.  So thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You bet. Anytime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And on Skype, we've got our fantastic guest today, Mike Algin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello, Gina. I know that Jeff is not here today, so I will try to complain about Verizon  as much as I can in his absence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please do. We need that.  We need that. Mike is a freelance tech writer, Google Plus user extraordinaire, and just  generally great guy.  Love to talk tech with both of you.  So thank you so much both for being here.  I guess we should just dive right down into it.  I think the big kind of big story this week is that Google turned 15, 15 years old, which  for an Internet company is absolutely ancient.  Yes.  They held a press event at the original garage where the company started, which I guess they  celebrate the birthday on the 27th of September.  But it's that day has kind of shifted around.  It's not clear what day they actually filed as a corporation.  But they held this event back in the original garage and announced a few updates to search  and to their PageRank algorithm.  They announced Hummingbird, which is their new kind of search algorithm following caffeine,  which I guess has been out for like a month now.  No one's really noticed.  And to celebrate, they changed the Google Doodle and the Google home page to the original  1998 version.  If you missed it like I did, you can actually Google Google in 1998 to see what that looked  like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, you were probably in middle school when Google came out, but I was actually  I actually remember it very well.  And at the time, the hot, hot search engine was Alta Vista, just was the greatest search  engine ever, Alta Vista.  And this Google thing came out and it was a research project.  It was like you had to be such a dork and nerd to even know that Google existed in the  first.  This is before the IPO and stuff like that.  And if I recall, the paper that they wrote, the engine project was actually also available  on the site originally.  So you could read Sergey and Larry's sort of philosophy about PageRank and all that  kind of stuff.  But but I actually remember when before the IPO and I remember trying it out and it was  like, wow, this is pretty good even then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember I don't remember when I first started using Google, but I do remember the  time when if you use Google, you were smart and savvy, like it was the filter that you  used, you know.  Yeah, I don't remember how I came about it.  I was just finishing college at that time.  I was not in middle school, just to be clear, in 1998.  I was probably using Mosaic at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was out of college, but I was using Yahoo as my primary search engine at that  point. Yahoo was real big.  Everything that Yahoo was doing looked great.  And then Google came out and I was like, how do you spell that again?  You know, and by the time I got it in in the browser and pulled it up, like I never turned  back. It was just like all Google from then on because it worked so well and it was so  simple to use.  You know, interestingly, the the it hasn't changed too much in the way it looks.  You would you would think, I mean, if you look at the history of other companies like  AOL or Yahoo or any of those companies, they've gone through major, major changes in the  way they look. But if you look at Google, they've kept it simple and they've kept it  looking even though the features and functionality have changed over time.  They've kept the look and feel very basic, very clean and it's simple and it's easy  to use. So I don't know.  What do you guys think about that? Is that is that a good thing?  I think it's a good thing. What do you guys think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they drop the exclamation point unlike Yahoo.  So I'm thinking Yahoo a little long to do that.  It's pretty amazing that the company never went through a major pivot.  I think that it was either Paige or Brynn who said the original idea was to make a  system so that people could order pizza online without kind of leaving their house and  that that had somehow given way to search.  But yeah, it's pretty amazing that it's always been a white page with an input box  that returned to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The most impressive thing that they've retained is the I'm feeling lucky button.  Yeah, that is that's just a goofy sort of, you know, nobody's paying attention kind of  thing that a geek would throw up there and just put a button, just, you know, roll the  dice on your search engine.  And it's still there.  You know, this is a multi gazillion dollar company and they still offer I'm feeling lucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think there's something to be I think there's something to be said for that.  I mean, it speaks to their initial bravado, if you will.  You know, they had done so much testing and they say, look, this really works better than  anything else. We're going to put this button there.  And it's still there today.  It's kind of it kind of speaks for the the solidity or the integrity of the search engine  itself to say, you know what, every time we every time you go to do a search, you know,  I'm feeling lucky more times than not, you're going to get to the page you want to get to.  So I think that speaks volumes to Google's ethos and the way that they develop their  products for the most part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's not just the existence of a button that will take you to their best  guests. It's the language on the button that is so informal and so kind of just casual  colloquial speech and hover your mouse pointer over the button.  It'll I'm feeling hungry and all this other stuff.  It's just it's.  Such a wonderful homage to their origins, and it's nice that it's still there.  I also think it's worth pointing out that as part of their celebrations, they rolled out  the new quote unquote flat design for the logo for the yeah, for the logo.  And I think it looks fantastic.  It looks great. It looks very consistent with their.  Companywide design look and feel, and I think it's fascinating that Yahoo did this  huge contest and like they made a big deal about their redesign thing and they came out.  They ended up with a logo that looks like 1998 with the drop shadow.  And I remember in the 90s, like those drop shadows and sort of like the 3D looking.  That's what everybody that was what was happening.  And that became obsolete like 10 years ago, and it's just shocking that after all of that,  they came out with such an antiquated looking. ography and logo, whereas Google just looks, you know, they retain the colors and the  idea of the original logo, but they've just flattened it and made it 2013.  I really like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's interesting now to look at to look at Google and you know what they are now as a  company. They're a huge company.  They've got billions of dollars in the bank.  They've got this set of core products and this huge business in advertising with lots of  money in the bank.  And they've in a way they're sort of turning themselves into this like moonshot company  who's trying, you know, big audacious things like, you know, self-driving cars and Project  Loon and and glass.  But if you rewind to 15 years ago, like their original mission, you know, which is to, I  guess, to organize the world's information, I think I think that I think that's the phrase to  organize all the world's information.  Like that was a huge moonshot, you know, back then that just seemed that just seemed insane, and  especially as the Web was just exploding.  You know, not only did Google have to make a search engine to find everything that already  existed in the Web, but it had to grow at the rate at which the Web was growing.  And then, of course, with books and things, you see them scanning.  So it's, you know, on maps and I mean, it just it just exploded.  I mean, it just, you know, of course, it was a talented team and a cohesive vision, but it  was just something really magical, not to sound like a total fangirl, although I guess this is the  show to do it on.  Is something magical happened with this company?  And a lot of things went right.  I mean, certainly a lot of things gone wrong, but more things went right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's for sure. Well, one of the you know, this whole moonshot concept, I think, is very key to  the company. Everything, even the stuff that isn't a moonshot is a moonshot.  When you, you know, when you read about, you know, in the plaques and some of these other books  about the internal meetings that they have at Google, the way they go is somebody says,  you know, we should we should sort of take a picture of everybody's house in in Mountain View  and and layer a picture of everybody's house in the world.  We're going to, you know, every time there's an idea, it's like, let's do this ridiculously  large version of that idea.  And then they do it. And that's really what what Google is all about.  They're just about massive thinking, like really, really big thinking.  And that's that's, I think, been a key to their success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't don't you guys think that that's it seems like they not lost it, but it seems like that they  kind of declined in that aspect, the moonshot aspect until, you know, Larry came came on as.  Do you guys agree? I mean, it seems like with Larry now, everything's like, OK, let's focus on these  these core things and then come up with these the subset of really big ideas like Google Glass and  some other ones, right. And self-driving cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they've jettisoned the little ideas that, for example, Google Reader, which I think was a  huge mistake for them to get rid of specifically because some of the heaviest users are  influencers. So I think it's a bad PR move for them to get rid of Reader.  They should just sustained it forever because the kinds of people who are heavy reader users are going  to be very active people online, very influential.  But that's a that's a that's that is not a moonshot big thinking type of project.  It's an RSS reader. It was the best one, but it was just an RSS reader.  Whereas if you look at something like Maps, no, they they're they're they're not necessarily going to  launch any new project as huge as Maps.  But look at what they've done with Maps itself.  The whole ground truth concept of this is creating a major, you know, the matrix inside this mapping  thing where they actually 3D map every inch of the Earth's surface in a way that gets high resolution.  The more people use it and the more activity there is around it, that is a huge undertaking that, you  know, if somebody told me, you know, 15 years ago that somebody wanted to do what Google has actually  already done, I'd say you're nuts.  That's just simply not conceivably possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's true. It is true.  So happy birthday, Google.  Yeah, happy birthday, Google.  I hope that I hope that Google can continue to build products that people need, you know, that people  don't know that they need, but do need desperately on the Web the way that they did with search.  Now, I remember back in the day thinking if you would ask me before I started using Google, you know,  in the early 2000s, do I do you need a new search engine?  I would have been like, no, AltaVista is fine.  Yahoo's fine. Right.  Until I started using Google and was like, oh, this is this is amazing.  Right. But, you know, I think in a lot of ways, like people users need, particularly like global  Internet users needs are maybe moving, moving past or evolving to things in addition to Web search.  And I want to see I hope that Google can continue to to deliver on those things.  And so and actually, Mike, this is kind of a controversial statement, especially with you here,  because you make such good use of it.  But, you know, a lot of people would say that Google Plus, which is, you know, Google's move into social,  you know, looking at, I think, you know, the threats or the what was going on with Facebook and kind of  coming with their own social product that, you know, maybe hasn't seen.  I know, I know. You can kick me when I say this hasn't seen the uptake maybe that, you know, that a  Facebook or Twitter has seen hasn't seen that sort of hockey stick growth, hasn't gotten great reviews  and the way that they're integrating social across other products.  I actually think that the way that they're integrating Google Plus across their products,  particularly in communities that already existed like YouTube, is a really good thing for everyone.  And I think it's kind of happening slowly and that there's some backlash, particularly when they're, you  know, moving Google Plus into an existing community like YouTube, where people are used to their old tools  and now they have to deal with a new tool.  But but, you know, I don't Google's never said this, but I don't know that Google Plus was maybe the  instantaneous success or maybe the success that they that they wanted to be right away.  I don't know. You know, Mike, you use you over two million encirclers.  I don't even know what the term is.  Followers, I guess, on Google Plus and you and you.  And it's your primary writing tool and you use it for everything, not just writing, but hangouts and all those things.  And that's my blog.  That's everything.  Yeah. Yeah. And you see the product as a huge success.  I mean, you've said straight up that it's quantifiably the best social network out there.  And that's why you spend your time on it.  Do you find that your family and friends, though, are also there or did you find a new audience on Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They are not there. And and that is the single biggest problem with it is that the thing that people do on Facebook,  which is, you know, my old high school friends, my college friends, my family, my extended family,  you know, my coworkers, my former coworkers, all on Facebook and that activity of following what people are doing  and sharing their lives and it's all personal.  And I know all those people is very, very compelling to a huge number of people.  And that's why if you look at Facebook's user, you know, the amount that people use it is huge.  People spend hours and hours and hours on Facebook.  It's a very, very compelling thing that's happening on Facebook.  And to a certain extent, the reason for that is Facebook was the big social network at the moment when everybody got on social network.  For a long time, social networking was and Facebook itself was just college.  You know, originally it was just Harvard. That was just Ivy League.  Then it was just colleges. Then the high school kids came along.  And then there was appointed, which were, you know, those people's parents and grandparents.  And everybody got on a Facebook. And at that moment, it's like a game of musical chairs.  There was one chair and everybody sat down on the Facebook chair.  And now that now that they've they have what Facebook has, what I call a monopoly on everybody,  everybody's on Facebook because everybody's on Facebook.  And that's the only reason everybody's on Facebook.  And so, you know, for for something like Google Plus to come along to, you know,  Google Plus has many things that Facebook is not.  But one of the things Google Plus is, is it's also a version, you know, a type of Facebook.  You know, it's one of its many hats that it wears is that it's Google's Facebook.  And in that sense, it's really a lousy place to have that Facebook experience  where you interact with everybody you know, because everybody you know, isn't there.  I mean, that's that's very clear. Now, that's that that's a specific the thing that  is very interesting in this context.  Two things that are interesting about it around the world.  The whole Facebook thing is less of a phenomenon.  Like, for example, in the Middle East, Africa and a lot of other countries,  the whole interact with your existing the people you know is not as important  as meeting new people and interacting with those people.  And so Google is you see the high numbers on Google.  And you're like, well, how could it be that high?  Like, you know, and the reason is, it's kind of more international.  It's been more quickly accepted.  And one of the reasons it's more accepted internationally is that Google has these  programs where you can use Google Plus for free.  You know, it's not counted against your minutes in India and other countries.  A bunch of other reasons like that.  But the problem is that for Facebook and I'm predicting that Google will surpass  Facebook in active users in about the end of next year.  So in about, you know, a little more than a year from now.  And that after that, Facebook will sort of slide into my space land.  Part of the reason for that is that once Facebook loses this sort of like everybody's  this is the only place where everybody is, they got nothing.  They have nothing. They have a horrible interface.  They the ads are intrusive.  The security is problematic.  Nobody trusts them.  They really have a lot working against them.  And once they lose that monopoly on everybody, they're done.  And whereas Google Plus is very slowly gaining the monopoly on everybody.  Kids are leaving Facebook because they're tired of being spied on and sort of  interacting so much so publicly with their extended relatives.  And so they're looking for the anonymous sources of social networking like  Tumblr and so on.  And Google Plus happens to be a fantastic place to do that kind of social  networking as well.  So so I really believe in the long game for Google Plus.  I think that, you know, within three years or four years, it'll pretty much be the  only major all purpose social network that matters.  There'll be lots of always be lots of little tiny ones.  But but I think that the changing of the guard is pretty much inevitable unless  something crazy weird happens.  But yeah, I mean, but but it's it's absolutely true that right now Facebook is  a much better Facebook than Google Plus is.  Google Plus is a better Twitter than Twitter.  And I could go on and on without their social networks.  It's a better path than path.  But that thing with like the high school friends, Facebook doesn't Google Plus  doesn't have that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's also I find it's easier to start with Google Plus.  And Mike, you're a big I follow your method of posting from Google Plus out to  Facebook and Twitter.  So thank you very much for that.  But I find that it's a great place to start.  You know, you post in Google Plus things automatically for me anyway, things  automatically get posted to Facebook and Twitter.  If people want to follow me there, they can.  But but I never go to Facebook or Twitter.  You know, Gina, like when you and other people start talking about, oh, Twitter's  doing this, do you have this app?  I'm like clueless. Right.  I use the Web interface sometimes if someone retweets something I say or  something like that, maybe I want to see who that is.  But I hardly ever go there.  And right now, I'm fairly comfortable having the separate worlds of like, you  know, family and friends are on Facebook and and every, you know, every everything  else is kind of on Google Plus.  It makes it really it's like it's in a nice container right now.  I mean, it'll be great when they can come over.  And luckily, with Google Plus, the mechanisms are there to filter out or just  look at this circle versus this circle and things like that.  It makes it really easy.  But right now, I'm kind of comfortable.  It's like, yeah, I go to Google Plus.  I can I can follow all the discussions on Google, Android, open source, making stuff.  And I don't really care where those people are coming from, whether they're  friends, whether I know them.  I'm just looking for interesting ideas at that point.  And so we'll see.  I mean, for me, the other thing about Google Plus is Google's done a very good job,  it seems like, of tailoring the discussions that I see on my home page so that it is  the things I'm most interested in.  Unlike Facebook, when I go to Facebook, it's a blah like someone threw up all over  the page. Here's all the stuff that everybody's talking about.  But on Google Plus, it seems like they're doing a really good job tailoring the  discussion to what I'm interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they have to do that because really, Google is all about where where it's all  going. And Gina, you're a Google Glass user as I am.  And you see that Google Glass and the coming Google Watch and wearable computing  in general is going to be a whole different set of priorities and processes,  processes for social communication, where there has to be machine filtering,  sorting, filtering, whatever.  And you know that once you start using Google Glass, Google Glass is basically the  sort of mind meld between the user and Google Plus.  I mean, Google Plus, when you just say OK, Glass, take a picture and then hit share,  off it goes to Google Plus.  And then when there's a message, it sort of automatically comes in.  And of course, there'll be apps for all the social networks and so on.  But really, I think Google Glass is the first glimpse we have into this the coming  world where Google Plus is central simply because it's the central place where you  interact with all your Google stuff.  And there's going to be further integration.  We've had a recent integration with YouTube.  I think there'll be a point at which YouTube dot com will just redirect you to  Google Plus and video and all that stuff will happen right in YouTube.  I think we're coming very close to a point where bloggers on blogger dot com, where  there would be no distinction for those between a public post on Google Plus and  posting on their blog.  In other words, you can post either on Blogger or Google Plus.  And no matter which one you post on, it shows up in the other.  It's the same set of comments, except on Blogger you have your little design and  on Google Plus you don't.  You know, those kinds of deep integrations, it'll get to the point where, you know,  it's just to use Google will be to use Google Plus and it will be the best place,  best thing to use because of those integrations.  So Google Plus as glue is a super compelling idea that Google is completely focused on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, for me, it is those services and those integrations.  I use Google Plus because I have instant upload enabled on my Android device.  The Android integration alone is huge.  I sign in with Google a lot more because those buttons are just in my apps.  I use instant upload.  I want to embed comments on my blog and I'm just going to use a Google Plus because  Google Plus has great commenting and threading.  So even though I'm not necessarily going to plus dot google dot com and composing a post  very often, I agree that those integrations and services around Google Plus are very compelling.  I got to say, all once I enabled instant upload and it took me a while to do so.  But once I enabled it, I take tons of pictures of my daughter, the baby all the time and  all those auto features, the auto awesomes are so great.  Like, I really see the value of that.  Like, oh, OK. The problem, the reason why I don't actually write posts on Google Plus  and particularly like the way you outline, like I'm doing a good post, you get a great  high res photo, use formatting like bold, italic, include links, make it kind of a  compelling post. It looks a lot like a blog post.  But see, the reason why I use social networks, I use Twitter particularly, is because I  don't have to do any of that work. Right.  Like, I can just type a few a few words and put a link and I'm done.  And everyone's tweets are the same.  I mean, you look at your Google Plus page and you've obviously put a lot of time and  effort and it's finding images and writing the right teasers and and creating headlines.  And to me, I'm kind of like, well, why wouldn't I just do that on my own site?  Like, at one point, you know, at one point, you know, it feels like a lot of work.  It feels like more work. It doesn't feel as frictionless as I guess is the word that  Zuck would use as maybe some of the other some of the other places.  But I think that's just a matter of, you know, I mean, I think it's just a matter of  like what you're looking for, what you want to do.  You know, if Google Plus is something like it just collects all the things I plus one  and helps me do something useful with them, then fine.  If it's a place where I'm just going to auto, you know, instant upload my photos and  do cool things with them and then let me share the, you know, the friends and family  that are on there. The thing the thing about the friends and family not being on Google  Plus, though, you know, Google Plus has a user acquisition problem.  And like I hear that you're saying that people don't join Google Plus because their  friends aren't there, but their friends aren't there because no one's joining Google  Plus. I mean, it really is kind of a chicken and egg problem.  And we've seen networks like Instagram and Snapchat and Path even have these like huge,  you know, growth rates, you know, very quickly for small startups.  Of course, we have different expectations for a big company like Google than we do for  small startups. But we've seen, you know, huge user user spikes happen very quickly.  And that just didn't quite happen with Google Plus.  I think that there is a user acquisition problem.  And I don't know if that's if it's about the complexity.  I don't know if there's too many different messages around what Google Plus is.  Is it hangouts? Is it comments?  You know, what is it?  But but I do think that Google has some problems to solve there.  There is a huge thing about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there is a there is a huge thing about expectations.  I mean, Snoop Dogg has more is in more circles than Path has users.  I mean, the scale is not even close.  But but the the thing about you had mentioned, you know, the ability to toss off a Twitter,  a quick Twitter thing, just, you know, here's a snarky comment off it goes, it's pretty  consequential. And whereas when you do a Google Plus post, you think I'm stepping up to the  microphone in this big room in front of people like it feels like so public and it feels so  consequential. The other part of that, of course, is on Twitter.  It's trivial to monitor a feed.  You can follow a huge number of people on this.  Everything's so short that, you know, whereas on Google Plus, you can really get bogged down  with information overload because these they can be such long posts.  But I toss off all kinds of things like for every public post that, as you point out, is  nicely formatted and all that kind of stuff.  I'll probably post two or three privately to different groups, my family, friends or  whatever. And I just toss off whatever.  I don't format anything.  And I go all the way down to life, life logging, where I post a lot of things that I don't  share with anybody except myself just to keep track of my own life.  And Google Glass really facilitates that.  Like with Google Class, you're like, oh, here's a picture.  I don't really want to share this with anybody, but I want to remember this moment.  Boom. It's up there.  Done. I don't have to think about it.  And so there's this, I think slowly.  They mentioned at Google I.O. that for every post that's public, there are two that are not public.  So lots and lots of people are using Google Plus.  And you'd never know it because you're not, you know, unless you're in their private circle,  you're not going to see their posts.  And so it's got a creeping acceptance factor that I think is more than what appears at first.  The other point I want to make is that I think that people have trouble understanding the  actual, the magnitude of how much is posted there.  I try to post things that are very timely.  You know, if it's a bunch of people have posted something, some news or, you know,  about some gadget or something like that, I'm not going to do another post.  I might share or I might not.  And so what I do before I post anything is I go and I search Google Plus to see,  you know, get my finger on the pulse of how much this has already been posted.  And in the first year or so, it was very often that, oh, nobody's posted on this.  I'm going to be the first to post on this.  Now that never happens.  I'll have something that I think is the most bleeding edge information.  And I'll do a search and there's like 400 posts on it already.  I mean, it's just, if you look underneath the surface,  there's so much activity on Google Plus.  It's just monstrous.  So you have to, you know, part of it is the circle limitations.  Like if you could circle 10,000 people, you know, it would just be completely overwhelming.  But, you know, I think there's more going on than us tech pundits really realize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so, too.  In fact, like Cabo Zone and the IRC was saying that he couldn't be a photographer  without Google Plus because of the interaction that he has there with other photographers.  The communities aspect of Google Plus, he says he learns tips, tricks,  hooking up with people for photo hunts or photo walks.  Sounds like he really learned about photography from Google Plus because of the community  and the way it's so easy to find other people that have the same opinions and things like that.  So I mean, it seems like just getting to your point of what you were saying, Mike, about  the other aspects of Google Plus beyond just what you might see or what you might think,  how you might think people are using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Jean.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  You had mentioned the benefit of easy auto uploading.  You know, it's really worth doing.  I mean, I think you were at Google.  I know you were at last year's Google I.O.  I'm pretty sure you were at this year's as well.  I was, too, when they rolled out all the photo magic stuff.  Yep.  That's one of those things that you really have to kind of pause and go, wow, this is  just like beyond any sci-fi people didn't even predict this.  I mean, not only does the picture go up automatically and then Google decides which are the best  pictures and says, you know, you can look at all your pictures you want, but here's the good ones,  you know, which is kind of the mental process you do anyway when you take a gazillion pictures.  Then it takes those and it puts little subtle, you know, essentially Photoshop  improvements on them, which are always reversible.  It does something like people talk about Auto Awesome and they always talk about the  automated GIF, but Auto Awesome does several things.  And one of the craziest things that it does did this for me recently.  I went to a family wedding and at family weddings, everybody's posing, everybody lines up and  smiles when you take a picture, you know, and I have this really fast Canon, right?  So I take, you know, 10 pictures as easily as I take one.  And, you know, it was taken.  It was doing that thing where there's a picture that's the best picture except one person was  blinking. And so Google will take, will create another picture, grab the open eyes from that  person, from another picture and put it in there so that you have one picture that never happened  where everybody's smiling, everybody's got their eyes open.  And it just does that subtly.  And so if you see a shot like that, that has the little like Magic Pixie Dust logo,  you know, icon thing in the corner of the picture,  it's actually, I mean, this is just crazy that it does that.  And it's all, this is like, this is before you touch anything.  It's already doing that.  It's just crazy.  It makes my photos delightful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like if I look up through my photos on my phone, I see a lot of blurry stuff.  I see a lot of bad pictures and that one good picture.  But if I go on Google+, and I think it defaults to just your highlights, so it always shows me  my best pictures and the collages and the gifts.  And I didn't realize he was doing that open eye thing.  I mean, I always am just like, oh yeah, like, I'm going to be like,  I always feel happy looking at my photos.  And that's all stuff that I would do if I had taken the time to do it.  But it was always such a drag and I often didn't do it.  So yeah, that is the photo stuff really.  They did really hit a home run with that.  And I don't think they get nearly as much credit for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And guess what, Gina, you're life logging.  You probably post only a minority of your photos publicly or even privately.  But those photos are there.  And that's a visual diary of your life in reverse chronological order that is just priceless  and private.  You're actually life logging and probably never intended to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Google would have made a huge mistake if they had done something like,  we're going to automatically share.  If you want to use the auto upload, we're automatically going to post that  in your circles or something or whoever's following you.  I mean, I think that there was a moment there where,  I don't know if it was ever even thought about,  but I mean, if they had done some of those things,  like they take a very, when they develop a new feature,  for the most part, it seems like they take a very good approach in that,  hey, look, we're going to automatically update your photos,  but we're not going to post those, make those public.  You get to go in and choose which ones you want to make public  or choose which ones you can take off the autocorrect and the auto magic,  whatever it is.  It seems like they're making wise decisions, which I think is another thing  that they seem to be doing well.  The question I want to ask you guys, as long as we're on this topic,  and then I want to hear about Hummingbird because I think Gina mentioned that earlier.  The question I want to ask you guys is, what's the prediction?  What would be the feature or maybe it's not a feature, maybe it's something else  that puts, as far as the US is concerned, at least puts Google Plus over the top.  Mike, you mentioned in other countries, they give you free access  if you're coming in from a Google, an Android operating system or something.  I mean, what's that one feature?  What do we think?  What's the prediction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's easy.  When Google really opens it up to developers and enables developers to build stuff based on Google  for real, Google Plus for real, that's going to be killer.  It's going to open up, it's going to launch a thousand startups that are going to do crazy,  good stuff.  I mean, it's crazy to think that to this day, Google Plus is pretty closed.  I mean, developers are pretty much locked out and I just think that's just going to be  a singularity where everything changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they've been pretty measured in the access that developers have.  You certainly have all the Google Play services things on Android have Google Plus integration,  you have sign in with Google, but there's still the API, it's read only.  And in fact, this was the question I was going to ask you guys earlier, is that Aaron,  you said something like, oh, Mike, I use your system for posting starting on Google Plus,  but then syndicating that out to Facebook and Twitter.  I still don't know how to do that.  It still doesn't seem that obvious.  To me, the killer feature, and this is something that I feel like just won't happen because of  licensing or political or competition reasons, is for these networks to talk to one another more  freely and for me to be able to very easily post to all of them, but customize the message.  I don't want to do Plus Mike Elgin on Twitter, that looks crazy.  I don't want to do at Mike Elgin on, it just looks weird.  And I hate when I see people just clearly blindly posting the same thing across,  but I would like for it to be easier when I have something I want to share,  to be able to broadcast it to my networks in a way that makes it native to that network.  I think every network has its own culture and its own ways of addressing other people  and hashtags and things, although we are starting to see some convergence across those things.  We're seeing hashtags supported across all the networks now.  But yes, better integration across these products and yeah, better access to these APIs.  We're seeing things with Game Center too.  Google is slowly, slowly opening up to developers and making Plus a platform with richer APIs,  but it's been slow and it feels very measured.  It feels very much like this is only what Google wants developers to do with this and nothing else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's Vic Indotra really who's behind this.  He is so intends to not blow it, because I think Google blew it with Buzz,  with almost every or every prior social site.  They screwed it up in some fundamental way.  I think Google is just above all, they just don't want to screw it up.  They know they have a great thing going and they just want to be very conservative  and move forward very conservatively and just get it right.  I would like to see them move faster personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The privacy issue that you brought up, Aaron, about the default being not sharing.  Google learned some hard lessons, particularly around privacy when it came to Buzz.  When I instant upload 100 photos and I don't share any of those and they're  just sitting on Google servers, that only costs Google money.  I'm not sharing that with anyone.  They get information about me, which makes me a little bit more valuable based on the photos.  We know that they know what is contained in the photos.  They know if it's flowers or babies or chocolate or whatever.  They get more information about me, but if I'm not sharing to others,  it's less valuable to them.  Right?  But they made that decision that should be private.  That was one of my first concerns about Glass.  It was like, when I take a picture, does this mean this is automatically  going to go out to my circle?  It's like, no, that's the right decision.  I think they learned those lessons with Buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is so easy to do.  Have you posted anything accidentally?  It's extremely easy to do.  You go share and it just starts happening and they give you like three seconds.  Half a second to cancel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin Purdy showed his Glass to a friend of his who took a photo of himself looking in a mirror  and then accidentally shared it.  And the caption was, I think I just accidentally shared something.  I've actually shared twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've shared a public post that said nothing except through Glass with a hashtag.  Just by handling the Glass, just like by taking it out of my backpack or whatever.  And then I find out later that they essentially did the Google Glass equivalent of butt dialing.  It's kind of funny, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're often butt pictures because I will lay Glass down on a tabletop and sort of walk away  and it's the waist level.  Upside down, right?  Please don't auto share a picture of somebody's butt in my office, please.  Especially not mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And don't generate a hashtag, please.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's also that.  Exactly.  So I wanted to ask you guys real quick, unless, only if it's really complicated.  In summary, what do you guys are using a particular tool to post across,  to post to Google Plus and then Facebook and Twitter?  Or is there a particular client or are you doing copy and paste?  Is there an extension?  How are you doing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are two tools that I think are extremely useful.  One is Friends Plus Me.  So I use Friends Plus Me to auto post to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.  And if you look at my Facebook stream with a mobile device, it looks perfect.  It just looks like I posted on Facebook.  If you look on the web, it's a funky, like tiny little thumbnail thing and it's not.  But the whole post is there.  And there's a link back to Google Plus, which is the most important thing to me,  because I want to have one conversation and not a bunch of conversations.  Twitter is perfect.  Except for this whole at and plus thing.  But I do a headline and then I do other stuff.  Friends Plus Me takes the headline.  It makes that the tweet and then puts a shortened link,  which goes back to the full post on Google Plus.  It's perfect.  And LinkedIn is perfect.  So Friends Plus Me is really, really good.  And they now support groups.  They now support groups on LinkedIn and Facebook.  So you can do that flexibly.  And then there's also something called Do Share, which is it's a little funky.  And they're struggling against the fact that they don't have right API access to Google Plus.  But it enables you to save posts and to schedule them.  So you can have posts going out every hour or whatever on a schedule.  It works 95% of the time beautifully.  There's a couple of little things you learn to deal with some of the idiosyncrasies of it.  But that's another great tool for people who would like to do some of the things it can do.  I used to use Manage Flitter, but Friends Plus Me is better for posting from Google Plus automatically  to Twitter and Facebook.  So I use Friends Plus Me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you said Do Share is a Chrome plugin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a Chrome plugin.  Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gotcha.  It seems like these tools are sort of rapidly evolving.  And I figured that whatever you're using might be changing a little bit  because things are changing.  And it seems like to programmatically post something in the language of a particular  network is kind of hard.  Although I like the idea that it's just taking the headline and then shortening a link to your  Google Plus post.  And so that's the canonical location of the thing that you put up.  I like that a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can also generate numerous tools for generating an RSS feed from your public posts.  And once you have an RSS feed, you can, like for example, I generate an email newsletter  from my Google Plus posts.  It's on hiatus right now, but I did it for about a year and something.  And I'm going to be doing it again.  But basically, that's pretty cool.  Once you have RSS, you can do lots of things with that.  So that's another sort of, you know, all of these things are kind of work-around-ish.  They're not exactly what you want.  But, you know, they exist and they can be very, very helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I always still come back to that question of like, well, if I'm going to do all  this work to make it work on Google Plus, why wouldn't I just write on my own site and my own  domain, you know, using a tool that I own or, you know, data that I own and do this that way?  But at the same time, like, I'm just not going to set up services.  You know, it's the same reason why I use Gmail versus running my own IMAP server, you know,  which I did for years is like the time that I would have to spend to do the maintenance and  have it work as well as Gmail does is just not worth it to me.  And for something particularly like the photo stuff, you know, I'm just never I'm just not  going to do that stuff manually and Bacasa.  I'm not going to write the scripts, the software to do it myself, you know, for me automatically.  So it's just easier.  So I get it.  But it does sound like you like you spent a lot of time kind of working around and using  different tools.  I mean, you're definitely pushing the edge of the platform and kind of doing all the  hacks that you need to do to make it work for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the RSS thing that was that took a bit of figuring out.  It took me a day to figure that out a long time ago.  And friends plus me has to be set up.  But in both of those cases, once it's set up, it's you're done.  You don't touch it.  You don't think about it.  It just works.  And, you know, in perpetuity, there's just no.  Oh, oh, do share.  You go in and interact with the with the site itself or the, you know, the plugin itself  every time.  But, you know, it's it's it can be worth it.  But again, as you were implying, you know, for most people, you're going to have a Google  password, like something that's going to like required.  So you have a Google password and you're probably going to want to do certain things  and of Google.  So you're going to have a Google Plus account.  OK, you you kind of have to have a Google Plus account almost for some people.  And since you have a Google Plus account, you don't really need a Facebook account if  you have these tools that auto post.  You know, it's not ideal to post through these things, but it's better than wasting  your time on Facebook.  And and so it's really this is what Google is going to keep doing.  They're going to keep adding these things.  You know, the they've already announced that Google Plus is going to be the social network  for their whole new Android gaming universe.  Right.  Right.  And if that gets huge, then we're going to see, you know, so, you know, one by one,  they're going to use Google Plus to be the basic social platform for all of the stuff  that they do.  So to use Google will be to use Google Plus.  And since you're using Google Plus for one thing, you might as well use it for the other  thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, they're clearly committed to it as a platform going forward.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they held that 15th birthday press event at the old at the old garage, the original  garage where the company started.  And it made me a little nervous, you know, the home page thing and the garage thing made  me a little nervous because I think, you know, looking to the past and getting nostalgic  is one thing.  And I think that that's something that big companies kind of do a lot, especially when  they're struggling with their big company-ness is to sort of get nostalgic and sort of make,  you know, kind of the old days, kind of this golden era or something.  I always want to I'd rather much I'd much rather hear about what the future is.  But happily, Google did make a lot of a lot of a lot of kind of small announcements about  changes that they've made, particularly to search at that event.  They have added in search results, particularly kind of sticking to the core product there.  They've added comparisons and filters into the knowledge graph.  So if you search for something like this example, they gave you search for impressionist artists,  you'll get this kind of banner across the top of the page.  And then you can filter by different kinds of kinds of artists.  So expressionist, cubist, modernist, realist, which is kind of nice.  So it's like this is again, Google, Jeff, if Jeff Jarvis was here, he would say that they're  trying to intuit your intent.  Another another thing that you do that they do knowledge graph comparison.  So if you wanted to know what the fat content was of olive oil versus butter,  if you search for olive olive oil versus butter, you would see the knowledge graph  tables, which would normally show up on the on the on the right hand side,  show up right there at the top of the search search results and kind of compare  the two and Chad is bringing them up.  Yeah, right there.  Thanks, Chad.  Yeah, so you can see how many grams of fat or an olive oil versus butter,  the number of calories, which is really nice.  So Google is just trying to get really smart about what you're looking for.  Also, continuing on a theme that they talked about at I.O. is this idea that everybody  uses different devices and that you should be able to get the same information across  your devices and the devices should kind of be aware of one another.  The next couple of weeks, new version of the Google search app is launching on iPhone and  iPad. And so you'll get notifications across your devices.  So if you do on your Nexus seven, if you say, OK, Google, you know, remind me to buy olive  oil at Safeway. When you walk in the store with your iPhone, you'll get a push notification  to get olive oil, which is which is really nice.  And this is something that we all those of us who are using Android have had for a while.  But now that it's on I.O.S., you can see, see, get the benefits across devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can see, Gina, in both of those cases, in both the cases of the of the  knowledge based comparison and of the sort of the the information falling around out of these  are very wearable computing centric ideas. And it's all about your invisible friend.  It's all about Google Voice Search, Google Now. And it's and it's going to get to the point where  you just talk and you don't care which device is listening. Is it your car? Is it your house?  Is it your TV? Is it your phone? Is your tablet? Your computer? Is your watch? Is your glass?  You won't care. You just say, I want to know this information or remind me to do X, Y, Z.  And it won't care which device you won't care which device and it won't care which device  it tells you about the result later. Right. So it's really this it's really going to be this  sort of invisible friend that is just ubiquitous, just just ambient. And and all of their search  stuff is sort of being re-engineered to make that possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And they're converging upon that that that one design, the the the very mobile touch friendly,  the car design. Yeah. The Google Now car design, the glass design, which I imagine is going to be  the the watch design, which is a really great UI. It works across a lot of a lot of devices.  So we're going to get that that consistent that nice consistent design hummingbird, which is the  the code name for the new new search algorithm. Like I said, rolled out like a month ago.  And from what I understand and Aaron, let me know if I don't get this right.  Hummingbird basically lets you ask questions of Google, but it extrapolates what you mean  by the previous query. So you could say something like, where is the Eiffel Tower and how tall is it?  And it knows that it was referring to the Eiffel Tower and can give you those answers.  So yeah, that it's to answer kind of long questions or line a line of questioning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. So it's a line of questioning and it's also about a more natural. So it kind of fits  in with what we were just talking about a more natural way to to say these things instead of,  you know, there's kind of a there's kind of like this secret code of, you know, people that are  really good at making Google work for them know how to put the search in the search bar.  And so I'll see like my kids doing searches, I'm like, no, no, no, no, put this word here  and move this there, and then put in this little, you know, minus this, and it'll get you exactly  what you want. And, you know, it seems magical, but, you know, not everyone knows how to do that.  So I think it seems like what Google is trying to do with Hummingbird is make it a more natural  conversation. And I think this also enables what they showed at Google I.O. where you can say,  you know, drive, I forget what the example was there, but, you know, some lady was trying to  drive somewhere and she's instead of saying, like, you know, drive to this address, she was like,  you know, take me home. It wasn't even like navigate or anything. It was just like,  take me home. And it knew automatically to turn on navigation and to route her to  wherever her home was. And I think that's what this is trying to get to. So I think this is  one step further in that, in that, you know, nirvana that they anticipate is that kind of like  what Mike was saying, you know, you just, you just talk out loud, kind of like the communicator from  Star Trek, the next generation, you know, you've always got a device somewhere, whether it's attached  to you or nearby, and you just say these things and it comes up. So it's there before you even  have to go to a terminal or pull out your phone. You pull out your phone, you turn it on,  that information's already there in the, in the drop down pane or something like that. That's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it seems like they're getting at here. Right, right. So it's almost kind of like there's the  death of the search operator. I mean, you know, it's like phrase search and plus, you know,  it's like salsa, but not the dance, you know, minus dance, you have to, you'd have to know all these  special codes, right? But this is, this is the smart Google, the Google that you can speak to  as if it's another human, you know, and it would, and it understands what you mean in the context  of what you've been talking about. And it knows so much about who you are. Yeah, it knows, it has  context and it knows who you are and what you're talking about. Yep. As I understand it, the, the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the, the new translate algorithms are similar to this in the sense that instead of trying to just  like do this keyword thing and, and, and sort of, you know, just you said this word, so we're going  to give you things that have that word in it. It's more like people who have all these other  criteria have done something similar. And so that's going to influence what we're doing that it's  happening and translate and so on. In fact, the Amazon's recommendations have kind of operated  on that general principle for a long, long time, where it's like, you know, give me a recommendation  for a book. And they're like, well, we see that you bought this book, that book and the other book,  and other people who like those three books also like this fourth book. And so we're going to  recommend this fourth book, you know, that kind of, that kind of thinking about search based on,  you know, again, it's just massively big data applied to search in a much more holistic way.  And I would like to say that there have been some critical, you know, snarky report that  Google turned this thing on and nobody noticed as if, if it was so great, everybody would have  noticed. But in fact, the fact that nobody noticed is precisely what's so great about it.  Something like this is built, the information behind it, the stuff that makes it good,  is built by the actions of users themselves. So like maps, like Google+, like lots of these things,  they essentially build the infrastructure, and then the actions of users make it good.  And so the fact that they flipped a switch and went to this new system, and it wasn't jarringly bad,  is almost a miracle. I mean, that's like amazing. And then as people use search more over the coming  months, you're probably likely to see search get a lot smarter. And it's not something you're just  going to notice right away. You know, the fact that you didn't notice that it was dramatically worse  right away is quite a feat of engineering, and it's likely to get much better. This is a self  learning thing. All search is, all search algorithms are, it's quality and robustness  and the fidelity of it is determined by the actions of millions and billions of users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. Yep. Well, something that we might notice, Android Police, a great site, they do this,  they do this awesome thing where they look at new APKs, new Android apps, they tear them down,  they look at the source code and try to predict new features that are coming up. And they did this  recently with the new Gmail release and found that it looks like from some XML files and other code  that ads are coming to Gmail on Android. And I'll be honest, I'm concerned about this. I haven't seen  ads done really well in a mobile app by too many people. I think if anyone's position to do it,  Google is positioned to do it, but I live in Gmail on Android. I process a lot of my email on my  phone and I'm wondering, you know, what this is going to look like. Is this going to be a banner  ad at the bottom of the page? You know, obviously in Gmail, kind of in the browser, you have the  keyword ads kind of showing up in the right hand column, but you just don't have that kind of real  estate on a touchscreen device. And I think it's really easy to accidentally tap on an ad when you  meant to tap on a reply button or something else. So I'm really interested to see how Google does  this, because I think that if they do it, if they don't do it well, I think there'll be some backlash  from users about, you know, them kind of being an advertising company and affecting, you know,  I think what's a really core experience to Android. Do you guys use Gmail on Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I live in it as well. I've got multiple email accounts and so they're all set up on my  phone. So it's really easy for me to go back and forth amongst the four or five Gmail accounts that  I have. Don't ask me why I do that. It's a long story, but you know, I would hate to see, I'm  looking at my phone right now. You're right about the real estate. I mean, they added those icons  not too long ago, which takes up some of the real estate from being able to see what the message is  about. I wasn't too thrilled about that because most of the time it just displays like the first  letter of the person's name. I found the same thing. I think it's stupid. I wish there was an  option to turn that off. Anyway, and I'm afraid that the ads are going to end up in line, like  three email messages and then an ad, which looks like an email message. I mean, that's my biggest  fear is if that happens. Oh man, that's going to be so disappointing. If it's a little black bar  at the bottom or the other option might be, you know how they added recently, they added the  view where you can have social and promotions. And I think there's a couple other, like that  correspond to the tabs that you have in the web view. So that could be an option too, where they  have one that says ads for people that want to see them. I don't know. I'm just trying to think  of where this, because I got the new update and I'm not getting any ads yet. So that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hard to imagine how this could be good. You know, it's like, well, they could just drop in  the ads as if they're email messages as they're doing on in the browser version. And that sucks.  Or they could just take up one third of the screen and that sucks. Or they could, you know,  they'd like, there's no good way to do that. However, having said that the only way that this  is going to be good is if the ads are so relevant and so desirable that you want them no matter what  form they come in. The problem with them is, you know, we assume that ads are going to be something  we don't want, but if they can figure out how to use, you know, it's not a mobile device. They can  really finally figure out how to use location and context and what they know about you on other  services to give you exactly what you want. Factor to essentially give you search results  before you do the search. That would be acceptable. Beyond that, it's not going to be popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Probably. So, so like, you know, in Gina's example of where she in your example, Mike,  of where you upload a photo, but you don't share it. And Google has maybe the location information.  Maybe you get an email message saying, Hey, we realize you're at such and such the corner  of such and such intersection. By the way, this pizza place is handing is giving you a free slice  of pizza if you buy another one or something like that. And it would appear in Gmail as opposed to  because I may not have maps open, but I'll get that notification if I get a new email message. So  it could be good. It could be good in that sense. But I think yeah, you're right. I'm trending more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  towards, Oh, this sounds like a disaster. Yeah, we see that we see Gina that you're uploading a lot  of pictures of a baby and therefore you're probably a good stiff drink. Here's a bar around the corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right. Yeah, but don't go to the don't go to the butt picture analogy because then it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  gets all crazy. It gets bad bad. Some of the strings that Android please found in the XML  were will not save add as message will save add as message add dismissed. So it looks like maybe,  you know, dismissed makes it makes me think that it'll show up maybe as some sort of toast  or maybe, you know, I've sent a message on Gmail and it says message sent. By the way,  you mentioned something about credit cards. Amex has a 10% discount going on. You just go dismiss,  you know, whatever, you know, I don't know, it'll be interesting to see. It'll be interesting to see  how they how they handle it. I hope I hope that it's subtle and relevant and good better than  I've seen most ads. I actually think Foursquare is the only mobile app I use that has has done  ads of promotions that don't bug me and have actually piqued my interest enough to take  advantage. Amex had a had kind of a special thing going on with Foursquare. And now if you check  into a place with Foursquare, it'll say like, welcome, you know, your friends so and so and so  and so have been here, by the way, like save money on whatever, you know, to be some sort of like  clearly marked ad. And it's just like, okay, dismiss. I would have seen that anyway. And it  doesn't it doesn't interrupt the user flow so much. It's just that email so so personal.  And, you know, the ads don't bother me in the web browser. But again, you know, you've got so much  space there. Moving into the physical world of receiving stuff, Google acquired Buffer Box,  which is a Y Combinator company that puts up kind of, I guess they're little just mailboxes  in public places like coffee shops and such. And so you can order from your favorite retailers and  have them delivered to your Buffer Box and then you can go pick it up at your Buffer Box. Well,  it was a Canadian company and I guess the Buffer Boxes were only available in Toronto. Well,  Google is expanding their pilot to San Francisco. And that's that's happening now. And it looks  pretty cool. I'm not I'm not totally sure how different this is from just like having a private  mailbox. And I know that Amazon has like an Amazon Locker service as well, which I think is  kind of a similar thing. But the problem it's trying to solve is just like, hey, you're not home,  you're at work and you had a package delivered. But this is a safe, secure place where a package  can be delivered and you get a push notification when it has been. Yeah, the difference between

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that and like a PO Box or whatever is that it's you don't if you don't have a package,  you don't have an empty box. They you just did for the remain for the direction of when you have  a package. It's almost like putting your luggage at the train station and you take the key. And  then when you go back to get your luggage, you leave the key in there and somebody else uses  it later. And Amazon's Locker service, this is clearly a response to Amazon's locker service,  is not doing so well. I think that out of a lot of 7-elevens, 7-eleven is one of the  companies that's working with Buffer Box to try this. But it just seems like a kind of a funky  business for Google to be in. I just don't see this succeeding. Having said that, there is an  interesting trend that I wrote about last weekend of every test, everything in San Francisco,  and including Google on other things too, that Google's new delivery service, which just recently  went into the Bay Area, started in San Francisco. But there's a long list of services you can only  get in the city of San Francisco. And this this Buffer Box thing is that when they tested another  city, the second city is San Francisco. San Francisco is always the first or the second city  to get these cool services. And if you add them up, you're like, wow, man, I'm moving to San  Francisco. This place, it's, this is some cool stuff. Having said that, this looks weird. You  know, they're in a bunch of coffee shops and stuff. Who wants to pick up a package in a coffee shop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they also launched a local shopping delivery service in San Francisco as well. So it sort of  makes sense that these two things would be launched hand in hand. Aaron, have you tried,  have you tried any of these new services? And I guess Petaluma is not, you guys are a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  little far far out. Yeah, I'm too far from from San Francisco to make use of this. And it really  doesn't appeal to me. Maybe I'm not the target audience. I guess I'm, you know, it seems like,  what are they going to do above and beyond what like the UPS stored already does and things like  that? Right. You know, I think what Mike said about maybe the time more of a timeshare thing  where you only pay for the time that they're holding a package for you, that kind of makes  sense. They could compete in that angle. But I don't know. I mean, I was intrigued with the  whole Amazon locker thing. I thought that was interesting. You know, I guess I'm more interested  in improving delivery services so that I can get things faster. So if there's some way to use this  and also get like same day shipping to these locations or something, I mean, that might be  interesting, but I don't I don't see that as being part of this. So. Right. Yep. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see. What else do we have going on here? This is irrelevant. Also in lieu of the 15th  anniversary. Pew survey says that 56% of internet users Google themselves. See, I have an excuse to  Google myself often. We do it almost every week on the show just to try out new features. So it  doesn't feel like too much of an ego of indulgence. But yeah, that's more than half of adults. This is  an article that reports a search engine land. And in fact, men search themselves 58% of the time,  women 54% of the time. And they've got also further breakdown by by race and age. Of course, the  younger you are, the more likely you are to Google yourself. Education and household income. Kind of  interesting. I mean, I think I mean, not unexpected. I guess we all are concerned about, you know, how  people what people are seeing when they try to find information about us and, you know, what  information about us is out there. I'll admit I had a Google alert set up for my name there for a  while. Like get it get it get an email whenever you know a new web page on the web showed up with  what with my name in it. It was usually stuff that maybe go like, oh, it was mostly mostly useful.  I wonder, I wonder if Google could offer more, you know, go again, going into the kind of social  part of it, like if Google could offer more better tools, and I guess Google Plus really is the  solution to this for sort of creating your presence online and managing it and making it,  you know, putting yourself, you know, putting the content out there that you want people to see.  And I guess that's exactly what Google Plus really is. Yeah, I mean, what you're talking about is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  reputation management. And there are a couple of reasons to do that. Like if you're a professional  like like us, you know, you're and you're sort of in the public sphere in some way, you want to see  if somebody's out there trashing you if somebody's committing libel or whatever, or if somebody's  stealing your content or stealing your name. You know, that's that's all good to know. I think  younger people are curious. I mean, there are lots and lots of people who they search their name,  and there's nothing but a Facebook thumbnail picture of themselves. And that's all they're  going to find. But you know, when they do pop up, it's it's like pretty cool. So you know, it's  sign of the times and why not? I mean, you've mentioned, Gina, that you as curious about this,  that you had a Google alert. Did you get rid of it? Yeah, you know, I did wind up getting rid of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  at some point, because it just it wasn't it didn't feel complete. And it only came once in a while.  And I just I kind of went through an inbox purge where I was like just shutting down any, you know,  as many emails that came to me automatically as possible. And I just felt like, you know what,  this will I'll find these things as they come up or people tell me about them. That's fine.  And honestly, it did not feel complete. Google alerts felt really good and timely. And I would  get, you know, big digest really often a couple of years ago, but it seems like it's kind of  gone downhill. I don't know if they're just not maintaining it enough or if it's just my searches  weren't configured correctly. Do you still use Google alerts? I use it heavily. I mean, I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have hundreds of alerts. And I have a special folder in Gmail to receive them all. And once a  day, I try to slog through them. I get I get 150 or so a day or something on every imaginable topic.  I have too many like if I what things I do is if I am introduced to a new concept, and I  want to learn more about that concept, I just set up, you know, just that was related to that concept.  I guess most one of the most recent ones is reshoring their companies that are like like  Apple that are bringing their manufacturing from China back to the US or whatever. Kind of curious,  is that a trend? Is that not a trend? So I'll set up an alert, it'll throw me for a while,  and then I'll get sick of it and delete it. So I'm very fluid with it. I probably create alerts  every single day, and delete some every other day or something like that. And I certainly have  the ego ones going the ego searches going. I find it phenomenally useful. My big tip that I give  people about Google Alerts is that they're also Google Scholar Scholar Alerts, which is an entirely  separate system that searches, you know, it searches, you know, scientific journals and stuff like that.  So if you're interested in technology, so search engine technology, you want a Google alert searching  the general press and then you want another one with the same keywords searching the scholarly  press because there are a lot of papers that people are writing that are very instructive.  But I love Google Alerts and I'm scared to death that they're going to kill it someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think yeah, I wouldn't surprise me actually. That might be a sad day for you. Yeah,  yes, I heard a whole lot about it in a while. I'm really, I'm really, I'm really encouraged to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that this number of people googling themselves. And I think it's really important. I mean,  people might feel vain doing it like I'm not going to Google myself. That's so vain. It really,  you really should, especially if you're in the job market or looking for a job or, you know, people  for employers, that's probably one of the first things they do is do a Google search on your name  and you want to know what's coming up. When I was looking for a job recently, I read a story about  this guy who there was someone with the same name as him who did some horrible things. And he was  wondering why he kept getting turned down for all these jobs. And then he found out that there was  this person with the same name that was doing all these crazy things and people were thinking it was  him. And he had a heck of a time trying to go through. I think he eventually did hire one of the  reputation online places to fix this. I think they finally got it fixed. But I mean, you know,  this poor guy was searching for like over a year trying to find a job and he didn't realize this  until later. So I think it's in everyone's best interest, whether you feel, you know, like you're  like it's a good thing or not, you definitely ought to go do it just to see what pops up because  that's other people's view of you that may not know you very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Google Alert is an efficient way to do it because you don't have to go searching every  week or whatever. You can just set it up and forget about it. And if you pop up somewhere,  it'll show up in your inbox and you can see what people are saying. And, you know, I think  that they had some problems for a while and it's gotten better again. But I could be completely  wrong. And I'd be curious of what the experience is of people listening or in the chat room,  whether it's gotten better for them. I get tons of stuff. I don't know if it's comprehensive,  if there's things being missed or not. And I'd really love to know whether it's really getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  everything. Yeah, Aaron, your point about Google yourself is I was kind of joking about a feeling  like I had an excuse. It does feel vain and egotistical, but you are right. It really is  useful to see. It's like walking out of the house in the morning without kind of looking in the  mirror. And it's sort of just a reality of today's world. And especially for young people who are  looking for jobs or are applying to go into schools, plenty of potential employers and even  schools and stuff are looking at what you look like online. And pity the folks with common names

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  who get confused. Well, people should realize that nowadays companies hire  external consultancies whose specialty is to find out everything there is about you to the point where  they even friend you on Facebook or whatever. And do deep research to find out everything  there is about you. They essentially profile you, label you, categorize you, and then go back to the  prospective employer and say, okay, this person falls into the following three unemployable  categories of party animal, whatever. And I mean, this is a very, very sophisticated new industry  that's being embraced increasingly by companies. And even those that are not going pro with the big  specialized consultancies are doing a version of that in-house because it's simply so easy and so  inexpensive to do. So yeah, you really have to know what they know about you if you're looking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for a job. Yep. Yep. All right. Well, next up, we're going to do the change log. But before  we get there, Leo has time traveled from the past to the future, to the present, to the, I don't know.  He's time traveled to come say a word to us about our sponsor today, LegalZoom. Hey, Jeff. Hey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina. Don't mind me. I'm somewhere in the middle of the Adriatic, but I came back just to tell you  LegalZoom.com. LegalZoom is not a law firm, but I think they're better. There's certain things,  legal things one needs to do in life, but you don't need to spend all that money on a lawyer for.  Things like a last will and testament, incorporating your business, an LLC, trademarks,  patents. LegalZoom can help you with these legal tasks at a much more affordable cost. You get the  feeling of control, which is great too. In fact, this is how we did our LLC here way back in 2005.  And it was partly because I didn't want to spend the money. All right. It was entirely because I  didn't want to spend the money, but I do love the idea that I see the whole process. I go through it  step by step. I answer the questions. I think about it and I get the document I want. I think  there's a lot to be said for that. There's a lot of pride with starting your own new business.  If you don't protect it, you're going to regret it. I can just say that. You're at risk of losing it.  Worse, if you get sued, you're at risk of losing your personal assets. That's why you create an LLC  or corporation to protect your personal assets, to limit liability. That's what it stands for,  limited liability. So here's the deal. I want you to protect yourself. I want you to use legalzoom.com.  I want you to join the million business owners, actually over a million business owners like me,  who have used legalzoom in the last 12 years to help start their businesses. You'll save time.  You'll save a pile of money on startup costs. And they don't mention this, but I really think  the sense of control you get is great. By the way, you can get legal advice from legalzoom.  This is new. They didn't have this when I did it. They have the legalzoom legal plan. They've got  contracted relationships with attorneys in almost every state. You can see their profiles online,  unedited customer reviews, their pre-negotiated fees, so you know exactly what you're going to  pay. So you can get an attorney to give you some answers, help you decide between an LLC or a  Chapter S or a Chapter C, for instance, get a DBA. You can even form a nonprofit all just starting  at $99 at legalzoom.com. Wheels, trusts, trademarks. I love legalzoom. I think you will too. I really  feel like they're a company that is empowering people like me to live their dream. And I think  that's so great. Try it today. Legalzoom.com. All I ask when you use it, just please let them know  you heard about it on This Week in Google. Put Twig in the referral box, T-W-I-G. And as our thank  you, we'll give you 10 bucks off. How about that? Legalzoom.com. Use the offer code TWIG. Back we go  to This Week in Google. And now the changelog.  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That just makes me so happy every single time. So we've got a few different new things in the  Googleverse this week. In addition to some of the things we talked about earlier, Hummingbird and  the Knowledge Graph changes, Google's released a completely redesigned analytics app. That's a  Google Analytics app for Android. It's got a totally redesigned look and feel, ideal for tablets  and phones. You can see that clean typography and the card design that we're seeing across all Google  products. Google Analytics for Android now has new visualizations that automatically resize to fit  your screen size and your orientation. It's got a slide navigation that mirrors Google Analytics on  the web, quick access to reports, and specialized reporting for web and app views. So if you're  Google Analytics addict, you definitely want to get this update. Google also launches Web Designer.  This is a visual tool for building interactive HTML5 sites and ads. This is a desktop app  for Mac and Windows. And you can download it if you go to google.com slash web designer.  And it's available right now. Again, just Mac and Windows. And I got really excited about this  because I thought, oh, this is a web development tool where you can make websites that are super  interactive, HTML5. And then as you can see in the demo that Chad is showing us, it's this really  small part of the web. And it's actually, you can build sites with it, but it's actually built for  making ads. It was developed to allow advertisers to easily create HTML5 ads for mobile and desktop.  Until recently, Google argued advertisers didn't have the tools they needed to easily develop  content fit for today's cross-screen experiences. And Web Designer wants to be that tool. You can  also make whole sites with it, but you'll see in the demos, really it's about making  banner ads and the standard ad sizes was built right into it. Google's reverse image search  is now available in Chrome by default, no extension needed. This is in Google Chrome 31  and above, I believe. And I don't have it yet, but it's rolling out over the next few weeks.  You don't have to install intention to reverse image search. You can right click on an image  and there's an option in the menu now that says search Google for this image. So you do a reverse  image search and basically it lets you see content that's related to a specific image. So if you  search for a picture of your favorite band, you'd see search results that include similar images of  the band, web pages about the band, or even sites that include the same picture. Of course, I call  this the catfish feature. Catfish is that show about people who get into online relationships  and haven't met the other person and this other person usually looks like a supermodel.  And then they do a reverse image search and realize that they've janked this image from  somebody who's totally not them. So now Chrome makes it a lot easier to do that.  What else? Oh, Google's rolling out the streamlined new colorful design for docs,  sheets and slides in Google Drive. It's just kind of a minor update, but it does look really nice.  You'll see in the screenshot there, you'll notice each editor has a product icon displayed in the  header, kind of bright, bright color. And that doubles as a link back to all your files and drive  and the header is more streamlined and compact. And so you can focus more on your content. It looks  nice. I can see it here in the rundown here. We use sheets for the twig rundown. And finally,  what we talked about earlier, the new search engine and card UI for mobile search and the new  iOS search app that we talked about earlier, the 15th, 15th birthday, so that you get cross  device notifications and the knowledge graph comparisons and filters all rolling out now.  And Hummingbird as well, which has been rolled out for quite some time. So yeah, that's it.  That's all I got in the changelog.  Thanks, Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, Gina, did you guys cover last week? Maybe I missed it. The inclusion of the new apps icon  when you go to Chrome instead of having all your Chrome apps come up, like you have the little apps  button.  We didn't actually. I think I mentioned it when it was in beta. Chrome is like, is one of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  things because there's Canary and the, you know, it's Canary and then the dev channel and then  beta. I'm not even sure how many channels there are, but you can often kind of see the  new features coming from far away. But yeah, that little apps button in the upper left-hand  corner of Chrome, like right under the back button.  Right, right here.  Yeah, right there.  Chad's got my desktop. So now instead of like having this, this was what used to come up when

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you open a new tab, it was like all your stuff. You can see I'm a big old time arcade guy. But  you know, that's what used to come up and it was kind of like, blah, here's all your apps on the  page. And then I think what they, you know, they're like, you know, they're like, you know,  apps on the page. And then I think what they, what they decided to do now is number one,  they're bringing the Google search bar front and center, which is interesting. And then,  you know, so you have the button for apps. And then the other thing, well, it's even showing  me over here on the other side, Chad, welcome to the new way to find your, your favorite Google  products. So you can open up the grid and it automatically drops down, you know, the things  that I use most often, which is really helpful if I just want to click, you know, on Drive without  like going to a different page. I mean, it saves me a couple of clicks, but throughout the day,  that actually adds up to quite a bit of savings time savings for me. So I can go right to YouTube,  I can go right to Google+. So they've changed that around a little bit. And I really like it.  The more I use it at first, I was like, I'm not sure just because I was used to the old way of  doing things. And now it's like, wow, this makes so much sense. Why didn't they do this years ago?  Because it really makes it more streamlined on the page, at least for me. Yeah, I have to say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was I did not mourn for the departure of the black bar. I think they called it the sand bar  across the top. It's much cleaner. I like the white space a lot more that grid of little boxes  in Chrome. When I first saw it, I was like, Oh, hey, get out of my Chrome. I mean, the whole point  of Chrome is that it's supposed to disappear, like the actual Chrome is supposed to disappear  a little bit. I've got I've gotten used to it. I mean, these design this like very cohesive design  is really and you mentioned this earlier, Aaron, like this is this is page like this is Larry Page  coming in and saying Google is going to have a consistent design that shows up across all the  products. And it's really nice to see that, you know, that the cards and the good typography in  the white space. And now, you know, you see the hamburger icon a lot. Now we're seeing this grid  of, you know, the apps grid button, you know, it's these visual signals that you're like, oh,  that's what that is. And I can see that in all different contexts and still understand what it  is. So, yeah, I really I really like it. I've accepted it. I didn't love that I had a button  added to my Chrome without adding it myself. Right. But I'm good with it. Now that I can see  them rolling it into the web products as well. I like it. And they even have a new commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if you've seen it that talks about Chrome. It's a commercial for Chrome. And it says,  you know, mobile tablet TV or mobile tablet laptop. I forget what it is, but it's like,  you know, it's the same experience everywhere. So they're really pushing for that. And I think  that's what this is all about, really, you know, making sure that the user interface is common  across all the devices so that people feel comfortable using it the same way on, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  everywhere they interact with it. Yep. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, that's a good commercial.  Definitely pushing us toward a multi-device world where you've got a computer and a tablet and a  phone and everyone has a computer and a tablet and a phone and eventually a watch and glasses. And  that's totally normal. And you're not dismissing notifications across all of them, which is nice.  Speaking of watches, the Galaxy Gear reviews landed today. I know it's a little far afield,  but the Galaxy Gear is getting some bad reviews out there. Yeah, it's horrible. Yeah. Yeah. Have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you tried it, Mike? Have you tried one? I haven't, but it's I wrote about it when they first  announced it and essentially declared it dead in the water. The whole point of the new version  of the wearable computing movement is that suddenly wearable computing is wearable.  You know, watches and smartwatches and cell phone watches and stuff have been around for a long time.  10, 12 years ago, you could buy a watch that could make phone calls and that could take pictures and  all that stuff. I had a camera watch in the year 2000, but they were horrible. They're huge.  There's like a TV set lashed to your wrist. They're just gigantic, boxy, bulky thing.  Most women could never wear a watch like this except for ironically or as a geek fashion  statement. They're just awful. And so the promise of the new watch movement that you see with the  fitness oriented watches and also the idea that Apple's working on a curved glass  smartwatch is that they're going to be actually, you can wear them in public and not be a complete  dork. And then along comes Samsung with this throwback device that's just a gigantic boxy,  bulky, ugly thing that is, I mean, it's just incomprehensible that they actually did this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That only works with the Note 3 if you want to talk about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. I mean, they're slowly rolling out compatibility with a few other phones, but  you know, it's like at the very least support every phone that has Bluetooth.  And then you'll get more than a dozen users. I mean, it's just an awful thing that they did.  And the thing that bothers me about it is I've been a huge cheerleader for the wearable computing  movement in general and the smartwatch movement in particular. And I've been saying, it's coming,  it's going to be fantastic. And then they come up with everybody saying this thing and the Qualcomm  watch, which was not a serious effort either, they're acting like, okay, this is the smartwatch  revolution that we've been talking about. No, this isn't the revolution. This is not.  This is a throwback to the thing that we're going to bury with the revolution that hasn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  actually started yet. So, very disappointing. So what's Google going to, I mean, the rumor is  Google's working on one of these watches too, right? So what do we think, I guess, or what do  we think they're going to do differently that's going to make it something that we can actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  use and want to use? Google Now? Yeah, certainly now. I mean, I'm trying to find a glass on my  wrist. Yeah, a glass on my wrist would be really, really great, right? Because I wouldn't have the  dorky thing on my head, but I would get all the sort of nice benefits of Google Now kind of right  there. And so really just Google Now running on my phone on my wrist would be, it's got to, there's  so many things that they'd have to hit. They have to hit great battery life. They had to hit wireless  charging. They have to not try to do everything, you know, kind of, and do a few things really well.  I think that there are opportunities to market the watch to certain groups, like building the  FitWatch makes a lot of sense, right? Like fitness nuts, you know, parents who have to do things one  handed a lot. You know, people who just kind of notification junkies or news junkies or people  who want notifications without being, you know, doing that rude thing when they have to pull out  their phone. They just have to articulate the message of what the product does really well.  And the product has to be like simple and just, you know, just be something that, you know, that  communicates its value so much that you just can't bear not to have one. And I think too opening it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  up for developers more as well. Yeah. Right. I mean, that's got to be, that's got to be pretty big  because it's not only about what Google can do, but you know, if you have the ecosystem and a  developer is willing to spend the time to make an app, that's really cool. I mean, Google doesn't  know everything about this. Samsung doesn't know everything there is to know about this. Sony doesn't  know. So I mean, I think having a functional developer ecosystem for a product like this will

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  be huge. Well, with Android's rich notifications, like Android has great rich notifications built  in already, like the iOS doesn't have, right? So if, say for instance, at Google I O 2014,  all the developers get watches and automatically your app's rich notifications appear on the watch  and you're able to control your media or, you know, perform all the actions that you can perform in a  rich notification right now, but do it on your watch, which isn't, isn't that, you know, difficult  to imagine, right? Because those rich notifications do have minimal UIs, but do let you perform the  most important actions, you know, with very little developer intervention, that would be amazing.  So that would be a good start. Like, Hey, your app's notifications work perfectly on our watches.  And when they're dismissed on the watch, they're dismissed across every other device. So your user's  not going to be annoyed by them when they look at it, look at them and all their other devices.  That'd be awesome. But you know, if they also give away, every developer gets a smartwatch at  Google I O 2014. Also, here's the SDK and here are a couple of extra cool things that you can do with  it. Here are the sensors the watch has that none of your other Android devices have. Then you get  no place where you're like, Hey, I can install, you know, apps for this. So a couple of things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  about the potential smartwatch. One of them is that I predicted and I hope that the prediction is  true, that the Google smartwatch will have the same aspect ratio as Google Glass, so that the  user interface and the apps and everything can be just the same. Just as you said, Gina, it's  the same thing. So for those not familiar with the Google Glass interface, it's a breathtaking  new idea for an interface. When it comes on, you see the current time and that's the present.  And as you scroll to the right, you go further back in the past, everything that's happened,  every event that's happened, every card that's happened in Google Glass in reverse chronological  order. And if you go to the left, it's the future. It's the weather today and you know, and so on.  And you get the very end on the left and you get that's a perfect interface for a wristwatch.  Perfect. And if they have the same aspect ratio, they can essentially just leverage every thing  that's been done with Glass for the watch. So, okay, that's one point. The other point about  Google and a wristwatch is that the cool things about the Moto X phone, the coolest things about  it are the sort of low power mode and the fact that it's always listening and always paying  attention to location and orientation and movement and all that kind of stuff in the super low power  mode. That technology was developed for a wristwatch, not for a phone. They developed that for  the Motorola smartwatch. And so, you know, look at what Google already has to bring to a wristwatch.  They have the Moto X technology, they have Google now and they have the Google Glass interface.  That's all I want. That would be the greatest watch ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And in fact, one of the stories in our rundown there, Google is set to release the GDK,  the Glassware development kit to developers, which will let developers build native apps for  Glass. So it'd be really interesting if native apps go for Glass. If the Glassware app store,  which is also rumored or may have been confirmed to launch next year, if that would just all work  on the watch as well. There was the Mirror API that they released early on, but it was limited.  So it looked like the GDK will really let developers do more native stuff. So it's interesting that  they're calling it the GDK or they're calling it the Glass. If the plans were to extend it  to the watch, I'd almost kind of expect them to call it the wearable, you know,  DK or something instead of the GDK. But there's definitely a lot of potential there. It does seem  like Google's really positioned to do a watch well just because they've done the UI on Glass. I have  to say social, you know, all the other kind of blockers aside, the UI, the user interface is  absolutely perfect. They nailed that better than I thought you could do. I had my doubts about how  you can navigate on Glass, but it's really quite good. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, yeah. Speaking of Glass,  I love this video there. A firefighter had entered the If I Had Glass social media contest and  proposed that he would use Glass to take pictures and take videos while fighting fires. And he just  got his pair. I think just last week, and I think this past weekend, he fought his first  house fire using Glass. And he said, you know, I'm concerned about the heat and the smoke affecting  the, you know, the hardware, but he got some amazing pictures. And you really can see how,  particularly for something, a specialized job like firefighting or security, how Glass is really kind  of amazing to be able to take hands-free photos and video. Yeah, Chad, you've got the video going  there. I don't know if you can get sound on that. This video had an actual blaze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is my visor on my helmet. It's just quick and easy to catch the picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wood received Google Glass on a Friday. By Sunday, he was fighting a house fire.  Of course, his plan has an inherent risk. Will the technology be reliable?  My biggest concern is the heat and the smoke. He believes Google will take notes and make

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  adjustments for Glass's 2014 release. I think the Glass that we have today is going to be  different than the Glass that comes out as a consumer model next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The way Chief Wood sees it, this tool could stand the test of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can take a picture, send a picture, make a phone call. I think it's the next step in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  information revolution. In Jones County. Yeah, pretty cool. Pretty cool. So, you know,  I have my doubts about Glass as a general kind of consumer product. I think for firefighters  and surgeons and teachers and field guide leaders and those kinds of specialized factory workers,  anything to do with safety or education, I think there's huge, huge potential there.  That certainly trumps the maybe discomfort of having a head-mounted camera on your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because you can't interact with it. I know I have a friend who's a firefighter and he uses  a GoPro that he puts on his helmet, but you can't interact with that. So you can capture  for later use, but you can't interact right away and say, you know, take this picture, swipe,  send it to whatever, you know, the chief or whoever's monitoring the situation, right?  That's so much more useful. And, you know, I can see Google taking this one step further  and integrating it into helmets and things. I mean, why wouldn't you do that, right? Or for  police officers, you know, integrating it into their uniform somehow so that you can have  instantaneous, you know, feedback to somebody that's making decisions that needs a closer look at the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  situation. Yep, absolutely. Very cool. So did you guys accidentally hang out someone who you were  not trying to hang out with? Do you see the story? On Glass? No, just Google hangout slash gtalk. So  on any of your devices, I guess apparently there was a glitch that sent some chat messages to the  wrong recipients, which is basically the worst bug that you can possibly have in an I am client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This actually happened to me. Oh, Chad, this happened to you? Yes. So here's the bug is that  for me, it's still sent a message to someone who was in my circles. But if I sent a message to  someone who I expected it would only go to them, it actually went to a hangout full of people.  Luckily, it was just like a hey, you there and people were like, I'm no, I'm not like,  what are you talking about? You know, and and yeah, really scary to the point of like,  okay, I'm going to use Skype for the next few days to contact everyone. Yeah, yeah, not fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How did you how did you realize that it went to a hangout full of people? Did a bunch of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  respond like who are you? What? Basically, and it would show up if if you could see it like it  wasn't it was a weird bug where I use I use Trillion. And so I sent it through Trillion.  And then when I went to Google+, I could see that there was a hangout that I had spoken in.  And I realized that the messages that I thought were going to the other friend were going to the  hangout and not to the friend that I was messaging with. Oh, yeah, Twilight Zone. That

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  would have freaked that would have freaked me out. I'm going to use a word that I would never use  with Jeff Jarvis on the show, which is that's creepy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Can you imagine if I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  thought that I was talking to a family member and was maybe talking about family issues? I mean,  there's so, so much that could go wrong that there's so many awkward things that could happen. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm really glad that it was an innocuous message. How you doing? Hey, you there? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  And I'm impressed that you saw it. Like, I don't know if you were on Trillion. So you just happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to check. No, it's funny because I saw the I saw the article and I went my friend never responded.  And I went over to Google+. Yes. Yes. So so luckily I was I was I mean, I was a pretty  savvy user and I caught a really fast and I knew exactly where to look to see if I was exhibiting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the issues. But yeah, not fun. Not fun. Wow. I gotta say I love Hangouts and I've actually  switched to the Hangouts app on my Android phone and I use it on the desktop. I mostly use the text,  you know, the text chat. I'll talk about the text versus the the video chat. And I really I really  like it a lot. But that is that's a little scary. Apparently there's a Hangouts update rolling out,  by the way, which will show availability statuses, a better organized contact list.  I'm not sure if that has actually been pushed out yet. I think Android police listed a link to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to the APK. Yeah, yeah, stage rollout. But they need to they need to there's a lot that needs to  happen with Hangouts is so it's confusing to use. It's hard to tell what's going on and who's  you know, it's constantly interrupting people. But I think the most glaring problem with  Hangouts is it doesn't support SMS yet. Yep. It's got to support SMS before anybody can really take it seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. I'm waiting for the day the day when the Google Voice Hangouts integration gets announced  and also the weirdness about the way that it interacts with Google Talk with certain with  different clients and that the XMPP decisions that they made. I mean, there was there were some  there were some missteps there. I feel like it just it needs to talk to every you know, to everything  interact with everything, but particularly with SMS, right? Because SMS that's what iMessage has  over Hangouts at this point, right? That is the SMS integration. So that's definitely a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I almost wish they would have waited on this one. I mean, they should have just held back until that  stuff was working and they had the integration with voice they had the integration certainly with  SMS. I mean, it just seems like they should have waited just a little bit because now they've  introduced confusion. Do I use gTalk? Do I use Hangouts? Do I use voice? I don't know. Maybe I  just use my phone's built-in SMS because that's what works, you know. And so I think it's going  to be a lot harder for them now to to get people to to to upgrade or I don't know if it's an upgrade,  but change to Hangouts, which is what they want. Because they want to unify all this messaging,  which is great. But they're just going to have a hard time doing that now because now people are  confused. It would have been so much better if they just would have waited six months or something  till they were ready, hopefully, and released it at that time. But the other problem is, and I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know if this happens to you guys, but there's an incoming call or some kind of Hangout or something  and you can't find it. Yeah. Yeah. Does that happen to you? Yeah, I've had that happen before.  If I go to Gmail, maybe it'll appear, you know, and it's just it's just so half-assed. It's just awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I did have that. I did get a notification of one which I on my Android phone, which I  swiped away and then couldn't find it. The new one. And now I have this lingering paranoia of like,  did I miss one or was it just a double notification? Yeah. Oh, you're right. You're right. I have been  using it. I do like it, but definitely, definitely does have have some issues to work out for sure.  Yeah. Yep. Let's see. Do you guys see Steve Ballmer's tearful goodbye?  Yeah, it was intense. He was a big crying man. Yeah. Mike, you did a piece about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  why Microsoft should fire Bill Gates, actually. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Well, there are three investors,  Reuters reported this yesterday, who are calling for Bill Gates to be removed as chairman,  but left on the board. And they're especially concerned with his influence over the next CEO.  So they don't want to Gates to bring in another Ballmer. I mean, essentially, Ballmer, in my view,  was a conspicuously incompetent CEO. I was going to use this information as my number of the week  later on. Sorry, I know that's fine, because I also have a pick of the week, which I can use  in that segment. But here's the number $570 billion. If you look at the valuation of Microsoft when  Steve Ballmer became CEO in the year 2000, it was roughly $620 billion. And it was close to a record,  the record that they had achieved. When you adjust that for inflation, that would be about $850 billion.  So adjusted for inflation, Microsoft was worth $850 billion in 1999-2000. And it's now worth $280  billion. So essentially, under Steve Ballmer's leadership, and it's really Bill Gates's  leadership, Microsoft has lost $570 billion in value. So if anybody can think of a CEO who  survived that long with that much loss of value, I'd love to hear it because it's never happened.  And I've always believed that Steve Ballmer, the reason he was promoted to CEO and the reason he  survived all his failures was because he was Bill Gates's guy. He was loyal personally to his former  college buddy, Bill Gates. And so Bill Gates, everybody says Bill Gates is a genius and a  visionary. And there's another argument that he's a moral person because he saved a lot of lives  with this philanthropic organization, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. And that's a separate  issue. But if you just look at the ability for Microsoft to succeed in the future, and you look  at the litany of failures that the Steve Ballmer, Bill Gates duo has committed,  missing the internet in every possible way, missing search engines, failing with MSN,  screwing up their lead with Internet Explorer. If you look at the failures in mobile with the  Windows for pens and the Origami project and this whole tablet PC concept, the internet and  mobile is everything that's been happening since Ballmer has been in charge. And they've not had a  single success. Everything that they've done that's been good, like the Zoom or like the Surface,  has been way too late for them to succeed with this phone. So they're either wrong or they're late  on everything in the last 14 years. And so to swap out Ballmer for another Bill Gates pick,  another Bill Gates loyalist, and to have Bill Gates even on the board, even as not chairman,  he has enormous influence. This is far beyond his ownership. He only owns 4.5% of Microsoft.  And by the year 2018, he's going to own zero. He's got a staged automatic withdrawal, essentially,  of sales of stock that will leave him with zero Microsoft stock in the year 2018. These three  investors who are calling for him to be removed as chairman, just them alone represent a greater  percentage of stock than Bill Gates. So this guy, Bill Gates, is essentially not a visionary. He's  a dinosaur. And he's the wrong guy to be so influential over Microsoft. Microsoft does so  much potential, but they're unable to take their brilliant research and put it into products.  They're unable to foresee things coming. And they need a CEO who's really in charge of the company,  who really has vision. And if Bill Gates is anywhere near the board, he's going to  use his influence to continue, I would predict, this long, long string of  abject failures. And the valuation of Microsoft is going to decline and decline and decline until  they're just a footnote in history. And so I think Bill Gates should be kicked off the bull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. Wow. I like that. That's good opinion. We got Mike calling the end of Facebook and  Microsoft here, folks. I think I'm going to put him around here on my calendar. I'm going to check  in in a couple of years and see if this actually happens. But I love that. Good reasoning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But is it really Bill Gates? Every time I hear Bill Gates talk, in fact, the more I hear him talk  as he gets older, it seems like he still has a lot of these good ideas. But he resigned from his  position. I know he's still on the board. But I'm wondering if really Bomber wasn't in the way.  Do you think that getting rid of Gates really is the right decision? Or maybe now that Bomber's  gone, some of those really good ideas that Bill Gates maybe still has could actually be carried out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bill Gates is very good with technology and business, but he has absolutely no feel for  human nature. And so he has no he's tone deaf when it comes to users, when it comes to markets,  when it comes to culture. And so he is kind of in my view, the opposite of Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs  was never super technical, was never a software developer, hardware engineer, but really had an  instinct for what would thrill users. And since 1999, when Steve Jobs, 1999 is the pivotal year  when those two are going opposite directions. And Steve Jobs keen insight into human nature  without a lot of technical acumen. And Bill Gates had all the technical background without just tone  deaf about, you know, let me give you one example. I think you guys even talked about it  recently on Twitter or maybe last week's twig or something like that. But the continued, if you look  at the tiers of Windows, the different types and all this, it was peaked out at sort of Vista.  To not understand that that is just a horrible, unnecessary waste of consumer goodwill to just  confuse the pants off of your customers and generate this sort of buyer's remorse. But,  you know, back to your point, I actually think Bill Gates was a, you can't argue with the fact  that Bill Gates, that Microsoft succeeded when Bill Gates was the CEO. And I think a lot of that had  to do with the fact that he was a tyrant like Steve Jobs. He knew how to dress somebody down,  how to instill fear and how to kick everybody's butt. And he was a hardcore workaholic, totally  engaged in making Microsoft as one. As a board member, he's, it's just his ideas and his influence.  He's not engaged. He's not able to instill fear and loyalty and all this kind of stuff that he  could as CEO. And so he's more of a problem or a barrier, I think, to Microsoft success.  I mean, I really, if anybody thinks that Steve Ballmer ran Microsoft in a way that was counter  to what Bill Gates wanted, I would be really surprised by that opinion. He was a Bill Gates  loyalist all the way. And he was essentially running Microsoft on behalf of Bill Gates and  largely guided by Bill Gates. And between the two of these guys, they just missed everything.  And it's really unfortunate. Microsoft has enormous potential. The technology and the market  position they have with Xbox, the fact that they own both PixelSense and also Perceptive Pixel,  that's the future of desktop computing is touch. And Microsoft owns most of the intellectual property  and they have the biggest lead. And they're on track again to completely squander their lead.  You know, they need a visionary who's going to get this stuff to market and be a lot more Google-like  by just getting this stuff to market and being more transparent as a company and stop. They need  to stop fighting internally and having these sort of silification and that is kind of like  internal competition. And they need to scrap all that stuff and just move forward and be aggressive.  And I know with Bill Gates, I just don't see how they can do it.  Maybe they're just too big to do that though. I can't see a company that big

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  being able to spit stuff out that quickly and not have the competition. I mean, I came from,  you know, I worked at Oracle for a number of years and it was similar there, right? You've got all  this internal competition and infighting and things. You've got different groups that are  trying to gain mindshare and everything's being run by the top by Larry Ellison. I mean, I think  with Microsoft, it's kind of a similar problem right now is they're so big, they've got their  hands in so many pies. It's hard to really deliver like you're saying, like they should  with something that's really innovative and really bring something to market before other people. I  think that there's so many barriers in the way, not just with the leadership, but with the size  of the company and the different groups. Like you say, I think it's going to be really hard for them  to actually deliver on that if they are going to continue to be a big monolithic company like they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  are now. Yeah, I mean, that could be, but what would Larry do? I mean, if they're too big to  succeed, then you need to cut a lot of underperforming. You know, what Microsoft  has been doing all these years is instead of cutting underperforming properties as Google has  been doing, they've been hiding the lack of performance through accounting gimmicks.  How much is Bing losing? Well, that's hard to determine because they've buried that in these  other divisions and so on. And so that's sort of been their, that's sort of an internal political  ass covering kind of approach to these problems that's very antiquated and is not going to help  you compete against the likes of Apple and Google on the internet and in mobile technology  and in the gadgets sphere in general. I don't think Microsoft needs to be smaller in order to  do what they need to do. What they really need to do is they need to use what remaining power and  cash that they have to go and school Hollywood in who's in charge. They need to turn Xbox into the  living room system and turn that into home automation and all this stuff. They've got  everything in place. They need to execute on it, right? The other thing that they need to do is  take this PixelSense stuff and the perceptive Pixel stuff, the big desktop touch tablet things  and also pen. In Microsoft's case, they have great research on pen, combining touch and pen together,  and they need to get that into a sub $5,000 consumer version as fast as possible and really  own that market. Because if they don't do it, Apple's going to do it. And if Apple doesn't do it,  Google's going to do it. And as it is now, Microsoft is years ahead, but they're not shipping  anything. They're keeping it for casinos and CNN for election night coverage. That's what they're  using this stuff for, small potatoes. They need to have this thing at Best Buy. And if they can't  turn that around in 12 months, once again, they're going to repeat what they did with Zune and with  Surface. They're going to come with too little too late and it's going to be another lost opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe they need to spin up a Skunk Works project or something similar to what Google's done with  X Labs. And then from my own experience, what Sun did with when ZFS started to become hot and heavy,  they took these guys and they said, hey, look, we got this new ZFS thing. We've got this DTrace  thing in Solaris. Why don't you DTrace guys go off to San Francisco and get a loft somewhere,  come up with something new and cool. And they came up with this great product for a while that was  really catching on. It was really innovative at the time. And I won't comment on where it is now  because of where I work, but it was the concept of taking something like this where you have a lead  and then because of your size, needing to pare down and get focused on it, turn it over to a Skunk  Works project. That's what seems to make the most sense here. Why wouldn't they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't know. The research itself is something that Microsoft is very, very good at.  They have killer research. But then when it's time to productize that research, the internal  political divisions prevent them because nobody wants to compete against another division. What  they're starting to do, they're just now starting to jump on board to what Google started, which is  that you compete with your partners. Google was the first major company to say, hey, our whole  mobile operating system depends on these other companies making hardware. They're our partners.  We do the software. They do the hardware. And then they bought Motorola and said, you know what,  we're going to compete directly against our partners, our users, the companies that sell  this thing. And everybody's like, you can't do that. And Google's like, watch us. We're going to  do it. And so now they're doing that. Now Microsoft's kind of doing that. They're purchasing Nokia and  all that stuff. But they really need to embrace that concept. They need to stop being afraid to  cannibalize themselves and their partners and just move forward with the most bleeding end technology.  It's a cultural issue. It's not about invention. And I don't think it's about execution. It's about  politics. And it's about the internal  focus that needs to be completely undermined by strong leadership that just drives the best  technology out into the market, no matter who gets hurt. That's what Google would do. And that's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft needs to do. Wow. Fantastic discussion. Good stuff. One of the hardest things to do is  change culture. And so I was such a big, such a big company and you do need strong leadership to do it.  But yeah, great, Mike. Thank you. Cool. So I think I think we should start to wrap up. If you guys  have any other stories you want to talk about, we'll take a break right now for Leah to tell us  about Squarespace, our second sponsor today. And then we'll move on to our picks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello, Googlers. Leo Laporte here. Actually, I'm not. I'm not here. But thanks to the miracle of  technology, I can be here in this form, this evanescent form to talk about squarespace.com.  I see so many people. I see people like Jeff and Gina and lots of other people struggling with their  websites. We have it. We do it all the time. We'll go to a website, knock it off the air.  And I think, you know, that's kind of a shame. I mean, you're getting the biggest plug of your life  sometimes. And because we know that because so many people are going to your site, it's gone down.  So all those people who would see what you're doing can't. That never happens with Squarespace.  We have tried. In fact, try right now. Go to our Squarespace site. The Inside Twit blog is running  on Squarespace. Inside that twit.tv. Can't bring it down. Every one of you goes there all at once.  Nope. That's because Squarespace does both hosting and the content management system.  They're tightly integrated. Anthony explained this to me once. And I know, you know, the founder of  Squarespace, Anthony Castellana, explained this. It has to do with it's like the servers are  virtualized and the software allows that. And so your site doesn't just live on one computer. It  lives on the whole Squarespace cloud. When more bandwidth is needed, the cloud is there to, you  know, put more bandwidth behind your site completely seamlessly. Stuff like that. I don't  understand it. I just know it works. I know we cannot bring a Squarespace site down. More than  that. I mean, it's very affordable. It starts at $8 a month for the annual plan. The unlimited plan  is only 16 bucks a month. That means unlimited bandwidth, unlimited sites, unlimited pages.  In fact, a Squarespace, you cannot, you will never get a bill with the unlimited plan for bandwidth.  So you get to be, you are the most popular site in the world. Your site doesn't go down and you  don't get a bandwidth bill. If you want to do commerce, 24 bucks a month with the annual plan.  By the way, with any of these annual plans, they'll hook up your site. They'll give you a custom  domain name for free and they'll hook up your site. The commerce is amazing. If you want to sell  something online, there is no better deal for e-commerce and Squarespace.com. Unlimited physical  or digital goods. You can sell MP3s and CDs for instance, or paintings and photographs or digital  photography, whatever. They calculate taxes, shipping. You could do coupon codes. All of this  is built in. They set you up with a merchant account, but Squarespace takes nothing. It's  24 bucks a month. That's it. I don't know of a better solution for e-commerce, frankly.

Back we go to Jeff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina and this week in Hoogl. Hoogl. Before we move on to our picks. That's a good one.  Are there any other stories that you guys want to cover before we go on to our picks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I saw this thing about the vending machine, the game vending machine that Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  put in Japan. Oh, yeah. This is an Android based or it's an Android game vending machine. So how

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  does this work? So it works with NFC. I guess you just go to the machine and like hold your phone  up to the game that you want to load and it like automatically loads. But I think this only works  in Japan. I can't see how this would work anywhere else, right? Because Japan, if you don't know,  they've got a lot of vending machines there. So they're all over the place. You can buy all  sorts of stuff through vending machines. And I guess the concept is you just come up with your  phone. It has to be Android 4.0 and you have to have NFC and you might see a game or something  that you want to load on your phone. And so you just hold it up there. And if it's a game,  if it's a pay service, you know, it uses, I think it uses Google wallet to pay or maybe you can use  a credit card too. I didn't see that in the article, but I don't know. It's just a really  interesting concept. I just cannot imagine this. I mean, why wouldn't you just use the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So it's a software vending machine. So it's like the Play Store. It's a manifestation  of the Play Store. Actually the vending machine will give you a Nexus 4 for you to try it out,  but you have to give the Nexus 4 back. So this is interesting. So if you just want to play a game,  you could just be like, hey, give me a Nexus 4, load up a couple of games and play for a bit  and then just give it back like renting an Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that makes more sense. It looks a little more sense. I missed that part of the article. So  they're actually, so it drops out a Nexus 4 in there and you use it. I mean, I don't know,  maybe it doesn't make sense. So they're hoping it's kind of like the red box idea, right? Like you go  up and pick a movie. It spits out a disc, but in this case it's spitting out a Nexus 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Is this at an airport? It seems like this would make sense at an airport. I guess you  wouldn't take it on the plane with you because you had to get the phone back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It says the machines are only there for a limited 10-day run. So they're testing this concept out,  but I just can't imagine this working anywhere else. It's just kind of an interesting story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought I'd bring it up. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. All right. Let's move on to our picks. Aaron,  why don't we start with you? You've got something really interesting going on in the studio there.  I've been chomping at the bit to see what's going on in that extra monitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. So I don't know if you guys have heard about this project. It came out a couple weeks  ago. It's called Google Coder. And what it is actually is Google is kind of embracing Raspberry  Pi. And all of this, everything around this is right up my alley. So I'm big into Google,  big into open source, big into open hardware, which is why I love the Raspberry Pi. And what  you may not know is I also really love new concepts around education. Right. So things  like Udacity and different ways for people to learn and easier ways for people to learn about  things. So what Google did was they created this Google Coder, which is basically their  learning environment for people that want to learn how to develop web applications.  So what you do is you take your Raspberry Pi. And I've got my Raspberry Pi sitting here at the  desk next to me. I don't know if we have a shot of that, Chad. Oh, you can kind of see it.  I don't want to mess it up, but it's right here. So I got my Raspberry Pi. I've got a Wi-Fi dongle  connected to it. And I've got the Google Coder image loaded on the SD card that's in the Raspberry  Pi. And when you boot this up, and I will switch to my browser now. When you boot this up, if you're  running Mac or Linux, you should be able to automatically go to Coder.local and it should  connect you automatically to the Raspberry Pi. If it doesn't, if you're like me and you're running  Windows so that I can share my screen better, you actually need to find out the IP address. Anyway,  so this is the first use. So it's telling me we need a password. So I'm just going to try this.  It's going to be a live demo. Let's just see how this works. They always go smoothly. So I'm going  to put a password in here. Oh, it's telling me it needs to contain a lowercase and at least two  uppercase letters or numbers. Wow. Okay. So let's, let me, let me modify this and see if it,  see if it works now. Okay. I'm waiting. Here it comes. Okay. So now it says enter your,  enter your password to get coding. Hope I can remember what it is. So I'll put that on there.  Okay. And here's what you get. So it's, it's really googly. Number one, you can see the things that  are popping up. It kind of gives you click here to do this. You create a new app, click here to do  this. The brilliant thing about this is, is it's very low cost. So I'm running this on my $25 Raspberry  Pi. So basically for less than $50, you can get everything you need to get started coding web apps.  So let's just try this out. Let's go ahead and say, we want to test, they've got some preloaded apps  here. So we could do eyeball. We'll click on eyeball and you can see the eyeballs moving around  when I move my cursor around. And the great thing about this is there's a little, it's probably hard  to see on the thing, but there's a little tab over here on the side. And if we click on that  through the magic of television,  it's taking a while to load, but basically what happens is when you click on that, you get  the code that loads alongside the application and you can start going in and modifying it.  So you could modify the color of the eyeball. You could modify the way that it works by just  doing some simple, simple, you know, changing the script slightly. So it's helping you to learn.  And so I think this was a really great project and I wanted to bring it up because it's really  combining all of these things with the ultimate goal of, you know, increasing someone's ability to  go out and do something that they weren't able to do before. So I just think it's a really great  use of all the codes open source. It's using open hardware. You know, it's a Google-y experience,  if you'll pardon the expression, but they're trying to make it really simple to use and understand.  It's very inexpensive. And at the end of the day, you can write your own web app. So anyway,  that's Google Coder. And if you are interested in learning web applications, I would highly  recommend going out and picking up a Raspberry Pi and trying it out for yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very cool. Yeah, really cool. So it comes with Hello Coder, Eyeball, Space Rocks, and then you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  can make your own. Yeah. And then you can make your own and it walks you through. I was going  to demo that as well, but for some reason it's not quite working. Of course, it's a live demo. It's  not working. But it'll actually, you can do create a new app and it'll take you through. Okay. It  starts out really simple. Like what color do you want your app to be? And it looks a lot like the  apps in the Chrome, in the browser, right? When you do a Chrome app, it looks very, very similar  to that. And so it's just a really simple way. They're trying to make it simple. I love that they,  again, this is kind of a pet project, right? But I love that they took the time to build on what  Raspberry Pi was doing to make it really easy for people to learn to code. And maybe right now,  they're concentrated on web apps. Maybe that's not your thing. I hope that they develop this into  other applications. So maybe Android development or maybe learn how to code in Java or Python  or something like that using a similar, easy to use kind of approach like this. So yeah,  I just think it's really cool. I hope they continue to do stuff like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right on. Right on. It's a great platform, Raspberry Pi. Mike, what do you got for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Well, I'm going to be talking about a hardware device that Sony announced a couple  of months ago, I guess. And it now is apparently available. And I just love the concept of this.  It has a terrible name. It's called the Smart Bluetooth Handset, SBH52. That's right. That's  SBH52. Ask for it by name. What it is essentially is it's a little device, probably about roughly  the size of an Apple TV remote control. It's very small. And it connects with any Bluetooth-based  device. If you have a Sony device or another device that has an NFC chip in it, you just tap it,  pair it, tap it against the phone. And what this does is it's got an FM radio built in. It's got a  little tiny low-res screen. You can receive calls. You can answer like a little Zoolander phone.  Right. So if you can, what it does, it enables you to have a gigantic phablet in your backpack  or your purse or whatever, or even 10 feet away. And when you get calls or want to listen to music  or whatever, you can use this thing as if it were a little phone, but it's actually connected to  your device. There are apps in the Play Store, according to Sony, that deliberately use this thing.  It's essentially, I consider it a wearable computer. It displays your text message and  notifications. It's waterproof. It's just a weird, odd kind of thing that Sony came out with that I  think deserves a lot more attention than it's getting. As you can see from the screen, it clips  on. It can go to pocket. It can clip onto your coat, clip onto if you're working out.  So it's great for the gym because you can clip it onto your clothes and listen to FM radio.  Some gyms have the television sets in front of the treadmills have FM radio to convey the sound of  the TVs. So it's just a really cool device. And it's a thing that enables you to have a phablet as  your phone without having to pull this gigantic thing out of your backpack all the time and put  it up against your head to talk on the phone. You can have this little tiny phone. It's just  a cool little device that I think is both part of the wearable computing movement  and it's also part of the phablet movement because it enables you to use a phablet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in a more practical way. Yeah, it looks really cool. Headset and handsets. So it's not like a  Bluetooth headset. So it's kind of like an iPod mini, but you can talk in it. So you get your big  screen, but you can just clip that to your jacket. And you can plug earbuds into it and clip it onto

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  your shirt. And then your device can be in the back seat of the car or whatever. And you can  interact on the phone and listen to music and all that stuff. What's the price range on this?  Oh yeah. I don't know. And they don't have it listed and they don't have a link to, but they  up until very recently it said coming soon and now it doesn't say coming soon. So I assume that this  is purchasable and I don't know the price, but if anybody's curious about this product, I'll be  following up on Google Plus as soon as I find out this information. Yeah, it's really cool. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  like an Uber Bluetooth headset. I mean, I like the fact that it has the buttons. Looks like 60,  well, that's not American. So it's like 80 bucks. Yeah, 80 bucks. That's not bad for a Bluetooth  headset. I just bought one yesterday. In fact, it was a car version for the car. But I like that  they give you the play buttons and whatever that Uber button does in the middle. I mean,  that really, I mean, I don't know. I think there's a place for this, especially like you say,  when you've got this huge thing that you don't always want to have to whip out every time you  want to pause your music or, you know, it really makes a lot of sense. So I think it's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does. It does like weird, strange, unexpected things. For example, it'll pair to two devices  simultaneously. So if you have two phones, you can use this to answer both phones. Oh, wacky.  Weird stuff like that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huh. Very cool. Very cool. My tip this week is pretty simple one. It's kind of for,  it's kind of a web development tip for people who like typography and notice typography on  different web pages. This is a new feature in Chrome that is coming out on Chrome 31 plus. So  you can try it right now if you're on the dev channel or using Chrome Canary.  If you come across a webpage with a cool looking font, you want to know what the font is. Instead  of going to what the font, which is usually what I do, you could just right click the text now  and then new versions of Chrome, choose inspect elements, and you switch to the computer computed  tab down in the inspection panel and you can scroll down and you'll see a summary of all the  typefaces used for that element. And Paul Irish, great web developer, said that this works. This  works great. You'll see the typeface names for Google web fonts, Typekit, local fonts,  at font face typefaces, Unicode glyphs, all kinds of interesting font sources. And again,  this is built right into Chrome. You don't know extension needed to a third party service needed.  And this is in the dev versions of Chrome. So cool way to discover new typefaces and see,  what that cool font is that's going on a page that you're interested in.  Chrome font finder. And it just, if you're a developer, use inspect element all the time.  So it's just down on the computed tab there. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. Yeah. I like, I like  these kinds of things are built into the browser. So the Chrome really got two things, the search  reverse image search built into the, to the right click menu on images and this, this typeface  finder, which is really nice. Well, I think that that's a wrap. Thank you both. Mike Elgin,  tell us where we can find you online and hear more of your amazing insights about Google Plus
