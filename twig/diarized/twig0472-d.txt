How you doing Stacy?  Hello, I'm well, it's great to see you once again  Also joining us Matthew Ingram from CJR or chief digital writer. How you doing Matthew?  Great good  good I  Like I like just getting to the point on that one. So I appreciate that Columbia journalism review. It's not just CJR  I should specify it's great to see you guys. Thanks for yeah. Thanks for hop here  Yeah, it's and it's a good day to do this because I don't know if y'all line  I know that you probably are very aware of this you two  But there's some big stuff happening in Washington DC right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to do I read Matthew's article on it. So I was excited. Yeah, I mean there's so many reader

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So many facets to all this stuff. I feel like the last week has been a whirlwind of  Well, I have a big tech reckoning like big tech is suddenly there's a huge a giant microscope  Being placed in the middle, you know in the middle of a sunny day right on technology tech is the  Absolutely, I mean things kind of started that that way right last week  I know on last week's show you guys talked a little bit about kind of what where Trump was at by the time of the show  I think the story kind of evolved through last week  So as you probably mentioned that before we kind of get into what's going on today  You know Trump was saying better be careful the treading on very troubled territory  I think this is all the stuff that you were mentioning last week  He also ended up posting a video which I don't know if you guys talked about  that showed the Google homepage every year during the inauguration and  On all of those years. There was a link present to watch the inauguration through the Google portal  Except in the video it does not show those links present when it's Trump's inauguration  So this was used as fuel to say hey see Google really wants to stamp, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stamp out conservative stuff. Yeah, and in classic Trump  fashion it was wrong and just like the  the research quote-unquote that he was  That he was quoting about how you know social media and particularly Google searches biased against him, which was also wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There were  There was a part of the video where I think it was like 2016 it actually showed an older logo  Because in 2015 Google had redone its logo  So, of course, there was all sorts of internet sleuthing going on as far as like hey, wait a minute  That doesn't make sense. If you pulled this screenshot it would have had the new logo not the old logo  Therefore was this being doctored or or I'm not sure what the explanation ever was on that  But it certainly cast a pretty large shadow over it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think the thing I'm trying to remember who made the point but  It's really irrelevant. I think to Trump  Whether any of this is true or not  As it is so many times, I think he gains or or he sort of wins  If we all spend a lot of time talking about whether it's true or not  Like like I think his his game plan consciously or subconsciously is just to raise doubt  Yes, is there by its you know, is there a secret cabal that is against me  I don't know but we're looking into it, you know, and then that's it. Just throw it out there planting the seed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Classic classic discrediting kind of efforts there. Yeah  Yeah, it makes sense and he I mean as as an individual he benefits from any confusion  He can sew in this manner. So it makes total sense  Yeah, and I guess I would like to  talk about what the the congressional hearings today because  Are they still ongoing or did they just end? I I know I am NOT watching them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The house one was going on I think before we started but it was wrapping up and Google did not show up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No one from Google showed up Facebook and maybe the invisible person showed up

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because there was a chair there with Google's label on it and no one's sitting in it  So it's possible Google has some advanced technology and they were able to make someone invisible that was actually there  But I doubt that happened. It appears like I did not send anyone which is weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, someone said we haven't paid as much attention to an empty chair as when Clint Eastwood. Yes  Exactly, I mean, oh I'm the empty chair  Yeah, where he talked to it it would have been fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah  So, okay  So the congressional hearing happening obviously Google's absence Sheryl Sandberg from Facebook Jack Dorsey from Twitter  They're all there to sit on the hot seat  they had invited either Eric Schmidt or  Larry Page to sit down at the  Sorry, sorry  Sundar that's right. It was in there  and  They instead offered up Kent Walker's the SVP of global affairs  To which they said no, we need someone more senior than that. We need you know, right Twitter and Facebook are doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why aren't you and why is Jack Dorsey has several companies? He's trying to run but he showed up

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why do you think Google decided to bow this out?  What do you think about them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have a lot of other stuff going on and they may just be like trying to play one-upsmanship with these  With Congress, I mean, let's let's be real all of these things all these hearings are our chance for Congress to like grandstand  And show off either a how ignorant they are about how the internet works or be berate  people so honestly, I  Don't blame Google for being like yeah, we're gonna set this one out. I know that most people go to these but  Me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I know what you mean I have to say though, I think they made a mistake by not they may have going  I mean, so even if Sundar goes he looks, you know  Nice, he looks ashamed or whatever. They want him to look he says he gives a statement  He gives kind of vague answers to most of the questions, which is what Cheryl and Jack did  but he looks kind of  Contrite or whatever boom like wind whereas now it's just hey you didn't show there's an empty chair  Look Cheryl and Jack are busy people, but they came

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google has historically been very  Their tech nerds they don't show up for BS and I mean they've done some BS but for the most part I  Just don't associate that with Google you don't see them when when I see people at Google talking about politics and in the areas  that I've covered it is  very technical coverage their arguments are very oriented in like  physics and the way things work and so  It may just be that they're like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At the same time they spend tens of millions of dollars on lobbying  Because yeah, that's what they want to send  Right, but unfortunately that's you know  Like so now it became a big thing  Kent Walker might actually be the best guy to talk about the topics that the senator of the house  Allegedly actually want to talk about but but the but he doesn't make enough of a statement about  We got the heads of these things to come and bow before us

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm curious to know I  Mean there there have been strong words obviously  Throughout this and what was it? What did I read here?  Did it the senator Mark Warner says, you know says during the hearing that these companies have all come a long way  But they still have so much further to go  And that Congress is going to have to take action here the era of the Wild West and social media is coming to an end  And I wonder if like I I get what you're saying Stacy as far as Google just being like, you know what?  Write it off. We know what we're gonna get if we go there at the same time like Google has spent so much of its efforts  Lobbying to certain causes connected to this not being there at a what could potentially be a very pivotal point  For the future of these companies basically removes Google from the conversation from being a part of where they get from there  Maybe they would know maybe they wouldn't have any power to do much of anything anyways, but I don't know  It just I wonder what that says about Google's kind of dedication to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lobbyists are still talking to the people the senators aides who are gonna draft the legislation  Google is not stepping away from the equation. All this is is Google saying, you know this public remonstration. I don't I'm not here for it  They're still gonna have the same  Cred with the people who are actually making the laws when the time comes and they may be a gamble on that being like, yeah  We we don't need to be here, but I don't think this is gonna really hurt them. I could be wrong  But everything I've followed in politics and how the laws get done  I'm not worried. I  Wish what you said was true though because it would be awesome for like that to be true. Yeah. Yeah  That to be true, yeah, yeah, well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Then there was just a it was just a fleeting thought. I don't know how important these things end up being  somewhere down

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if they are theater it still matters that you  Show up for the performance in a way. I mean there could be senators who decide to make that right, you know  They're kind of go to  Whipping stick for Google I do think that Google is kind of trying to have it both ways to they're trying to  you know a lot of their public statements have suggested that they're not really a  Big part of this problem that it's and they they did that at the other hearings as well tried to suggest that  Well, we were not really social networks like them  And so it's mostly a Facebook and Twitter thing and kind of you know  Kind of wave their hands around and hope that nobody starts talking about YouTube  Which which is a big part of the problem is and is that the direct comparison right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  like it's obvious we're used to hearing so much about Facebook and Twitter as the  networks that have been  Incredibly abused in this regard. I guess I guess that would be Google's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Definitely. Yeah, I mean sort of worry like regardless of what Trump says about search and the algorithm and all that that's  Ridiculous, but the but YouTube does have a problem and I think  They have acknowledged it to some extent and tried to do things about it, but they really don't like to talk about it  But it is a problem particularly misinformation wise and just the same way Facebook and Twitter are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That actually brings me up. So I was inspired this weekend by I think was a thread on Twitter go figure but  It was based off of a I can never say is an app to Fecky is that he's here  She she did an article back in March in the New York Times on YouTube being the great radicalizer and this thread basically talked about  You know go through your kids YouTube accounts because this is where a lot of this  so I actually went through my daughter's history and started looking at some of the stuff that she was looking at and  Probably 98% of it was fine, but there there were two things that I was like, oh  This is like and again, you guys know my daughter's obsessed with star stables the online horse game  This was like a star stables in group that  Was was not radicalizing her exactly but it was promoting some really crazy ideas  And I was like, holy cow  These people are nuts and my daughter may not recognize that they're nuts  so I actually sat her down and talked to this talked about it with her and I  Guess the takeaway there is a if you have kids  Especially in this kind of impressionable age range  They really are putting  crazy content everywhere and  like  It can be things like PETA for example, my daughter had some wacky ideas about dog food for a while. Thanks to YouTube  Some of them are kind of amusing and some of them are like really scary so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it's just kids. I mean, I think there are lots of  adults who maybe their critical thinking faculties are not that great or  you know YouTube is just something they use for entertainment and  I know I talked to  Guillaume Chazlo, I think is his name a former YouTube  recommendation algorithm engineer and he was describing how  You know, it's only a couple of levels away from virtually any search gets you some wacky  conspiracy theory whether it's that the earth is flat or the moon landing never happened or  9-eleven was an inside job or it's really staggering. You don't have to go  Like you don't have to go down the rabbit hole very far  You only have to click a couple of links and all your recommended videos are kind of nut jobs  And I mean that's bound to have an effect eventually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and I remember coming into my first journalism class actually and the journalism professor  he sent us a  It was the equivalent of a press release, but it was on paper and it was like  It was a done in that format and it was that toothpaste was made with sugar and  You know the whole thing it had like stats and whatever  Associated with it and then we did and this was like literally the first day and he's like I need you guys to write  Something based on this this press release. So your edit. I'm your editor. You just got in here you go and most people  Just rewrote the press release and didn't question  The the underlying fact that it was always that toothpaste is causing too many  cavities because of the high sugar content no one  very few people asked wait does toothpaste really have sugar and  So it was a really interesting exercise in  Thinking critically and yeah, whatever  I think we probably should do more of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we definitely should we definitely should and and I think the  You know, we a lot of attention gets focused on  The big stuff like Russians and the Iranians or whoever trying to manipulate  this or that Facebook group, but I think there is a lot of kind of  Low level misinformation of all kinds with I mean vaccines and autism is is one example  There's a staggering number of people  At least staggering to me  Who believe that vaccines are bad for you and they believe that there's scientific evidence to show this  And it's so it's not just  It's not just the big stuff that kind of gets headlines. There's a lot of just crazy  whack job conspiracy theories out there and I think there's a very receptive audience for them and these tools  And these tools  you know, there were conspiracy theories all the  Throughout history, but you didn't used to be able to share them so widely and spread them so quickly for virtually nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  yeah, the worldwide community kind of aspect that that every little pocket of of  Obsession or belief or whatever there is throughout the world any number of people that also  Agree with that or buy into that thought and the internet is a way to connect them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is really powerful is because I mean if you go to any parenting blog you will find people who I  Don't care what the science says when I gave little Jimmy his vaccine. He turned weird the next day  I mean, I'm not kidding. That's that's out there. Yeah  anyway, so  Where where were we going with all this so Congress I feel like we're in Congress because we're not  What do they need to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you mean? Yeah, what are what are they going to do? What are they threatening to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What so those are two different questions? What should they do versus? What are they going to do? Yeah, and I you know, I'm I  keep trying to  Remind myself that  There are actually so yes misinformation is clearly a problem  troll Russian trolls and foreign actors are clearly a problem, but the solutions could actually wind up being worse in  some ways than the problem and if we if we put so much pressure on Facebook and Twitter and Google to  solve this problem or and or we have  Legislation designed to solve this problem. We could wind up in a you know, a really bad place where  The government's trying to legislate  truth or legislate who's allowed to say things or  Facebook and Google are you know effectively deciding who has a  Place to say things and which things are allowed to be said and that's you know, that's a dangerous road to go down

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely  This is kind of ties in with another kind of threat of news  Today about Attorney General Jeff Sessions who has  Apparently been meeting with state attorneys general this month  About these companies saying they're intentionally stifling free speech this goes back into the free speech discussion  We had just a few moments ago their statement said there's a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition  intentionally stifling the the free exchange of ideas on their platforms and that they're you know that it potentially  there they would move to do what you're talking about to  legislate around this to regulate around it rather and  What is the kind of the long-term ramification of that from a freedom of expression?  Standpoint when the government comes in to say, alright, well, we're gonna gain control of this platform now  and these are the things you can and cannot say and  Yeah, that really

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Big time it's wrapped up with section 230, you know the  Communications Decency Act that protects the platforms for speech that appears there  there's all sorts of pressure inside Washington to  weaken or soften or even get rid of certain parts of section 230 and  Force the platforms to be responsible for the content. So, you know, that's a double-edged sword. It could be  Good in the sense that you could hold them to account for certain types of speech  but it could also be bad because they are  they would kind of then go out of their way to remove speech because they'd be afraid of being sued or or  Having, you know the government come down on them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  God this is such a hard problem sitting here thinking I don't want the government evolved. Maybe if the government or  We had a truly  quantitative thing but the business models are the problem and and  Honestly, the business problems are the business model is what got us in this role and trouble kind of in the first place because it heavily  incentivizes  clicks and pushes up content that that generates  Excitement basically so I'm like what we really need is like a government funded encyclopedia  it doesn't really need to be government funded, but you you basically  You need a place for authoritative information you need a populace that is educated  So one way to deal with this is teach people a little bit better and add this to the curriculum and the federal government does  Have a stake in curriculum. Thanks to you know, the common core stuff  Rules, whatever those are  So that's one aspect and then another would be something. I don't know along the lines of  Libraries or a place where you can  Get authoritative information I  Some people even if you teach them how don't want to think for themselves though  So I don't really know what to do about those people  And I think that you I mean part of the problem is that people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think they are getting authoritative information because they're reading Breitbart or watching Fox News  They they would say on a survey, you know, I trust these outlets  You know  I trust these outlets to give me the information that I'm looking for and they have the correct worldview and  So I'm totally taking care of information wise and they would be wrong, but they but they firmly believe that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there are also a lot of people who you know, obviously there's a lot of mistrust in mainstream media  And so where they where a lot of people end up turning is places like YouTube where they find an independent voice  That that they trust that they say is more trustworthy than the mainstream media  Arguably probably because their worldview matches  The the viewers worldview and yeah, that's just a big challenge

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe and I think that's why trust is so hard. Yeah to you know, every media outlet says well  We were trusted by our readers and so that's what we base our business on is trust and I'm sure they believe that  But there's just as many people who don't trust them maybe more there are people who trust implicitly  outlets that are publishing just outright lies because those lies conform to kind of the way they see the world and  Then Facebook shows them lots of other outlets like that because that's what it does. You know, it's a confirmation bias  machine sure and all the engagement metrics are you know oriented to and I thought that was one thing that  Kamala Harris in particular brought up, you know that it is the business model that and that's where I was going with the  Piece that I wrote about it that why did this take so long?  Why did it take ten years for us to even start talking about?  How these platforms could be used for for ill instead of good is because the business model  Didn't encourage thinking about that. All you all you want is clicks and engagement and  Comments and likes and and emojis and so on and what you know, there's that famous comment from the former  Facebook news feed engineer what Facebook cares about is engagement and you know, what's really engaging

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a no no consideration it seems on the scale to which a lot of this would happen  You know, it always seemed like no matter how successful an internet company was  There were other ones out there to kind of keep one from becoming, you know a multi-billion user  Service like Facebook has just as one example  It just the scale that we're dealing with now is so completely different compared to anything  We've seen before as relates to the internet that poses a huge challenge  And I don't know maybe maybe they should have seen that down  You know years ago and planned for an eventuality of something along those lines, but apparently I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they were told, you know, they were told it's not like so mark planning about this for yeah  Yeah for years and so it's not like Mark Zuckerberg can say well  No one was talking about it. So we know we were gonna be that lots of people  Lots of people were talking about it about the potential downsides and they chose not to pay attention to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe the solution is to do what so many  apparently some Pew has Pew research has a study and says many  Americans anyways are changing their relationship with Facebook just as one example  They say more than half of in their survey  More than half Facebook users 18 and older have changed their privacy settings in the past year  42% have said they've taken weeks long breaks from Facebook  26% said they've deleted their accounts and  74% of all the people they asked said they've done at least one of these things over the course of last year

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a lot of deletions that is more than expected

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that is that is surprising. I guess we'll see that in Facebook's numbers, which I would think Oh  Crikey, you're gonna have less of last earnings was so terrible. Imagine this coming one. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the question is are they getting enough users in new markets to sort of make up for you know, a certain percentage  Deleting it feels like they're running out of really highly internet connected places

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like they  I'm like there are seven billion people on earth  They estimate like 3.2 don't have access to high quality internet connections that are kind of constant and Facebook is that where is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyone how many members it has I don't know Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  2.2. Okay 2.2 billion. So that's a pretty narrow gap and you got to think some of those people a  Probably aren't that interested or B might be an authoritarian regime so they can't get on it  So yeah, they're they might be hitting close to their ceiling. That's why they're like, hey  Let's invent new ways to get people on the internet. Yeah, that's why they want to get into China so badly. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely  So that's okay. So that's changing  I mean it really seems like a lot of the younger users are the ones who are more likely to do these account deletions and  Everything there's actually also another story in here. That's totally related down at the bottom on  Generation Z  About this kind of growing  Desire to log off to disconnect, you know that they're yeah, they're finding that their relationships in  You know in the real world are not as fulfilling as they should be and they kind of point to the use of these social  Media platforms as as part of the reason why so in many ways that would be a retraction is happening  I don't know how I wish my kid would read that article

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was thinking if we could if we only have one really truly screwed up generation, which I guess  That you know, that would be okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There will be some sort of chart and it'll be like now will be like this huge dip and then it'll be back up and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'll even out as we figure out  I mean cuz I do think I mean these things do take a little bit of time to be like, whoa  That probably wasn't good for anybody  I mean everything from you know, I don't know  Television, you know, we had to learn some  Moderation and things. I mean we had to build a rating system and I just but there but there's more television than there's ever been  There I'm not saying that there may not be more social media than ever, but I think we might figure out ways to  Do  Police police it may not be the right words  But to label it or to help it help people understand the effects on them. Yeah form healthier relationships with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and it does feel like we're we're kind of I mean we are still so  early in even the web let alone social networks, I mean, it's such it's like a  Fraction of a second in sort of internet time or world time  And so I think in a lot of ways we are still trying to figure out  How does this work like the early days of the telephone or the telegraph or television or you know, I was reading about I think  It was  Revolving doors were apparently a huge social  Policy issue because no one could figure out how to use them and there was no kind

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is the right way to go in and out of a revolving door?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No etiquette so some so people had to like research it and then decide  Oh, this is how you go through a revolving door and it sounds ridiculous now, but you know, maybe we're still  Maybe we're still developing kind of you know a common etiquette or language about how to do these things and we're so  We're like right after the invention of gummy bears or something  Everybody wanted eat gummy bears all day long and you know, eventually people figured out that's not really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sticky sugar is not a good thing for your teeth. Yeah  Think about how many relationships have broken up over whether to roll the toilet paper over the roll under  You know these things they got it. They got it figured out at some point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if anyone still knows the answer. Everybody knows over the top is right over the top

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody knows I think that's established. Yeah, that is established. All right, my daughter that's settled

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right, settled case law  Top as far as that's concerned  All right, that's about as political as I think today's show is going to get maybe after the break  We'll have some stories that aren't quite so politically charged, but it's you know, it's the top news. I would say the air so  Absolutely necessary to discuss so we got it out of the way for those of you trying to avoid the politics on the show  Let's take a break and thank the sponsor of this episode  And then we'll get back into more this episode of this week in Google is brought to you by rocket mortgage by quick loans  You've all kind of been paying attention. I'm sure to interest rates. There's a whole lot of rising happening  They're expecting more rising to happen by the end of the year. So the trend is up right now  There's a lot of unpredictability when that happens. You don't really know what's gonna happen  You don't know if now's the time to jump or whether you wait to buy a home that causes anxiety  It's not the easiest thing to kind of maneuver or manage  So, you know you want you want someone that's gonna help you through the process and and inspire confidence that you're doing the right thing  Well, our friends at quick loans are doing something about that and they call it the power buying process  It's actually very simple and very powerful for you  Step one is you answer a few simple questions and they're gonna then check your credit for a pre-qualified approval  So step two quick loans will verify your income your assets and your credit  It only takes less than 24 hours to do that and they'll give you a verified  Approval and this actually gives you the strength of a cash buyer and that's I mean, that's that's the best when you're looking for a home  Being a cash buyer is as good as it gets so it's super powerful to have that step three  Once you're verified you qualify for their all-new  Exclusive rate shield approval now what that means is that they're gonna lock up your rate for up to 90 days while you shop  So whatever the rate was right then it's locked in place  If the Fed raises interest rates your rate is not gonna go up within those 90 days  And then here's an even better part if rates happen to go up. Like I said, it's gonna stay the same  But if rates go down  Your rate also drops. So no matter what your your you win and that's  Pretty awesome. They can do that. It's the kind of thinking that you'd expect from America's largest mortgage lender  So to get started you want to go to rocket mortgage comm slash twig  Rate-shield approval is only valid on certain 30-year purchase transactions additional conditions or exclusions may apply  So you want to check that out based on quick loans data in comparison to public data records  Equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access org number 3030  That's rocket mortgage comm slash twig TW IG put that in there get the  Get it all locked up and enjoy your new home  When when the dust settles anyways  all right, so  moving from  Kind of what's going on in the congressional hearings on to other Google things which  Feel feel maybe a little less important. Are you are either of you guys?  kind of  Anticipating the new pixel announcements whenever they may be the new pixel phones. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mean, I want to see them, but I'm not gonna buy a new phone. I don't think what is your phone right now  It's a pixel too. So I usually I'm a I'm a die-hard two years because I'm not  Obsessive

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or  Updating phones. I get it. Yes. Sorry  I think if I didn't do it for a living if I didn't do, you know review phones here for a living  I probably would do the same. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean ask me how long how often I change my thermostat or light switches and I got a totally different answer

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, that's so opposite for me  What about you Matthew what are you using right now I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have this Samsung s7, okay  Which is smashed beyond?  Believe and you're ready to have function well in a bunch of different ways. So yeah, I'm definitely ready to upgrade  And I'm really interested in the pickle pixel. I've always liked the phones  It sounds like  It's gonna be a great phone  to be honest, I was looking at the I  Don't know if you guys you've probably talked about these the Huawei p20 I was looking at that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Purely for the camera. Yeah. Yeah, the p20 has a great camera  From what I understand. I haven't had a much personal experience with the p20 but  Does Huawei have  Have any have significant retail presence in Canada  Like so we while way out out in the wild in Canada

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You see them yeah, and in fact, I've seen I know  Lots of people not lots of people but a significant number who have them they used to be in  Best Buy, but of course, they're not going to be anymore. Right? So that's probably gonna reduce their visibility quite a bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean always a gigantic brand worldwide. It's just here in North America where it's kind of  Pinched off, you know as far as that's concerned. It's harder for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or you can't buy a Huawei that's a Chinese phone  you know, they're gonna be tracking your text messages or  whatever and  And I said, you know, I I  Probably should care about that, but I don't  think if they want to  Save my text messages or it's I'm not involved in any kind of you know  Secret government projects that I know of so I don't I  Just don't think they would learn anything interesting. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it sounds like you're in the two-year camp then and as well with your device. So that's good. Yeah, that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your two years are up. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If the smash screen was any it wasn't any indication  And maybe a whole bunch of other hosts a host of reasons but so basically the pixel 3  I think you guys talked last week about this whole like Ukrainian  Black market like leak of pixel 3 phones. We basically know everything about it at this point

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We do now I was curious does it it still has the fingerprint or fingerprint reader on the back?  But I know some of the Samsung phones are according to some body having them on the front

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Samsung  Well, there's been an ongoing rumor and I don't know when this is going to happen or if Samsung is even gonna follow through  On it, but it's possible that it would happen with the s10 that they would have a fingerprint sensor in the front  Underneath the display so it wouldn't be a separate button on the front  It would just be exist underneath the glass which there are other phones that have done this  But not really a mainstream like, you know premium smartphone from one of the major  Manufacturers has done this yet. And I think the rumor is that there have been patents. Well, that's not a rumor  There have been patents that Samsung has filed  for in display fingerprint sensing  The question is whether that's actually going to appear and whether future phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I would buy the pixel 3 if it had wireless charging like good wireless charging. I think I think you'll have wireless charging  Yeah, it looks like they might and so then I'm like, oh that kind of changes things for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and see wireless charging is one of those things that I've never I've never really kind of  I mean, I've used a handful of times but it's nothing nothing that I've invested in. Let's say I still play

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it always slower? Like is it gonna be?  Slow  Yeah, so it's a good overnight on a table

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what see I that's what I just want to like get a  charging pad basically and stick it somewhere and then be able to put my headphones my watches my everything cuz like  You know right now I I have many different varieties of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Charger and there was that thing right there was the pad but you had to add these

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not gonna add the wires. Yeah, yeah a case a certain case

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  stickers  Don't add stickers Samsung actually on there at their note 9 announcement  They showed off a piece of hardware that was like a dual charging station  So it would charge your phone and your watch but but yeah  I mean I think that the dream the the hopeful destination is some sort of larger pad that is big enough to drop three or four

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Devices on well wasn't someone was working on wireless charging through the air were they done there was a startup?  Oh you being there about it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, whatever happened to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The hardest part about wireless charging through the air is it tends to generate you know  It's it's not as efficient one and it generates heat so you'd hate to cook people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We do have of course Tesla was working on wireless  Electricity and we already have that it's called lightning and it's very safe. So yeah, that didn't work out so well. That's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so you know little frightened of a walking into a room where everything inside of your baby  You know, there actually are very

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Reason or not very low power chips that use Wi-Fi to recharge things  So it's a energy harvesting mechanism that people are researching using Wi-Fi to  But it's it's super low power. It's not like it's not gonna be charging your phone anytime  Huh, but maybe I want it wouldn't hurt  It'd be more like a like a motion sensor or something that maybe not even something that big but like a temperature sensor, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to admit it bugs me. So I have the moto 360  second-generation watch and I  You know, I'm always not where the charger thing is and so then I  Wish I could just put it down or or even plug it into a regular USB or do something  Instead of like you're in the car or something. Well, I'm not gonna bring the little stand thing that charges it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that is super annoying that like hockey puck stand up thing. Yeah to set it into and yeah super proprietary

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no super proprietary no and oh but everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we all wanted to not be proprietary and they all want to be people making it. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're like consumers are so screwed. I'm like tech. We really just like hose that up real bad. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We are track records not not so hot right now  So, yeah, so pixel 3 3 XL apparently hit the FCC so and in that filing it looks like they did call out  Something that allows to the wireless charging. So I think you're gonna be happy with that  Yeah, and  I'm hearing a lot of people like like the 3 XL has well and all about Android. We don't call it a notch  We call it a bucket  Pretty deep notch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bucket is a deep notch. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it has a bucket up at the top but the pixel 3 non XL does not so I'm seeing a lot of people who are  Like seeing these early leaks and thinking well, I'm gonna go for the smaller one, you know  You you make some concessions there within the display  But her gouge or bucket. Why does the larger one have a notch? Yeah, I  mean, I think they're doing it a because  You know  Because Apple did it be they're doing it because there's this constant push towards bezel lists  And if you have a notch then you can get the majority of the display out there goes to the bezel. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just find it for fascinating that  That a notch which is something arguably negative is  People are copying it. Yeah, because Apple has one so if I will hated when Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dumped the headphone jack but everyone not everyone but many companies copied that too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everyone can hate it and then everyone copies it because it's Apple  Yeah, people get used to it with Apple and then they think this is weird. This phone has no notch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the market power and consumers getting hosed again. See see it was so short. We were like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But also it's how people can perceive things differently  So if Apple does it it's gonna be good  Even the fact that it's actually a kind of kludgy solution to something  Right, it looks great because Apple does it so that everybody perceives it as a benefit somehow even though it's clearly not it's a transitional thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yet I think there are some hardware manufacturers that see it as a gamble, right?  Like Apple has a pretty good track record of doing certain things that may or may not have been done before  But then but then making it more popular it just by doing it and so I'm sure some of these manufacturers are like  Well, let's take a bet on some of our devices. Well, I know that too and if our cells are  Really impressive as a result that we know we we bet correctly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just want to point out that high heels were originally a thing for men  Women that adopted them. I did know that  Yeah, really they were mostly for riding horses and so a lot of royalty had high heels

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your clothes out of the bud

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  true

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That you did not need them that you didn't have to walk very far it was all part of this I'm so lazy  Not lazy. I'm so privileged. I don't have to walk and kind of like with the Chinese long fingernails  I'm so privileged. I don't have to use my hands

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly, right  Okay, are either of you smartwatch wearers? Oh  Well, you mentioned the moto you mentioned them the the moto 360. What about you? I know it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Super popular, but it's just like it. Yeah  Exactly. The main reason I got it was because it was cheap and it was circular and I didn't want a watch that was square  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And do you use a Fitbit you have the Fitbit, okay  Well, apparently all these rumors, I don't know why we expect the rumors are gonna happen because  There was an exclusive that the pixel watch from EFA. Anyways that the pixel watch is not going to happen  It's not gonna happen this year  Anyway, so if you were holding out for a pixel watch at the event that still is not yet announced  Even though I feel like we know so much about it already  Wait longer because there will be no pixel watch. I don't know why what why don't they have one yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Qualcomm had it they use a Qualcomm chip and reference design in there  So some people were talking about how Qualcomm didn't have a chip ready, but then did release their chips  So I don't know what the hold on this it may just be like screw it  nobody's buying this thing everybody's apples won this war with their  Inexplicable Apple watch remember how we used to all make fun of it back in the day when it came out  I still do make fun of it. I  Mean I don't I don't need it, but you know, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Google says they they're not interested in developing a watch yet because there's no perfect watch for everyone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There isn't well, and this is okay. This is what's gonna happen  If we let the tech people  like dictate  we're gonna suddenly be living in a world where  driven by instead of customization and kind of  In I craft sensibilities and artisanal blah blah blah may not make sense and feels kind of pretentious  But right now we do have lots of options in things like jewelry and clothing and furniture and in the tech world  That's terrible, you know  So unless we get like this really huge push towards modular modulate  What's the word of much modules?  Modularity or modules that you can just pop into things and design that kind of functionality into  Everything so your appliances your whatever's you're gonna get this weird stupid tech  Obsolescence focused change it every couple years model and we're gonna hate life

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and this is my sort of nightmare of you know, I feel like  Everything is going to look like the instant messaging world did when you couldn't talk to another person  Unless you use their instant messaging service  so when there were three or four and they were all battling except it'll be light bulbs and stoves and cars and  glasses and  Implantable chips or whatever and so you won't you know  I think that's the world Apple would like to have where you just use Apple stuff  And if you don't use Apple stuff too bad, and if you want your stuff to work with some Apple stuff, forget it. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You guys have depressed me again, I know we keep going here we're just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everything is gonna work properly someone that someone I know  mentioned that it was a  key design failure  That John Luke Picard has to specify what he gets every single time and you know  I never thought of that but it is shouldn't it know by now how many cups of tea has the man ordered for God's sake

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it's the 25th century. Yeah, there should be some sort of predictive tea algorithm in there  Come on, it's like oh you  So last 10 days

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, you know, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Listen to a Google product engineer talk about this. This is actually really interesting  It was Mark Spates  Not John Luke Picard, but it's so close. So it's talking about when to use  Algorithms to predict things and take action. So he said if you're hold on I'm gonna I'm even gonna  Article so I don't screw up his percentages because this was actually really it ties directly to what you're talking about  If you are  Nine oh, okay. Talk about something while I Google go go

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is what happens when Stacy Google's okay here it goes property

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, okay. Yeah, I'm not gonna question his tea things his tea  So he says there he divides it into three things. So a curated experience  So think about things like Netflix or suggesting songs from Pandora  He says your AI model should be 70% confident. It has the quote-unquote right answer  Okay, the next one is a corrective experience  so like if  Like a light is on and there's like a motion sensor on a light is his example. So if you're sitting there  And the lights go off you can actually  Wave your hand and the lights turn on so you can correct it pretty easily  so in those cases you need to have an 85% confidence interval and  If you actually want to do something that's gonna cost money for something or a cost a resource so like dispensing a cup of tea  You need to have that be like 99% accurate. That's fair. That's predictive

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I would argue John Luke beats that test. I mean he drinks a billion cups of tea  He's been a starship captain for probably years, you know  They should figure out the tea is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What he wants? Yeah, he's old enough. So his age could come into the factor into the math

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To be five nines confidence interval, so yeah, that's  Ridiculous. I mean you may most people you won't even have that that amount of data to even give them that John Luke Picard. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just before he dies. It'll be like here's your black tea cold  And then he'll die

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah, I mean I think that's I know that we're always like oh this should anticipate this but as someone who's built  Like who's tried to program automations and my house and stuff. This is actually a really  It's a tough problem to solve and I don't think I mean, I know that's where we're like our house should just know this but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, and I do know if the I don't want the people running the  advertising algorithms to  To do that because then they'll just suggest things that you just bought or they'll suggest  The toe fungus cream or whatever that they get paid a lot  Just you know, there's there's no  like  Those ads the metadata the Facebook takes in should be able to serve me the most targeted ads and I still get crap  And it's still would you like to buy the pair of shoes that you literally just bought?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's always the example but it's always so true like still that and that seems like the easiest one for them to like not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and every website doesn't yeah every website you go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe just don't shop online enough. I see a variety of products based on all of my shopping history

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So do you I don't know I shop online a lot but a lot of a lot of times it's it's just through Amazon  So maybe that's my limiting factor. Yeah, you know, oh, yeah, you need to go to other places

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean I get I get ads for anthropology. I get ads for servers. I get ads for like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the sharing of I don't know if this is true, but it feels like the sharing of actual acquisition behavior  Is not as so there's lots of sharing of hey you search for this or you went to this page and it's about this  But there isn't a whole lot of sharing of you acquired this at a specific  Because everybody wants to hang on to that data I guess because it's important

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they think it's so important. I argue that actually a lot of this data is not just useless, but it's actively irritating  So yeah agreed

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they tout the benefits, but I don't know doesn't feel like a whole lot of benefits there  You were talking about automation a little bit  Kind of ties into an Amazon announcement, which when I read this I was like this Stacey probably be  This might be right up your alley Amazon announced support for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Contact and motion sensors with its oh, we just talked about that this morning. Okay. I'm sorry  I just totally got excited finish your same good excellent. That's what I was hoping for

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I mean, yeah, I mean it's just tying into the capabilities of automation in your home. So open the door for example  for home on me as a trigger for  Home automation maybe that you know set something else off when a contact is is removed from a motion  Sensor or a zigbee sensor. I'm not really quite sure maybe you should describe it because I feel like I'm a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amazon and Amazon has created an API for manufacturers. So this isn't for you and I this is gonna be companies that make products  They can add this to their matelma a there. Do we say the name here on this show? What do we do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, we don't we don't I like I like Madame A's let's just do that that works. All right, so the Madame A's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So your skill will have this so the first company that is doing something with it is smart things  So if you have one of two zigbee related smart thing sensors, you can actually  They've are you can actually bring them into an amazon routine  So that's one the other is the amazon echo plus which has the zigbee radio in it  But so far  It only works with the central light and sylvania sensors  so really what this is is a notification to all the manufacturers of  Zigbee devices basically. Hey  You could totally tie your sensors in and I'm really excited about it  but  This is my one beef with amazon this okay. I have lots of beefs actually, but this is a big one  Every time they do this because it's so piecemeal  I have to go through and rewrite and rename and redo routines and it drives me absolutely bonkers  so  That is how I feel about that and I have not tried this out with my one smart thing sensor that can use it yet  So I I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't done it yet. That's the other part. So so what would be the benefit like walk me through?  What what would it allow me to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I could create a routine it basically gives  amazon the ability that a lot of like smart home platforms already have so like if I have  certain types of hubs  I can already like program  When detecting motion at a certain time  Turn on the porch light, right? Okay, so that gives you that kind of routine

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Still don't know how that's going to be implemented as an amazon routine  So that's that's the part where i'd like I need to play with it and try it  But I haven't been home since well, i've been home a day, but I haven't done it yet  I know i'm so lazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not good enough. Yeah, come on get on get on the ball. I was installing light switches this afternoon and yesterday

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was kind of trying to figure out where I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I  Like the idea of triggering other things with these sensors, I think again actually I was reading through this I was like yeah  Google home needs to have this too  Obviously, that's how I feel. Yeah, they all will

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Eventually, so what what they need to develop and what i'm unclear is if this is going to do something like this is  You could just tell  Hey, madam a if my front door bell camera sees motion  Do this and then it actually writes that routine for you  That would be amazing  Yeah, and that's where they're trying to get to but I don't know if that I don't think this actually does that so  bummer  Yet dot dot. Yeah, that's going to happen. Yeah  It will happen. It will happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  uh speaking of amazon one trillion dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to do this thing but yeah, there you go, it's dr evil

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, i'm not i'm not sitting in leo's dr evil chair, so I can only have way to it your hairless cat, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, one trillion dollar market cap milestone has been achieved. It was brief  But it happened on tuesday and I think it dropped down to a paltry  995 billion

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Settle whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know where it's at today, but uh  Not bad amazon, maybe someday i'll be a trillion dollar company, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I find it  Well, I guess as a as a former  Stock market reporter. I find the obsession with sort of round numbers bizarre. Yeah, I mean, I know it's  it's it's human nature, but um  you know the  If it's worth 999 billion, that's still pretty good. Yes  I would agree or 800 billion

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, yeah, I would agree but and you know, this is not the first time that the sap and apple did this early august  Um, so, you know amazon playing second fiddle to am apple as far as that's concerned, but oh my goodness guys it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What what  So this is this is their market cap  I'm just i'm just thinking about  All the ways we could divvy this up and compare and contrast and what would be useful and what would not but yeah  It's the same point you're making big round numbers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and and I do think the the sort of  flip side is that those  Round numbers do kind of make you stop and think a little  um  You know just about how big these companies are. Yeah, and  And maybe it isn't  You know revenue. It's it's the stock market and they're anticipating all sorts of  Future benefits that may never appear, but that's still a pretty staggering  some

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Scooter access today

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  972.96 billion. So no is that all? Yeah  Come back next week

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We'll check back again and actually related. I moved away from  madam a but I should mention also that apparently  amazon says  Madam a operates on more than 20 000 devices now. So amazon is clearly winning the  compatibility  Game, right?  Concern. Yes. Well, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes  And it is the number one when I talk to anybody who's building a device  They're like, yes, madam a is our first option or our first priority followed by google home  but  That's also a lot of crappy  There's a lot of crappy things on there, right?  So it doesn't matter if you have 20k if you don't have the most important ones, right?  amazon does tend to right now still have the most important ones. So i'm not worried about it. But again, i'm like  Let's be real you guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a good point. I remember that with uh  With the the google play store before it was the play store when it was at the android market  And it was like, yeah  Well, we've got tons of apps to compete against apple and it's like yeah, but most of them are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pieces of garbage that will crash your house

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's most of the stuff there that you're gonna find. It's not very good. Thankfully. They've they've improved that over the years, but they have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Indeed actually I had an interesting this is a tangent but  I was talking to someone about  google's desire to get into china  and facebook's as well obviously and  They made an argument that obviously I thought well google wants to get into china. It's a massive market, etc, etc  Um, you know, they want to compete with by do and so on but  His point was i'd be interested what you guys thought but his point was that he saw the big  Draw as being android  so that's something like  80 percent of  Devices in china are android but that it's a kind of lawless frontier because google can't  You know can't act in the country and sort of control it the way they do elsewhere and that that's a big  kind of  Driver for them is to just get in there and get control of  That massive android market

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's a justification as opposed to a rational or a rationalization not a justification. I don't know what i'm saying interesting theory though

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it is. Yeah, I don't yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's see here let's uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what I have to say. Do you want to talk about the url because I was I thought that was kind of cool  But I don't know if you want to talk. Yes, I do. Let's talk about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Yeah google's  Google's focusing some efforts focusing time and resources  To fix what they say is is just a big problem in the fact that urls are complicated. They're complex. They're confusing  they say  uh  That it's going to be controversial but everyone's unsatisfied with them. What do you think? So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw this story and I was like, well, you know  One of the reasons this is a problem is because urls are often turned into like tracking urls, right?  Yeah, so not always I mean there are definitely pages that have poor naming but  a lot of the  Weirdest gobbledygook is totally tracking stuff. So maybe if we didn't have to track that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe we should just get rid of tracking maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe if no one needed to make money, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Get rid of tracking and ads, but you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whenever I share links or post links, I I remove all the gobbledygook deliberately  Yeah, so that I try to  But although I will say as a publisher who puts

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I my ads have tracking codes tied to I clicked on this from stacey. I'm like, hey don't remove that  That's really helpful to me. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See now the shoes on the other foot. Yeah, I know everybody has a reason for those tracking  Once it's your reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The same thing did try this before though, right? I think the wired story mentions that they did try  Because I remember a period where if you clicked on a link in chrome, yep  The url bar would just show you a truncated version. So it just showed you I think the main domain and maybe one  kind of  Slash market didn't show you the full thing. Yeah subdomain

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, if I remember correctly it showed that to you  But if you actually went up there and copied it and then pasted that link into another browser window, you'd get the full  The full thing. Yeah, and I don't know if that if that full thing included the tracking information or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think they just hid the the actual url. Yeah, so it would show you something  But if you clicked and pasted it then you'd get the real one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder why they didn't keep that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know some people complained

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because because because I mean, I guess we're always staring at the url bar  Sometimes that can be a great indicator of of something  Um something well, no, I mean of good or bad, right?  Like you you would check the url and and maybe there's clues in there that if it's hiding it from you  You'd be less likely to detect that something bad was happening or i'm not i'm not really quite sure  in other words something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  I know I find it irritating  when i'm checking links in a newsletter or  Some places that deliberately obscure the url. I hover over a link. Yeah  And then I look down to see  Where is it going?  You know, is it is it something that I actually want to click on and go and look at and if the url is obscured  It's harder to make that decision. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes  So true, I would imagine changes anytime anytime soon  Well, this it really sounds like it's a very nebulous discussion happening right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But at least they're trying to do it sounds to me like they're trying to do it for a good reason unlike say facebook  Which deliberately obscured urls because it didn't want you to click on them and leave facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right that um  Scooter x put something in the chat room that might be worth talking about it's about google buying google's deal with mastercard that  Came out a while back. That's right. Yeah  A few days back. I don't know if that's in our rundown because I don't see it in our  Rundown that was the deal where they were getting purchase activity  Well, so this is the question I have so bloomberg reported that google has apparently paid  Millions of dollars to get credit card data from mastercard  Now and this is a recent story and bloomberg says it's it's just it's new reporting but back in 2012 or 2012  Google actually had talked about a deal with an unnamed data broker or data provider to get credit carding  information  So i'm not sure if the unnamed data provider from that story was mastercard or if this is  new  and so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember reading do you follow lauren winestein?  winestein winestein  Uh the privacy forum so he's got a yes. Yes  Yeah, so he he said that he thought this was kind of a trumped up story. Sorry for the verb but  um that it that it  Was a deal that they announced last year and it's doesn't involve individual purchasers by identity  And so he saw it as a kind of you know, they were trotting out an old story  But I don't know if that's I haven't looked into it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I read the story and it's tremendously unclear if it's the same  I will say that google's not alone in this. I noticed this. Um  In a couple other places for example nordstrom's does it deal with facebook?  So anytime I buy something at nordstrom's it actually shares that data with facebook  Does it post it on your wall?  Uh, it's not posted on my wall, but facebook does know  What I thought it was you which or just that somebody bought that no that it was me it is  It is some of the direct tracking which is why i'm like, I don't sign into facebook a lot of the time, but  Now that i've got a site I do have I am signed in and I don't like it about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were talking about that acquisition data like people actually buying things is the most  At least lots of companies think it's the most  Sailing it is because we're speaking with our our dollars and so that's how you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Someone's about to have a baby because they're buying baby stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, or

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it makes total sense, but it's like really creepy so there we go it it is definitely there's that sort of target

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Example about the girl who was buying pregnancy related stuff and right they sent an email to her dad  It's like what a couple of years ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, they didn't send it to him as like a by the way, your daughter's pregnant they sent it  By the way, you could buy more stuff  Yeah, would you like more it was totally innocent totally innocent  um  so I think this this does look back because the  The justification in the bloomberg story and the justification in the original washington post story from 2017 is the same  It's basically tying the data  From me clicking on an ad to actually purchasing something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the holy grail right like you clicking on an ad means  Little to nothing you actually buying something shortly after you clicked on an ad is huge  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So  Google did point out you can opt out of this ad tracking as you know  If you didn't already know web and app activity  You can go into the online console and do that and that would and then you won't get anything useful. No, but  Yes, that's true. But then I really think about it. I'm like how much do I really care about?  Whether my ads are targeted like is that an okay trade-off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do care because um  Not that I buy weird stuff, but I  I feel like the things because once you know what i'm buying, you know  What's in my home and you know way more about me than?  One i'm aware that i'm sharing maybe but also  I don't think  My ability to determine the weather for example, so google offer like there should be different  Different levels of tracking associate like if I turn this off, what do I lose if I if I just lose google?  Giving me better ads. That's fine  If I lose the ability for google to like they're like well fine  Then we're going to pretend we like we don't have access to your location or other information  And so we won't automatically show you the following things that you rely on and think are convenient, right?  so  it the question is  Do we have some sort of striations in?  what I  Like what I share versus what services get taken away  It does if that makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kind of the trade-off with so mastercard said no individual transaction or personal data is provided

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but the example they give is incredibly misleading then the example they give in this story  Is I click on an ad for red lipstick a lady clicks on an ad for red lipstick and later with her mastercard goes and buys that  Red lipstick the advertiser gets a report indicating as such  So it may not say stacey does but it is definitely linked right to my activity in google because I am  Logged in knows who I am. So mastercard may not get it, but they know it was me  They know I like the question is whether

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like someone knows that it's you presumably mastercard  No, presumably they share that with google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  They have to share that with google if google's tying it to my click  Once it's tied to my click. It's tied to me  I mean, I'm not saying maybe it's a really terrible example, but if that's the example then somebody's not telling the whole truth

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Seriously who's buying red lipstick these days, huh? Yeah, I buy I buy all I have 16 red lipsticks

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have been on the hunt actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And google google is aware of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google knows Google knows stacey lay off sephora, man

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What else do we have here I think we've got a little kind of  Pieces and and bits and pieces here and there like there were some devices announced at ifa. I don't know how interesting  That is for for you guys. I mean there was a there was a number of smartphones that were announced there sony xperia xz3  Uh the huawei honor play a lot of like mid-range devices htc u12 life  Actually, the htc phone looks very similar to the pixel 2  Which if you remember htc was involved in the pixel 2's design  So it makes a lot of sense that they would have some similarities, but the backing on that  Looks very very similar very familiar  I think we have a couple of new ones here  Zte axon 9 there was a new blackberry phone. I think but I don't know if there were any like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There were some new home appliances that are connected to the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, so, okay. So you were you were probably paying more attention. Yeah to kind of the iot stuff that was happening at ifa was  What do you think of ifa as far as a a conference for that type of product?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That I could not go except I didn't go because I was in banff doing the hiking thing so I was not  I was I was I was devastated but I was also like, yeah, i'm not gonna give that up right so  Um, I did try to convince kevin to go on our behalf and kevin was like, eh, and I was like, oh fine  Fine, would you normally be there if you weren't bouncing next year? I would be there. Okay next year. I'll plan a little bit better  Um, because I I think it's a really interesting show  Uh a lot of the higher end appliance vendors are showing off  Fully integrated kitchens, for example  so  A couple things worth noting ge announced that you no longer have to talk to its digital assistant with its kitchen stuff  You can now just talk to madam a so instead of saying  Madam a asked geneva to set the oven to 350  You can just say madam a set the oven to 350  Why does this matter because it makes interoperability a little bit easier so as long as now that  Madam a has native support for ovens  Anybody who makes an oven can do it and we no longer have to worry about you know  Remembering that my dishwasher is by bosh my ovens by geneva or ge and my fridge is by samsung  So that's cool  we also saw  this is a maybe a worrying trend is  Is it melee? How do you say the really high end meal melee?  Melee, I think melee  Um, they launched some products including a new disc for their dishwashers  Which you're like, oh, okay, but what it really seems like is a way to actually buy especially branded soap  And it's unclear if you're going to be if you're going to be able to not  Buy their like through their channels with this particular product  um  it is  Another company did the same thing with refrigerators and water filters  And kind of used connectivity to insert some extra drm there  So that's something to keep an eye on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think it's a really crappy thing for consumers ridiculous a power a power disc a round puck that dispenses  a powder detergent so you buy these discs or do you fill up the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The disc you you do you you buy the you I think you buy the discs

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cool, let's yeah, why to to what benefit other than melee or meal or whatever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're gonna argue that it cleans your dishes better does something fancy and reduces buildup in your dishwasher  You know all the typical. I mean we we know what they're gonna say. That's lame though  it is lame and it's  It is frustrating that instead of offering  Truly better services and and maybe they are  Maybe that's how they'll get you in like I would love a dishwasher  That can detect exactly how much filth is on my dishes and clean them appropriately  Using the minimum amount of water for example, that would be something worth paying for  but  I don't know if it's worth paying for if it also locks me into this stupid  Proprietary revenue generating dishwasher soap, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and they're not small either those discs are actually pretty large  They're gonna take up a lot of space and if you're running your dishwasher  Once a day, it seems like that's gonna be a pretty expensive endeavor

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although the trend of dishwashers you guys is drawers  Having multiple drawers with your dishwashers that you just put open the drawer in your counter  You stick the dishes in you set it to wash overnight and then you've got maybe another one and you can just open that pull from there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  So multiple drawers that operate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Independent as a dish. So yeah, so it's it's aimed at smaller households who don't run  Okay, I I love them they're very pretty like oh interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So like little mini dishwashers throughout your kitchen  Yeah, just to that. Oh just to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I guess you could  Every drawer is a new dishwasher

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Put your dirty dishes in the drawer. They come out clean. That's so why is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's so bizarre

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's it's really neat. Oh someone's asking for both

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, show us a picture  Uh, i'm googling dishwasher drawers just to see yeah, I have I have never heard of this. I haven't either really  No, this is okay. Never I don't I don't i'm not up on dishwasher technology. So no, I haven't really here

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, there's a and remodelista if you google dishwasher drawers, there's a story jason just a little bit down called  Uh remodeling 101 the ins and outs of dishwasher drawers  And they show okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They show the drawers so you can see i'm putting this in other in the dock because it is definitely other  Uh, yes, sorry  I know  Uh, I love I love tangents like this  Okay, so I put the link in there  And you scroll all the way down at the bottom. There's like the third picture down if you end up going there and here  I'll put it in chat so people have it too  There you go. If you go down to the third picture, you'll get a good shot of it  That's the second it's interior  And look at that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See so yeah, the idea is it's for you know, it's space saving and you run that dishwasher just once a day for small households  And then you you basically could just you don't even have to put your dishes away  You you pull from the clean one and run from the dirty one. I would put mine away, but that's just me. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I probably would too. I'd have my kids do it  right  So it's yeah, so it kind of doesn't matter. Um, that's interesting. I had not heard of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so that's a big that's like a trend. Yeah  It's not smart and has no tech

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was gonna say is uh is madame integrated with these dishwashers? Can we rope it into technology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Eventually, they will be yeah, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure, madame wash the dishes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the most exciting things I was talking to somebody about connected appliances actually and they were talking about  Once something's connected to the network you can have accurate timing  And so for people like me who like want to sync my microwave and my oven clocks because they're right next to each other  All to the same time  That's perfect because the internet will actually do it right now. I have to set them like  I know that would be great  Some people this really upsets like my husband and I we all have a person in front of their  We all like are like synchronized with the the time set and we're all like, okay  No  We all press our buttons  That will be a thing of the past. Yeah good. The future looks looks bright  For ocd people everywhere. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  exactly  It's enabling our o cd everyone's ocd inner ocd. Hey, you know, i'm I had not realized last time I was on  There was no, uh, there was no slot in the the rundown for the change log. Why don't we do the change log?  You're on it man the google change log. I love that. This is back  Although I have to say those those icons and the the google logo  little dated  But I guess the changelog hasn't hasn't uh, been a thing for a while  Happy birthday to google one year shy of drinking age here in the us 20 years ago yesterday was the date that google incorporated  was incorporated  uh  Google inc was incorporated 20 years ago  Uh, so happy birthday google. It's good to see you. You're looking good  Get a job  um  chrome is also celebrating its 10 year birthday always  Always living in google's birthday shadow about halfway  Uh, there's a new look to the desktop browser  I don't know if you guys saw this actually my chrome my pixel book updated and I was surprised I hadn't read this story  So I wasn't expecting it and things look awesome. What do you think? I like it. Yeah, I I really like  google's current kind of design  uh  design era  Aesthetic yeah the aesthetic the material theming that they're doing. I don't know. It's it's very pleasing  I think that they've done a good job kind of refining it to where it's at right now. So  Now that's integrated with chrome. You got some other updates like improvements to autofill password management, uh, including integrated password creation  So that's something I love about last pass and now chrome is going to have that embedded as well so you can create  Uh your your passwords and not keep reusing the same ones over and over again  Uh, so make sure and check that out. The chrome update is is available to you now  um  Google assistant is apparently now bilingual. So if you are in a home  With you know, and and maybe there are two languages spoke in your home  Assistant can now interchangeably  Uh talk and recognize and all that between two languages at once  That's neat. I think it's gonna help that is neat. Yeah good idea  And uh, that will work obviously across all assistant functions. So controlling your smart home  Uh, you know all other functions. I think it'll be good for the home  And then this is important stuff google is offering a free content safety api  toolkit  Uh to non-governmental agencies, this is going to put its its artificial intelligence work and its neural network kind of efforts  Uh to task on recognizing and flagging child sexual abuse material online  um also known as c-sam  Uh, it this basically what this means is going to allow for recognition at scale  And kind of minimizing the interaction the need for human operators to filter through a lot of the stuff  Up until now, it's been that would be helpful. Yeah, it's been the task of a lot of you know humans to have a terrible job  I can't even imagine. Yeah  so  They've got their ai on the case. It's going to help assist in uh, like flagging known  Uh c-sam content for review and then also recognizing content that might not have been previously flagged  But that would likely fall into that category. So it's all about kind of minimizing how much the humans actually have to be  Involved in that process  So and then that is that's free. So people are going to be able to put that to work right away  Uh, man, it's been so long since the google change log. So how do I close this? That was the google change log  I'm out of practice on the change log. I love that it's back though

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I really appreciate your like thinking of things like oh, how do I close this which is like  Like  When kevin and I are recording we're always like and uh that I guess that's it. Yeah, we're done. We're done

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Too later. Oh, hello. Oh, it's coming in with a snack

Transcript:  It's i'll show i'll show whatever it is. I'm not 100 sure what it is, but i'll show it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yes, this is where where legendary tv is made I think could pay off exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Surprise i'm pretty sure it's a smart home device  Probably it might be you know something really interesting  like red lipstick

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You ordered it on amazon and it delivered 20 minutes later  Um any anything else in here before we take a break and then come back and do our tips and and all the other stuff  Did I miss anything?

Did y'all not know that?  lumos sleep mask and what it does  is  It flashes light in your eyes to prevent jet lag  What?  It is a 200 sleeping mask that you can purchase  um, and it will  You tell it when you're going to fly  And where you're going and then it starts with through the app prompting you to sleep with it the night before  Or spend some time with it the day before  And it flashes lights in your eyes while you sleep to help  acclimate your brain

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Got it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so  CNET tried this which is where I found out about it and  This person actually said that it it seemed helpful for her flight to australia  As someone who's been to australia from the u.s. It is not going that is problematic. It is coming back. So i'm kind of like  Uh, we'll see but I really want to try it before I go to europe in a couple weeks. So that's my goal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to know what you got. Why can't you tell us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because it's a secret  For a certain amount of time between us  Just between us, you know, just between you and me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah here. Let me turn off the stream one second. Yeah. Yeah, hold on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, carson turned off carson turned off the stream. Okay, seriously. You can tell us now no one will ever know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No one will ever know  Uh, yes. No, i'm i'm sorry you guys I got excited but then I was like, oh this is not what I thought it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right  Fair enough. Uh matthew, why don't you why don't you tell us what was delivered to you?  Huh? What's what's uh, what did you get delivered?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We want to know the last thing I had the last thing I had delivered

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, do you  Actually, you can talk about anything you want. Do you have a matthew's stuff or a number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Last thing I had delivered was a lightning to ethernet connector because my ipad  Wi-fi bluetooth radio suddenly stopped working for no reason. So, okay  Um admittedly, it's an old ipad, but okay anyway, so I was going to mention I saw this the rundown  We didn't talk about it. I don't have a thing  Um, because everything I use is old and busted and so I don't have anything new like stacy my light bulbs  You have to twist and they they don't change colors or  Do anything like that. So  But I did notice that twitter was talking about some new features and I this company never ceases to amaze me. So  The they were saying they're experimenting with new  Features to help make the platform more conversation  So for example, they would show you  When someone was online?  and I thought  So and I saw a couple people responding to it like that is the last thing that we really want  so  Twitter arguably is too conversational already in a lot of ways in terms of bad conversation  Do we need to show people?  When we're online so they can come and you know beat us up about something or troll us  Hard about whatever it was. We just said I just found it. I don't know. It's it's like there's  There are parts of the company that  You know there I mean this is all well-meaning features, but there are parts of the company that don't seem to be aware  of the real problems with twitter and how these features might  not help I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like they had their their different departments are it's like business as usual just continue iterating and again coming up with  interesting features and  I mean this this is not the only time this has happened too where twitter's put out an update and then there's you know  I've seen many times where an update to the service happens and all I see on social media is like, you know  Why don't you instead focus on fixing your your social network, you know, like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's become a meme now as soon as twitter as soon as jack says something  About we are doing x the number one response is  Why don't you get rid of the nazis first, right or?  Give us an edit function. Yeah, and then you can  Change hearts to stars or stars to hearts or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you want an edit function on twitter matthew? I'm curious

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I  Actually sort of go back and forth. I think I think it could be done provided  There was a very short window. Yeah, so if there was a window where  Right after you typed it, you know some email programs have this right after you typed it. You're like, ah crap  You know I said that and I meant this or I spelled this person's name wrong or then you have  I don't know a minute 30 seconds maybe to change it  Obviously, there's all kinds of trouble you can get into if there was just an  A unilateral at all times edit function. So I see definitely see why that would be a bad thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I would agree with that if it's like or maybe it's it's even as short as it is on  Like in in google in inbox or gmail. Yeah, I have my undo send and I think that only holds it for 10 seconds  It's a short window  But it's but it's long enough. You know what I mean?  It's long enough for me to send it and then do that quick scan and be like, oh man  I typed that person's name wrong, you know  And knowing that it doesn't actually post maybe in the twitter feed you send it it appears in your feed  But it hasn't actually appeared for everyone for another 10 seconds. That way you see it in context  You know you can make it the change and yeah, I think that would be the way to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think? I mean, obviously they they have other things they need to work on. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well for sure for sure but they've also got to iterate  What do you think stacy edit? Yes or no edit yn  twitter yes or no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you even on twitter? Matthew i'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  God, i've done some stupid tweets, but I understand why they don't want us to have it  Uh in in i'll be controversial

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead. I thought you were I thought you were about to be controversial

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, I said in no, I don't think we should have an edit button. Okay. All right. That's controversial. Yeah  Okay, I don't like puppies

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know that whenever there is an immutable immutable twitter law or maybe it's a law of the universe that when  Ever a tweet of yours goes viral. It will have a typo in  Yes, all the all the tweets that you type that where you check everything and the spelling is perfect. Nothing happens to them  But the one that everybody will share will have some dumb mistake in it. I'm going to start misspelling every single tweet I send out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't want it to go viral because then you know you don't I don't actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And in the times, I mean I had  I had that unboxing video  Of the amazon box that would that you know  There was an oreo cookie and I mean the box was gigantic and there was a single oreo cookie package in the bottom of that  And I mean  In the case of my twitter feed that may be one of the most viral things i've ever had  And that quickly a box with oreo cookies quickly became political in my feed. I mean it totally like immediately  Like I i'm a horrible person because blah blah. I'm just like whoa  They're cookies

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't know they were gonna pack them so poorly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, he did he did this on purpose to blah blah blah. It's like I promise you there's no conspiracy theory

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just wanted to eat some cookies. That's a classic twitter experience. Like you and I are chatting and I say  Yeah, I just never really liked  You know pancakes that much and then  20 minutes later  Someone is being calling someone a nazi or alleging that you know, it's a conspiracy of some kind

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But twitter doesn't need fixing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's a great conversational platform. It's a town square as jack dorsey. Yes  Uh, let's do it. I still like twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean I still use twitter. I don't use twitter as much as I used to well  I browse twitter pretty regularly. Yeah, I don't post much. No comment. Yeah  I'm the same comment all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've started yeah matthew you have you have really tapered off. Where do you talk now? Well in the summer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I talk actually to people in real life in real life  Yeah, what is that?  It's an overlooked medium, but I  I guess I I scaled back partly because it was summertime and I have other things that you know in the winter  You're just sitting in your house and it's freezing cold in canada not in texas. Obviously  And I was like because you live in canada  Yeah, so there's nothing else to do, you know, but shovel the driveway or get on twitter. So i'll probably be back  more  Than before but I have been reconsidering it it does  I'm not sure it's good. It's a great news source and it's a great  Way of getting information. I'm not sure it's a great  place to spend a lot of time and it can be kind of emotionally  Draining and it can be kind of a certainly a time suck. So  I'm trying to find other ways to  Occupy my time. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  agreed  uh my  thing  I yeah, I guess this is this would constitute a thing google. You may remember you may remember a few weeks ago or a little  while back  Made mention of the titan security key, which was its two-factor  Yeah, that's right authentication security key. It's now available and actually I think it had been sold out for a while  I just checked the store you can buy it right now the kit's available for 50  Ships immediately you get a usb key a bluetooth key and then you get some adaptive adapter connectors  Which I included a screenshot of one of their promotional photos google's photos for how you would plug this into your pixel book  Uh, so it's right underneath this link because it doesn't have a usbc version of the key  So every time you want to use your ultra secure  Titan security key you've got to have another dongle in there, which is just you know, seriously  Is this like a replace

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's up, sorry you go ahead is this a replacement for the ub key or different from ub key similar

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's basically the same same thing. Okay, it's google's own version of the ub key  um, and our ub keys so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I don't know if you guys know this but if I use authenticator, you know on my watch or whatever  Is a hard key like that?  Noticeably better security like is it dramatically better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that they yeah, they consider it to be a step up  From something like that actually having a hardware key that has to plug into the port  Okay, I haven't used one myself and actually this kind of ties in with google  Has the advanced protection feature that they announced like late last year? I think it was that's really  You know, it's like this next level hardware two-step verification kind of account setting that was really designed for people like  You know journalists or politicians or people who have high  high risk  sort of  Yeah, sort of jobs as far as their data and you know, the what would happen if that got out so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I use two factor on almost everything. Yeah, like I use two factor for like dropbox and  gmail and like just about  Everything and so i'm definitely a believer in  Believer and um  Actually zeta too. Fuck you who you mentioned is a big fan of the ub key and says that every  Sort of activist or journalist should have one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah  and I think this might be I  I think I read somewhere that this is more than anything built for google accounts specifically  So I don't I don't know if that means that it won't work on other accounts that support hardware keys  be surprised if that was the case, but  um  Anyways, there you go. Fifty dollars you can get it right now if you like. I think I might order  Dollars what? Yeah, it seems pretty steep to be honest. It seems like you can get a free ub key if you subscribe to wired

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um, yeah, that's what I was thinking subscribe to wired got a ub key

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  uh when you um  When we're talking about two factor  I have been following efforts by companies to like really push this so google is very like hey by the way  You should uh, you should add two factor. It's much better, right and then male chimp, which I use for my newsletter  They actually give a 10 discount when you use  Two factor, which is a nice incentive and then a couple weeks ago like two weeks ago fortnight  Basically introduced kids to two factor by giving them a premium dance for free if they enabled it. Oh, that's right  Yeah, cool. So that's cool since since we're talking about two factor and I think it's a big deal and important  I think like pointing out when companies do things to encourage their users because it is I mean people it is inconvenient  So you do have to make it convenient for people to actually change how they're already doing it. Yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go fortnight. Yeah, that's that's uh, I do remember reading that that was I was pretty interested in that  hopefully kids don't end up locking themselves out because  Because I mean there is that that significant risk with the two factors. Yeah, there sure is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like android police said, uh, the titan security key  A hardware two factor bundle with outdated connectors. That was basically their thumbnail  Review because it's no no c and bluetooth nfc only for android and ios

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
