And Jeff Jarvis is here, professor of journalism from  the City University of New York, the author of What Would  Google Do in His Latest Public Parts.  Hello, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello.  It was so nice being with you last week.  It was so wonderful.  I feel so far away now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I loved hanging in meat space, man.  It was great.  It was fun.  Now, unfortunately, both you and Gina caught some sort of  bug on the plane ride home.  Ioflu.  That's what she called it.  And Gina's really a little under the weather.  Plus, her babysitter's sick.  So that's really more to the point.  So she's with Ed at lying in bed moaning.  But she'll be back next week, I'm sure.  But we've got a good replacement.  He's almost as lovely, but certainly as talented, Mr.  Matt Cutts of Google, one of the earliest employees.  Hey, everybody.  Good to see you, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And let us note that you are a Pixel sandwich, as Matt put it  earlier.  God, I hate you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So both of them are using Chromebook Pixels.  Both of them are using Google Hangouts.  No, Google Talk for the video.  Is that going to be deprecated, Matt, with the  new Hangouts?  Or are we going to have to move to something else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that the trend that we heard at I.O. is that it will  definitely be moving toward Hangouts being  the unified solution.  So it starts out with Messenger and Hangouts itself.  And then there were indications this past week  that things like SMS and Google Voice will eventually  be folded in, which makes it a lot more useful if it truly  unifies all the different ways of talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't wait.  SMS is huge.  And they do verify your phone number when you  sign up for Hangouts.  So I'm presuming that will be the case.  And then I have not yet switched to Hangouts from  G-Talk on my Gmail.  Because it's funny.  I heard all these, does anybody really make calls from Gmail?  I do it all the time.  It's my home phone.  So I don't want to mess with that.  And I even use something called the OHI.  Do you know about the O-H-A-I?  It's a little device.  It's so cool.  That lets me use Google Voice to make, what is it?  The OB, what is it called?  Now I can't remember the name.  The OB-1, Kenobi?  The OBI, that's it.  OB-HI, now I remember.  O-B-I-H-A-I.  And so what I do is that uses Google Chat.  It's kind of weird.  It's using a weird kind of variation on Google Chat.  In fact, it has to patch itself into G-Talk to work.  But then phone calls coming into my Google Voice  automatically ring a phone.  It looks like a landline phone in my house.  There it is.  It connects to the internet.  So it's a VoIP solution that's free because I'm using  Google Talk and Google Voice.  It's really cool.  But that would break as well as the ability to just make  phone calls from within Gmail.  So the solution is not to upgrade on Gmail.  And everybody agrees that that's coming, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's safe to assume we're working to unify things  and make them very seamless and work together well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's always that.  And I think that, and you guys know this, but I think it  really, because of the death of Google Reader, everybody gets  a little nervous.  We all don't.  For instance, Google Voice, I'm dependent on it because I  have many phones.  I'm always changing cell phones.  Google Voice is a unified number that  rings all my phones.  I need it.  If were you guys ever to kill it, I would just fall over in  dead fate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I've noticed ever since Reader, the web has been a  little bit angry, cranky, irritated.  And it's become this meme about, well, is Google going  to shut down this product or that product?  Almost like back in the early days, it was like, oh, Gmail's  beta.  Don't use it because it's beta.  It was clearly really good software.  I hear they're going to get rid of Search.  Go over.  I think Search is pretty safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The end of Search as we know it was what Amit was saying.  That was his tagline, right?  That's true.  Amit Singhal was saying, it's the end of Search as we know  it.  By the way, I don't think I'm stealing anybody's thunder,  but the current versions of Chrome have Voice Search.  They don't have the hot words yet, right?  No, you can't say OK, Google.  Not yet.  Which I can't wait for.  I know.  It's going to be fun.  Search is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I cleared it.  The only real difference is she answers back to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you and I are probably part of the, what was it called,  the Gmail lab test or whatever.  No, because I use apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh.  So I was in the field trial.  We beat up the Google Plus guys about this problem.  So I've had this voice for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said, yes, it is.  Let me show you.  Can you see my computer now?  Yeah.  So I have a little microphone here, right?  No, we can't.  Oh, crud.  As soon as I moved it, it went out.  So I have a little microphone.  And if I highlight it.  You got a Pixel, man.  No, that was why we stopped using the Pixel,  because it wouldn't work.  Wait a minute.  Now it's doing the search.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a weird search.  I am not your wife, sister, or daughter came up the result.  Let's go back.  Ooh.  And I have not done any switches.  This is the first time I've used it.  It just worked.  So I highlight it.  It says search by voice.  What's going on in Santa Cruz today?  And unfortunately, it doesn't have the contextual stuff.  So I can't say, how do I get there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it actually has some contextual stuff there.  Not all of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Joanna was able to say, how do I get there?  And it would then say, no, that it was Santa Cruz  from the previous search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you could do something like, how old is Barack Obama?  And then maybe you can say, how tall is he?  Or how old is Barack Obama?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Barack Obama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, she was talking to me, because it  was a Knowledge Graph, right?  She's talking back, right.  How tall is he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Barack Obama is six feet one inch tall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's one inch tall.  No, I'm six feet one inch.  That is so cool.  So I guess if it's a Knowledge Graph,  it has to be one of the Google Now card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think what's live now is conversational search.  And conversational search is this idea  that instead of typing in one search,  and then the next time you type in a search,  Google has forgotten everything about what you just said.  If you start to refer back to a previous search,  like who is he married to or who are their daughters,  then we start to disambiguate what the pronouns are  and what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or grammatically, I would call it antecedent search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true.  He's a professor.  You just have to forgive him.  Sometimes it slips out.  So Danny Sullivan just said, Matt Cutts,  tell Leo about in Twitter.  And then I have to click the link to see.  So let's see what Danny Sullivan said  we should be checking out here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, I cribbed some of the examples.  Danny Sullivan, he wrote a great article  about the conversational search.  And he was sort of saying he went through three or four steps.  Yeah, it was a great example.  It was kind of funny because when he did the demo,  it worked sometimes, but not all the time.  And we were like, oh no, we want it to work all the time.  And I think Danny's attitude was, hey,  it worked a lot more than I expected.  It's pretty cool.  Yeah, in fact, that's what he's pointing to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's pointing to the conversation.  He says you can go on with the Barack Obama thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You can do three or four levels deep if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  His wife, I think, is one of them.  He did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can do it with anything.  So you can say, how old is Barack Obama?  And then who is he married to?  And then you can say, how tall is she?  And so you can chain it a long conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Danny did this.  So he said, who is his wife?  And he got Michelle.  How old is she?  Then they got her age.  Wow, that is really cool.  And I love that it talks to you.  And so is it your understanding, Matt, that they're going to?  By the way, we should mention, Matt Cutts is here.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, you did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did I say he's here?  Matt works for Google.  And he works to stop web spam.  And he does these great webmaster videos  that everybody should see.  In fact, we're going to play with the philosophy one  in a little bit.  So Matt knows a little bit of where he speaks.  But we should always point out when he's on,  he's not speaking for Google.  He's just speaking as a friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He has a cattle prod under his chair.  And if he does anything wrong, you're  going to see him start buzzing.  Please don't fire me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please don't fire me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I got to do this.  I'm sorry.  Who is Matt Cutts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I doubt that'll work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  According to Wikipedia, Matthew Cutts  works for the search quality team in Google,  working on search engine optimization issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whoa, mind blown.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whee!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who's the old one?  How old is he?  I don't think that's in Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it doesn't.  So that was from your Wikipedia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, basically a lot of the knowledge graph  comes from Freebase.  And a lot of that, in turn, comes from Wikipedia.  So if you have a Wikipedia entry,  we're more likely to be able to answer questions.  And it's neat.  We'll highlight in the knowledge graph  the attributes that we think are important.  So you'll see different stuff for Justin Bieber than for Barack  Obama, for example.  I got to do it.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who is Leo Laporte?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  According to Wikipedia, Leo Gordon Laporte  is an Emmy Award-winning American technology  broadcaster, author, and entrepreneur.  You got the Emmy Award in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, thank you, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, who is Jeff Jarvis?  Uh-oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  According to Wikipedia, Jeff Jarvis  is an American journalist, professor, public speaker,  and former television critic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right?  That's pretty good.  From now on, this is how we're going to introduce all you guys.  I'm just going to play the game.  Ask Google, who are you?  That's so cool.  I love this.  Of all the demos, we saw so many cool demos,  and it's hard to pick just one.  But of all the demos at the keynote we saw last week,  I felt like this one was the one that was, to me,  the most astounding, the one Joanna did,  and the one that was perhaps less covered  than it ought to have been.  Because that's the talk about the Star Trek world.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's funny because a lot of these examples  are sort of toy examples like Barack Obama.  But you can try, who is the prime minister of Turkey?  And you'll still get really good info.  Who is the prime minister of Turkey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You made me do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The prime minister of Turkey is Recep Tayyar Erdogan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he recently met with Barack Obama about Syria  or something like that.  So it's getting to a point, and then we'll  have hot word detection soon.  And a hot word is basically when you say, OK, Google,  and that wakes Google up, Chrome,  so that it's listening for a question.  So you're in the car or whatever,  and you can just say, OK, Google, I heard about this.  I want to ask about this question.  And the barrier for doing a search is much lower,  and the results get back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you don't even have to hit your chest.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When does the Always Ons voice come up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you know?  I mean, you probably have it already at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Normally, Chrome puts out updates every six weeks or so.  So I think you'll honestly need it later this summer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, so it's going to be six weeks or so.  Yeah, 27 just came out yesterday.  So I get it.  So it needs a Chrome update for this to work.  Usually, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not so sure about hot word, but I'd assume that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is only in Chrome.  I noticed it's not in Internet Explorer.  I tried to get it to work, and it didn't.  Well, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not in Internet Explorer.  Normally, for something like hot words,  would it come out in the beta before it comes out  in the stable release?  Yep.  Or they just hold off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Normally, you'd see it show up in what they call Canary,  and then Dev, and then Beta, and then Stable.  That makes sense.  If you really want to live in the future,  you can sign up for the Canary build,  and you can see everything just as it's being checked in.  Is Canary pretty stable?  Whenever I've done it, I've usually done developer.  Canary is basically like a nightly build,  and so you can't have occasional trouble.  But it's, you know, if you're really in a little bit of a  edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dev was pretty dicey for me.  So I'm in Beta and happy, but Dev was, hmm.  And you cannot downgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can downgrade.  But I've been using developer for a long time,  and I've had to downgrade to Beta maybe twice because of  various, like a bug in Google Docs or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, if you go to Canary, which is the daily, right,  is the dailies, it says, at least here,  it will run in parallel to any other channel you've installed.  So you'll get two browsers.  So you don't even have to worry about a downgrade if Canary's  wonky that day.  So I'm going to install Canary right now.  That'll give you the best shot at having always on voice search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My fellow Pixelmate.  Well, we can't do that on Pixel, though, right?  Because the browser is the OS.  Yeah, it's a little trickier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because they want to, I mean,  the last thing you ever want to do is brick your computer,  which if you upgraded to a Chrome that wasn't stable,  that could have consequences.  So I think for the most part, if Chrome is your only interface,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you really don't want to break it.  You're like, OK.  But that's not why people get Chromebooks in the first place  anyway.  They get a Chromebook because they  want reliability, security.  So Beta, I mean, there is a developer.  In fact, that's how Jeff had been running,  is in developer mode so he could use Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I've still got it in developer mode in case  there's a backup to this.  But I'd like to get normal reading.  Matt, do you want to mention you're a 30 day challenge  you're on right now?  Are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so I'm actually, every month  I do a different 30 day challenge to try something new.  And my 30 day challenge this month  is actually to use a Chromebook Pixel for 30 days  as my primary computer.  And it's been really easy.  There's only been a couple of times when I've wanted a Linux  laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was a loaded question.  Please, Louise.  Actually, having received, and I should say,  this was my free Pixel from going to Google I.O.,  it's really great.  I'm not dissing it.  I like it a lot.  It's merely, my only thing is you probably  don't want to get it if that's going  to be your only computer.  It's hard to, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has been my only computer for three months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, but you're not a programmer.  You're not a photographer.  No, you're not.  You're a writer.  And writer's needs are few.  There are very few programmers in the world.  They're strange.  All right, I've just shifted to Canary.  I'm excited.  Anything could happen at any moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Matt, what have your hiccups been?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.  Well, one's really obscure.  But the one that was the funniest to me  is I don't know if you guys saw earlier this month,  John Dvorak's blog got hacked.  Yes, yes.  And originally, he thought Google was wrong.  And it was Google's fault.  He's such an idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He had this whole conspiracy theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, because he had written something negative  about Google.  John, you're running WordPress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What a surprise.  You got hacked.  Yeah, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The old version of WordPress.  Exactly.  You got to keep it patched.  So I wanted to use the program called WGIT just  to fetch the page so I could show him, hey,  here's the part of the page that's hacked.  And there's no WGIT installed on my Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is a terminal, but you can't install arbitrary Linux  commands in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd have to install Linux or something.  But I could have SSH to a computer and then use WGIT.  I was a little lazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there is, in fact, there is an SSH for Chrome extension.  I've used that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, on the Chromebook Pixel, there's  an SSH built in, like secure shell, I think they call it.  And it works really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So are you coding on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have done a little bit of, I'm trying  to tinker with my blog and sort of reconfigure it a little bit.  So I have been SSHing into my WordPress host, my web host,  and tinkering with configurations and stuff like that.  A lot of people at Google use it for coding.  Really?  Yeah, they've actually been pretty happy.  What do you use?  Programmers often just stick with like VI or EMAX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're using VI and terminal.  Never mind.  I don't know what's wrong with EMAX.  Come on now.  I mean, you should be happy.  A little Lisp coding and you can do anything.  Exactly.  Yeah.  OK.  Yeah, you're right.  What am I asking?  They're not using IntelliJ.  They're, you know.  Right.  But it's things like that.  If you're using the computer as a more serious tool,  you need an IDE or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here you go again with your judgmental ways.  What are you lording yourself about?  Your uses are more serious than mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Trey Ratcliffe was sitting here on Sunday.  And he said that, he didn't say it replaces Lightroom,  but Camera Awesome and all of the things that it's doing.  I agree.  Those are great.  I love the automated GIFs.  I love what it's doing.  I like the automated GIFs too.  Yeah.  Aren't those cool?  Yeah.  A little GIF joke.  I got the GIF GIF.  I am not going to be, I do not believe  in the tyranny of the programmer.  Just because the guy wrote it doesn't  mean he gets to say how it's pronounced.  But you called it GIF, right?  I did, because I feel guilty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we get to call you Leo Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just because it's your name.  That's my name, not the.  Well, I don't care.  So you call it GIF, Jeff?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's GIF Jeff.  No, because it's not a J. It's a G. It's a GIF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But a giraffe is spelled G-I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to admit, I pronounce it GIF.  And on Twitter, all the people who call it GIF are like,  oh, you people are so smug.  I can't believe.  Language evolves.  And all the people who call it GIF are like,  of course that's the right way to do it.  You can only do it this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, English does not give us a clue.  Because GIFT, G-I-F-T, GIFT, and giraffe GI, both have.  There's two ways to do it even before an I.  So English helps us not a wit.  I don't think just because you wrote it means you get  to say how it's pronounced.  Frankly, I think I get to say, is the guy who  is the only guy who pronounces most of these terms on the air  and has been for since 1991, I, Leo Laporte,  and the guy who gets to decide how things are pronounced.  Here's what I want.  I want the internet.  I am president of the internet.  But seriously, until recently, people  weren't talking out loud.  It was all the written word.  And so there was nobody knew how to pronounce it.  We fought in offices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, we fought.  I want somebody who's Dutch to say it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  GIFT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like Van Gogh and hock.  It's a GIF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the nerdiest discussion.  We need Gina here.  I love it.  This is the geekiest discussion we've ever had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it.  So we are going to get at some point this summer,  you think we'll get that.  Now let me ask you about the always on in search.  Because one of the things that some people have brought up,  doesn't bother me, is that, whoa, that means  Google is always listening.  Is it always scanning all of the sounds  it hears looking for OK Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I think if you were to enable the hot word thing,  I think it would be listening to the pattern.  It would have to.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But of course, you don't have to enable it.  And it's local.  It's local only.  Right.  That was the thing you asked that question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  It's local.  Well, I would assume that the hot word detection runs locally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not like it's a stream,  a bunch of audio over the net.  Like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would make sense.  That would reassure people.  So it's just some audio grip going on in the Chrome.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's funny because Chromium is open source.  So I love these when people get paranoid and they're like,  Chromium is watching or Chrome is watching everywhere  I go on Google.  It's like, OK, number one, it's open source.  Number two, you can turn on Wireshark or Etherol  or whatever you want to call it and watch as you're surfing.  So.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  That's one of the reasons I like open source.  So you can, by the way, the Blink team this week  removed 8 million lines of code from WebKit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it Blink or was it Apple?  I think Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple did it?  Because I thought the reason that they were forking WebKit  is so that Blink could take out all of the code for platforms  they didn't care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Well, and that's true.  And so for people who don't know,  WebKit recently forked.  And so there's Blink, which has got a lot of Google  contributors and WebKit continues  to have a lot of Apple contributors.  Opera went with Blink.  Different people are sometimes slightly picking sides.  But both sides have started to clear out  code that's not maintained.  So I think something called Shadow DOM  got deleted on the Apple side because there wasn't  a maintainer for it anymore.  Well, that seems fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, can you chat?  Can you call Danny Sullivan and see if he wants to be on the show?  He keeps tweeting me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  He was tweeting before.  He sounded like his nose was at the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin Marx says this every once in a while.  Please come on the show, Danny.  So one of the things he says is, of course, OK,  Google is only heard by Chrome.  But everything after has to go to Google for the search.  Right.  Now, did you know that?  Well, but Danny wanted to make that clear.  And that's completely appropriate.  He does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At the same time, like with Android, voice recognition,  it tries to be accurate and it sends it over the network.  But if you don't have a network connection,  your Android phone will try to do voice recognition locally  as well.  And so you can imagine having those sorts of fallbacks.  But yes, it's true.  To do the best voice recognition,  you want to send it over the network.  All right.  I get Canary running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me just try here.  I'm going to talk to Canary.  OK, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing.  Well, it's your Windows machine, no doubt.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But no, Canary Windows, Canary on Windows.  The other one worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you don't have to turn it on.  I think you have to turn on the function, Leo.  You've got to go into flags.  Oh, he's old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm not exactly sure.  It might be a Chrome extension for now.  I don't know exactly how they plan to roll it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all right.  I'm sure it's not in here.  Is it about, what is it, Chrome colon slash slash flags?  What do I have to do?  I think so.  But Matt would know better.  Yeah, there it is.  Careful.  These experiments may bite.  Wow, boy, Canary has a lot of extra crap in it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  I am not going to mess with this.  Holy moly.  I don't know what any of this stuff means.  I could turn the script bubble off and on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw Rick Byers at I.O. and he had one that was just  for the purposes of a demonstration so he could  show where things moved.  And so it left traces of his fingers across the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was fun.  So I hear you were on Howard last night or yesterday morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I was.  Well, I brought Gina's point up on Howard.  What?  Because what Zach Braff was on and talking about Kickstarter  and Howard was trying to understand Kickstarter  and all that.  And so I called and I said, I don't agree with this  because I like Kickstarter.  I like you, Zach.  I like what you're doing on Kickstarter.  But I've heard some people, Gina Trippetti,  say that they fear that Kickstarter will be taken over  by famous big Hollywood mobile types like you.  And he insisted not.  And he said he's been spending the last month explaining  Hollywood financing to people.  And said that one thing Kickstarter told him  was that Veronica Mars and Zach Braff brought a huge number  of new contributors to Kickstarter, who in turn  contributed more than $400,000 to other things.  Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's very interesting.  I have to admit, I did join in on the Kickstarter  for the Zach Braff thing because he had some tier that said,  at this much, I will record 20 seconds of video  with you saying whatever you want.  And so he would almost do like your telephone answer  machine message or something.  Oh, that's awesome.  Wouldn't it be great to have Zach Braff talk  about the importance of White Hat SEO and voting?  Did he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Has it happened yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm waiting to hear back on how to redeem my sponsored level  or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hi, this is Zach Braff for Google.  That would be awesome.  It would, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is Zach Braff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe in two-factor authentication.  You should, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, speaking of which, Twitter has turned on  second-factor authentication.  They did it today.  And that's why my phone was going off before the show.  Because one of the things you have to do is turn on SMA.  Remember the old days of Twitter?  It was all about SMS.  And 40404 was their short code.  And you could get all your tweets in text.  Now, that would be a very bad idea today.  Because as I found out, your phone goes off constantly.  So you have to authenticate the phone you're going to use.  Because that's how they're going to send you  the second factor, six-digit code,  just like Google Authenticator.  And so I turned on my phone.  And then there's a checkbox in your settings.  Apparently, I believe it's on everybody's Twitter account  now.  And from now on, when you sign up for Twitter,  as I just did on this machine, for instance, it'll say, hey,  whoa, what's the code?  And you have to have your phone.  And it'll send you a six-digit code.  So that's good news after all the Twitter  hacks over the last few years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a great idea.  I'm really glad they added that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you guys set the stage in many ways.  So now Facebook does it.  Microsoft does it with Outlook.  Google, of course, one of the first to do it.  And now Twitter does it.  And I think that's great.  Yeah.  I think that's really great.  As I have in all four.  And we were also talking before the show,  and I think it's worth bears repeating,  that Google Authenticator, which I run on Android,  is just a version of this is a standard,  this form of authentication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.  Yeah.  It's called a like TOTP, time-based, one-time password,  or something like that.  And so any piece of software can implement this standard.  Google Authenticator is a really good one.  But the beauty of it is that now someone  has a client for Windows Phone.  And so you can do it all on that.  And you can even take the secret, the QR code,  and you can scan it with multiple phones.  And so you can have the same secret on three or four phones.  And then whichever one you have with you,  you can just say, OK, based on the current timestamp,  this is my password.  This is my six-digit number.  So it really makes things secure.  But a lot of people have this misconception,  oh, I can't get texts.  What if I'm in a foreign country?  You don't need to have an internet connection.  It all runs locally on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And unfortunately, right now, Twitter  doesn't seem to be using that, although that  doesn't mean they wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, it sounded like maybe Twitter's, my guess  is maybe they're in a hurry to get it rolled out quickly.  And so they're sending texts for now.  But there's no reason why they, in theory,  couldn't use this as a way to do it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then a little approach.  And I can show these, because without my password,  the codes are worthless.  Every 30 seconds, they change.  But I have one for LastPass, one for Gmail,  and one for Outlook.com.  And that's the Google Authenticator running.  And every 30 seconds, you get a new six digit code,  which you'll need if you want to re-authenticate any of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in fact, I've got it set up on my WordPress.  So the standard is implemented by a lot of people.  I did a blog post a little while ago  that talked about the number of people that support it.  And I think it's LastPass, WordPress, Dropbox, Amazon Web  Services, Drupal, Stripe, Dreampost, YubiKey uses it.  And then that's in addition to all the folks like Microsoft  and stuff as well.  It's a little bit of hassle, but it really  gives you so much more protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every bank should be using it.  Amazon, please, we're begging you.  Amazon, start using it.  I mean, all of these places you're giving,  you know, this password's important.  And having a second factory just makes it so much.  Now, let me ask you.  That means before you do admin on your WordPress blog,  you're asked for the code?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, every time I try to log in,  it says, give me your password.  And then it's the exact same.  Type in the six digit number, and it changes every 30 seconds.  So I just whip out my phone.  And then it remembers it for, I don't know, 30 days  or something like that.  So it's not like I have to type it in each time  I want to tweak my WordPress blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you know the plugin's name?  I'm going to look it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  I believe it's called, well, it's just  called Google Authenticator.  Oh, OK, cool.  Yeah, so if you use WordPress, just  search for a plugin called Google Authenticator.  And then look for the one that has a lot of downloads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not the one that for downloads.  Google Authenticator will protect the site.  The one I'm looking at is 17,517 downloads.  That sounds right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's the one.  That is really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matt, Matt, Matt.  So let me ask you this, since I happen to have you here,  just as it just happened, on Twitter,  there's this thing I'm getting now where Russian accounts find  old tweets and then retweet them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's happening to me.  Out of nowhere.  I get a ton of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think that, what are they trying to do?  I will, OK, if you're writing a bot for Twitter, you can,  write nonsense, or you can cycle through in common quotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is it, horse ebooks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Horse ebooks, yeah.  Or you can have a list of 1,000 predefined tweets.  But the easiest place to get tweets and content  would just be to mine the history of Twitter.  So I suspect they're trying to look real  by just recycling your content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I've always wondered, what is the value  in these Twitter bots?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you're a spam fighter at Twitter,  you probably say, well, most Twitter spam accounts  are probably two days old.  So now if you're a smart spammer, you probably say,  oh, I'll leave my account around for a long time,  make it look normal, tweet three times a day.  And then three months from now, ha ha,  I'm ready to attack people and I look like a real Twitter user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're waiting for horse ebooks to do that.  It's apparently, this is a very long term strategy from them.  They've got 17,000 tweets and they're still just random.  I think they've realized, hey, wait a minute,  we're getting a lot of traffic.  No, every once in a while, see a millionaire speaks?  That is a plug for a book, right?  That's spam.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Matt, do you and other spam fighters  like the fabulous four get together?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, like whenever we came up  with the realm no follow attribute,  it was great because there was a lot of people,  I think we met at Yahoo and a bunch of people  were all at a round table.  But at the same time, you have to worry about,  you don't want to be accused of collusion or anything like that.  So we often see each other at search conferences,  but it's not like we compare, what do you think of these guys?  Oh yeah, we don't like them, that sort of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a big issue, isn't it?  You can't, companies have to be very careful about that.  You need a lawyer in the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it makes sense that if we can cooperate  with other search engines on like how to reduce malware,  you know, or completely open standards, all that sort of stuff.  So we've done some of that.  But you have to be a little bit careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, you know, I just imagine this fun thing  where they all get together and play whack-a-mole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you hear? What do you know?  Who's at Source Ebooks? What's going on?  So let's take a break.  By the way, how is that 30-day challenge going?  How many days in are you on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I usually start it at the beginning of each month,  so I'm 22 days in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it sounds like you like it.  Now, here's the question. June 1st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So that's the interesting thing.  I honestly was planning to go back to my Linux ThinkPad.  And then I remember it was May 12th.  May 12th was the day I was like, you know what?  I could just stick with this Chromebook.  So we'll have to see for sure.  But I mean, the screen is so nice.  It is beautiful. The battery life is better.  So it'll be a tough call. It is gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. It is gorgeous.  All right, we're going to take...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huh?  I've been living la vida Google solid on three months.  It's worked. I don't even work for the place.  And I've got the pot on my back. It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're the most senior guy living in the Google Cloud  with the Pixel, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Him and Rupert Murdoch.  Yeah. No.  What is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Get it out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So can you see my screen now, Chad?  All right. This is a wonkiest setup here.  How about Danny? I think Danny said he'd do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Danny is unavailable. He only had a few minutes.  Oh, he was just in there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said he tweeted that his kid was in the room  when I mentioned it and his kid laughed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That Danny, they're talking about you.  Exactly. I love it.  Hey, let's talk about Ting.  Ting is cell phone service reinvented.  No BS mobile service.  They're an MVNO. That's a mobile virtual network operator.  It means they resell a Sprint network.  So if you've got good Sprint coverage where you are,  you really ought to look at replacing  your current carrier with Ting.  Here's why. There's no contract.  It's always month to month. Always month to month.  There's no early termination fees.  There's no bundling or ride-along services.  They don't charge extra if you use more bandwidth.  They rebate you the bandwidth.  Actually, they don't even charge you in the first place  if you use less bandwidth. I'll show you how that works.  You get a credit for unused service.  It includes with all Ting phones, voicemail,  caller ID, tethering, hotspot, no charge,  three-way calling, call forwarding, nothing mysterious.  And it really works great.  The best thing to do is go to twig.ting.com  and do the little savings calculator, bring your cell bill,  or you could just go directly to plans  and kind of do a sample. Let's do one right now here.  It's $6 per phone.  So this is great for companies or families  that want to have a lot of phones.  Let's say four phones, a family of four.  So that's 24 bucks a month with the phone.  We'll choose our plan.  We don't need a lot of minutes. Let's say a thousand minutes.  We do need a lot of messages. Let's say 2000 messages.  And let's go all the way up on data.  And this is going to be a shared pool.  So with three gigabytes of data, 2000 text messages,  3000 minutes, the total for the family,  for all four of us is 110 bucks.  Four phones included, 110 bucks.  Now, here's the beauty part.  You don't use as many minutes, no problem.  They don't charge you.  What they do is they send you a bill  at the beginning of the month  and they adjust it at the end of the month.  You use more messages, no problem.  They just move you up to the next tier.  The 4000 message tier is three bucks more.  So they just move you up to the next tier.  And it's under $13.  Use more data, same thing. Use less data, same thing.  So you never pay for more than you use  and you never get a penalty if you use more than you said.  There's a wonderful online control pay.  Geeks love it because you get all,  are you an information junkie?  You'll know everything about what's going on  with your phone service.  No hold customer support during business hours.  If you call the Ting helpline,  a real person empowered to solve your problem,  will pick up the phone and will stay on the line with you  until the problem is fixed, which I love.  They also have great customer forums,  help system, video tutorials and startup guides and more.  So here's how it works.  You're gonna go to Ting,  bring your bill, do the savings calculator  just to see how much it's gonna save you.  Then go to their device page.  Now remember, these are unsubsidized.  So these phones cost a little more,  although I'm gonna save you some money.  And they have a big variety of phones.  I mean, they have inexpensive phones.  They have Mi-Fi style bandwidth devices.  They have used devices.  So you could find a phone that's right for you.  You might give a used Galaxy S2 to the kid  and you might get a Galaxy Note for yourself,  that kind of thing.  Note 2 for yourself or a Galaxy S4 for yourself,  whatever it is you want.  You can even bring your own.  An eligible Sprint devices can be converted to Ting  or take your old device, sell it to Ting  and they'll give you cash to help you buy the new phone.  There's lots of ways to do this.  And if you go to twig.ting.com,  whatever you do, you're gonna save 25 bucks  on your first Ting device.  So they've got all the big,  let me just see what the newest stuff they got.  Yeah, they have the Galaxy S4.  It's called Dearly Beloved.  They also have the HTC One,  which I have to say I'm really liking,  really liking that HTC One,  but I carry the S4 most of the time.  Both excellent.  And by the way, I paid $800 for my S4.  It's $571 with the Ting discount that we're gonna give you.  So that's a good deal.  In fact, it's considerably less than Google's gonna charge you  next month for the Galaxy S4.  twig.ting.com, try it today.  You're gonna love it.  And I love it that they're changing  the way cell phone companies work.  Or maybe they're not, but at least you can do it with Ting.  So far, the cell phone companies  don't seem to be backing down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know why, I don't know why.  Well, I saw Tony Hale from Sharp Beats said  that he goes the opposite of what will Google do.  He tries to just do nothing that Google would do.  Oh really?  Nothing that Google would do.  It was a good post.  So Leo, on the rundown under your tip,  just so you can find it,  I put my good friend from the Netherlands, Bart Brauer,  has put up the pronouncer for GIF.  But he's Dutch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is the Dutch.  I know, that's what I wanted.  Oh, you want it, okay, from the land of Van Gogh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he did it like that, so you'll see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, well, that's good, let's see.  Oh, he put it on SoundCloud, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's not GIF, it's not JIF, it's just GIF.  I want an animated GIF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He gets the wetness that you can't get, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, Jeff, did they do that in real time,  in the amount of time that you asked for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he tweeted me a little joke,  it's CHCHCHCHCCHCIF, and I said,  I don't know why I have to have SoundCloud.  So bingo, Bart was there.  Bart is a newspaper guy from Amsterdam, he's wonderful.  Thank you, Bart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The power of the cloud is strong in this show.  We can find out anything, anything you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, everybody, flush at the same time.  Let's see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go to Wikipedia and make a new person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room says,  Google Now flag in Chrome Beta.  I guess I could turn on Google Now cards,  or I guess notifications, right, in my Chrome Beta.  So I'll have to play with that a little bit.  Wow, that's a good reason to go to Canary.  It's nice, it puts a little Canary,  or you could say gold, Chrome icon in your taskbar  to go next to the Google colored one.  Let's see, what other news do we have from the Googleverse?  I'm just trying, as long as we've gotten mad,  I'm just trying to think of some Google I.O. stuff  we could go back over.  I think it's the case, Babel,  which we kept hearing about, that's Hangouts, right?  Babel.  No.  Is it Babel, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good, because that's what I was calling it  until the chat room said it's Babel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Hangouts, Hangouts.  It's Hangouts, it's Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Babel is pronounced Hangouts, in case you wonder.  And are you gonna get access to the quantum computer,  and why the hell is Google buying one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a really interesting question.  Quantum computers are good at exploring a space  all at once in parallel.  And so instead of doing iterative computation in giant,  trying out one thing at a time,  they explore the whole space kind of all at once.  Like the human brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, like the human brain.  The human brain is massively parallel.  It's not fast, but it's massively parallel.  Speak for yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have serial brains.  And Google is really good at, hey, the query is Katy Perry,  send that out to thousands of machines,  and everybody do their computation,  and then come back with the best result.  So if you read that article,  it talks about artificial intelligence,  and Larry really enjoys anything related  to artificial intelligence.  So there might be a couple different angles there  that are interesting to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would you say, I mean,  Ray Kurzweil is now at Google,  so he's kind of the most famous AI researcher out there.  Would you say that things like voice search  and Google Now are using AI techniques?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would.  In fact, Jeff Dean, there was a good session at Google I.O.,  and I think the video is live now,  that had Jeff Dean and several other Googlers,  and they talked about how they're doing deep learning.  So they have a project called Google Brain  that basically tries to do massive neural networks.  So the idea is you don't just have  a single level neural network,  but you have multiple levels,  and you just sort of set it loose on things like YouTube,  and it learns to identify cats.  And so you can use that  for a lot of different applications.  Specifically, they've improved the voice recognition,  and then once you figure out all the right weights  for the neural network, then you can bake that down.  And so that's why your Google phone gets a lot better  in terms of voice recognition,  because the model takes a lot of computation to do,  but then it's pretty small once you've figured it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pretty exciting.  Yeah.  I mean, for a long time,  AI, natural language, all of this has been a hot topic,  and computer science, and then it felt like it,  they were giving up, frankly.  Like, well, we tried it, and it's not really working out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it seems like there was  sort of a blighted zone for a while.  Like, when I went to grad school, it was like,  oh, don't study artificial intelligence,  and they have to rebrand it to machine learning  and stuff like that.  But Google is definitely a haven for people  who want to target really interesting applications,  including image recognition,  and stuff like that.  There's the neuron that learns to recognize a cat.  I've seen some videos of this,  and it's pretty spectacular,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  as it refines the vision,  it gets better and better and better.  I guess you showed a lot of cat pictures,  and it starts to say, oh, this is kind of the platonic cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and the beauty is you don't even have to segment it.  So you don't have to do any training and say,  hey, people come up with 1,000 pictures of cats.  Instead, you just literally set it loose  on either the web or the images on the web or YouTube,  and you let it pick out what are the distinctive things.  So if our brain has a neuron for Jennifer Aniston,  then you would assume that the deep learning  would eventually develop a neuron for Jennifer Aniston.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  I think I did that already.  There's something, every time I see her, I go, meow!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Meow!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see this, the Fiat photo bomb  on the Volkswagen headquarters in Sweden?  That's a fun little one.  Some smart Fiat employee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They saw the street view coming down the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like, ooh, ooh, hurry, hurry.  And they drove right up in front of the sign  that says Volkswagen headquarters in Sweden,  and they put a Fiat there.  Oh, man.  That's good.  I want to see more of that.  Yeah, that's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Down there on the page, I think Leo's photos of-  You can see the car coming.  Going there, also caught by the street view car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can see the whole thing, it's documented.  Here it comes, he's driving in, yeah.  That's so funny.  God, you know, anybody who sees that Google street view car,  you gotta find a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do something.  I can't wait to see one in the wild.  So here's another odd one, Leo.  Today, Google had a Big Tent event in the UK,  where they do these things as policy events,  that's what I went to New Delhi for.  So it was about a bunch of topics today,  but they invited Ed Miliband, the labor leader,  who came and knowing full well what he would do,  he spanked Google on this tax thing, which I also-  Because Apple's getting spanked right now.  I've written in The Guardian about this,  I've been on BBC about this.  Yeah, Apple's getting spanked right now.  Apple's getting spanked right now too, but also,  well, the absurdity of this is it's not the problem  of the company, it's a matter of,  I've said this often now, of lawmakers writing new laws  and diplomats negotiating new treaties with other countries.  But it's not up to Google to decide how much they,  oh, we think we should pay this, right?  They're minimizing what they need.  But nonetheless, I thought it was fascinating  that they would go ahead and invite this guy,  without challenge, to come on and challenge them  at their own event.  Good.  So I thought that was cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what you ought to do,  the courage of your convictions.  In Apple's case, they're not doing anything illegal,  but boy, even more than Google jumping through hoops,  they created an employee-less Irish subsidiary.  There's nobody working there to store the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, and Ireland, they're complete there,  as with Ireland, they enable this,  but with Ireland's financial situation right now,  Ireland ain't gonna change that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but the irony is Ireland gets no tax money  from them either, they're a stateless entity,  so they pay zero tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, far be it from an engineer  to talk about anything legal, but Google does have,  I think it's European headquarters in Dublin,  we have a large number of Spanish fighters in Dublin,  so I've been to Dublin to visit them  and they do a fantastic job.  And I thought the tax rate in Ireland was 12.5%,  or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's a little different what Google's doing,  they're still doing the Irish reach around  in the Catalan jump, or whatever the hell it's called,  but you have employees.  The thing that's kind of blatant with Apple is,  it's a zero employee entity in Ireland.  So it's clearly created for one reason only.  Now Google did transfer its intellectual property  to this Irish subsidiary to offshore the tax liability,  but it's a little different.  In any event, and we talked about this yesterday  on Mac Break Weekly, it's probably,  on a publicly held company anyway,  a fiduciary responsibility of the people  who run the company to maximize profits,  and among other things, minimize tax liability,  or they would have problems with the stakeholders.  And as long as what they're doing is not illegal,  it's really up to the US government to change the laws,  so if this is an issue, as opposed to have,  I mean the companies kind of have to do it.  At the same time, there's doing it and there's doing it.  I mean, at least Google has employees there.  Apple has nothing.  So it's an odd situation.  I debated Margaret Hodge,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Margaret Hodge is a member of parliament in the UK,  she's been going after and calling Google  every nasty word she can come up with.  I debated her in The Guardian,  and then last week they had me, believe it or not,  they had me back on the BBC,  but not the World Channel, to-  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they probably love you.  Are you kidding?  That drives traffic to have somebody go,  you know, to go off on them.  It's great, you know, they're not babies, they understand.  Here is, we don't have a change log,  because we don't have Gina,  but from a change log point of view,  that you don't have to have Gina,  because the Google Developer Blog  has a very nice summary, Scott Knaster.  We're gonna get him on MacBreak Weekly,  he wants to be on MacBreak Weekly,  he's an old Mac guy.  Works now as a developer evangelist at Google,  and he has summarized everything  from the developer's point of view,  from Google I.O., Android Studio,  based on IntelliJ, Google Play Services 3.1,  Google Play Developer Console, Google Maps, Maps APIs,  Google Compute Engine, now open to everyone,  PHP Runtime, Google Cloud Datastore,  Instant Buy Android API, Wallet Objects,  when am I gonna get my gosh darn wallet, by the way, Matt?  Do you know why my T-Mobile or AT&T phones, none of them,  I want wallet!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's tough, that's kinda like,  well why doesn't video chat work on AT&T, you know?  Sometimes the software, you do the best you can.  What's interesting to me about this post is,  it runs through in a lot of detail what happened at I.O.,  but a lot of individual sessions at I.O.  had announcements that still didn't even make it  into this level of detail of the post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was the richest I.O. ever, amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For developers, I have to say,  just speaking my opinion personally,  I think it had gotten a little out of hand  with the free devices and a little consumery,  and bringing it back to developers, I think,  was really smart.  So they had a couple great announcements.  They had something for webmasters  that's called Request Autocomplete.  So Chrome actually looks for something called  Autocomplete on form fields,  and so if you wanna make it easier for people to buy things,  it's literally an hour to annotate your web form,  and now they've introduced a new standard  called Request Autocomplete, and if you're using Chrome  and you have a Google Wallet account,  then it's basically two clicks to buy something,  no more filling out forms.  And they've got an equivalent standard  for Android applications,  which is called Google Wallet Instant Buy,  and so there's no reason why webmasters  shouldn't annotate their forms at the very least  to make it lower friction and easier to buy  and get shipping addresses and all that sort of stuff.  So that's one thing I wish more people had heard about  out of IEO, because it's a really cool standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are videos of all the sessions gonna go up eventually?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think almost all of them are up.  If you go to developers.google.com slash live,  there's a lot of sessions there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been watching them slowly, and it's so great  that you guys publish all that stuff.  It was great, plus you couldn't get into anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  related to glass to save your soul.  Yeah, yeah.  And even getting into Google IEO was fun.  It was the moment of illogic.  Yeah, yeah.  The illogic of the developers,  that you'd see the room was full,  and nonetheless they filled four deep all the way  down the hall.  Guys, count, you're not gonna make it in, give it up.  Go have coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The fire marshal will not let it happen.  But Leo, I think you did a blog post earlier today  about the number of simultaneous people  who were watching Twitter during the keynote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that was a fraction of the total  who watched the YouTube direct, right?  What was the total?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Larry mentioned this number  that was something like one million,  but if you've only got five or 6,000 people  in the actual room, and you have 180, 200,000 people,  and there's a million watching on YouTube,  your audience becomes that larger group.  I agree.  And so I like that they put the sessions up  within a week or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's great, and I contrast that again  a little bit to Apple.  Apple throws out journalists after the keynote,  and all of the stuff is closed and NDA'd  so that developers can't talk about what they learn.  And it's just an interesting contrast in the style.  And I like open source, I like open, I like APIs.  I like it that Google publishes all this,  anybody wants to develop can.  That's just fantastic.  I wish I had the time to watch all of these videos,  but they're just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would only understand about 1% of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, a lot of it is very accessible.  People should not be scared off by any of it.  A lot of it is extremely accessible, and it's really great.  What I enjoy is seeing the people,  because it's very easy with any company,  Microsoft, Apple, Google, to just kind of make it  a monolith and forget that it's made of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why I love the fireside chat.  Yes, the Android team fireside chat.  You really get a chance to request, yeah.  It's so great.  Oh, there was a Google Plus fireside, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And there's a huge diversity,  and they're quirky and interesting,  and obviously all of them, super smart.  It's just fun, it's really neat to see that.  I really applaud that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I like that a lot of them stick around afterwards.  You can say, well, I really wish this featured this,  and they're like, oh, okay, well,  let me think about how we can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  That's kind of nice. Really, really cool.  So thank you, Google.  Let's talk about Tumblr,  because that's within our realm.  Tumblr, David Karp's company, little company.  David's 26 now.  He started when he was a 19-year-old dropout,  high school dropout.  I love this.  His mom, he was 14, going to Brooklyn Science or whatever,  and his mom said, you know, you're too smart.  Just drop out.  She was a teacher.  I'll teach you.  Home school, of course, I'm sure all that happened  was he just sat down at the computer more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he also went to work for Fred Seibert.  That's right.  Next two networks to Google not too long ago.  That's right.  And Fred kind of had a warm embrace for him,  and that's where he started working on companies  and eventually on Tumblr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a wonderful story.  Marco Arment also writes his memoirs at marco.org about,  he was one of the, I think the first employee David had  before Tumblr and then helped create Tumblr.  $1.1 billion.  Karp apparently has about a quarter of the stock,  so he's going to get a considerable amount of cash,  about $250 million in cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Union Square Ventures got a 5,000% return.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fine, you know, they took $125 million in venture capital,  valued the company at $800 million,  sold it for $1.1 billion.  It's a great success story.  The real question is what's Yahoo going to do with it?  You know, a lot of people are concerned  because of the way Yahoo treated Flickr,  but I think it's a new, I think it's a very new Yahoo,  and I think Marissa Meyer.  Oh, I think Marissa, it's very, very different.  Has demonstrated.  I mean, and this acquisition,  but they could not have got it without Marissa.  I think we talked about that.  I mean, she wooed Karp, and most importantly,  I think reassured him, this is not Flickr.  This is not the same Yahoo.  She won't make him purple.  And yet, you know, you hear a lot of dissent on that  and saying this is not a good, you know,  well, we'll just have to see.  I think there's a lot of Tumblr people who are nervous.  Matt Mullenweg immediately posted the next day on WordPress.  We got, what is it, 72,000 people moving over  from Tumblr in the first hour.  Yeah.  You know, it's not, the thing doesn't close for six months.  You got plenty of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I am so, see, I'm also happy for New York.  This is the first big New York exit,  and that's a wonderful thing for the scene here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the first?  Well, you had a lot of companies that didn't quite do it.  You know, Foursquare and, I forget the list,  but it's a long list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that Yahoo, the press release said something like,  we promise not to screw it up or something like that.  Yeah.  She put up an animated GIF.  It's very authentic, yeah.  And, you know, Marissa is whip smart,  so you have to think she's on point.  She's gonna be paying a lot of attention to this.  And I think earlier today I saw  Yahoo also rolled out Flickr Pro.  And someone had taken offense and said,  oh, well, you're saying photographers aren't pros  or there are no pros on Flickr or something like that.  And she responded on Twitter and said,  hey, I worded that really not well.  I'm sorry, of course we wanna have photographers on Flickr.  Just something like any normal person would do.  But from her, that really shows.  She's plugged in, she's paying attention.  And, you know, nipping that stuff in the bud  really makes a big difference.  And she's funny watching, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's a real person.  It's hard with CEOs.  It's very rare that a CEO will do something that,  you know, let her hair down and do something that real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it feels like you had the CEOs  who didn't know what email was.  And now they have to know what email is.  But the CEOs who are-  She knows what Tumblr is.  Yeah, but the ones, you need somebody  who can like respond on Twitter.  Like, you know, for better or for worse,  Jonathan Schwartz at Sun seems like one of those guys  who was like, he was willing to get in  and get into the scrum.  And there's definitely pros and cons.  You don't wanna come across as bitter or, you know,  sarcastic, but someone who's plugged in  and really savvy enough to use it well,  I think that can generate a lot of goodwill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's the Carol Bartz side of it.  And then there's the Marissa Myers.  It can go either way on that scale.  But yeah, no, I think it's, I love the new Flickr.  I do not love the pricing.  I think it's extremely confusing.  I can't figure it out.  I'm a long time pro user.  And I've got one plan that is different from  the doubler plan or the free plan.  And it's clear that they're going to put ads,  a lot of ads on, that's gonna be,  to me, that's gonna be the thing to watch on Flickr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate to sound like, you know, Google boy,  but now that my phone is just sending automatically  Google+, it's hard to see me switching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Google Plus has a huge advantage here.  And I love the new layout.  I started posting more,  cause I feel more engaged with it.  I think it's more fun to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The funniest thing though, is they've got a real,  they'll fix it.  But the scroll bar to read comments in the pop-up window,  there's something on the rundown I put up there.  It's just hilarious how you can have four nested scroll bars,  just trying to go through comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is the threaded comment problem.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That can be a little bit tricky,  but I really like the new layout.  I do too.  Anything that kicks up controversy outside of Google,  you can assume has a lot of controversy  inside of Google as well.  But the people did a great job of listening to feedback  and really polishing out all the wrinkles  and sanding down the rough edges.  And I've noticed myself,  I use Google Plus internally a lot.  And I find myself going back a lot more  after the new layout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting challenge.  A lot of people saying we want a streaming.  We want it to automatically scroll down the page.  And then Google's opted not to.  They have a little button that pops up that says 45 more,  whatever you press that.  I actually prefer Google's choice.  Cause what I found with the older streaming solution  is I'm reading something and it starts scrolling.  And I could chase the article down the page.  Come back, come back.  Yeah, that's not good.  I actually think this is an improvement.  Although I'm a fan of live scrolling.  I think in this case it's probably better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of like FriendFeed used to have live scrolling.  But then once you moused over it, it would pause for you.  Which was good.  You don't want it to move while you're reading it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, peanut butter brand Jif has tweeted,  it's pronounced Jif.  Just in case there was any confusion  and they're talking about peanut butter, I think,  not the graphics interchange format.  That's great.  I think brands are getting so damn smart about this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why did this come up again?  This perennial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're on some honor for the inventor of Jif.  He's had a stroke and he's, you know,  I see, okay.  But it was some honor for him.  So they brought this thing back up.  Like a wedgie.  Yeah.  Red vines when, I didn't know this,  but when Twitter announced Vine,  red vines posted a sick set in Vine about red vines.  Brands, I love this when brands do this.  This is so smart.  Anyway, I'm sorry.  I just derailed the conversation, but I just,  I saw that coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So can I go to glass for a second?  Glass, please.  Where's your glass, Jif?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you get glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't gotten notification yet.  I'll get you some glass.  I'm waiting.  I actually sat outside my optometrist the other day,  wondering if I should go in and get contacts right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody at IO had regular glass, you know, had lenses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I went over and I tried to talk to him about it.  They kept on saying, talk to the PR guy.  Talk to the PR guy.  They say, red badge.  We can't talk to you.  We're gonna kill him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can't talk to you.  Those red shirt people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Nick Bilton had, I think, the most ridiculous thing.  He has turned into Mr. Cranky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry, but I love Nick.  I adore Nick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But he's decided he's Mr. Cranky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he's gonna be contrarian all the time.  So he wrote this post about,  oh, I went into the men's room at IO and I was freaked.  And I tweeted back,  nobody wants a picture of your junk, Nick.  Nobody ever did.  It's funny, that was my response too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If they want a picture of my junk, take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead.  So he actually called me yesterday to talk this through  and he said, well, it's the most frightening technology  I had.  I said, frightening?  What's frightening?  Are you kidding me?  Is this frightening?  And I said, what you're scared of is  other people, I said, then you should talk about this  with your shrink.  And he laughed.  So I'm waiting for his column.  I thought it was the,  Nick's tried so hard to be contrarian about this stuff.  He got all mad at me in Twitter and stuff.  But I thought it was the most ridiculous,  birthful piece.  But also there's an XKCD on this,  which I think is wonderful.  That was my favorite.  I didn't see it.  Well, let me see.  It's on the rundown, under glass, second thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's hilarious because-  You wanna read it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe before we rush to adopt bracket, Google glass bracket,  we should stop to consider the consequences  of blithely giving this technology  such a central position in our lives.  Don't have any insights about a new technology?  Just use this sentence.  It makes you sound wise  and you can say it about virtually everything.  That's true.  Let's consider the implications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the hover over even says that the beauty of the problem  is that everyone will project their worst fear  and assume you're being smart  and addressing their worst fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  And it's happening like the techno panic over this  is just getting wary.  And it's happening in media like crazy.  That's why somebody like Nick, who's smart about technology,  understands technology, covers technology.  And I said, Nick, you've got a responsibility  as a journalist too.  If under media pressure, people panic too much.  Because he was getting this idea when we talked  about somebody taking a picture in public.  And I said, yeah, Nick, that's public.  You don't want to restrict that definition.  As a journalist, you never should want that.  Because otherwise when you catch the mayor  going into the opium den,  or I should say, given Toronto's news recently,  the crack den.  And then, oh no, no, no, I had an expectation of privacy.  Public, you can't take my picture.  You don't want that.  You want public to mean public and it's okay.  Even a public restroom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where we get to the norms.  Give me anyone who wants to take pictures  of junk in men's rooms.  But there are people who do that.  Well, okay, but you know,  Glass is hardly a surreptitious way to do it.  It's not exactly surreptitious.  Okay, Glass, take a picture of his junk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That isn't exactly secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Yeah, I saw that XKCD and immediately thought of you, Jeff,  because it seemed like the techno panic  is still down to one very convenient cartoon  that you can use from now on.  It really is.  I want to frame it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to hand it out  every time somebody comes up with a new panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we've seen that happen,  especially with, say, Street View.  Because Street View is incredibly useful.  Now that we've had it for a few years,  people realize how helpful it is.  But when Street View was not available in some countries,  people, all they had to go by was what they were reading.  And so if there was something that was a little too strident  or techno panicky where people were writing it up  and people hadn't actually had a chance to experience it yet,  then they got more stressed and more worried about it  than they really needed to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think there's a larger discussion  about the glass itself and how useful it is  and all of that stuff.  Oh, yeah.  But I mean, I'm not too worried about the privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Nick told me a story.  I won't use the names because it was a private conversation.  Here I am ruining probably an anecdote in the story,  but there was one entrepreneur  who ran into another entrepreneur.  Two entrepreneurs walk in a bar.  One's wearing glass.  And they start having a conversation,  and the one said to the other,  I'm not having this conversation with you with glass on.  And the other one said, well, I'm not taking it off.  It's a little conversation.  I said, okay, that was a negotiation of norms.  That's the way it turned out.  And it worked out perfectly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, everybody's happy.  Yeah.  It is kind of a consensual thing.  You know, we got a pair, but I let Jason, as you know,  I let Jason have them because he's got a baby  and it's perfect for him.  He's gonna take lots of pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matt, have you warned them much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have gotten a chance to try them out a little bit,  talking about people with babies who have them.  It's really funny because there was an internal post  by someone who, her grandfather, I think, turned 100.  And so she put them on her grandfather to record.  Oh, that's great.  Wow.  It's actually, you know, I'm like a little  kind of jaded technology guy,  but you get to see the first person perspective.  All the people gathered around to say they love them.  And then they, you know, sing happy birthday  and then he blows out the candles.  He blows them all out.  And it's, so yeah, we do have to figure out the norms.  Absolutely.  But there's a lot of interesting potential there as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like what Trey Radcliffe's doing  and others with the virtual photo walks.  I think that's really cool.  You don't need glass to do this,  but they did it at the photo walk on Tuesday.  And it actually wasn't Trey.  It was somebody else was wearing the glasses  and there were people at home in a hangout  who were in this hangout online  and watching as they walked around  and did the photo walk of people who couldn't,  for one reason or another, move around  or couldn't get out of the house.  And I just think that that's a remarkable use for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The person I always want to plug when we talk about this  is a woman named M. Monica on Google+,  who was a real great denizen of Google+,  and she has trouble moving around.  And so a lot of these first photo walks were done  with kludgy phones attached to cameras  so she could direct them.  And now you can take people on tours anywhere.  Yeah, it's really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think there's some real uses for it,  but I mean, I'm not going to wear them.  I find it a little headache inducing and distracting.  But I could see driving maybe if they allow us to.  It'll be very useful for Nav, for walking around.  There's certain uses to it.  I mean, I love Google Now,  and I think as a Google Now delivery device,  it's pretty darn good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and also if you go to the Google Voice Search now,  I think you get a sense of how glass is going to operate.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I was talking to a journalist at Google I.O.  who basically said it reminded him of the Apple One.  You know, like, okay, yeah.  That's what Scoble said as well.  Yep, yep.  Yeah, but you could imagine how it would go.  Look at that, there's the 100 year old.  I'm really glad that's public  because I was hoping that it wasn't revealed  or anything secret. So cool.  And if you skip to about, I don't know, halfway through,  you can see where he blows out the candles.  But it's, like you can tell, you can see who the,  you know, you can sense the family.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which.  This is, and that's what Scoble said.  Scoble said, I have the same.  Go ahead, we'll listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anything you want to say?  It's your birthday.  What's it mean?  Well, first make a wish.  No, it's okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Make a wish.  First make a wish and blow out your candle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Make a wish.  Should it be a silent wish?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I said, that's not true.  It's pretty cool to think that somebody who was born in 1913

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is wearing on his head,  the computer, which is.  That's great.  Recording video of his 100th birthday.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Happy birthday to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And posting it globally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Might not have had electricity.  Might not have had.  Yeah, in 1913.  Yeah.  You know, they didn't have, you know, I mean, this is.  Didn't have planes.  Yeah.  You know, probably didn't have air conditioning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody said that,  that history begins when, with the digital camera.  That's when real history is gonna be, is beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, speaking of the, of the, you know,  so I've got my 30 day challenge with my Chromebook Pixel  and you talked about digital beginning.  Like this month, I've actually paid a lot of attention  to trying to, I've digitized my photos.  I used a scan cafe.  You know, I've digitized all my DVDs.  And for the first time, I had them just on my bookcase  and I started to upload them all to, you know,  Google Drive and another service or two, just for backups.  And so, and I even went through and I scanned,  Goodreads has an Android app that lets you scan  all the ISBN numbers on your books.  So you can upload all the titles of all the books  you have in your library.  So I've got 1200 books in our house.  Oh, what a good idea.  And then once you've done that,  Goodreads lets you export that as a CSV  and then you can import that into Google Play  and then you can have a library and you can slice and dice.  So for the first time, all these things that were analog  between books and pictures and DVDs,  I'm finally kind of making all of that digital  and that's sort of helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I forgot to mention, had Gina been here,  I would have mentioned this, but Tumblr, David Karp credits,  actually Marco credited Gina Trapani  with the explosive growth of Tumblr  because several months after it launched,  March 21st, 2007, she wrote a life hacker piece  that Marco says exploded Tumblr's presence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, if only she'd had friends and family stock, jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm gonna point out,  because I thought, gee, I think I've been using it before,  that my first, my Tumblr log begins in February, 2007,  a month before that.  So I also discovered Tumblr.  Anyway, that was kind of a nice,  I was gonna mention this to Gina.  Let's see, what else should we cover before we run out?  Google Plus Community Manager says,  yes, SMS is coming to Hangouts.  It does ask for your phone number now,  so you verify your phone number,  so I presume that makes sense,  and we'll integrate Google Voice, we mentioned that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you been auto-awesomed, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm loving auto-awesoming.  We're talking about Google Plus' photo stuff,  the automatic gift creation.  By the way, that's why everybody's talking about gifts,  I think, is the automatic gift creation  in Google Plus is so awesome.  If I look at my photos here,  I took, I actually, I think I knew that this would do this,  so I took a picture of my dryer drying clothes.  And it generated an automatic gift.  That's awesome.  It's not the most interesting gift ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is awesome, automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it did it automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So on the rundown is a collection  of the auto-awesome tag on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, all right, let me go find that, that's really cool.  On the Google Plus platform.  So auto-awesoming is doing enhancement too, right?  Or is it just a gift we're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also enhancement, I think.  Yeah.  But I, you know, I recently had about-  There's a bunch of gifts.  Yeah.  A lot of the times you're taking multiple pictures of people.  And so you might have five pictures  that are almost identical and it'll cycle through those.  And then you get a gif for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I've been intentionally taking multiple pictures.  If you use the burst mode on your camera,  it'll do that automatically too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's gif.  Or gif.  It stands for graphics interchange format.  Good, good, good, good graphics interchange format.  So also if I post this on Google Plus,  will it use the hashtag auto-awesome automatically?  Or do I-  I don't think it will auto-awesome.  Because it does some auto-hashtagging, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does, yeah.  So it tries to, whatever you talk about,  it tries to do very smart,  oh, he's actually talking about, you know,  this sports team or something like that.  But my guess is auto-awesome,  you'd need to label that explicitly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, let me do that  because I want to join the autumn awesome fun,  even though that's the most boring animated-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is.  If you go way down this road,  there's a happy couple like at their wedding coming-  Are they kissing?  That one right there, yeah, that one's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the bright side, now that people know this,  they can start to make really easy animated GIFs,  which it used to be kind of a passable before.  Right.  I have to admit, I don't think I've ever made one,  and I accidentally made one  from some duplicate photos yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also find them evil and horrible,  and so it corrupts our world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I admit, when Google Plus came out  and it was obvious that animated GIFs  were going to be a big part of it,  I had some concerns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of our professors here at CUNY,  John Smock, is doing a small kind of course  in how to do it, and I've made ruthless fun of him  for ruining journalism and the net as we know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Auto Awesome is awesome.  That's funny.  Now, how's it doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So these were taken so closely together.  This was, he mentions in his side,  apparently if you take enough photos  that look similar enough,  That's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is one guy with somebody different  coming in and out of the room.  Right, we should explain for the audio listeners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This may be the father of the bride or something like that,  or maybe a professor with his students  or something like that.  Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think people are gonna get creative with this.  We haven't scratched the surface of public scene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yes, there's definitely,  we have to figure out what the parameters are,  like when it will do it, how much has to be the same.  Clear, I mean, that's an eye-opener,  because the dad stays the same,  but the other guys he's taking a picture with  are similar, so we're getting some idea  that it doesn't have to be 100% the same,  and it can be separated in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it might have to do with the timestamp,  because this is, there's a very different in this,  where it looks like this was sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's just time.  Right.  Because that's something exploding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, if auto-upload notes the timestamps  on when it's uploading, then it knows,  oh, these are five taken in a short window  or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I've been using burst mode,  but I guess maybe I'll start to, yeah, let's play with it.  Let's see what'll happen with auto-awesome.  I, and I just, in the new edit tools and everything,  well, I don't know if it's gonna replace Lightroom.  I do agree with the tagline at Google I.O. that the,  what was it, the data center is your new Lightroom.  It's not too far off, not too far off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other thing that happened is Trey talked about glass  and said that his taking of photos  has increased just exponentially.  And only Trey could, every one of them could be beautiful.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he can HDR glass, which is amazing.  Yeah.  Do we have,  Catbeards, I don't know how that got in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I threw it in there, it was just one of those,  I just couldn't resist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then do we wanna play Matt's philosopher philosophy?  Catbeards is a photo meme where people place a cat  in front of their face to make a furry beard.  The cat has to be looking up.  Oh, that works pretty well.  Mm-hmm.  There's a cat beard.  I like it.  I need a cat.  Oh my God, this is hysterical.  Is this good?  The internet is just amazing.  Bless the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who would have thought that?  Matt, you have cats, right?  How?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my goodness, I have to try this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I need to get me a cat.  That's, that guy's looks like Santa Claus,  but it's the cat's nose.  Actually, it's a girl.  And it's the cat's nose and it looks like a beard.  Some of them.  That one's great.  That one's great.  Some of them really work.  Some of them really work.  What a world.  What would we have done without the internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You doubted me, O'Leo.  Yeah.  O'President of the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want you to run over to Vin Cerf's office,  show him that and say thank you, Mr. Cerf.  Okay.  Without you, there would be no cat beards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Next time I see him, I'm sure he'll be like,  what are you talking about?  Get away from me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Vin, Vin, Vin.  Vin's been wearing glass for two weeks, as always.  Has he?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, just shows you these old guys,  they could pick up these trends like that.  We're gonna take a break,  come back with a tool, a tip, a number, whatever you got.  Matt's got some recommendations.  Should we play the philosopher?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been looking for it.  Is it on your webmasters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure which philosophy video we were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this not a new one, Matt?  I thought it was a new one.  It was your philosophy of search.  Lauren Weinstein tweeted it, or plused it.  Is it this one?  Oh, interesting.  Okay.  This is it?  Is that new or is that old?  Look at him.  That's pretty new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like 12.  It's pretty new, oh, okay.  But it's a little long, I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we'll just point people to it.  How about that?  All right, all right, all right.  Did you study philosophy in college?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No?  Well, I did some humanities stuff.  Humanities.  That didn't really count.  Weren't exactly a philosopher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Let's see here.  I had some interesting stuff to talk about,  but maybe should we start?  Normally we'd start with Gina's tips.  So Matt, do you want to give us a tip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  I've got a tip.  With Google I.O., people were paying a lot of attention  to developers and the future of search,  answering questions, conversational,  anticipating questions with things like Google Now.  But it's also safe to assume that we continue to work  on core search quality.  So my tip is just to check out Google's webmaster videos.  If you search for webmaster videos,  we have a channel that's gotten something  like 12 million views.  So recently, for example, we put out a video  about what to expect for SEOs and web developers  over the coming summer.  And it's actually gonna be a pretty busy summer.  It'll be pretty eventful.  So for example, the rest of the world doesn't  pay much attention to this stuff,  but if you're an SEO, a search engine optimizer,  we've got an algorithm called Penguin,  and we're releasing the next generation of Penguin  in the next few hours.  So after I get off this program,  we're gonna go back and we'll start to press the red button.  And it's gonna have a pretty big impact  on web spam, for example.  So if you wanna keep up on the latest updates,  you can search for webmaster blog or webmaster videos,  and we'll always be posting updates on those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's 2.0, it's a leap, eh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a leap.  It's a brand new generation of algorithms.  The previous iteration of Penguin would essentially  only look at the homepage of a site.  The newer generation of Penguin goes much deeper.  It has a really big impact in certain small areas.  So I think something like 2.3% of English queries  will be affected to the degree  that a regular user might notice.  So look for that to come out in the next few hours.  Yeah, and on the screen you see Google Webmaster Central.  So if you go to google.com slash webmasters,  that is, if we put a manual spam action on your site,  that is where you'll get a notice, for example.  So Penguin is an algorithm, but if we manually say,  oh, you were cloaking or selling links that pass page rank  or something like that, you'll get a message.  Watch out, Dvorak.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Ding ding ding ding ding.  Joking, John, just joking.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he wouldn't do that.  Your number. Just keep an eye out.  Your number of the week, Mr. J.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'll try this one, a whole bunch of fives.  Google put up google.com slash trends slash top charts  is I think a monthly compilation of top searches.  And we see this stuff all the time.  We see it in various lists,  but there's some funny ones here that just make no sense,  like car companies, cars, chemicals, chemical elements.  Gold is the most searched chemical element  followed by silver, iron, carbon, and aluminum.  And then Bitcoin.  Right.  So just a silly little thing for Martini  is the number one soda for cocktail  followed by Bloody Mary, Mitt, Julep, Manhattan, and Mai Tai.  That this reminds me of Zeitgeist.  Exactly, but it's kind of a monthly new,  it's like a dog's pit bull, number one, which scares me.  Bulldog, Labrador Retriever, German Shepherd, Siberian Husky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's neat.  I saw Trey's invitation to Zeitgeist.  It looks like a giant mousetrap game.  Did you see that, Matt?  Oh, a little bit.  Yeah, Zeitgeist is coming, when is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Soon, I think.  Zeitgeist is through the sales department,  so I never get an invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you not get invited to Zeitgeist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never been to a single Zeitgeist.  And you know, it's a sales thing.  It's like a thought conference for people who work with sales,  and so that's fine.  That's appropriate.  It's not fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's not fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want to go, I think, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I write in a suck-up kiss-ass Google book.  I never get invited.  I'm all this suck-ass kiss-up.  You should go.  No, yeah, you should.  Okay, watch this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't get invited.  Watch this.  I'm sure Steven Levy got invited.  Oh!  That was mean.  Oh, man.  You know, I love Zeitgeist, the page,  and we can all get to see that,  but I think Zeitgeist is more like a sales event, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is, but they do neat things there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, the invitation is super cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do invite a blogger or a journalist or two.  Oh, yeah.  No, they do a lot of neat stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just it comes out of the sales side,  but yeah, Jeff, I agree.  If I ran the world, if I ran Google,  you'd be going to Zeitgeist, but I don't go myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let me see if I can find Trey's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can see you, Matt, as an evil Bond character.  Be nice to Matt, or he's going to release all the spam again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Trey said he couldn't take it with him  because he's going off to China.  I think he did get his visa, by the way,  but this was the invitation that he received.  So he said he wants to give it away to one of his followers.  So if you live in San Francisco, send him a note.  He's going to pick randomly and then left it  at his hotel this morning when he left.  That's pretty, that's like mousetrap.  I think that's cool.  I don't know what it is.  I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where is it being held this time, do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't say here.  Do you know, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we're not invited,  so it doesn't really matter, does it?  No, we certainly are not.  We don't, we don't.  You and I, we should get together.  We'll have a pizza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're on the need not to know list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Well, we'll learn whether any sales side folks  listen to this week in the morning.  Yes, we'll find out, won't we?  We shall find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they'll say, how much money does Jarvis give us?  Nothing.  So that's it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nothing, nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd have to come under the thought leader category,  which, you know, there's a significant number  of people who do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And hey, I bought my Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, you spent real money for it.  Now you have two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wanted to have a t-shirt that affected at IO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I already got one, thanks.  Something like that.  You can keep it, I don't want it.  Something like that.  I paid for mine.  What are you gonna do with the second one?  You're just gonna have two,  like one at work, one at home?  That's what you should do.  Because it's all in the cloud, right?  That's one of the beauties of the Pixel.  Having more than one Pixel is not a burden.  Oh, true.  My tool, actually, we already talked about it,  but I wanted to make sure it got in early,  is the new Twitter's two-step authentication.  You must turn it on.  And actually, might as well point out  that you can download Google Authenticator  on Android or iOS for free.  It's a great way to keep track  of those second factor authentications.  Twitter doesn't use it yet, but will soon, I'm sure.  And, and Matt and I were talking about this,  and he endorsed this.  Very frequently, the secret,  you add an account to Google Authenticator  by taking a scan of a QR code,  which gives you your secret number.  It's a very quick, easy way.  But what I would suggest is when you get that QR code,  whether it's from Google or Microsoft or LastPass,  or whatever, you save it and put it in LastPass.  I keep it in my LastPass vault  where it's completely secure,  and you wanna secure it,  because that's all people would need  to duplicate your second factor authentication.  But by doing so, I can add, as Matt said,  add multiple phones.  And since I always have a new Android phone,  it's important for me to have that QR code ready.  Boy, I love it, because it literally takes me a minute  to add all three authentications to Google Authenticator.  I hope everybody starts using  this time-based authentication.  It's a really great technique, and I hope Twitter does too.  Meanwhile, turn it on.  You need a cell phone on your Twitter account,  and you'll get a text message with the six-digit number  that gives you the second factor.  Thank you, everybody, for being here.  Matt, it's so great to have you.  What a great feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matt, it's great to have you back.  It's been way, way, way too long.  It's really good to have you back on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's always fun to be on Twig.  I'm really glad that it worked out  where I could stay with my Pixel.  I didn't have to root it and install Sky Stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we should point out  that this is the first all-Gtalk episode.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matt, if I could put Ubuntu on my Pixel, you could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true.  Well, I just have to say, mad geek props to you  for putting the crouton on.  It's pretty impressive, huh?  And getting Ubuntu on your Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They made it really easy.  Boy.  Yeah, he did it all by himself.  Amazing fellow.  Thank you all for being here.  I thank Matt Cutts, who is in charge of fighting  and rooting out evil in the Google search results.  Thanks to Jeff Jarvis.  He blogs at buzzmachine.com.  By the way, everybody should look  at Matt's webmaster videos.  They're just fantastic.  If you have a website, it's such a useful tool.  And people always are calling the radio show saying,  well, I've got this deal with an SEO company  and they're gonna tell me how to raise my Google ranking.  I said, you don't need that.  Just watch Matt.  He'll tell you everything you need to know free.  It's free.  They're very generous.  Webmaster tools.  They're generous on them.  Find it, watch it, learn.  We do this show every Wednesday, right after security now,  1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern Time, 2000 UTC on twitch.tv.  Please watch live, we love it if you do.  But if you can't, on-demand audio and video  is always available after the fact.  And forevermore, they will be always available  hundreds of years from now.

And that's at twit.tv slash twig  or wherever finer podcasts are aggregated  and delivered to you.  Thank you for joining me now.  Let's wrap it up.  Thanks for joining us.  We'll see you next time on Twig.
