Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did they miss this moment they did because we that was before the show began  We learned the audience day. So we learned two things his previous life  We learned that Stacy at the end when at the end of her wedding the recession was she and her new husband  Walked out the door. They played I've been working on the railroad and then  To be fair  No, I don't want to be fair it was no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's actually like and if you're not singing lyrics in distinguish. It is the same song. It is the same song  And we learned that Stacy in college for beer money  taught kickboxing  At 5 45 a.m. Most importantly  Yes, so early you see oh it takes us Stacy you've been with us for what about a year it takes about a year  So before we really get to all the corners filled in is you know to the who you are  We're getting there now  So the reason I brought this up is that as the rumors are flying about new pixel X pixel phones from Google we don't know when  We know the code names  They last year was Marlin and sailfish this year more fish  musky and walleye  Walleye was mentioned in the Android open source project  So that sounds like there's heart their hardware is coming along according to Android  I'm sorry droid life  Musky is a five and a half inch walleye is the smaller five inch  Then we're now  We're now seeing a rumor  That there is even a third full phone called time in  in fish must be I  Don't know chat room is time in a fish

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Siberian time and Siberian salmon is a species of fish in the salmon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so maybe this is that you know what I would that would lend me to think this might be the Chinese version of the pixel  Phone that's the new thing right you mix Microsoft just made a Chinese version of Windows 10  To appease regulators there, I wouldn't be surprised to see a Chinese version of that phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh wait now it's also the Eurasian giant trout

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could be the Russian version the Russian and Chinese version  So I'm not sure what would be is a time in a big fish

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is it's a large you it's good for dry fly fishing apparently so remember the Nexus 6 which code name Shamu the killer whale

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that was a big one, and I guess if time in is a big fish. Maybe this is an even bigger six inch  Would you get a I'm starting to think that the perfect size for a laptop is 13 inches the perfect size for a phone is 5.7  inches  Smaller so I've been shown laptop 13 inch okay, so you agree with me on the laptop  But you want to smile hands are smaller your woman. Maybe you have a little bit smaller. I don't have huge hands  Jeff you like a big phone you said  Because I'm a manly man, but nobody wants a Trump but did you but you had the Nexus 6 wasn't that too a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just a little too big was too big. It was a little bit too in fact. It's my it's my five phone  It's my international phone, so I still use it  Not only that a little bit too big and also because the back is is curved curved like this  Yeah, it you can't use it on a dinner table. It's rocky  Yeah, when I'm when I'm eating alone in the rest I use it like a tablet now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have it as kind of a tablet phone they use for timers and stuff like that like I will argue argue that the perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  tablet size

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is seven inches yeah, I would agree with you. I agree yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are there cases that you can stick on your phones coming back to the phone case?  But also the dinner table thing that have like a little picture stand that you can pop out. Yes. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, okay, Craig Newmark's case is just that I'll ask him right. I like I suddenly was like oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the thing I need that I didn't know I needed until right this moment. Yeah, they have stands

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And some have stands only in  Landscape mode some have stands landscape or portrait  But I think landscapes normally what you want because you're looking at a movie or TV show on on a tray table  That's kind of the point right oh  Eating your breakfast or spooning up your Cheerios and at the dinner table at the dinner table

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not the dinner table. Sorry it's where yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the same. Well. I say dinner table. I mean I'm out alone. I'm sad in a restaurant far  There's nothing worse I have to keep company table for one mr. Jarvis again

Transcript:  That's because they've a little one and any any moments to yourself for precious when your kids are little I  Just I like people watching. It's fun and eating so you have your phone. Okay. I'm just kidding again  We're filling in the picture of who Stacey Higginbotham is I was seeing you at the owner

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At the cafe she's dangerous. She's a registered weapon. Yeah, she's a loner. You don't mess with Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's munching on a bear surprise her the restaurant with her phone on a stick kickstand looking at people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's in portrait. It's not in landscape mode in portrait  Well because I'm usually reading or reading articles. Yeah, yeah, I'm I'm not watching things

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, me so so the thing is now. I know I'm gonna have to get a larger phone for one reason  Because it's all I'll be able to carry on a plane with me. This is shot. This has be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's two theories as to this  New rule the rule is that certain Middle Eastern Airlines in certain cities will be forbidden  Passengers will be forbidden from carrying  Larger electronics the phone will be the biggest electronic the only electronic you can carry on board the rest will have to be in check  Camera you can't take even camera  It says they said ostensibly for security reasons  So you know I think they're trying to make you think  that there's new information and by the way there's some there was a rumor that the  That some that Virgin Atlantic was gonna consider doing this have they announced well  No, the British authority the British authorities British for thinking of doing it okay, but they that's more so there's kind of three theories  Well I know too so you tell so the one is the one that's that's on this face of it  Which is oh there must be some discovery about how people could make bombs. There's a guy apparently teaching  Terrorists how to make plastic bombs that are undetectable they're afraid those could be posing as a tablet a Kindle or a laptop  That's the obvious theory. What's the other theories two and three?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That it's a Muslim band a harassment ban on Muslims or that it's anti  I  Government subsidized national carriers, that's what I believe them so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It affects primarily Emirates  Etihad  through the three big Middle Eastern carriers and  The theory that I read which I thought was very interesting is that this is a protectionist move by the US government  Because the most lucrative passengers the business and first-class passengers on those airlines will switch to American carriers  Which for which there is no such ban?  So they can use their laptops and that this will hit economically hit hard these Middle Eastern carriers to the benefit of United American

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mind you're gonna come through the same airport security

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's my point is okay. You could ban it. You know universally if that's a problem you have to ban it everywhere  They're saying well, we don't there are other cities

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are other cities that are far were it could crock us  Airport by all accounts has no security at all. So why can you bring on laptop on there and not not in Doha?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The rules take effect on Tuesday. The UK has said it will follow  Yesterday Tuesday the UK said it would follow suit with his but I don't haven't heard yet that they've done that  Apparently from the DHS guidance that had  2016 airline  Airliner was attacked perhaps by a laptop bomb somebody pointed out. Well the laptops of my carry-on  There's nothing to prevent me from detonating it remotely via my cell phone a  Remember they used to make you turn these things on to verify that they weren't bombs with they were in fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Working electronics they haven't done that late. That's such a pink you imagine that starting that again. Yeah, that would  At least at least I carry instant on things my Chromebook is instant on  You poor for schmucks with a with a back and take forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Delta United and American  Have long resented the fact that Emirates and Eddie hot our government subsidized and  Have complained along in Qatar Qatar Airways as well have complained a long time  Time that they have a disadvantage against these airlines because they benefit unfairly from cups of government subsidies  So it's not in fact in February  the CEOs of United American and Delta set  Secretary of State Tillerson a letter complaining about the massive subsidization of three state-owned Gulf carriers in the significant harm  This subsidized competition is causing the US Airlines and US jobs end quote  In a meeting with the executive shortly thereafter Trump promised phenomenal tax relief broad deregulation and other forms of support to the industry  Is this one of those other forms of support?  It's it would they can't paint it that way because that would in fact be a violation of global trade rules  Can't you can't you know so I don't know it's but what's it what's sad is I think it is gonna absolutely have that effect  If I were traveling on any one of those airlines to the Middle East and by the way you may not be going to Dubai  But it's a very common stopover on the way to Asia for us  It is so guess their hubs and spokes right so I'm I'm not  I'm gonna seriously consider thinking about Delta American or United  So it's gonna have that effect whether it was intentional or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now add to that  Your  You know your computer and your phone and all that being subject to you when you come back across you saw the  marijuana Colorado story right no, what's that  So a woman who had a boy Mexican who had a boyfriend in California came back forth a couple times one time when they were in  Colorado hey, they did what you do in Colorado now and  They pulled her phone coming in and they she didn't have any lock on it  They look they go through all our social they go through all our photos  She has pictures of a few bongs and things from the the grass store and  Question about it, and they kick her back out, and she's indefinitely banned from the United States of America. Oh my god  whoa  So right so I'm trying to think about how do you go?  Well, how do you go completely antiseptic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've talked about on some of the other shows  I  Don't know if I recommend this but one theory one thing would be to make sure your phone is backed up  And then as you're about to arrive and arrive in the United States to wipe it  Yeah  But then isn't that a red flag when they say can you unlock your phone and you do and it says what language you like to use  So maybe wipe it and then set it up in a kind of base basic fashion, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was thinking there should be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just gonna say even if you have wiped it. That's fine. I mean they can't  It's done. It's a fae accompli a complete a comply

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it doesn't matter if you're an American citizen if you're not an American citizen you can get in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure, and if you are an American citizen you could be detained for hours in airport jail  Which is not fun either because you don't have the rights you do not have rights there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's the question so they can't make they can you make you use your finger?  They can't make you under unless under certain dress put your password in unless they have some some reason to I wonder if there's some kind  Of application that encrypts your phone locks it even from you until it's off. I like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like a geographic lock  It's as long as I'm in this airport can't open it until you're home. Oh  It's like somebody needs to write that right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's well, but you'd want you'd want to be able to use your phone in the actual airport  So it'd have to be some sort of two-factor  so  You could get around it some phones like the Samsung phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have a business and home use and there is a  There's a locked folder on a Samsung phone. It was Samsung wasn't this that a locked folder on the phone?  That you could put stuff in that had a separate an additional  Password it wasn't immediately obvious. It was there you could try that you could unlock the phone  The problem the real problem is what what often happens with?  border control  Apparently I haven't been through the border since this started  And the presumption being they bring it to another room where they now  Could be two things they're doing they're probably copying the contents of the phone for later analysis. That's bad enough  But once somebody has your phone and it's out of your possession and it's unlocked  You have no idea if they've put surveillance software on it. They could also put put malicious software on there  Mm-hmm  And you wouldn't know so I think the best thing to do if you can I mean look I'm not going on a 12-hour flight without  Some sort of entertainment no no so watch I want to watch the Americans man. Yeah  So I think the best thing to do is is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take it with you normally and just wipe it before you get off

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could still be you'd make phone calls with it and use it  But it just won't have any data to do with it  Normally and just wipe it before you get off you could still be you'd make phone calls with it and use it  But it just won't have any data on it, and then if they do take it  Then you have to throw it away  Thank you a lot of security experts say if if somebody if somebody takes your phone law enforcement takes your phone  Just you're done. Don't take it back. You don't want it anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, good lord, so somebody said on on Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead I think it's a real boon for the Sky Mall catalog there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was gonna say by I'm gonna buy a burner phone  Yeah, another way to go. Yep, and since I keep 90% of what I care about in the cloud anyway  I can log in help me find the flaws in my reasoning here  I log in and then when I'm done I log out and then you just hope it's not cached

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right, it's Chromebook ladies gentlemen you have a Chromebook and  You're using Cognito mode and there's no there's no make sure it's a cheap phone because if they do take it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't want it back right right the point is that that phone is done. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, this is just why do we have to worry about this? It's not apparent to me at all  Maybe I'm completely wrong that this is in any way improving our security  No, no, yeah  If it if I mean if this improved our security then you can make the argument we need to do this  We need to you know protect our nation  Improve the security that's fine, but that's to me. This does not seem apparent that that's what this is doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but although I  Was gonna say if people if they discover a new attack they often don't talk about it obviously  So they don't tip people off that they know what's happening. So  Do I really believe that this is a security related threat it's really hard we don't know we don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't know that's what there's the problem. Here's the problem Stacey  There's no credibility left. That's a problem, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Automatically impute malicious, you know  Motivations you impute their motivations because yeah, it could be real. It could be real and we wouldn't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So somebody there's a star Simpson and Twitter suggested that that airline should be handing out Chromebooks the way they used to hand out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember that for a while Google to promote the Chromebook was doing that they had little Chromebook booths at the SFO and terminal  That's right  And you could take it and bring it on the plane and then there would be a booth at the other end where you'd give it  That's a let's Google's right opportunity

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you can't stream the video maybe on the plane  But you can download the video while you're in the lounge and then you have things to watch on the plane  And then you hand back in the Chromebook has nothing this is the ultimate first world problem though

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are afraid of going yes, it sure is an international  12-hour flight we are going to arrive in a different nation in the environment because  We will have to sit with our own thoughts for that time  No, don't talk to the person next to you or read the Sky Mall catalog all three sound like bits of hell  They really do. Of course everybody's my sister. You're not a you don't talk to the person next to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're like one of those people. No, you know, I hate when people talk to me me too. Me too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do too. I don't like put in headphones and I cough  And I walk up phlegm anything Oh charming well, you don't want to be charming you want to be the opposite  Mmm. Yeah. Oh, that's so funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we're all missin throats, we're all missing throats. Yep  So does this affect I did want to know just in case most people probably want to work why this is a big issue  Working and streaming but what about like your Kindle? Can I bring my no kindles included as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is absurd?  That is I'm sorry. That's absurd. There's even less electronics in that than a phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you imagine having the argument with the airport person? No, this is a this is a nook not a Kindle

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No reading anything bigger than phone reading devices  Tablets what about a big phones?  And I bet you even some big phones. Oh, this is what I do with my child  Yeah  She gonna watch the crappy movie do they say in fact most airlines have removed the in-flight entertainment  Because you've got your stuff. Yes, because you have your device. That's exactly right Leo  All right. I'm we shouldn't this really does sound sad that we're okay moving right? You could meditate think about things

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get a deeper at right and don't give me don't give me that my own sister and on Facebook read a book

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Read a book heavy our books allowed books are allowed books are still allowed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Free thought is still allowed as our books. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But at least for the time being for now for now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was I think the big story of the week in my world yes, if I may please is  That the Guardian the BBC the government of the UK now AT&T all  Pulling a boss the big the big French ad agency pulled their advertising from Google and YouTube. Yeah, Google responded  immediately

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, oh now now you now YouTube cares  Google has apologized and promised to improve  Phillips should have put up put up new we should say why they're pulling advertising  They're pulling this is AT&T statement right  AT&T statement were deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate  Until Google can ensure this won't happen again. We're removing our ads from Google's non search  platforms  That's YouTube display advertising  That includes AdSense right AdWords  And that's an AT&T is doing that globally Verizon is also suspending ads with with Google  Oh, that's new one to me. Mm-hmm  And so it's not just customers of Havas anymore. This is this is really spreading

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it was it was separate like the Guardian did it I think before Havas did BBC is a boss client

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and  Yeah, wow, so  So I was writing a post line go ahead  Go ahead GSK that was I think that was through Havas the the British the Royal Mail was through Havas  Yeah, this is a media buyer  So Google's response we don't comment on individual customers  But as announced we've become begun an extensive review of our advertising the other the other link on the on the rundown  I put up expanded safeguards for advertisers  So there's a list there but this is  It's funny that this should surface now  I mean this is advertisers have always complained the same complaint about Twitter that you don't know where your ads gonna appear and for a lot of  advertisers that are very  conscious about their reputation and their  Public image this is an issue that they're reluctant to advertise on Twitter and I thought we're  I thought they had the same reluctance on YouTube frankly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the timing in part is fake news and also sleeping Giants  No, no sleeping Giants Giants. Yes. What no, what is that?  So sleeping Giants is a Twitter account where they find whoever's been on Breitbart and they publicly shame them shame

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shame whoever's advertising on Breitbart. Yes, and it could be a true federated or another  Service, but they don't care and like they they actually just called out the New York Times

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fairly recently Amazon they call out regularly because Amazon it separately has as affiliate things there and Amazon doesn't cut them off  So there's there's more than a thousand advertisers who now pledge to pull out from Breitbart  Now this is coming out. It's coming on programmatic. The advertisers does not choose Breitbart. They don't know they're there  But there's a quality issue here. That's to me the interesting thing here is that is that so the piece I'm trying to write now  Help me write it  Is that we're looking at this at the wrong end of the periscope, right?  We're looking down and trying to find all the all the crap and and try to tamp it down  The easy way to solve this is to create quality networks  Right, which is the way advertising used to work, right?  The the media brand created something quality the ad agency chose it as quality  They put the ads are almost wonderful. It all got screwed up by Google and programmatic and all that  So the way to go back around is to create things that are quality. There's no one definition of quality

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not how is our human effort. How is what sleeping Giants is doing?  Different from what Peter Thiel did to Gawker

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One question is you both roundly condemned that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Difference here is that they're holding the advertiser response. They're not they're not going after ensuing them to put them out of business  They are saying to an advertiser. I'm gonna judge you by the company you keep but they are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Economic with using economic means attempting to put a Breitbart out of business

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well in truth Breitbart doesn't care about its ads that's gravy Breitbart is supported by

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whatever but but that's what the attempt is, right? It's the same thing as you know, the the family family, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Going after advertisers is a time-honored tradition. I know it is. Yes  Well, so and it's it's very different. I would say it's different from suing someone because  You're using the same medium a medium of exchange like advertising is medium of exchange  Advertising is medium of exchange as opposed to switching gears and going after them with the bludgeon of the law  it may be that's  Silly and doesn't make a difference  But I'm I'm seriously thinking about this and kind of like hmm. What makes it worthwhile?  and  You know, it's similar though. The outcome is similar, isn't it? But they have a choice they can say, okay  No and lose their advertising and presumably that's because a large the advertisers are worried because a large number of consumers care about this  Whereas Peter teal a large number of consumers or readers may not care about Gawker's issue  Whereas Peter teal is taking it one himself to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Question about Peter Thiel and okay. It is I understand. It's why it isn't really the same but I just feel like yeah  No, it's a good point. It's a chilling effect on a speech

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it also says the whole responsible it's like moral policing which we kind of do as a society and it's people  We we say hey we think it's really wrong to I don't know lie probably just a fair

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm probably just afraid that somebody would do that to me and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So and somebody right and if enough people did it Leo, I'd be out of baby. Well, maybe it makes sense  I don't know  If you're promoting something that provides little or no value, right? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't know no, you're right. That's that is that's a signal from your audience  That they are not happy with you as opposed to a single  Billionaire that he's not happy with a story you wrote. Yes, okay. That's a that's we did some research at CUNY a few months ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where we looked at a native advertising and a lot of surprising findings to me was how much that the readers  judge  Both ways they judge the brand by what by what media it appears on and they judge the media white by what brands are advertising on  You judge both ways the company you keep and and to me this problem we have in media  This whole fake news argument is again looking the wrong way. We've stopped talking about quality  We basically say we're trying to boil the ocean. Here's all the advertising possible the world  Oh my god, we have to we have to keep you from going there as opposed to saying here are some things  We selected that are actually very good  You can be there and that creates a new scarcity and the value would be higher the question the first question is do  Advertisers value quality or they say no in programmatic and retargeting. I just care about the data about you wanting those boots  I'm gonna follow those boots are gonna follow you around. I don't care where it appears bright  But I don't care if the advertisers don't value quality  We're doomed if you can convince the advertisers to value quality because it has an impact on them  That's why things happen. That's what that's why this havas thing matters

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So quality is a hard thing to do though because like the fact that I looked at a pair of boots and  the fact that I might be a member of the KKK and  Love a certain news site are completely irrelevant to the advertiser if I get to click on those boots, right?  and so from their perspective quality only matters if it  If it doesn't generate or sorry, it actually generates results, so maybe it's the metrics they matter I  Don't I don't know how to think about this also I am being followed by a pair of earrings right now and  It's very tempting. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You keep seeing the ad they know somehow that you want these  Rugs and these earrings they're everywhere. Wow, that's interesting. Do you put peanuts in your dr. Pepper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which I have an opinion on but go ahead  Okay, we'll do that later. That'll be my story. All right, actually and you know, have you know you have a Google Home, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do. Yeah, so I I did not get the the my day experience  I did not get the Beauty and the Beast ad which is a shame in the target market

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let me play what some people so the my day explain that Stacey. What is my day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is your your wake up with like I think of it as talk morning radio  But it's your commute time your news briefs your weather. I feel like you can add things to it. You can customize it  I don't actually use the feature all that often because how do you ask for it? Well, sometimes I do just by accident I say

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good morning. Okay  You know who good morning and she'll say good morning. Leo today is March 22nd  2017 all right, so let me confuse her

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, Google. Good morning

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So she's telling you a time it is what the weather's like your calendar so here let me play this though because this doesn't work anymore  This is from Twitter. Okay, Google stop  This is this is a demonstration of the Beauty and the Beast problem. Okay, Google stop

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Your harlan

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, NPR  Okay, Google  Stop take a look at this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google stop take it off the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's my day like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello Bryson the time is 744 a.m  The weather in Park Ridge currently is 21 degrees and sunny with a high of 37 degrees  Your commute to work is currently 39 minutes by public transit by the way Disney's live-action Beauty and the Beast opens today  The story Bell is the inventor instead of Maurice that rings truer if you ask me  For some more movie fun. Ask me to tell you something about Bell now was that a paid ad from Disney latest news

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said no, right? I don't think so. So they've done this every day. They'll do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did one when Steve Martin's birthday said today Steve's Martin's birthday and they did a little bit of King Tut. I  Think they just trying to have fun. These are obviously human editors write these and I think that this was I  Think it was a mistake. Obviously, it looks like an ad but I don't think it was intended to be an ad you think Stacey  Well, so here's the deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't care if it was an ad or not because Google came back saying it wasn't an ad and people are like, well  And they're but the question the only thing that matters is did money or some item of value change hands, right? If it did  Then it's an ad be tagged. Yeah, it's an ad  Tagged yeah, and I think this gets to though how pernicious  some of these marketing agreements can be when we talk about like IOT and  Even even our phones things that suggest like  Contextually aware applications that suggest things to you  So I think it's really important we have and I'm gonna use that famous a bright line rules about  What we decide is an ad and how we make people disclose it on small screens  In voice apps, etc  Because this is and it's damaging to Google. I mean think about how many people were like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is I think it was a mistake, but I don't think it was a paid ad  But you know it sounded like one so that was it that was a big mistake on their part

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and what about these marketing agreements? I mean that that's that's well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll give you an example. Remember when Google named Android KitKat and they said then no money's changed hands  But that was clearly promotional right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I was I was thinking about the Harry Potter  Implementation on the phones around the fantastic beasts, right? Those are ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yes, I assume that was an ad doesn't the FTC has very strict rules. You can't don't they maybe not they do  They have it for bloggers, right? We can't for I can't tweet. Hey, I really love segment  On Twitter without saying hashtag ad or hashtag sponsor or our sponsor  Segment you have to indicate very clearly. This is an ad or this is a paid placement. Actually  It doesn't even have to be paid placement  They wouldn't necessarily have to pay me for that tweet for it to have to have to be disclosed  It's they pay me for ads elsewhere. So I have to disclose that  That's yes, that's very they're very clear on that for bloggers. Maybe less. So for our you know, artificial intelligence

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. Yeah, I don't think there are any rules yet for AI

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or IOT devices, but what we don't want is a world where we get these all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Constantly thrown in you also want some option you want you want some up you want? Oh, we can play you the theme from  Beauty the Beast would you like to hear it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Taylor's oldest

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have a nice voice  No, I like the bit you have a deep voice sounds good  They did they did play a little music right little piano music  I don't know if that was from Beauty and the Beast and then they said ask me something about Bell  Encouraging interaction, but that's kind of how Google Home is is a little playful. They're trying to I  Don't know what I don't I think it was an I think it was a mistake

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, and it's just a time waster and think about think about like on your car if you're driving and  You know, there's an ad that's relevant to like a certain place. You might be right now. I  I  Your car could suggest. Hey want to grab a burger?  You're right by such-and-such or maybe you're ask your car. Hey, what's for lunch?  What's is there a restaurant near me and then seeing that, you know?  Getting that via voice  How are we gonna mark that as an ad right?  Because like right now if I ask Google that in my phone  It gives me the sponsored listings and it gives me all the other listings, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all kinds of really fascinating challenges what voice puts together I  Have three challenges off the bat. First is monetization  Second is brandine is very difficult and third is when you ask a question to Google and it gives you an answer  As we've seen recently it may be the wrong answer  But it gave you one answer because there's only one opportunity for an answer. We had a good discussion last week on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry what you weren't here Jeff because I said this is the problem when you go from being a surgeon any piece  To being a fact engine and I think that this is a real difficult challenge  Because a search engine would give you multiple results some of which might be fake news  But there would still be legitimate search results  But if you're gonna say I'm gonna give you the one true fact about this  That is a heavy burden you're putting on yourself and I think Google shouldn't even get in that position, but that's up to them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Obviously, it's kind of way that's what you need in an on-demand contextually aware kind of what you want. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so you don't want 20 results. Well, let me give you 15 search pages you could go to that's not useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here are the options now. I I wonder if something like so in our show when I do an advertisement  One I announced that it's an ad but we also have little music playing underneath as a way to like  Delineate it as different from the rest of the content

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's the same music every time so every idea so you have a little little ad bed that you use  Oh, that's a cute way to call it is that why is that's interesting that was your idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, it was actually my my partner's idea. So but we just he was like, hey, why don't you play some music to make it?  So you'll know even if you even if you skip through right you're in the middle of the ad you're still getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The undercurrent I could we could try that that's interesting  I mean, I think we're pretty clear when we go to an ad and when we come out of it  But but I've often thought maybe we should be clearer so there'd be no confusion  My I'd never ever want to be in a position where people think content like you think an ad is content  Obviously and I think that's the problem Google got into there's no clear way to say  This is not an ad  I'm just giving you something I think you'd be interested in which is the beauty and the beast opens this weekend and it was it  Was a huge weekend and massive opening. It may have really surprised you heard by the way the kid  His in that tweet there was a kid going yeah  Because I mean Google Home did the right thing because that kid was really excited, right?  So maybe Google knew there's a seven-year-old in that house. That's gonna be very excited about this. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then why didn't I get it?  Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, okay no idea no idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a little sad now occasionally by the way somebody's saying well, you know your audible ads verge on content  I'm not saying we won't stick content in the ads. I just don't want to mix ads into the content. I  Don't want you to be listening to content and think you're hearing listen listen to an ad and think you're hearing  I don't want you to be listening to our show and we we sneak an ad in under under the  But if you're in the middle of an ad and I mentioned there's some great books  I like that that that's content, but I don't think that that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Confusing I hope it's not we also used to do unpaid ads on the show this show. Oh, yeah for Chipotle

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and glee  Bastards fast who never gave no you know what some guy was here  He was like the IT guy from Chipotle gave me a ton of Chipotle  In fact, we had Chipotle lunch today. So one burrito no  No, we got lunch for 20. He gave us a coupon that said lunch for 20 and  And we fed the whole staff today at Chipotle on that coupon, by the way, thank you. Whoever you are masked man  Wow  Says I sneak ads in  I'm sorry, you know, I feel bad if I do that and maybe we do need to get a little tinkle tinkle bed  Can I borrow your tinkle tinkle bed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, I am NOT answering that question at all. What is the what is the song? That's like a that's a Trump

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Moscow joke I'm not going there yet the Ritz Carlton. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's my theme music. It's my it's the intro theme music that idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I should do them somebody saying you should do them in a funny voice  and now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does is gonna love that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right now to strangle you well average actually advertisers, of course always want your ad to sound like content

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't want you seem like an ad so get it get Pink Floyd get the rights to Pink Floyd's money and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Going in the background sure why not  Yeah, that's what Paul Harvey did he would go now  I don't think anybody knew that that's what this meant, but he would say page two and then he'd read an ad page three  and that was his way of saying it was an ad which was weird, but I  Think you should play I've been working on the railroad every time you go to play. I've been working on the railroad. I love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  16 times what do you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Though the day older deeper in debt. We like that song because it's in our key, which is deep

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was gonna say Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The deep key so our conclusion is that Google probably didn't intend to put Beauty and the Beast in there  I would certainly hope that they don't if they were thinking at any point about paid placement in the Google homes  Messages, they probably have stopped thinking about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a terrible place to put it too. Cuz that's like I mean, it's great from an exposure perspective  but that's like information you need fast, right and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Done although they did it at the end in fairness. Do you think they're gonna do that? That's it? That's really it  Well, they didn't know you know what they didn't do at the end because the next thing then was news briefs and  And so it isn't at the end. In fact, it's the beginning of the stuff that really becomes useful, which is the news

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The weather is the most useful part I hope we yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope we don't see that because I would be that really would make Amazon's echo less useful and all these things. Yes useful  But and the that's hmm, that's interesting. I mean it is a free service

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Both of the rattling  Transactional devices I buy stuff at home all the time. Everybody I mean everybody knows that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me on the echo and home has just added purchases, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, they just added local but okay, so let's let's  Break this apart you pay for the device the service itself is gathering incredibly valuable data about you  Right that those both of those platforms they're gonna use in other places

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're getting paid in other words. They're getting plenty of value. Yeah, unless we tear

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean unless no one ever looks on the web again. I  Promise that Google's getting plenty of value out of this Amazon. It's a no-brainer for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I order stuff all the time from Amazon. In fact, the latest is that you can order  Amazon now if I'm not in one of the cities, maybe Austin's one of the cities, but it's not I  Know and I know that New Jersey's not but you can you can actually ask your Amazon Echo now to get something to you  within two hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exciting here comes Oh  Nougat is already being eclipsed. The next version of Android is coming into beta the Android Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Takes all the suspense out of it. Wait. Do we know what it's called? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  MG we do not  Oh  Oreo jokes have been made Oreo would make sense  Oh, I don't know  better battery life  What's new in Oh, here's what's new in Oh background limits building on the work. We began in Nougat  Android Oh puts a big priority improving battery life  That is actually the biggest thing that I would say Andrea needs to work on compared to iOS  Oh, yeah, because iOS is very good about very aggressive about killing background  Tasks and as a result gets very very good battery life on much less battery  The way if you're an Android device you handle this is just by putting in big old batteries  So there are automatic limits in Oh on what apps can do in the background  In three main areas implicit broadcast background services and location updates  This will make it easier says Google to create apps that have minimal app impact on a user's battery  Notification channels these are new app-defined categories for notification content  Channels let developers give users fine-grain control over different kinds of notifications  So in the past all you've been able to do is say I don't want a notification from you now  You'll be able to say I want this kind but not that kind  That's good, right  New visuals and grouping to notifications make it easier for users to see what's going on  Auto fill api's  So I use last pass for auto fill which is awesome  But this will make a standard operating system wide  Auto fill api available to apps  So they won't have to kind of do it, you know last past you have to turn on stuff and things  Accessibility work around and stuff so this that's this is welcome news  That means that your password manager will be better at auto filling in passwords  picture in picture  So, you know, we already have that with YouTube right when you're watching a YouTube video  It can go down into a little thumbnail as you do other applications  There's a new app overlay window for apps to use instead of a system alert window and a multi-display support  Actually, I think this is gonna be interesting the split screen  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's that's good for tab. Oh, wait. No, it's handsets. Okay multi-display support is interesting because and you're seeing this already

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Windows phone has it it's called and I was it called  begins with a C  I can't remember but the idea is that your phone is gonna be your computer and  The idea is that your phone is gonna be your computer and  If you can plug it into a display and keyboard suddenly, it's a full-size computer and these phones are so powerful now  I think this is gonna be a big category in the years to come so you don't have more than one computer you have one device

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That can be a desktop a laptop earlier conversation you go abroad and you rent a  Screening a keyboard, right? And this is your computer, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm guessing but that sounds like  Multi display support for launching an activity on a remote display that sounds maybe not maybe more this is more like Chromecast. I don't know  font resources in XML  Adaptive icons to help you integrate better with the device UI  What this is for developers wide color wide gamut color for apps  Newer oh, this is good new Bluetooth audio codecs like LDAC. I'm not familiar with LDAC  New Wi-Fi features like Wi-Fi aware previously known as neighbor awareness networking or Nan  With the appropriate hardware apps and nearby devices  Can discover and communicate over Wi-Fi without an internet access point. Oh  Interesting sort of ad hoc. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At hot networking. Yeah

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we could do ad hoc networking but no one else ran it so it sounds like it'll be built in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Built into Android Oh, that is so nerdy. Awesome nerdy. Awesome. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  think that I mean, yeah think about that for like protests, but also think about what you could do from a from a  Community standpoint or right just even at conferences. Oh so fun. Okay, nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like it  keyboard navigation  Arrow and tab navigation audio API for pro audio  This is something that's really been a problem in the past on Android actually glad to see they're addressing this  And it wasn't really Android's fault. It was because of the kernel they were using but latency on Android was too high for really professional music apps  So there is a new a audio API that will have a high performance low  Latency audio streams that's very interesting for musicians. You know, that's why there's not a lot of great music apps on Android  Mmm web view enhancements Java 8  Partner platform this big some big big big changes but not not so much UI changes as kind of  API change and I think isn't that kind of I  Feel like that's what Google said is that?  They're gonna do a tick-tock thing where they update the interface and then they update under the hood and they update the interface in the  Next one, maybe I'm maybe I'm mistaken that with somebody else, but that would make sense. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really should talk to all these iot companies about how they plan to  How they plan to implement and update their Android on the back end for all of their devices that are running versions of Android  Because a lot of them don't spend a lot of time on that right think well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But do they do do they do iOS is that why is it like that's the platform of choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they they build their stuff on and on Android. Oh, oh, yeah  Your June is a nice. That's right. There's other things  I think the nucleus conference call conference system thing is built on Android. So interesting. There's a it's a it's out there. It's open  Yeah, it's free  It's free

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wrote by Andy Greenberg and wired saying there's good news half of all Android devices have gotten fairly recent security patches  The bad news is half of Android devices haven't  But he says that  In its annual report on security that Google released this week  The company says and I think they're probably right Android security is getting better less malware in the Play Store  devices more often encrypted than not  and more hackers than ever report Android bugs to Google for bug bounties instead of  Selling them to the highest bidder in the private market  Or giving them to the CIA  He also writes Google's release solid data for the first time on Android's most serious nagging security problem the challenge of getting dozens of  manufacturers and hundreds of carriers around the world to patch  Their phones so 50% is a lot better than before still obviously only halfway there  But it's kind of way it's gonna be hard on those cheap old phones to get those patched

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've liked the effort. They've put into the Google Play Store like all the all the security efforts  They've put around that and monitoring. Yes crappy devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they're doing a very good job on an operating system that really is open and  And perhaps a little more vulnerable because of it I think I don't feel insecure on my Android device to you I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't want to say I don't because then someone will be like I accept your challenge I accept

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about you?  No, I but I but I use I mean a pixel I feel like because I'm using a pixel  I'm I'm as safe as Android can be and I feel like it's secure enough. I really do. Yeah, I do. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh on this if you play the summary video for about two minutes in the 30 minute long video you hear Kevin oh  I'm trying to see if he's oh, nope. That's not him.

Oh really not because of his brains or his good looks  It's just his voice just because of his nice voice the audio is a nice voice  1.4 billion Android users  That's that's another takeaway from this report 1.4 billion  Instagram this this week announced they have 400 million daily active users big growth for Instagram by the way  That's and that's I think mostly at the expense of snap. I would guess I  always liked Instagram I  Have to say I use it less now because of the stories  I don't it's purely psychological because you could just use it as you always did just scroll past them, but those videos  They're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did we talk about on any of our shows because this is something Congress is considering this week the FCC

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this gonna pass this makes me so mad I don't know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Want it not to pass it feels like how could this this is so directly anti-consumer. I I just don't understand how

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay  Yeah, so thanks to Senator Jeff Flake aptly named  The there  tonight  the Senate  Will be voting on a measure. That's actually a resolution of disapproval  So that it wouldn't be an affirmative measure  It is just to overturn the existing FCC privacy order that prevents Internet service providers from selling your data  Your surfing history for instance to advertisers  Protecting your privacy  There  So up here's an update from Rico the Senate voted tonight to begin debating the measure  Putting lawmakers on track for a final vote to roll back the FCC rules tomorrow if it's in the Senate  That means this is already passed the house or is it only the Senate that needs to know either way. They go either way  Yeah  Tomorrow tomorrow, okay  of course the house would rubber stamp it because  the house  Then the FCC's privacy rules would be wiped from the books  And and who and who likes this idea? Well guess Verizon  T comcast  Wireless and wired everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is anybody who's providing you a pipe to the internet can take your in right now for example  Google doesn't take your data. I know people like when Google Fiber came out people were like, I'm not getting my internet through Google  They're gonna look at what I'm doing and Google is like heck. No, we're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this would actually how does this do anything but just hand?  Over our information to people who give Congress money to you know to run  I mean this is our so anti-consumer it is the argument from ISPs is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twofold one is sort of legit in the sense that their life is a little challenging at the moment  The other is blatantly not legit  so the legit argument is because of a ruling a federal court ruling in the ninth district some states  Have different privacy rules different rules governing how ISPs can govern can use your information than others  So the idea is doing it at a federal level makes more sense because you know  It's state-by-state regulations for a nationwide provider suck, right?  so  Obviously the ISPs are like oh, well, yeah, we need we need to take all the rules away. This is terrible  It's very difficult to enforce some privacy rules in some states and not in others. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This by the way, if approved by the house and the Senate would effectively  Permanently ban the FCC from ever writing any privacy rules and  according to the EFF  The Federal Trade Commission is already barred from policing Internet service providers  So in other words, there would be nobody at the federal level protecting your privacy online

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nope and remember so a while back AT&T let people  Let they offered a cheaper version of their gigabit plan for people who gave up their privacy  And a lot of people did that because it was freaking expensive to avoid and that's because well, no  No, it was not fair. The FCC actually was investigating that and then a Jeep I became the chairman of the FCC and that's no longer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I mean I'm willing to compromise that seems like at least you're getting that no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because that idea  One they were not transparent about how much you have to pay so it wasn't just a discount it was you  You paid more over time for your privacy to  You only have a choice of two broadband providers in some places. You only have a choice of one and  Yeah, and so charging people for keeping their privacy is inherently. I it's inherently anti-consumer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Especially if they don't have any other course be clear with the Senate is going to vote tomorrow on  Overturning rules that prevent Comcast and AT&T and Verizon and your Internet service provider from selling your private  Information to the highest bidder and you know people are so upset. We hear about it all the time. Oh Google. Oh Facebook  No one knows more about what you do online than your Internet service provider

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this includes the websites that you go to  This includes when you're online it includes data on how many devices you have online

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the key. Here's the absolute key of this is that is that much of what you do online has no PII  You're cooking your phone company and your ISP have your name and your address, right?  It's personally identifiable in the extreme  That's a big difference  I mean if you go back to the days when we didn't have digital we had magazines  Axiom had all kinds of data on you. They still have kinds of data on you  Tied to your name much of what we complain about online is anonymous, but this stuff is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And oh I should also mention in case you guys were wondering on the ISP side here is also the American Association of Advertising  Agencies the American Advertising Federation the data in marketing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, of course, they're the ones we're gonna sell the information to  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is terrible everyone should call their senator  Yes, and explain to them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't I don't work for a big company. I work for you stunning that they that they would even I mean  This is just me and any we don't care about consumers at all  We are in the pockets of the people who pay for our campaigns period

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and there's a lot of sensitive information that you have I mean in in the past so AT&T when it did its its  original plan its gigabit plan for  That used your your website surfing for giving you ads  they did it in a way that it protected like sensitive information, which is medical information and etc, but  We don't necessarily have those guarantees and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here watch this this is if you know some of this is probably over-the-top, but this is what the EFF says  Overturning these rules would allow an internet service provider to do sell your data to marketers. Okay. Well  Yeah, obviously that's the number one thing but it's not limited to that  They could also hijack your searches

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they do that already with DNS reader. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Put ads in your search results, even if you're using Google  they could  Snoop through your traffic and insert ads by the way AT&T Charter and CMA have all done this  They have they all have done this and they were stopped  Remember a nebu ad and form we talked about this a lot on security now a couple of years ago  Well, they had to stop  But they actually had start again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  congressional hearings about this in the people the congressmen at the hearings a  Stunned me with their lack of knowledge about tracking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But well feigned are real feigned are real by the way some it might be real because some of them are just ignorant  Some of them are are being a little disingenuous  Grandstanding. Yes. Yes, whatever. Do you mean?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're telling me that you could  Use these little bugs and tracking devices to follow whatever I'm doing on the internet  Whatever do you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow your southern congressman

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I say I say son say  They could also  Preinstall software on your phone and record every URL you visit. Oh, no, no do that. No just a TT and sprint and mobile T-mobile  Remember carrier IQ we talked about that on security now an application that came pre-installed and phones sold by AT&T sprint and T-mobile  Logged all the sites and apps you use and send it right back to your ISP who now can use it for all sorts of things  And to be clear all of these companies have now installed deep packet inspection

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is what these service the services that these guys were selling way back in 2008 and 2010  So all of the carriers have DPI on their networks already they're just not using it for this  So this is not like a big investment. This is like just scraping money off the table  Any more so so yes, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Deep packet inspection basically is a tool that lets you see like what types of traffic and where it's coming from

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's what the NSA does, right? Well, it's in some ways  It provides a service to the carrier like you know that oh my god YouTube traffic is going through the roof  I need to allocate more  Bandwidth not really bandwidth but ports for those services. It helps you plan your network  but it also can tell you that I spend 15 hours a day on YouTube and  You know  See what websites I go to so  That's already in place. They don't really know what they're doing  That's already in place they don't they don't need to buy new stuff necessarily to do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is easy to implement. No, in fact, you know every one of these five things  They've done them in the past and they stopped because of blowback, but there ain't gonna be no blowback anymore  Verizon used to put remember those cookies you couldn't kill you couldn't turn off  Super cookies right tracking headers into all your all your day remember you could and it didn't matter if you  Turned on do not track and the thing that's our audience has told us time and time again  I've even had to fight with them because they're so adamant that we don't want this kind of  Snooping and  They blame Google and they blame Facebook, but this is gonna happen at where you live  It's gonna happen through your internet service provider far worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you have a VPN  Does

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would help in fact that's one solution right is to stop don't trust your the problem is you know  There's overhead and it slows your traffic down a lot. But if you use a VPN  Well, you're moving trust along down the pipe. You're no longer trusting your ISP  You're you're encrypting all your traffic from your computer. Of course, whoever's at the other end of that VPN you have to trust them  You know, so your VPN provider now becomes the your entry onto the Internet instead of your ISP I  Just I just this is so  Frustrating so that was my second story and I that was why I brought it up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like I blew it. Yeah, we have to do something now because we should have been beating this drum for at least a week

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As long I mean we've known about this going on  But now is it's deadly earnest go to EFF org and go to the table  EFF org and go to the take action page  Call your member of Congress  Call your your senator  house member  Email email not as good calls the best snail mails good too. It's easy to call them and just register  Your your the real thing is in absence of hearing from us  They're gonna go where the money is but they money is only useful to them to the buy votes  And if the voters rebel and we've seen this happen before  With internet regulation if enough people contact them they do pay attention

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So contact them. It's not a done deal used to in the old days. I don't know now all the rules are off  I know we don't know what's going on stop

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  everything yeah  Guys, have you ever gotten a notification from your Google app about a new product being available based on your search history? Oh dear  Because I just got one telling me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did you get one know what what Google app you mean what your Google now cards what Google now cards just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My daughter wants to know that yeah, but it's actually well you think I would get that because I have bought that for my daughter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think now. Okay. This is kind of like the beauty and the beast although less so  You've indicated you've shown through signals that you're interested in Taylor Swift  This is doing you a sir if you really are interested you would like to know she's got a new album going out, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's your Google now cards. So it can be my cards. I don't really want the notification

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's an extra level. I'm gonna see it. What are the rules about?  notifications from Google now, I  Don't think they can you turn those off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't want to turn all of them off because I love when it beings me and says hey  Leave now to get to your appointment. Yeah, that's really useful. Yeah, it doesn't ping me on like package notifications  It doesn't ping there's a lot of things it doesn't tell me  Yeah, I get a lot of packages  It means that's what you got the dog for anyway, right?  It tells you when the weather is gonna be different. But other than that, it usually doesn't notify me of things. Hmm. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't know sorry hope Google's not gonna get more aggressive on that that would be disappointing. Okay, actually this is less important than  It is less important. It is but it's all of a piece. It's all of a piece, isn't it?  It's how it's how our stuff can start using you using us

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Against ourselves or something. Yes. Oh, here's the problem I have  I  Believe that the future of media is about relationships and knowing people and this is gonna give it all cooties and it's gonna  It's gonna go too far  Which is what just what it's just happening and then we'll never be allowed to know anybody anybody you have in May  2016 the GDPR I think it's called the general data private privacy  general  GD privacy  Regulation  You think  Opt in to everything you have to opt in to breathing everything everything and you know, what's the scariest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is gonna be huge you guys  The penalties are 20 million dollars or four percent of your revenue for each indication. That's right  That's huge and you know those test cases. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is I this is  Too far in the other direction though like that stupid I agree you cookie thing  Which now every site you go to it says we use cookies, you know, it's like that is so  Yeah, and then you say okay and it's like how much money and time is wasted on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just I think this is the wrong search for GDPR in Google just search for it and look at the look at the number  Of paid ads that come up on the beginning for for compliance

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a big company's gonna spend a lot of money on this  general protection general data protection regulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So to put that in perspective because I think it's important to have a little perspective here  COPPA which is the our US version for children's online privacy and protection act  I think is like that room. I think that's right. If you violate that it's a  $40,000 fine up to a $40,000 fine per instance  compared to a 20 million dollar fine per instance, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And people by the way  definition of personal data  Name photo email address bank details posts on social networking websites. So your posts there  So what do you think or a computer IP address?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is kind of the opposite of what we're about to do in the United States which which is better

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well somewhere in the middle and a middle would be nice  the challenge is actually  If an American goes to Europe all of this matters if they're in the EU  They become presumably affected by this is how people are reading it and if a European is over here, so it's not just  I'm in Europe. I'm governed by this. It's I'm a European or I'm in Europe  I'm governed by this  So I was talking to someone who was concerned about like if I scan a Europeans badge at my trade show and I want to  Mark it to them. What does that mean for me?  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy, it's really what a contrast  Between what what the EU is doing and what we're doing  That's that's you couldn't have more polar opposites  I don't know. I feel like the EU is going too far. Yes, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah  Data subjects under the age of 16. This is like COPPA  Rental consent will be required to process the personal data of children under the age of 16 for online services. That means your IP address. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can't store your IP. I can't keep I was wondering how yeah, how does this removal of the FCC privacy rules?  kind of  Meld with COPPA because my child is on my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Coppa's it does not undermine COPPA  I mean part of this is coming from the fact that Congress doesn't like the FCC getting involved in this kind of stuff  But Congress made the rules with COPPA  Congress is not saying we can't make the rules only the FCC can't make rules, right?  But COPPA still applies if I'm an ISP

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could you not make the argument that you know, those internet searches were by my ten-year-old

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How does the ISP know right I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mean they can they could assume it's from a device, but you know, that's interesting. Hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, you would have to you would be bound by this  Stacey if you're in the United States collecting information  About an EU resident. There you go. You don't have to be in the EU or use equipment in the EU or anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just offer services to  Anybody in the world is now subject to right which is my lowest common denominator of  freedom highest common denominator of regulation problem  It that just opens the door for China saying no no, no, if anybody can see you you're gonna follow our rules, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this will give Trump, you know much fodder if he if he looks into that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You won't understand it man does not use a computer no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cyber is out of his way out. Yeah  Although although I mean you have to you have to think that what Congress with the Senate is about to do tonight is  As a result of a shift in the United States government  toward  Corporate interests and away from individual interests  Yes, and that and that's that's definitely the result of the of the last election  Yes  All right, I've forgotten my decryption password. Nope you're going to jail  You cannot claim that you forgot your passphrase that would be the US Third Circuit Court of Appeals  I'm doomed says oh god, that's contempt of court

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's gonna go to the next heels for this is the appeal supreme court has to decide gotta go to the Supremes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  An ex-cop claimed he couldn't remember the password to decrypt his hard drive  Which which they believe has child porn right a lower court said  Said no contempt of court Third Circuit today upheld actually two days ago upheld  So and and by the way in doing so  Avoided addressing the lower courts rejection of the defendant's argument that being forced to reveal his password violated his Fifth Amendment protection against  self-incrimination  So they didn't specifically address that  They just said you it's it's willfully disobeying and resisting the order to decrypt the hard drive on his Mac Pro  Is is contempt and can he can be held in contempt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now this is a cop I wonder X how far X cop okay, right  From a journalistic if she  Plays

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they have evidence of stuff that had the hash passing through the computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Forensic examination the computer indicated the device had been used to visit known child exploitation sites and to download thousands of files with the same  Hash values as known child porn files the files were not present on the computer  They are assumed to be stored on external encrypted hard drives  We should just I would like to leave the child porn out of this because that really colors the whole thing because nobody yes  You know everybody we all acknowledge horrendous crime nobody's for that  On the other hand we we would like the court  Well, I don't know what we want the court to do in this case  What do you think yeah?  He the John Doe will call him said he could not remember the passwords necessary to decrypt the drives and  entered several incorrect passwords during the forensic examination  Really the issue was the judge didn't believe him  Well the judge found that dough remembered the passwords needed to grip the hard drive  But chose not to reveal them because of what it was was on there  In other words the Fifth Amendment defense wasn't even addressed or acknowledged  No, you have no Fifth Amendment protection to reveal the password on revealing the passwords  That's also a big deal  We've always held that a password was protected by the right against testimony against yourself  There was it was believed that giving a password would be like testifying against yourself as opposed to giving a fingerprint which would not  Staff attorney senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation says anytime suspects are forced to disclose disclose the contents of their mind  That's enough to trigger the Fifth Amendment end of story  But  And that way in fact the EFF filed an amicus brief in with that point of view ah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  However so with a Chromebook, how would you encrypt a thumb drive?  Since you're not wearing a program which you normally need right to encrypt. I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unless there's a being oh, I know there is a plug-in you could use you couldn't encrypt the whole drive  But you can encrypt files using mini lock. I think there's a chrome extension for mini law  Which is a good a very nice thing to know about you can encrypt folders  Files I  Don't think you can do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Folders it goes back to our earlier conversation about crossing borders

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right mini lock is awesome. Yeah, it's available in the chrome web store. So this is a chrome plug-in you can use  uses a password  And your email and hashes them together  And you can share those in there and they're unencryptable  It also is it's a public key crypto  So I have given out for instance my mini lock hash my mini lock key and if anybody wanted to send me something encrypted  They could I say use my mini lock key to send me something encrypted and only I could decrypt it  Mini lock.io free open source highly recommended. I don't know I should I'm wonder chrome extension  For full disk crypto, I don't think so that doesn't sound like something  You could do  But you certainly could do individual files anyway  See, we're already thinking about that  Exactly. We're only thinking about that. But but this court decision said, you know, you go you'd be in trouble because  We know you know the password

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's assuming a lot but I can I can prove I can take you to 30 places. I can't get into anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're old. Oh, you did forget. Yeah. Well and unlike a web service, uh, I drive

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't just email someone to get your password, right? Right. No, don't know it. I don't know it. I think it's so weird. I  I  That's a big judgment call on the part of the court that well, you really do, you know, you're just pretending you don't know it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's it's I mean I've I've definitely had arguments like that with my kid where I'm like, you know  Who did this? Right? Or nobody. Did you do this? No, I don't remember. No didn't really I didn't do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't do it  I don't remember. I wasn't there at the time. I've never met that woman  Um  All right, um  Let's let's wrap up so we can uh, we can get out of dodge here. I'm just looking to see if there's anything  else we want to  Cover we're we'll be medium. So this is this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Something you might want to know about okay  um  So I don't think I've announced it yet, but I got an invitation to become a medium partner. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ev williams has  Turned away advertising and is looking for new ways to monetize medium. Is this one is this part of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you can join as a paid member paid member then as a writer I can join and then here's the part that i'm not sure  I like  It says that people can always  um post for free on medium definition of always these days who knows but  um  But then I can basically apply to have my stuff  Added into some evidently premium pool, but you know, I don't I don't like editors  I don't want editors  I love editors editors make me unhappy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is that a requirement I want to say of being in the premium pool you have to have an editor

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't want to well, I don't know if they edit you or not, but they pick

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can offer your stuff you'll give them your five dollars a month, but they don't guarantee you'll be in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's two different things I can belong as a reader at five dollars a month  But I can I can belong as a writer  And i'll get a piece of that  Uh based on I guess usage  Um, I thought it was gonna be you know, somebody said we talked about this show when this all started coming down  Somebody said that medium should just buy patreon and let you support the writers you like  But they're going to create basically some kind of uh as well as I read this as I understand  There's going to create some kind of compilation  Interesting so I don't know whether I you're not gonna do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't understand really everything. I mean medium  Besides giving you a nice clean interface. It's really about a community, right? It's kind of  Exactly. That's the value I get from it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  I might as well put it back on, you know buzz machine five bucks a month's not that much  But for here's the problem what the problem there's no shortage of content people, right?  Right here. I heard earlier about the need for a quality network and that's fine. But the other hand  There's no shortage there's no shortage

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we've been having jason calacanis  And marco armit and I have been having a twitter conversation today  Jason said something interesting. He said, you know  Somebody should do a netflix style play with podcast content  create a  netflix  you know a five dollar a month service that you subscribe to  for premium content from audio content from podcasters  as a way to kind of create a new model for podcasters  and um  So it's kind of be kind of like medium, wouldn't it except instead of written word? It's audio  Does 60 db kind of count for something like that? But you don't have to pay to be on 60 db  You just have to be lucky enough for them to pick you

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So but but they could do it that way. I guess they could do that  Uh, if you want to I'm just thinking I think they're thinking about that among other monetization strategies  um  but I just I  I like the idea of being free

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, and you can I mean with voice it becomes really easy to  kind of  Curate something that you like the like your podcast that you like  So I I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I don't I rarely go to the front page of medium though  Jeff, you know, so you don't really I don't think you get much of an advantage being on medium  Wait, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, so i've been on the front page of medium or an no i've been an editor's pick one of my stories  Did it go through the roof?  Yes, it got like  250,000 or 300,000 views which Jesus

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the so it certainly gives you a jump start and probably what happened is that you got more viral  Because you were in a staff pick  And then it I mean that gave you a little jump start but that was enough to kind of stimulate the rest of it  Which still comes you know, all my content comes from links on twitter on facebook on  on  Tech meme congratulations to gabri vera on that nice article about tech meme

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so I just I so I only see stuff that other people link to nuzzle with nuzzle is really great because that's  Links that come from my twitter people I follow on twitter  So it's a great newspaper of because I follow the right people the people i'm interested on twitter. It's a great newspaper material  they have a good algorithm and then a lot of times I do get to medium from that I get there from uh,  um  Reddit the front page of reddit. I get there from uh,  my combinators news  Those are the beats checks. I do I rarely I rarely go to the I always think  I often think I should go to the front page of media more often. There's some good stuff on here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There there is there's well, but they also send you an email need. Uh the email that's that you see I I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm the wrong person on that but everybody says oh email is the way to get a hold of it to reach people same here  But I hate email. I get too much of it. I never look at my email

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, it's no way ever newsletters. I just don't do it newsletters gonna take over the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a filter my email filter says if there's unsubscribe the word unsubscribed is in the bottom of any email  Put it in this folder, which I never look at

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, are you saying you're not subscribed to my newsletter you guys I am but it's in the folder  oh  Useless to me leo useless

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You are dead to me, but we're unusual I think right because everybody says oh no  You want to reach people emails the best system for reaching people blah blah blah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you you would vouch for that right stacey, well, it's the best way to reach a certain type of audience  So like I I cover something pretty niche. I've got a dedicated group of people who are like  I really care about the internet of things and so  I think it's valuable to them because they don't have to I bring them all the stuff right as opposed to  Having them go out and find it  So I think for some people but if you're like a general interest person and you subscribe to my newsletter  You're probably going to open it and be like, oh my god. What the heck this too much iot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just get so many newsletters that I just put them in the folder and I never read them  I do the beat checks, you know, I mean i'm just i'm doing the beat checks  I go to tech meme and all those sources and my feed leaf rss  Reader and all that stuff. That's how I find news hacker news  And I find that much more useful than going so i'm interested in iot, but i'd rather  Just you know what I you know why this works because it's hacker news and tech mean they're curated  Nuzzle, they're curated somebody else  There's some they're they're they're collating signals from a bunch of people  And whether it's hacker news, so it's people I know who are interested in stuff I am or

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what a newsletter is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's only curated by one person  Okay, that's fair. I'm like this is curated by a this is the wisdom of the crowd

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got it  The crowd, but you're right, you know, I that's why I subscribe to your newsletter and and kevin roses

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I subscribed to a bunch of really good newsletters. I just for some reason I never get around to reading them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's okay. I'm not i'm i'm gonna go over there and cry  Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really should come up with a new strategy what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, well congratulations to the zurich  Congratulations  He's finally out of bankruptcy  Wow my my decade-long involvement with peter teal is over he's not holding any grudges  A couple of quickies before we uh before we wrap up, uh, kurt eichenwald's  Harasser has been arrested kurt a uh columnist for vanity fair  He's also epileptic  He has been sent tweets in the past with epi epigenetic  Images designed to send him into a seizure  They caught  A guy who allegedly intentionally sent him a jif designed to provoke a seizure and the way they caught him was kind of interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To oh that was interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So in  After they caught him they read his direct messages in which he messaged other people  I hope this sends him into a seizure  Let's see if he dies so that you know, they got the smoking gum and gun in terms of intent  The way they got him the the the the alleged  tweeter  Was using a burner phone  Actually, no, he was not using it  But he was using a sim a burner sim that he got which was not associated in any way with his name  But he put it in his iphone 6  and so the fbi got a warrant for twitter and got the uh,  the the sim information  And then they which gave them the phone number and then they went to at and no they went to apple  They went to apple with a phone number and said is this associated with any iCloud accounts and apple said oh, yes  Yes, it definitely is. Here's the guy  So even though he had a anonymous sim  Because he used it in the iphone and it got attached to his iCloud account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I just usually I say gif or gif I do both because I can't remember what the right answer is

Transcript:  Who's merely harassed as opposed to sent to the hospital?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that what you're asking well i'm trying to understand like yes, I guess  How do you how do you go? How far do you have to go?  In what other mediums could you pursue someone?

This is good and it's google specific too  So this is my really specific if this than that applet  So my challenge is every night before I go to bed. I turn my phone to do not disturb mode because  I love my sleep. Yes  And I hate notifications about new albums in the middle. I don't want to hear  So  So what I did is I tied it to my fitbit  Um, and what happens so you activate?  Your fitbit and I believe you can do this with other fitness trackers that are also on if this and that they don't have a  I'm sleeping mode now  um, so I have to manually turn it off at night, but in the morning I always forgot to  Turn it back on so i'd be like at two o'clock i'd be like you have 30 missed calls because I never turned my phone  ringer back on basically  So  I set it up. So once my fitbit has logged my sleep for the night  It turns the ringer on my phone up to 70 in my case, but you can turn it all the way up if you want  If you're running android 7.0  It will take your phone up from do not disturb mode if you're running anything earlier than that. You shouldn't be  um also  It won't work. So this is for people with android phones and a fitbit  But you can also do it with other sleep tracking things and it's not immediate it takes a few minutes, but it is like  Help me all this week. Make sure I answer my or make sure I get my phone calls and texts. So yay
