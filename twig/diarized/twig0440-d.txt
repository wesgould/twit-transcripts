Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From people you trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Twig.  Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by Cashfly.  C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y dot com.  This is Twig this week in Google.  Episode 440 recorded Wednesday, January 17th, 2018.  Shugoo Guru Lyman Van Vliet.  It's time for Twig this week in Google, the show where we cover the latest news from the Googleverse.  Well versed in Google, Jeffrey Jarvis, professor of journalism at CUNY,  he's even written a book about Google called,  What Would Google Do? What Would They Do? BuzzMachine.com.  Is it out of date? I mean, is Google Act operating the same way they did when you wrote the book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually think they are pretty much.  Just that they became a mobile company is the main difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, I mean, yeah.  I mean, and every company has to change, but there's also, yeah, there's also the DNA, the heritage,  the way the company was founded that doesn't change much.  And also joining us, I don't know who the hell this is.  It looks well, Stacey's been kidnapped.  The lower third says Stacey Higginbotham of Stacey on IOT.com.  But you're telling me that's not permanent, which the blonde hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is a wig. If you want, I'll wear my purple one next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really like it. I really like it.  What do we think about Stacey as a blonde?  I think I like you as a brunette, but I'm just used to you as a brunette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm both. Yeah, she's a blue net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I'm a blue net. Normally I kind of have two colors in my hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, this actually ties into the first story of the day because the viral hit of the of the week  is this Google Arts and Letters app that everybody's going, all the kids are going crazy about  that takes a picture of you. It's been out for months.  We've known about this for months, but all of a sudden it was discovered.  Thank you, Instagram, for making it a hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Didn't they add a new feature?  It wasn't the matching was a new feature for this app because this had always been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so what you do and you've not done it, but I'll just give you an example and maybe  a cautionary word of warning. This is what I did.  I did this. I can't remember which I was doing.  So that I'm just warning you, the results are not always flattering.  So what happens is it takes a picture of you and in the app, it's a little hard to find.  I'll help you do it in a second.  And then it goes through its vast arts and culture collection of artworks and comes up with what it  using face matching technology. What do you think, Jeff?  Is that that's a pretty good likeness, you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.  So let me show you. I got to get one.  See, you're not. Yeah, I got.  Let's see here. You don't look like the beard.  They don't. It looks like Abe Lincoln.  No, I got another guy with the beard.  You know, of course, Google can't see my face because I'm actually a ghost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like there's a side view of this guy in a way.  This this one of me was good because it reminded me that even though I don't feel like an old man,  apparently I am. I did it earlier.  I was just thinking that this person that this guy is probably my age, right?  It's a he's Charles Wellington first.  Oh, no, I'm sorry. Sir George Grove, the painter is Charles Wellington first from the Royal College College of Art and Music.  And he looks a little like Ben Franklin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He does. And mine just identified my guy as older gentleman, older gentleman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So are you ready, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't because Texas is the other state.  That is so says the chat room.  So you can try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is in Illinois and Texas.  Illinois has a state law.  What the what that says you can't do biometric facial recognition.  Can't you get permission for it?  I mean, it seems odd because obviously a lot of like if you have an iPhone 10,  you're doing it. If you post a picture to Facebook, you're doing it.  Does it is Facebook prohibited in Texas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, but so this is a privacy aspect.  So the iPhone does not share your face with Google's or Apple's A.I. efforts.  So that's what this is about.  Facebook has been sued by Illinois attorney general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, because this is exactly what Facebook does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, yeah. Oh, they sued a lot of people.  So Illinois has seen has argued with Snapchat, Shutterfly, United Airlines.  This is like a strange law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it wasn't written correctly, but I mean, if you choose to do it.  Yeah, you should be able to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but Google isn't exactly upfront about like when your friends like,  check out this cool app.  It's not like Google saying it could so the app could stop and say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know what you're doing now.  How stupid do you have to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not to understand it's uploading your picture to Google so it can search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it's kind of OK.  That is a very high bar.  There's a lot of people who don't understand what's happening.  OK, just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there is a article in the Houston Chronicle,  if you're really interested, by a good friend named Dwight Silverman,  how to get around the block in Texas and Illinois.  It just turned off location, basically.  IOS settings, privacy, location services and just turn it off.  Or you could use a VPN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say I could do a VPN, but I'm not really that excited about that.  It's not that worthwhile.  Next time I'm in California, I'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To prove that it's possible, Dwight did it.  He's in Houston.  And he looks exactly like in a portrait of Baron Samuel Vaughn, somebody or other.  You know what? I'll be honest with you.  I don't none of them are that spot on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there was this thing of people standing in museums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're doing that just to get me annoyed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What you do, especially since I can't do it and get some sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're safe. You're safe.  I'm sorry, Jeff.  Stacey and I were bickering. Go ahead.  What were you saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mom, dad.  There was there was a meme of people standing next to paintings  that looks like them.  That was actually good.  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you have to that's a lot of work.  You have to go. There we go. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leave your images for people standing next to paintings.  Go ahead and look.  I search for people standing next to paintings that look like them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't you just understand what I want, Google?  Oh, that would probably be illegal.  And Illinois and would be a violation.  It would be a violation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a few of them here.  There's like one or two of them here.  There's a guy with the the guy on the top there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a pretty good one.  Except for the that's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The T-shirt. That's a good one.  That's pretty good. The bald guy, balding guy is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those are actually the people in American Gothic, just so you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Ken Tucker, who used to be the TV critic at the Weekly. Yeah.  It gave him American Gothic and he does look like it.  It's hilarious. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't know exactly why I'm getting these.  Well, I think it's Google search.  It's it's mixed in with the meme. Here's.  He said, sorry, Kamei and then Johnny.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Oh, no. Should I not scroll any farther?  No, I'm sure it's fine. It's Google.  I'm sure. What could possibly go wrong?  I think I go wrong.  Is your safe search on?  Yeah, I think the top I should turn it on.  Top. That's there's no others.  Monet does not look like his water lilies. I just want to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there's a guy in a night thing.  In a night's armor, the white beard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's funny. He's posed.  He's in night's armor posing next to night's armor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, there's night's armor and he's in a sweater.  Oh, I don't see that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I got a different.  That's the filter bubble we live.  We all live in. It is.  We have different searches.  Barack Obama mentioned in his interview with David Letterman on Netflix.  I haven't watched yet. How was it?  I haven't watched it yet.  He talks about the filter bubble.  In fact, the only controversial thing is, he said at all, was that  we live in two different worlds.  Many of us people watch Fox News aren't in the same world.  The people who watch CNN or MSNBC. He said it.  He said that. And that was fairly controversial.  And but then he talked about the filter bubble and he said,  if you and I search for the same word on Google, we'll get different results  because Google tailors the results to you.  And that's and so he talked about that filter bubble issue, which you you have.  This is from Eli Pariser's book.  And you have many times you have debated this and said,  and I kind of I've come around to your sense.  Although it is true that we tend to hear what we want to hear  and surround ourselves with people who say what we want to,  you know, especially politically, but in every respect,  who think the same way we do.  The beauty of the Internet is is you stuff still leaks in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'll come around a little bit, too.  I you know, I've been arguing that they have said this on the show  that I think the Facebook's greatest opportunity is to introduce us  to people we don't know, make strangers less strange.  And the filter bubble is not an information filter bubble  so much as a human filter bubble, where we just don't.  There's not enough diversity. Right. Simply put.  And and Facebook is an opportunity to encourage greater diversity.  So after the Facebook changes, which I'm sure we'll discuss,  I wrote a post about the changes themselves.  And then today I put up a post about rethinking the definition of community  because I realize that I think Facebook and media define it far too  shallowly and temporally, where if you if you if you get into a conversation  with somebody, somehow you're in a community.  No, you're not. A community is where you're joined together with people  and membership around something common, a need, a concern.  Something. And that's not what Facebook enables the world to make.  It could be. And I think it's I think it's a, you know,  it's a place they could go. And neither media, you know.  So so then when you have those communities,  then you kind of identify with who you know and who you are.  Then you need to be able to meet people who aren't like you.  Then you need to find the value in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is Facebook's coming change,  which is to disconnect itself from publishers and really put stuff  from your friends and family in the feed.  Not expressed that way. OK. Tell me what they're doing.  They're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are emphasizing family.  They are deemphasizing external content in general.  That doesn't mean that they will deemphasize news,  especially if your friends share it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I'll see that if my friends share it.  Yeah. New York Times. You still see that.  Yeah. So I'm looking at my feed and I, you know, and also,  if you follow a group that has news in it, you'll get a lot of news.  But this is so this is a news story, but it's shared by a friend.  And in fact, what's nice about all of this is this is all friends now.  And that is very different. It's not.  Lisa did. I've always said that Lisa remind me of a strong, powerful black woman.  I think that's true.  And apparently so Google feels the same. So does Google. Same way.  I don't know. Do you think that looks like Lisa? That's interesting.  Anyway, I'm sorry. See, this is why Facebook's new thing is good.  It's it's people we care about and friends and family instead of brands. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You used to say that your feed was all me.  And I noticed I'm not in it once now. So that's why you like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, did I unfollow you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This show is full of truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying to remember. No, I don't think I don't think I.  You're right. Where's Jeff in my feed? Have you not posted this week?  Ouch. Of course I posted.  But this is interesting.  I usually get a lot of. Yeah, because you don't.  Well, you know why I get a lot of you because you put your Twitter feed into this.  Oh, I wonder if we cut that out.  Oh, there's your.  But yeah, this is Twitter.  This is Twitter. Let me make sure Twitter. OK.  You're still I'm not snoozing you or anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're twice in a row. That's good. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. See, this is why I think I get a lot of Jeff,  because when I do get Jeff, I get it comes in in spurts.  So these are tweets. Yeah, that would be interesting.  If if if Facebook were to do that,  deprecate auto posts from Twitter, wouldn't that be interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they did for a while a couple of years ago that they did.  They discouraged it.  And so I stopped cross posting and I would try to post them both.  It was pain in the butt.  And then it apparently changed.  And, you know, I will sometimes go into Facebook  and kill something I did on Twitter so I can do it appropriately to Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I do. I use Dave Weiner's thing  called Radio 3.IO.  And so it's a bookmark lit.  And when I see a story that I want to really, I'm bookmarking it for the shows.  Shows. So I I use this.  I bookmark it.  And then it cross it posts to Facebook and Twitter.  But this this part, the top part is the text.  And then there's the link.  And underneath it, both on Facebook and Twitter, you know how they do that  that snippet from the actual page.  And this works, I think, quite well for me.  And then it also goes to pin board, which is what Carsten uses  to build the rundowns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Carsten builds it. Oh, pin board.  Okay, pin board. Well, and I have a further.  And I'm like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we use Pinterest for all of our editorial.  No, I have a further thing, which actually is Carsten's idea.  It worked quite well.  I then use Zapier, which is like if this than that on steroids  to put it in a Google spreadsheet  called Leo's Links, and he can go to Leo's Links.  And it's the same format as the rundown.  So he can just copy a line.  Oh, that's explains that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Next time I'm there, I want to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I just I don't actually.  Carsten brings order to your brain.  Yes. Well, it's the order it's in is chronological for me  without reference to show.  I used to tag it with the show, but unfortunately, Dave's tool  doesn't allow me to do tagging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, Carsten, you just go down from Leo's list and populate  what you think is relevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He has a lot of his own stuff, too.  Yeah.  I like this.  You actually look at this, Jeff Jarvis.  You tweeted something I also bookmarked,  which is Joel on software's.  This is all related. Joel Spolsky, who I.  You put it.  But I liked it.  He's his New Year's resolution was to give up  reading Twitter and Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said it on the show last week.  That's the new I don't have a TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, the time I didn't have a TV, actually,  I was also happier.  In fact, if I just would live underground with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then when you got the TV, you only watched PBS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a correction, by the way.  Obama did not compare Fox to CNN or MSNBC.  He said people who watch Fox News get a very different worldview  within the people who listen to NPR.  And that is absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's totally true.  My my father watches Fox News all the time.  And he is his vision of the world is terrifying.  Like he just.  Same with my father.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's American carnage.  It's the American carnage channel.  So, you know, if I've one of the things, by the way, people say,  oh, don't talk politics.  This is not about politics anymore.  It's what media we may disagree about politics.  I'm probably more conservative than either of you.  That's not what we're talking about here.  We're talking about an aberration in the world, not about politics at all.  I mean, I, you know.  Well, anyway, that's what I'm saying.  Anyway, let's talk about this.  Joel Spolsky, you think that I like his birdcage liners,  because that's what we used to call the newspaper. Right.  And he says, you know, his point is Twitter  and Facebook, Twitter more so than Facebook, but both are kind of  designed to foster outrage and flames.  And when you read them, he says, I feel bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is media.  That's all the news media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I don't watch sensationalistic television programming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, in the news media, that's I mean, there's there's the front page.  Right. But then there's also like the feature section.  And there's nothing puffier than the feature section.  I mean, that's all like feel good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even there, even there, there's there's kind of what  what bad things could happen to you.  And I'm just learning the business.  Nightly news. I've done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was a tabloid. And I'm not a fan of that in any form.  So when I when I feel bad because I, you know, when I tell my mom,  stop watching so much CNN because she she won't even fly anymore  because she's so scared.  And I don't like that.  So I kind of do kind of get those inputs out of my life.  I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  Why is this wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just to be clear, a minute ago when I said, I'm in the business,  I wasn't doing that in a haughty way.  I was I was doing that.  Actually did it. He actually did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, I was like.  Yeah, I also was in the business, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they are so I'm not satisfied.  But you weren't in the sensationalism business.  I was not saying I've never been in the business.  He was in the sensationalism.  I was in the bad side of the business.  I worked for the New York Daily News doing Page One's magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh. Your headline brain must be awesome.  Did you write your own headlines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got there after. Oh, yeah.  I got there, though, after the brilliant days of the daily news.  But I somewhere in my basement, I have a page one of Donald Trump on it  that talks about him being the leading up the year's losers.  He got mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's funny, though, what I realize is he gets mad,  but he also loves it because the most important thing is the attention.  More than anything else.  Here are the here are the iconic  daily news covers starting in 1919.  It was a tabloid.  Germans block signing of treaty.  Oh, loss and stop. It's not getting really well, actually,  that's getting a little sensationalistic.  Look at the woman on the phone.  A loss in stock collapse, 10 billion.  That's Japan at war with US.  Next photo. Oh, I have to. What is this?  What is this an ad? It's over in Europe.  Oh, wow. Maryland did.  That's sad. We carry on.  That's a great cover.  And a famous picture of John John saluting  the president's casket, flagged ribbed casket as it went by in the funeral  cortege in 1963.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was these are not their their headlines that we remember.  No, no. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, maybe we haven't gotten Ford to city dress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now that's now we're getting into the this is now we get in the 70s.  We're getting a little bit into the feisty.  Now, you're right, though.  Now, this is more straightforward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  These are like hard news, hard news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you got to go to the New York Post and I went I just I Googled  daily news, famous daily news covers, but I guess that was the wrong one.  That's I didn't get there. This is from the daily news.  They don't want to really celebrate.  The yeah, see, you can't go to the daily news for those.  Oh, you know what you go for?  Google Image Search now.  Now you get the good stuff.  Arrest weirdo in tape murder is is that was the news that said  headless body found in town was supposed to suppose.  Oh, gosh, some of these I don't want to look at.  You know, they're too depressing.  Fidel Gastro,  dictator reportedly OK after stomach surgery.  This was a famous one. I never forget this one. Got him.  So what was what was your favorite headline that you wrote, Jeff Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, God, I can't remember.  Think about it and tell you, I can tell you my People magazine headline  that I like best. Yes.  Shoe Guru Lyman Van Vliet cures tattered  tennis toes with sheer stick to it of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God. I love. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does it even mean?  There was a product called Shoe Guru.  Yes. To fix tennis.  And they did a feature story on them, and I wrote the headline.  Shoe Guru Lyman Van Vliet cures tattered  tennis toes with sheer stick to it of this.  I use that for a announcer trial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now on, when I when I am practicing my microphone technique,  I shall I shall proclaim Shoe Guru Lyman Van Vliet cures.  You see, you can't even say it.  Shoe Guru Lyman Van Vliet cures tattered tennis toes with sheer stick to it of this.  Wow. Nice. By the way, here's the art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I went to journalism school.  Oh, man, there it is. Oh, you found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shoe Guru Lyman Van Vliet cures tattered tennis toes with sheer stick to it of this.  That is a great. I thought it was tennis toes.  How did it screw that up?  How did Sally Corris, the person who wrote that article, feel about your headline?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have no idea, because the thing was she was the reporter.  Right. So I was the writer.  So that's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you and I think it's even more important in this day and age  where people don't read articles, they just share them because of the headline.  The headline is often written by another person, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not anymore. No, not in a magazine.  Yes, it was back in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not even in a newspaper, in magazines.  I think headline writers are still separate, right?  In print digitally? No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So at Fortune, if you're doing someone will do your headline.  You're every writer has to come up with three headlines.  And then many of them gets taken out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But. Yeah, because I mean, I'm not kidding.  The headline is the most important part of the whole article  from the point of view of social sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, we also had a person who did our  they would actually write the tweets.  Fortune had like two social media people who would.  No, so strange, the process was whack,  but they would actually write the tweets and write Facebook stuff.  The reason it was whack is because they had like a timeline.  So like if you had breaking news, they would stick it in the timeline,  but then it wouldn't get tweeted out for like hours.  So that just. They had a queue.  Yeah, they had a queue and they that we had rules about what got tweeted,  when and how fast it was ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Jeff, you wrote a medium article on what you think about the changes.  Let's let's let's let's break this down.  You say, yes, I'm worried.  Zuckerberg says he's going to prioritize posts that spark conversations  and meaningful interactions between people.  That doesn't necessarily mean what the headline said, which is  going to deprecate news articles.  No, it actually doesn't. Yeah.  So what is he going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They believe they they they've bought the research internal and external  that sitting and staring passively at the news.  That sitting and staring passively at content, including especially videos  is where they hear they had all these publishers pivot to video,  watching passively watching video.  They think that's bad for you.  So they think that that interaction with your friends is good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We read that we read that study from Facebook when when it came out  a few weeks ago, you know, it was a little self-serving.  They said it's bad for you to just passively consume content.  It's good for you to share.  And this is this is in effect, Mark, putting this into action.  But by the way, I also saw that Facebook's engagement numbers  have been going down for two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is all there's an argument that this is this is a long play  to try to fix the experience and have a happier experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even read somebody said this is the beginning of the end for Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, well, that's a wonderful headline.  Everyone would click on that no matter what it's well.  I think it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me see if it was in the Monday.  Yeah, let me see.  This is Frederick Falu writing in the money.  Oh, yeah, that's Frederick. Yeah.  I think he said this is the beginning of the end.  Maybe he was it him or somebody else?  Somebody else said that.  It's a good it's a good article, and it's clear it is not.  It is not a sensationalist piece by any means.  None of what I didn't write.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's here's the core problem I learned in conversations  that I've had through my CUNY gig with Facebook people.  Facebook had two giant buckets of content.  One was social content, the stuff that they are now going to promote.  That was your friend talking to your friends and your families and your cats.  And the other was everything else, so-called public content.  And the problem was that quality New York Times, Washington Post,  Twitter, whatever, got thrown in with crap.  And in the view of Facebook, it was all just public content.  And I think that's what got them in trouble.  I think that's what enabled people to game it and for the crap to rise so much.  And for the quality not to.  And and because they didn't want to do something that neither Google nor Facebook  wanted to do, which was to judge quality.  Google has now said, as we talked on the show many, many times,  Ben Gomes, the head of search engineering, now says in search ranking,  they will judge quality, authority, reliability.  Facebook's got to deal with that devil and figure it out.  So in a way, what I said in the piece is that I fear that they're going to throw  out the journalistic baby with the trolley bathwater, that by trying to get  rid of the stuff that's getting them in trouble, they get rid of a lot of good  stuff. And my hope is, and I still have hope that they'll do this, is that they  can bring back in some of the good stuff and still promote that.  And we'll see.  I kind of agree with you that this is the wrong thing to do is to react to what

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  got them in trouble.  The right thing to do would be to react to falling engagement, a lack of interest  among people under 25.  That's going to be a problem in the long run.  And and how Facebook makes people feel.  I mean, if they have apparently do research that shows that certain kinds of  content and passive consumption make people feel bad.  All of that's the right thing to react to saying, oh, we're in trouble because of  fake news.  Is the wrong thing to react to, I think.  Which is why I wrote the second post that I wrote today, and I'm not trying to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  myself more clicks.  But but if you define community merely as conversation, that's too thin and shallow.  And that's what gets us in trouble.  That's where the crap is.  That's what I'm sure Facebook might do instead.  So Facebook said they want to spark conversations and meaningful interactions  between people.  I say I'd prefer them to be meaningful, lasting and trusting interactions among  people.  Plural.  Imagine a Facebook where they enable you to start your own Rotary Club to improve  your community or your own church or your own AA or your own classroom or your own  mutual support society.  It kind of can a little bit, but it's not designed for that.  Right.  It's designed for I share this and we talk about it and media likes that and  Facebook likes that.  But that's not real community.  What do people Facebook means it?  What do its customers want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if Facebook means it, what do its customers want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I look at meetup as an example.  Right.  And I think Scott Heiferman built very quietly, built something that had great  power in saying that people still want to get together around common interests and  not yell at each other and do things together.  And I and there's a lot of gnashing of teeth that since our parents got old, the  Rotary Clubs and the Kiwanis Clubs and the bowling leagues and all that have gone  away.  And I think there's an opportunity for Facebook to bring some of that back as  meetup is done in person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But meetup is about is about meat space.  It is as is the Rotary Club.  Can you do that kind of meaningful engagement online with people or does it  have to be in a real world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't think it has to go ahead.  So I think very successful online communities can emerge, but they're usually  highly curated and they're usually built organically around some sort of either  content that people are excited about.  Like I think about like IRC or the boards are used to frequent or now, you know,  even comments on certain blogs, you know, they're a community actually does build  up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is Reddit an example of what you might imagine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The parts of Reddit can be.  So, I mean, you can't just say all of Reddit, right?  There are supportive, lovely parts of Reddit.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you get to choose as a Reddit user, you get to choose where you go on Reddit.  Obviously there's bad places on Reddit, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But like if what was her name?  Blog, Blogis, was that her name?  I can't remember your age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't remember mine.  I don't know.  Blog Diva?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  Hold on.  Sounds like how many syllables?  I think it's the Blogis.  It is the Blogis.  Okay.  Oh, the Blogis.  Yes.  Yes.  The Blogis.  Yes.  Okay.  So that's a good example.  Yes.  So she came online with a point of view and she manages to find a real community  that, that supported her and that supported each other.  That's kind of old school blogging, isn't it?  Well, that's just an example from the past.  So I just, that's what I look for.  And I think like to get there though, you do have to have a highly curated,  motivated people, even think about something like the toast.  That was an amazing community for three years.  That was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that's part of the problem.  And we see that happen in Reddit.  We see it happen on Facebook is that there's something corrosive  about being on the internet.  People try to game you.  We get trolls.  You have to constantly massively curate it.  And even then, look what happened to dig.  The gaming practically killed, did kill it.  I'm sorry.  Did kill it.  So there's something corrosive about being on the internet, isn't there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, because it's easier to like the barrier to trolling is so much lower.  Right?  I mean, there's always been people who think it's fun to send hate mail to people.  And all that stuff.  It's just much easier now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you have a meat space meeting, if somebody's acting like a jerk,  yeah, you push them out and it doesn't happen that often, frankly.  Well, and you have more signals to give you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have more, you know, it's like a cocktail party, except without the booze.  You know, it's hard to do it.  And they're there to accomplish things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hard to do an internet community.  And I have been on many and watched them all decline bit by bit, like the well.  It started for me with the well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what was the well?  What I'm trying to say is this, Leo.  The well was built around having a community as if community was kind of a generic  as opposed to say, well, the well was more like Reddit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, right. The well had groups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And so like if you were a deadhead and you went to the deadhead group on the well,  I think it had groups or maybe you would just I can't remember how that worked.  But it was a it was a wonderful community.  But it was like using it before it.  You'd follow these news groups.  But in almost inevitably, it would descend into flame wars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I'm saying is here's what I'm trying to say.  Those were built around interests or content.  Yes, that's correct.  As opposed to being built around a a accomplishment or a cause.  A Rotary Club existed to make the town better.  A union exists to get us our rights.  A political movement exists to get something done.  A exists to give support to people.  The problem is that I think that both media and Facebook  had think too highly of content of this notion that, oh,  community is that which gathers around what we do.  No, communities gathers around people's needs in their lives  and serving those needs and the mechanisms to serve those needs.  I think we have to turn around our definition.  That's why I'm saying our entire definition of community, I think, is too shallow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are we trying to take meat, space and shoehorn it into the Internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could accuse me of doing exactly that.  But I think that there you know, I saw somebody's post today  and I forget where it was somewhere on Facebook.  Somebody said, hey, wherever you are, join your town's Facebook group  because, wow, you learn things about that.  And it's great as people who care about the same as you care about.  And no, I think it's possible.  I think it's hard.  Doesn't have to be physically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one of the things I liked about the Internet is, is that  interest groups didn't have to be geographically proximate,  that you could have a chess club that's all over the world  instead of a chess club that's in Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if you're trying to make the world a better place, like some of Jeff's examples,  it becomes very hard not to do that locally.  So that.  I don't think you you can do a lot of things entirely online.  I think to fulfill some basic human needs for most people,  getting you away from your computer is probably going to be better  and having a meat space counterpart.  I hate so I spent

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I read this book called The Politics of Mass Society  and at a higher level by William Kornhauser in 1959.  You know, he was a very used copy  because I'm very interested right now in this notion of mass society.  And so, Stacey, you're right, I think that local is very powerful.  But when you're a, you know, a transsexual teenager,  local may be gathering 100 people from around the world  to feel you have enough to have a community.  So local can local can now gather new definitions.  But in either case, what Kornhauser says  is that when you have a paucity of independent groups, I'm quoting him,  then people are more subject to manipulation and mobilization.  So in a pluralist and a proper, good pluralist and diverse society, he says,  and I'm quoting, the population is unavailable for such manipulation  in that people possess multiple commitments to diverse  and autonomous groups to communities.  When people are divorced from their communities and work,  they feel free to reunite in new ways that is to be feed for trolls.  That's that's what really struck me in this discussion,  that the more we have more connections to people.  And the great thing here is that  because the problem is when you don't have a community you define yourself with,  you're just part of an anonymous mass.  But when you do define yourself with a community,  you also define yourself as an individual.  That's the great, wonderful paradox about communities  that by joining a community, I also establish my own identity as a person  and that a community that is open to many communities and that allows  and values those stronger connections among those communities  is going to be a more pluralist and diverse society.  A society where we are lumped together is vulnerable to totalitarians.  And I apologize for that faux academic moment there.  But that's that's that's what fascinated me about this whole discussion  on Facebook was was to rethink the value of these ties.  And David Weinberger would argue the weak ties do add up to something strong.  And I agree with that.  And I've been there for a long time.  But that's not sufficient.  End of lecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I was like, that was very deep.  Is this going to be enough to say is this going to be enough to save Facebook?  And what do publishers do going forward?  So there's you know, there's two things going on.  Is this enough to say Facebook?  But also publishers are freaking out because they used they live by the sword,  die by the sword, live by Facebook.  Now they're afraid they're going to die by Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And as I say, my piece, I fully, you know, confess,  I drove people to do more on Facebook as to Facebook themselves.  And people said to me all along, we're going to get the rug  pulled out from underneath us. And I think I said that.  Where's the rug? Oh, you know, you and others as well. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But I noticed we didn't.  You know, there was a lot of interest, perhaps, in going all along.  I've seen this every time. You know, we've been doing this now 12 years.  More than that. 13 years.  And and, you know, there there was a whole thing.  Oh, we should do more Facebook video. Oh, we should do more YouTube video.  You should. Why do you distribute anywhere but YouTube?  Why don't you just put it all on YouTube?  And I kind of held the line and I'm kind of glad I know.  You're right. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem and I don't think it's beleveling on Facebook's part.  I think that that they just come along and try something that doesn't work  and they try the next thing and oops, the collateral damage is the collateral damage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think you're right. I absolutely agree with you on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that doesn't that doesn't defend it.  I as I do say in my in my first piece, I think that Facebook,  whether it wanted or not, became the key distributor of news and information  society and it cannot abrogate that responsibility.  Why not figure out how to carry out that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Their only interest at this point is as their only interest ever has been.  To be a profitable corporation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but then you've got Zuckerberg there saying he wants to build a better  Facebook, saying he wants to build a better society, saying he wants to build run  communities. That's good for the corporate public.  Well, that's also a company has to have some vision, I think.  Google still has a vision.  So organized information and make it people are happier when they connect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. That's it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  His vision is just letting people in the world connect.  And I don't think there's anything to do with news with regard to that.  And I actually don't know if I want Facebook to be my arbiter of news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And are you OK if Facebook just said no more news? Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Except, oh, does that mean even if I post a news article?  Yeah, exactly. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, yeah, then I'm fine with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't get it.  Our Times has no role there.  Unless I explicitly make them my buddy.  Well, right.  This is the funny thing, Jeff.  If you ask normal people, that's what they assume Facebook is.  Yes. Yes. You have a good.  They don't they don't think it's how I file.  Although we also know almost half of America gets his news from Facebook solely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what is the social responsibility Facebook does has?  That's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should put a big banner that says don't get your news here, kids.  Go to Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Their big responsibility is probably transparency about the data  they're collecting, transparency about how they're manipulating  what they show you.  I mean, that's that's their ethical job.  It's not. It's not to show us.  I agree with you on that.  What? Let me ask you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with you in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, let me ask you another way, Dan.  Do television networks have a responsibility to help inform the public?  Was that is that a proper responsibility?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because they're using public airwaves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about cable? What about cable systems?  Do they have a responsibility?  So cable cable say I'm going to get rid of I'm going to get rid of it.  CNN and Fox, it just causes too much trouble, says Comcast.  I just screw it. I'm going to get rid of it.  That's fine.  Would they be abrogating their public responsibility?  No, no.  It might be a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, yeah.  I'm kind of like, hey, what would happen if that happened?  Oh, jeez.  Our conversations and news might get better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The all news channels are if you're going to point to one thing wrong  with this country, it's the 24 hour news cycle created by these all news channels.  I would submit no matter what Facebook does is de minimis.  What Facebook does is de minimis compared to what 24 hour news channels have done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I would also argue that if you eliminated those things,  not that that's going to happen, you would also create a better environment  for support for local news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, for news, for real news, for your newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, my. Or it could be delivered via the Internet.  I don't care. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There'd be a market for news.  You want news? Go to.  Yeah, we have a really good system for delivering news called the Internet.  TV is not a good system for delivering news.  It never, ever has been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is the Internet a good system for delivering news? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a great system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a good system as long as you are able to critically read things  and understand where they came from. That's up to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to. Yes.  But I'm sorry, if you're not able to do that.  Yeah, right. That's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, there's there is an entire class of people who are not educated in this  because they've never had to be educated in this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and because our schools haven't trained people.  It's more than that.  And I actually this I'm stealing this from Michael Scott and Fire and Fury.  People don't care about politics at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This isn't just politics.  This is understanding things like vaccines are good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That scene is that scene is politics.  So yeah, you're right. It's more than politics.  But that's that's include that in the umbrella.  People don't care about the weighty issues of the day.  They care about what am I going to have for dinner?  How am I going to be able to get sick?  They care about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's fine. And that's lovely.  But you still have to have a class of people who make arguments  to set policies to get people the stuff they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what it's always been that way. Right.  There's always been an elite.  Yeah. Well, let the elite worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not even that elite.  I mean, it can be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. But that's what they call them.  The East Coast elites and all of that.  Happy birthday, Betty White.  She was born on this day in 1922.  She's 96 years old.  And I got that out of Reddit. So there she's older than the queen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's a queen.  Her reign is queen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Her reign is longer than the queen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Queen Betty Queen Betty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Big changes from Google, FI.  I'm curious what you think about this.  It's billed as Google, FI.  Data is now free, but it's not exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No one's no one's fully unlimited or fully free.  But you up to 60 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You max out at 60 bucks, which is which is well, 60 bucks plus the 20 bucks for  data, data, video.  You have to use. Yeah. Yeah.  So I this is great.  I'm a Google FI subscriber. I think you are as well. Right.  Yes. Yes.  What this means is that we will not pay more than 80 dollars a line  no matter how much data we use.  They are. They do say after after 15 gigabytes in a month,  they'll slow you down unless you want to.  Which is a lot.  Yeah, that's that's this is really puts them in line with the other carriers,  frankly, except that they're explicit.  Whereas the other carriers say unlimited.  Here's the other big change, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Used to be it was it was it was a minor point, but you used to pay in advance  and they would basically kind of refund you.  Yes. What you didn't spend now.  Now they're going to sensible ways.  You'll you'll pay for what you use as you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Giga time. Nice.  And you don't pay for anything you don't use.  So if you just used voice and zero zero gig, it would be twenty dollars a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's I use my phone for travel.  So there are months go by when all I pay is for the line. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They call it bill protection.  Which is probably an accurate way to put it after after  bill protection kicks in at six gigabytes.  After that data is free for the rest of your billing cycle.  And after 15 gigabytes, you'll be slowed down a little bit.  Unless and you can't apparently you can opt in to pay  continue to pay ten dollars a gigabyte and not be slowed down.  No, I guess what happens after 15, you can say, no, I'll pay for it now.  I don't know. You can.  Yeah, there's a yeah.  If you don't want to be slowed down, use a way not to do that.  Oh, there is. I didn't know that.  I don't know if this is ten dollars a gigabyte.  That's what they've always charged. Yeah, I know.  But that's that's ridiculous.  I think it's a good deal.  Yeah, it is.  Frankly, let me just look at my plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I keep debating going in fully switching over to five.  I'm on a Google phone anyway.  I'm stubborn about my AT&T grandfathered.  Unlimited account, just I want to stick it to him by keeping it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This will be rolling out Netflix running in the background all the time.  Just just to get you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This will be rolling out to five customers  nationwide over the next few days.  I got my email already. Did you? Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. So, Stacey, when I when I download a an audible book and it gives warning,  warning, you could be using data, I think.  Ha ha ha ha. You know nothing.  I do not care.  I know. I love those data.  I can ignore them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ten of them. Ten megs for a book.  Yes, I got my email to an important update to your Project Five plan,  introducing build protection,  data when you need it and savings when you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, they sound just like a carrier now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  That's all right. That's all right, Google.  That's good. I think this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. If you don't make money, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they do. They I mean, is FI even the profit center for Google?  I wonder. Oh, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can imagine why hasn't come and cut it.  They're reselling data.  I mean, that's why their their gigabyte costs are so high.  If Google had its druthers,  I'm sure it could figure out how to drop that in a heartbeat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, if you have multiple members on your plan, it's different.  So they have a little spreadsheet for you  showing for the number of people who use it, etc., etc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This was always the like my nightmare days when carriers would change their plans  because you had to like explain.  You start here and if you add more people, this happens.  And if you go over, it's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Google FI is still probably the simplest and, you know, it is.  Yeah. And I and I really like it.  I'm very happy with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does it work internationally?  Yeah, very well. Oh, yeah, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know where it doesn't work?  So they say we're working most countries.  I think it's one hundred and ninety countries.  I found one that doesn't work in because I was there.  Monaco. Really?  Yeah. But the good news is France is a mile away.  So take a walk, use the phone and then go to the airport.  And then come back to Monaco.  Monaco actually is less than a mile away.  There's nowhere you can go in Monaco that France is more than,  I think, a kilometer away.  All right. So it's OK.  I guess they decided not to do the deal with Monaco Telecom or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe they had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you have a Google Cast device, actually.  I had them all over the house, right?  Google Home, Google Chromecast, Audio, Google Audio Cast.  This was a first discovered by a Chinese, very popular  Chinese router manufacturer called TP Link.  But now others are saying, yeah, it happens to us, too.  It was it couldn't actually cause your Wi-Fi to drop out periodically.  And this was happening to me.  Oh, so what happens is these devices, these Google devices.  Google says they're fixing this tomorrow.  These Google devices, when they wake up from sleep,  they have a stay awake thing.  They start they dump data on the network or something,  and it overloads the Wi-Fi router and it goes and it dies for a while.  And then it comes back.  So I thought, well, I wonder if this is what's happening to me.  So I disconnected everything.  I have many, many Google Assistant Google.  Must have taken about an hour to find them.  Unplugged them all.  The Chromecast are hard to find because they're little and they're stuck.  Yeah. I think I know.  I got them all because I then used a Wi-Fi  manager to look and see if I could see any signals. Couldn't.  This only thing I said about is I had to unplug my Nvidia Shield TV  because it has a built in Chromecast.  Lo and behold, my data hasn't dropped in 48 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they're going to fix this.  Do they have to fix it tomorrow?  I hope they fix it through every one of those devices or through.  They'll have to go to all their devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They patch all their devices.  It's it's there.  I think they're using UDP, which.  Yes, they are one of the issues.  It has no congestion protection.  Yeah. So not a TCP fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you usually want UDP for streaming because UDP is more efficient  on streaming because there's no ACK.  But the lack of congestion protection is, I think what's going on here anyway.  I don't know what they'll do to fix it.  The first part, according to VentureBeat, the first part of the fix  is a patch to Google Play services that run on Android phones.  Huh?  And then it says it's unclear if an update for home devices  and other cast enabled hardware will be necessary.  Maybe the app, the Google Home app that you're running on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  Controls it, talks to the device and tells it to go to sleep.  This is something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is your beat, because this is a Stacey, because this is an IoT device

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  causing havoc in the home.  We talked about it on the show.  We explained what was happening.  We didn't have the data this morning when we recorded about when the patch  was coming up, but we did talk about why it was happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, I didn't know about this either.  So that's good. That's good news.  I hope that I hope it works.  I'm not going to plug my Google Homes in for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I didn't have this problem with my Google Homes, but, you know,  maybe it's also a function of the type of routers.  Yeah, you're using the Eero's. Are you using Eero's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eero's and Plume's both were effective.  Plume more so than anybody.  But the interesting thing is, some have said it also happens with Google Wi-Fi.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Their own router.  Yeah, Kevin said he didn't have an issue with the Google Wi-Fi, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's one of those issues you might not notice because it's a brief dropout.  Here's where you'll notice if you're streaming video, the video will stop  and then it'll pause. It won't rebuffer.  It'll pause because it's not getting anything and it'll come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we, I mean, who knows?  Let's see if you notice me go out during the middle of the show,  because then you'll be...  Yeah, well, that's a good point. That's never happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although we do have people we talk to who do that.  That does periodically happen. They just stop and then come back.  Huh. In certain situations...  I see on the chat there's a good point here.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you plug them all back in, they're all going to get patches.  There's going to be a flood of data.  Yeah, plug them in at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Late at night, like the middle of the night.  In certain situations, a bug, this is Google,  a bug in the Cast software on Android phones.  Oh, so they're saying it's the phones  may incorrectly send a large amount of network traffic,  which can slow down or temporarily impact Wi-Fi networks.  The specific impact the network will vary depending on the router.  People with an Android phone and a Chromecast built-in device,  such as a Chromecast or Google Home device,  on the same Wi-Fi network may experience this issue.  You know, I feel bad. I'm not going to say this,  but I feel bad I'm the only one in the family with an Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, you're going to send up your network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to turn off my phone.  I have a Note 8 running all the time and a NetPixel 2 XL.  Maybe if I turn this off...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to turn off your phone, your Facebook, your Twitter,  your TV, and you're going to be just so happy.  So centered.  Do you see the new thing that was in an article in the New York Times?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you really want to get over your phone addiction,  make your phone black and white.  And you know what?  It's true. It's horrible.  It's a nightmare.  So it's in display on the iPhone.  It's a little hard to do on an Android.  On the iPhone, it's in display accommodations.  These are the bright and brilliant colors  you would get normally on an iPhone.  But if you turn on color filters, you can choose grayscale.  And then...  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a communist iPhone.  It's a Stalinist iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It must be what they have in North Korea, yeah.  And I have to say, it's true.  Really, when you look at your photos, ugly.  When you look at Instagram or Facebook, ugly.  It's so depressing.  What's the point?  You can do it on an Android phone.  If you go into developer options,  you have to tweak around with the developer options.  But what you do realize is when you turn the black and white off,  how compelling these are.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a glowing screen.  You could just put it in front of a baby and watch.  Yes.  I mean...  It's like a mobile.  You're like, woo, and they're like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you have a mobile for your daughter when she was little?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think so.  I had whatever the babies are,  I told you to go get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the rage when Abby and Henry were little,  I don't think it helped, was black and white mobiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yes, that's right.  I forgot.  That's right.  Exactly.  Same with us.  They don't see them anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By contrast, because they wanted the color.  That's true.  Babies can't see color at first, I think.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So a baby would like the Stalinist iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, the baby just likes the iPhone.  Babies love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that true?  They gravitate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  If you stick a phone in front of a baby,  they're like six months, they know how to turn it on.  I mean, it's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what's terrible is candy crush in black and white.  It's horrible.  You can't play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why?  See, I think this is to make it so you don't waste time on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  Your phone still functions in every way.  You just don't enjoy it.  You just don't enjoy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm like, it's like fat free ice cream.  Halo top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google has created...  Google is having so much trouble filling IT jobs  that they've created a free certificate program on Coursera.  So if you don't have any IT experience  but you want to get an entry-level support job,  it might take you eight to 12 months,  you can take a free course on Coursera, the big mook.  The big mook.  And you can get an IT job.  Natalie Van Cleef Conley,  former head of Google's tech support program,  was having trouble finding IT support specialists  so she spearheaded this certificate program.  It's also part of Google doing its bit  to help Americans get skills in a changing economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So are these full-time jobs?  Are they going to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't guarantee you a job.  It's just you get the skills.  I guess you get a certificate.  They do point out though,  they don't require a college degree,  but the problem getting a job is you need experience.  So this will substitute in some cases for experience.  The median annual wage for a computer network support specialist,  Computer user support specialist, $52,160.  So they're good jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So do you think we'll ever get to the point  where you've trained too many people in computer science?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, because that's like saying  you've trained too many people to read.  Eventually, you're going to have to know all of this stuff  just to function in the world,  or you're going to have to have an understanding of this stuff  to function in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It certainly wouldn't hurt.  Have there been gluts before in professions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Lawyers, MBAs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Journalists.  There are too many journalists now.  Sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are still good jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, think about all the seamstresses out there.  Man, what are they doing?  Buggy whipmakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why I commissioned a study at my center at CUNY  in the job skills needed in the field  so that we can be training people for the right skills.  There's whole new job titles in journalism,  like product development.  Never existed.  Audience development. Never existed.  Commerce is now a growing skill.  So these are new things that we need to train people for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, commerce?  Journalists make terrible salespeople.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, it's not.  Actually, here's the interesting thing.  Well, it's a form of native content is what it is.  I know, I know, I know, I know.  But wire cutter.  That's a good example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They monetize in a nice way.  They do affiliate, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they do, but that's the commerce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's how you make the money.  You are making content that is...  Is there a business that needs to happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  or a relationship that happens with affiliate links?  Or do you just, I don't know how this works.  Both, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been learning this because we have the best people we have  into the room to figure this out.  And fascinating.  A few interesting things about this.  Well, you got me started.  Is that it is another revenue stream.  And the people who are doing this, like New York Magazine,  Gizmodo Media, Perch, there's a bunch of companies that are doing this  and doing this well.  They actually find it kind of freeing because they have to maintain the trust of the audience.  If Gizmodo tells you this is the best deal and it's not,  then you're not going to be able to do it.  You're not going to be able to do it.  You're not going to be able to do it.  If you say this is the best deal and it's not,  you're going to say screw you the next time.  So trust matters.  They also find themselves freed from having to go after every damned advertising RFP.  But you do have to create content that becomes a home for this.  One of the best selling things on Business Insider,  I love this.  At least in the beginning when they started this,  was wallets.  A place for your money.  And what they would do is  do, you know, 10 best wallets,  what's the best wallet, look at wallets,  and they'd put links on there to sell the wallets.  And then, you would, because you're the susceptible man.  I was suckered in by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  when they find ones really selling,  Leo's brought 10 of them,  then they call the manufacturer and say let's do a deal directly  and not do this through Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what's funny? You don't see wallet ads anymore.  You used to see them all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like  that suitcase that's advertised all the time  on TV now.  Oh, you know, you've seen it.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I literally don't have a TV.  Oh yeah, they used to be a sponsor here.  And then they decided, oh,  this is what happened, by the way, every one of our sponsors,  they get great success here.  And then they say,  now we can advertise in real media.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think we do a better job for them.  We do.  And we're more efficient for them. But everybody wants to be big time.  It's funny because I always used to complain about that  among new media people.  I was like, they're all trying to get on TV.  Like you made it.  If you could take that podcast and get on TV.  That's true.  And yeah, it's true for advertisers, it turns out.  Who knew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, the other lesson from this  is that  you'd like to get away from Amazon because  there's a cap on what the affiliate fees are and so on and so forth.  But the consumers love  buying through Amazon.  So just as we were stuck  with Google for  advertising and with  Facebook for audience,  we're going to be stuck with Amazon for commerce.  Affiliate. Okay.  Yep. But there's a revenue stream there.  Why don't you, wait a second,  Stacey's business.  So I remember way back when  there was a trio blog.  Remember the old trio, my favorite phone in the old days?  Yes.  And there was a guy who did a trio blog and he started to say, well,  here I'll sell cases and stuff. It became a major business  for a good amount of time where he sold both trios  and accessories.  So Stacey, for you, is there a business  in actually becoming an affiliate  e-commerce recommended site  for a wire cutter for IOT?  So there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But  I'm lazy.  Okay. So here's the challenge.  In a nutshell, my business  runs on  90% of my audience are not  that interested in my ads, but the 10%  of my audience that are are highly  valuable to my advertisers.  So that works out really well  for me. So that's where  I'm trying to stay.  And affiliate  ads takes up a lot of,  it takes time to get going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if you did a separate  sub-brand  that was Stacey's IOT picks?  And you could also buy them,  just like wire cutter.  But I trust you on IOT.  I know you've tested the hell out of them.  I know what your husband's complained about.  I know, right?  So if I wanted to buy IOT stuff,  I would come straight to you,  buy it through you.  Yeah, there's a conflict of interest, but you're going to be very clear about that.  You're going to maintain your trust in your brand,  and I trust you for that.  I'm telling you, there's an

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  opportunity for you. No, there is an opportunity.  It just means that I have to write.  Right now, we don't do a lot of written  reviews. So, and I, it's a huge...  What are the ethical considerations

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of affiliate links?  Well,  you'll promote the stuff that sells rather than the  the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you'll, and I, instead of  doing esoteric things,  you know, that nobody really cares about,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do. Yeah, because you're going to make more money on something that a hundred  people will buy than on something five people will buy.  So there's pressures,  but you know, all advertising has  potentially some pressures.  You just have to resist them and say,  no, I'm going to continue to do the editorial that I do.  And you do have to  disclose, don't you? I mean, there have been companies...  Pinterest got in a lot of trouble when people realized  that they were putting associate links on  Pinterest links.  Of course, it was other people's accounts.  I'm telling you, Stacey. I'm telling you.  I actually think it's a  really nice kind of monetization.  We've done it a little bit. Look at this, too.  Because it doesn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, you, Leo, for God's sakes, what am I doing? Look at, right, you should be selling  stuff. So we did a couple of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One, we suggested that people use  our link when they buy stuff on Amazon.  We just said, hey, if you just go  start doing Amazon shopping through this  link, then we'll get a percentage of everything  you buy. It's a painless way for  you to donate. No matter what they buy.  Right. And I don't know if we still do that.  And then I think  for... I can't remember, but I think sometimes  I have  personally on my blog, I don't know if Twitter's  done it. We've had affiliate links.  I don't... Well, maybe not on products that we...  In an article about a product.  The problem is most of our content is  audio and video, which has no links

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  at all. Well, but again, I'll say the same  thing to you I just said to Stacey. If there were a  Twitch shop brand, we're not  selling t-shirts, that's fine. That's de minimis.  No kidding.  You don't make any money on merch.  I see what you and Padre  and so on and so forth...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I always thought about that. We'd sell  like Leo's computer.  Yeah. I put... Kim Commando does this.  I put together the best computer  with everything I like and you can buy.  Yeah. Yeah.  Nothing I don't. Yeah, I don't want to do that.  Yeah, Kevin and I have talked about it.  I feel like that's a little skeezy, or at least  it appears to be. It's not skeezy, but it appears  to be skeezy. Because you wouldn't want to  skeezy away. It's kind of neat though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because Gizmodo, for example,  they show you all the  like 300,000  people have clicked on this link.  Which I actually think is really cool.  When they have their affiliate links.  But I'm also worried that like if I did it,  there'd be like four people have clicked  on this link. And I'd be like, woohoo!  And my audience would be like, why are we here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I could sell Stacey's house or Kevin's  house, but everything's so use case  specific, it doesn't seem like a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like our model. I like your model. I like  clearly identified  interstitial ads.  That people know this is an ad.  There's some hand curation  of the content and the people.  So that we don't advertise  stuff that's junk.  I mean really, there is that impression  when you...  If Stacey's advertising  or Leo's advertising is stuff they approve  of, they like. And it better be, because  I'll tell you what, people blame me.  If they buy a product  we advertise and they don't like it, they don't blame the company.  They blame me. It's like a friend said,  hey, you really ought to try this barber and you got a terrible haircut.  Who are you going to blame? The barber or the friend?  Well, you got a point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You do buy everything.  I found the best  Sprinkly eyelashes  through Leo. I bought those. I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got the Indiegogo email  that my LED eyelashes that you told me  to get. I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  very excited to see them on you. And when  you are tired of them, I will take them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't want used eyelashes.  Yeah, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could just send them to me  and I'll try them on. I might.  And I'll wear my lavender wig.  And then you can be like, rave  with Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. You're going to have glow sticks  and stuff? I could.  I want my Toots the Unicorn.  Where's my Toots the Unicorn?  What was Toots the Unicorn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't remember all the things you bought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am such a sucker.  Oh my God, I hate myself.  I am such a sucker for like  crowd sourced stuff.  This guy raised $8,299.  Oh, now his video is  even gone.  Oh, I don't think I'm going to get my Toots.  He took his video off YouTube.  So the idea was  it was a unicorn that farted  in rainbows.  And what?  Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have too much money.  That's what this says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The guy came to the studio  and I went, oh,  that's really great. He even brought a Toots.  I said, oh, Jamie,  that's so great. He's from Austin.  You ought to go knock on his door.  Where is Leo's Toots?  Where's my Toots?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not going to do that.  I feel like when you  buy these things, you know what  you're getting. Unless you bought it in the first six  months of Indiegogo Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I confess that  there is a little bit of comedy  in it. I admit.  Yeah.  I do it for the clicks.  I do it for the clicks.  Let's see.  I've received some of these things.  The fuse card I got,  but it only works with swipe machines,  even though the picture shows a  chip. So I didn't  set that up. I'm waiting for this scooter that was supposed  to come six months ago.  Waiting for Toots. I don't know how long ago I ordered Toots.  You remember Jibo came.  By the way, DOA,  the only time it ever worked was when I showed it  to you and it wouldn't stop talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't it say it burbles?  Yeah, it snores.  That's it. It snores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really burbling. When you're not using it, it makes  little sounds. So it's so annoying.  I wasn't really unhappy when it died.  That's really fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it died in a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you get your money back from Indiegogo?  I can't remember.  I mean, like, is there a guarantee?  I don't think so.  I'll send a note to Cynthia saying, hey, Cynthia.  See, what I'm afraid of is she'll send me  one that works.  Oh, I guess Siri decided to get  involved. No, no.  Oh, I was like, what's happening here?  Siri says, is there a guarantee?  I don't know why she heard me.  Anyway, enough of this. This is dumb.  Google is giving  away machine learning.  You don't even have to know anything about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is why I wonder how many programmers we need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. This is  Google wants businesses to use its AI  to see photos better.  It's a new service they unveiled  today for businesses to build apps that can  automatically recognize images.  The new Cloud Auto ML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is basically to sell their cloud,  isn't it? Is to add more value,  more value added to their cloud versus  Amazon's? Yeah, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that the idea? Except they're giving  it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it,  they're asking you to put pictures in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's, oh,  it's a profit deal. Well, companies,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  companies pictures. Well, companies pictures.  No, it could just be a training deal.  Just to get what they need. That's what I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  call profit. Sorry.  Google, that's profit.  Google, to their credit, has a long  term view of profit. They do.  Cloud, let me see if we can  find out more about the, I remember  seeing that it doesn't require  programming. Cloud ML.  Google. Google Cloud.  Cloud. Google.com  slash auto  ML, AUTL.  A suite of machine learning products that enables developers  with limited, oh, you still need to be a programmer,  but you don't, you don't have to have  experience. You could be a dumb programmer.  You could be a bad programmer.  And then you easily  train custom vision models.  That's a good question, Stacy.  Where does it, yeah, state of the art  performance. Get up, Brenny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder. So this is solving  a really big problem, but it also  raises a really interesting question about  machine learning platforms. So there's  always this idea, there's this Holy  Grail, Facebook built one internally,  of creating a more generic  machine learning platform that anyone can use,  right? Yeah. Because right now you have  to be very well trained to understand  like, oh, it's spinning this  back with this probability. That means I need  to tweak this particular, you  know, photo or this particular point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I came up with an idea for an app that  tells you whether something's a hot dog  or not a hot dog.  Ah.  Now I'm the machine language  programmer. In fact, well, see,  and this is, part of this is because people have domains,  right? So I may be a great UI  programmer or app programmer, but I don't think  about machine language training.  I would then use this to help me  develop the model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, because you're going  to have to upload and label your  images according to this.  Start with as little as a few dozen photographic

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  samples and cloud auto-enable them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's doing the hard thing, which is training the neural net.  That's actually what you have like  data scientists do. This is a data  scientist in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can we expect more hot dog or not  apps because of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is this, is this, this is basically like using  Google's cloud to do natural language  processing. Now this is just natural image

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  processing. Right. So here's the example  that you can. Well, here you have to label

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it. Yeah, so you're going to get. Do you have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  label it? You have to label it.  No, so the hard job is  actually when you're  trying to build an algorithm.  Oh, I see, right. Knowing how much to  weight, how to weight certain  characteristics. So like  when I look at a human's face,  is it eyes that matter to determine  that someone's a human or is it like  the distance between eyes and  the mouth? So like you  have to, that's the hard part is tweaking  those algorithms and that's done by  people.  Does that make sense? Yeah. You have to  kind of know a lot about how this works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, but that's the point is that a lot of  companies have  expertise in various domains  and their programmers may be quite expert  but they wouldn't know how to do this.  They're not statisticians.  They're not statisticians, yeah. So yeah.  It says you can try it free but I see there's right next to the  try it free button a contact sales button.  So I'm  guessing it's free-ish  or freemium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And yeah, a lot of  companies have like really cool data.  Like imagine, actually  a good IOT example.  Imagine your house, right?  So I've got, I've trained my,  was it my canary?  I trained it on recognizing the people in  my house, right? Now they, they  can, canary can take that, run that  through Google's ML to  give better image recognition.  Like true biometric quality  image recognition for example.  That would be an interesting use case.  Another could be, you know,  photos of machines or  failures in a plant. If you  offer those failures  up, you don't actually have to know how to figure out  how to make a model. You just say  this failure is because of bad soldering.  This failure is because of, I don't know.  You know what this won't work for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gorillas, chimpanzees  and apes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's still, I can't believe they haven't gotten back  to that. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well they have but they've cut it off because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they just. They did it in a weird way. So a few  years ago a Google employee  pointed out that when you search  for, do an image search  or no, I'm sorry, Google  photos had labeled  his photos with a black friend  as gorillas.  Google said we're appalled, we're  genuinely sorry.  And the fix was  not to fix the  recognition, but to  eliminate the word gorilla,  ape, chimp,  chimpanzee and monkey  from Google lens searches.  Wired  tested Google photos using a collection of  40,000 images well stocked  with animals that performed impressively at finding  many creatures including pandas and poodles.  But according to Wired,  no results for gorilla, chimp,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  chimpanzee or monkey. This is not a technical matter.  This is somebody in PR who said never  let this happen again. This is embarrassing.  This is bad. It's not a good  fix though. It ain't happening again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I wish I had some. I do have one picture of a gorilla  in my, actually  in my photos, but I can't find it.  I do have a picture of an  actual gorilla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you wouldn't be able to find it.  I know. It says no results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The president would be very disappointed not being able to find the gorilla channel.  That was a ruse,  but I loved it. That was hilarious. It was a great  ruse. It was a very well done ruse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was it the onion? Who did that? I forget who.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no. It was just some guy who had  to change his name on his Twitter  account to the gorilla thing as a  joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He tweeted an excerpt. That's what it was.  He tweeted an excerpt from  Fire and Fury that was fake.  That said  that Donald Trump kept looking  for a channel featuring gorillas.  Like he had at home.  Yeah.  And aides  were so, so here's the  excerpt. On his first night in the White House, President Trump  complained the TV in his bedroom was broken  because it didn't have the gorilla channel.  Trump seemed to be under the impression that a TV channel  existed that screened nothing but gorilla  based content 24 hours a day.  To appease Trump,  White House staff compiled a number of gorilla  documentaries into a makeshift gorilla  channel. I was okay to this point, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Up to this point. The next thing is what made you  say okay. Broadcast,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah, this is the part where it's  April Fools. Broadcast into Trump's bedroom  from a hastily constructed  transmission tower on a soth lawn.  I think there are better ways to do that  in the White House. Yeah.  However, the president was unhappy  with the channel they had created moaning it was boring  because the gorillas aren't fighting.  So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so, anyway, it's like, it's  a ruse. It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  beautifully done ruse. Yeah. And he got people.  It did. And it gets worse, by the  way. I won't read on. It just,  you can Google it. So by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, did you spit  the cookie come out through your nose when you saw this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although you're much more attractive than that.  I'm like, it's not the most  choice. Yeah, it's not the most flattering.  But it is actually, actually accurate.  It's 59% accurate. I do

Transcript:  have a long nose. This this  chick is probably cuter than I am. So  I'll take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem with this is I think it does make people  like notice  like made me feel  old, made you feel like you had a long nose. You don't have a long nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do have a long nose. I'm okay with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you know what? Okay, this is  what teenagers do.  Teenagers, if you look  at your nose,  if you just start looking at your nose,  everybody's nose is terrible.  Noses are terrible.  I'm okay with my nose.  But you shouldn't look at it out of context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And every teenager does this.  I want a nose job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All noses are hideous.  They're a hideous protuberance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  nose. No, noses  are bad. There's no good noses.  Noses look bad.  You got to tell every teenager this. This is important.  We don't want nose shaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wasn't shaming my nose.  Yes, you were. You've internalized  this. I've internalized this.  When I came back from college for my first  trip home, my mom looked at me and she goes,  oh, I'm so glad you finally grew a deer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  nose. And I was like,  wait, god.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I had a big nose. I had no idea.  She's like, no, it's perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you seen Lady Bird? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, not yet. Can't wait. Oh, you got to go see Lady Bird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The clips I've seen ring  so true. They are.  For the mother daughter thing.  They're screaming at each other. I think  this looks good on you.  Oh, really? You think this would look good on me? It's hysterical.  I can't wait to see it.  I do want to see it.  So I found somebody who has a nice nose.  Amin Ra in our chat room says,  I have no problems with my nose. I actually get  compliments on it.  See? I think you're in denial,  Amin Ra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't have a problem with my nose.  No, your nose is fabulous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually had a girlfriend  who really actually had a hideous nose.  Well, I'm really  sad.  It does happen.  It was like a shark's fin.  It was a thin  and it was a blade.  It was like scary looking.  And it had a big hook in it.  But it was just,  it's a nose. Look, it's a proboscis.  Like you've seen the gorillas with the ugly  proboscis. That's all it is.  Isn't it proboscis?  Oh, I'm sorry. Proboscis.  Proboscis is something else.  It's a proboscis. Thank you for correcting me.  My whole life I've been saying proboscis.  No, no, you're right.  It's proboscis.  And there is a proboscis  butterfly.  Do you want to see the...  No, that's a different kind of proboscis.  How about the proboscis gorilla?  Will Google give me the...  Google won't find that.  This is what everybody thinks  their nose looks like.  Everybody thinks  their nose looks like that.  And they're not far wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The president's hair looks like that.  Stop it. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stop it.  No ad hominem comments.  Google, according to Cory Doctorow,  and people who have tested it,  has started to  ignore old pages.  Tim Bray, who's a great pioneer  of XML and early blogger,  and I've followed him since the beginning,  was searching for posts he had  posted in 2006  and 2008.  He knew  exactly what the articles were,  and he couldn't find  them.  That is disturbing. Yeah, direct quotes.  But it makes sense.  This is Tim's...  I should actually refer to, instead of  Cory's article, I'm boing-boing,  Tim's actual article.  Back in 2006, I published a review of Lou Reed's  Rock and Roll Animal album.  Brendan Simmons,  in 2008,  published a review of The Clash's  London Calling.  He said, here's a challenge. Can you find  either of these with Google?  2006 and 2008, it's not that long ago.  That's forever ago.  Like our shows are that old.  Here's the interesting thing. Bing  can find it. Duck, duck, go.  Can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But...  The all-knowing Google can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does stuff fall off the edge?  Well,  it's possible. And why not?  Does anybody really  want to read Brent Simmons'  review of The Clash's London Calling from 2008?  Well, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was trying to find my old  TV guide reviews of Oprah, and I couldn't.  Pissed me off. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So here's what we do, you see.  Here's the article  from Inessential.com. It is still on the internet,  very publicly. I'm going to  copy and put in quotes the  first sentence. And it's a fairly long sentence.  So that should really narrow it down.  Let's see. Can we find it?  Yes.  Maybe  if I go in incognito mode.  Maybe because I visited that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  site. I was going to say, once they linked  to it in the site, I think that was probably  a new indicator.  I'm trying to remember some old  stories that I wrote that hit the web  and bore this part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, so maybe, so what that  does, so I'm doing it in incognito mode and I'm still  finding it. So  do you have, that's what you need.  Jeff, do you remember?  I'm trying to go back and see the early blog.  I found the Shuglu Guru  right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a different archive made.  That wasn't the original.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ah. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see. Yeah. If you search  for Shuglu Guru,  yeah.  All right. Let me get out of this incognito tab  because it's no good to me. I want  to be in the filter bubble. I want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So my giga ohm stuff is  still archived and that's all the way back  to 2008.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give me a line, I'll put it in  quotes, you know, eight or  nine words would be enough  from one of your articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From 2008? Or do you want me to go  for that? As far back as you can go.  Well, that's what I'm trying. The problem is  my 2005  through 2008, I feel like that publication  is dead.  You're right. It might not be on the web.  No, you're right. It might not be on the web.  So, oh, this one's still on the web. Okay.  So then I just need to find an article.  Just give me a quote. Oh, oh, yeah.  That's hard, Leo.  Give me a quote, man.  Let me look for something and then  see if I can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's an article. All right. Patrick  Delahanty has an article  from 2005  from the Twit website.  And  Kevin Rose wrote it.  System release party.  And he Googled it and he found it.  So, yeah, now  we've dragged this along from  website to website  because, of course, where websites have been redesigned  at least twice since this article

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  was written. Well, Google may not think it's old then.  Ah.  Because it got re-  Okay. Well,  something to be aware of. So here's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  one. It's always hard  to test Google. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I have a 2002  post from my blog. Okay. Okay. Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me- And it's still online, but I  have never searched for it. And I'm going to  an incognito window.  Go ahead. Give me five words, ten- six  words from it. Okay. Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The web, lowercase T,  the web uppercase W comma  like an old girlfriend is just no fun  anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You thought that in 2000 when?  Two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  So I found it on my blog.  Google ain't finding it.  Nope, there it is. There it is. Cool as  dead. I found it right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With just five- six words.  Not a bad line. The web like an old

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  girlfriend. No, that is a really  crappy line. Well, it was an old  line. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry. You're right. You're right. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, I think you want to be on that media  man list. You're going to get on that spreadsheet.  You better be careful. That was that.  Okay. Nevermind. Can we erase this part?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I actually know I was quoting the New York Times.  I was quoting the New York Times.  Like an old boyfriend is no fun anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm like, ehh.  You can write that. The New York Times is saying that.  The New York Times is saying that.  Oh, he is. He's quoting.  He's quoting the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you welcome it.  Apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the web became too cool, too cute, too soon.  Do you go back-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, here we have a fifteen-year-old article.  You go back- I mean, you haven't read this in ages and look at it and go  yeah, that was pretty good.  Oh, I also look at things and say, that can't be me.  It can't be. I think I would say  I'm- you know, damn, I'm a good writer.  Except what's this- how does- how come it begins with a colon?  I did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a weird thing that I just did at the time.  That was my kind of- That's how you began.  Jay Rosen used to get enraged because it made no sense.  But I used colons to break up sections.  Just for the hell of it. Just to be different.  Just to be obnoxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I used to use weird typography, too.  Remember when we made the last name  capital letters on the twit lower thirds?  Is Jeff's lowercase?  Nope.  On some shows,  we've reverted to normal capitalization  for some reason. I don't even know why  I did that, but it's the same reason you put colons  in there. It's just like, jazz it up.  440 episodes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what we're-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a perfect A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, GigaOM took dates off of all of our stuff.  So now I'm not sure what it is.  That way.  It never ages.  Oh, this is aged, let me tell you.  Oh, but they'll charge you $300 for it.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unbelievable. Who owns it?  Brian...  Some guy.  Some guy?  You know what? This is called long-tail monetization.  It's a whole new thing.  He took a seminar.  How to monetize the old web.  Google bought Zagat  in 2011  for $151 million.  Never liked what Google did with it,  which is basically bury it.  I loved Zagat guides.  People who live in New York knew about Zagat  early on, right Jeff?  That was where they started.  How do you say it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Zagat, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Zagat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was a problem. Nobody could pronounce it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was like, oh man, now I've been pronouncing  that wrong my whole life too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was one of Marissa Meyer's last Google acts.  To buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For a huge amount of money.  $151 million. I'm glad the Zagats  are people, right?  I'm glad the Zagats  are the Zagats. I think it's Zagat.  You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here, hold up.  How do you pronounce  Zagat?  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's ask YouTube.  How do you pronounce Zagat?  Oh, Zagat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zagat.  So if you trust Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do.  They bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They should know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was from 2010, a year before they bought it.  Anyway, they want to sell it now.  I'm sad.  They basically killed it, right?  Kind of.  These were those red books.  They were red guides.  The thing that was great, this was pre-internet really,  is that  all the reviews came from people.  So if you went to a restaurant, you'd write a  Zagat. How did they even get these Zagat  reviews? I don't know. You'd mail it to them?  You'd write a review, and then  you'd go to a restaurant page  and it would have little snippets and would  give it a rating.  What was it from?  Lisa and I used to do this, I think from 1 to  Because a really good restaurant  is like a 27, a 28, 29.  And Lisa and I, we would do this  all the time. We'd go to restaurants and she'd go, I think it's a 23.  And I'd say, what? This is easily  a 25. We'd actually do that.  Which I loved. And I trusted  Zagat. One of the things you learned about Zagat  is that it was very much  conditioned by the people in  the city. So Indianapolis' best  restaurant wasn't comparable to  San Francisco's best restaurant, even though they both  get a 28, because people in Indy  liked that restaurant. So you just  would say, well, I'm getting the locals  take on it. It was like a great Calvin Trillin

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  piece. He said that when they tried to impress him,  and Calvin Trillin, the New Yorker, loved things  like hot dogs. Right.  When you go to Cleveland, people would have to try to  impress him with the fanciest restaurant  in Cleveland. He said they always served, and this is  a quote, stuffed heavy with heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, I'll never forget  going to the best restaurant in Greenville,  South Carolina. It included  hush puppies with every course.  I kid you not. Hey, hush puppies are delicious.  They're delicious, but they're not good for you.  And it had with every course.  In fact, I've had a lot of fun with that.  We went to Detroit,  actually Dearborn, to visit  the Ford folks, and they took us to the  best hamburger restaurant in Dearborn.  And was it good? No.  I'd say it's a 12.  Oh, that's terrible.  But anyway,  this is an example of how  I feel like the internet bros  ruined Zagat.  And they did because they had stuff  like Yelp and Google reviews  that they thought were better, and they  are patently worse.  I hate Yelp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One, you have to use the app.  Two, everybody on it are so  freaking spoiled.  Woof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we had  this perfect system,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  dead trees, admittedly,  but you would go to a city,  you'd get the Zagat guide, and you would  and you could trust it. I literally  went through the top 10 restaurants in San  Francisco according to Zagat.  It was great.  And it's true. Restaurant 9  was a little bit worse than Restaurant 1.  I mean, it was accurate.  So now you pronounce  Zagat Yelp.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you, Cobra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I stole his joke.  So Google is going to sell Zagat.  I don't know for how much. I guarantee you  it's not $151 million.  Zagat was founded in 1979,  but Tim and Nina Zagat.  Wait, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  aren't those the reviews as part of Google?  Aren't they part of Google reviews  when you look at a place?  Yeah, but they didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  adopt the system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you don't get the numbering system.  They've mushed it in  without undifferentiating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People like us told them, don't go in the content business.  And then they own this content thing.  They didn't know what to do with it because they weren't in the content business.  It really is frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hate it when companies ruin something  that's perfectly good.  And that's kind of the Internet's  brand, isn't it?  You know what?  It's like an old girlfriend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thanks, Leo.  Thanks a lot, Leo.  Thanks a lot.  I was quoting the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's changing how you make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When do we get that thing with the  fist in your head? What is it happening?  You don't get one, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Only she gets one.  Padre was supposed to do this, but it hasn't happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a dual  punching thing.  I don't get punches from both sides.  You could give me a concussion.  Although that would be pretty funny  if you both at the same time  hit the button.  Boom!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stunned the host.  The great thing is there will be a slight lag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'll get stunned for no apparent reason.  YouTube is...  I got my email  from YouTube.  The YouTube Partner Program, they are changing  the requirements for monetization.  I won't be able to monetize  my Leo Laporte channel. Not that I ever  did or wanted to.  But I imagine a lot of smaller  people are going to be upset.  I can't monetize my channel

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  with all three subscribers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you want to monetize it, these are the  requirements. You have to have 4,000 hours  of viewing time in the last 12 months and  1,000 subscribers.  That's not a high bar, but  it's higher than a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's higher than what I've got.  It's because they're now going to have a premium  ad opportunity  where they're going to review content  better. And so I think it's not  worth their while to review  dregs. But my daughter was saying  on her YouTube VidCon world  there's some  fear about this. Some people may have a lot of views  but they don't have subscribers so they're going on Twitter  begging people to subscribe.  This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's response to those weird child  videos. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  So subscriber is a good signal  they think. A thousand  is not a lot. No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But my  youtube.com  slash  yielded the board. But that was always just  that was like a personal place where I stuck old  videos and stuff. I never monetized.  Yeah. I don't need to monetize it.  Let's see how close I am.  Wait a minute. I have 3,762  subscribers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I just don't have very many views.  I need more views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You need 4,000  hours.  But see, I don't put anything on here.  The last thing I put on here was six months ago.  The Galapagos  videos from  but this is where I would like put like the 360  degree videos I post I made and stuff like  that.  I think there's a video of me in  the hot tub. Here's a video.  You don't remember this Stacey. Please no.  I was bald at one time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why? What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  Nobody ever understood what happened.  No, I shaved my head for charity.  I see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the worst look ever.  It's not an attractive look. I'm not going to lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I look like Curly and the Three Stooges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's okay.  You know what? I have done some crazy stuff  with my hair.  So I'm not going to judge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't ever shave your head.  You'd look like Sinead O'Connor.  You'd look fine.  Do you have any more tattoos?  No, just the one.  Do you have tattoos?  I used to have a tongue ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A tongue ring?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you talk with that?  How hard is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A loop? A stud?  No, it was just a stud.  It's very dangerous.  I survived.  My daughter got one when she was too young to know better.  I was kind of upset.  But she didn't have any infection and she's removed it.  And her tongue has grown back.  Your tongue grows back, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it totally grows back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's the risk it'll split is one problem.  And you don't want to split tongue.  Forged tongue.  You do not want to forge tongue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There goes my podcasting days right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Especially with your name.  That's a hidden bottom.  That's a hidden bottom on IoT.  It doesn't work.  That's a hidden bottom.  A challenge.  I could say Leo Laporte.  But I can't take days to hear about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is one of the highest moments in our 440 shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, what about Google's parental consent effort?  Leo Laporte's tongue stud simulator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't know about that?  Okay.  What is it?  The update on Chrome Supervised users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, like anything.  Let's talk about old girlfriends again.  Google updating  parental control features.  Just because I saw this as a parent  who feels that Google is lacking  in their parental control division.  I'm like, what are they doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're taking it out without replacing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what they're doing.  Why would they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, people were really upset  when they initially,  not when they initially, but they had updated  some of their user stuff probably a couple months ago.  And it basically,  when your kid was 13,  they were kicked off of it.  Oh.  So there was nothing like,  it was basically like following the DCM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, DMCA, yeah.  COPPA actually.  Oh, COPPA, yeah.  Do you say COPPA?  I say COPPA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I go, COPPA.  COPPA cabana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you saying with a ring  in your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not going back there.  So do you use this for your daughter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've looked at using it.  Right now we don't because  we just have SafeSearch on everything  and that seems to be fine.  She's not adventurously browsing for things.  We've had lots of conversations about how  there are things  that you can't unsee.  And so far that's what...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They burn themselves into your brain.  Right.  And trust me, you do not want them there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's pretty... both conflict and  she does not want to see.  She knows she doesn't want to see things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So she's like, I don't want to see that.  One thing you'd ever want to see is a bald Leo.  For instance.  That's true.  Cautionary tale.  You will never get that out of your brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, this is the family link.  So the email sends people to the  family link parent control solution,  which is the sucky one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're not getting rid of...  They have another solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So this is the family link, which I looked at  and I thought it was kind of lame.  So this is  for Android phones and it lets  you manage your apps, set your  screen time limits and stuff like that.  And it's designed  for kids, but once the kid turns 13,  it's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's kind of an abrupt  evacuation.  That's kind of...  The kid does a search for,  I don't know, bald Leo and gets this  and then is scarred for life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. They might turn into a serial  killer. You never know.  So  yeah, I'm not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you censor that?  Did you not show that picture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now tell me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if that nose  looks normal to you.  See, one of the reasons we have hair  is to distract  people from the nose. I'm saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This, by the way, was when they cleaned up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the situation. Yeah, because you were there  for the initial shaving.  Was that like Christmas Eve or something?  New Year's Eve. We had a big party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I never want to do a New Year's Eve show with y'all.  That's the moral of this lesson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We shaved Jeff's beard poorly  and shaved my dome poorly.  And then I went to a barber, thank God, and she  cleaned it up. Look at that with a straight  razor.  It was actually...  Well, no, it was awesome. She wrapped  my head in hot towels.  And it was very old  fashioned. And she did a bowl  with a brush and lathered it up  and it was fun. And then  when they shave your head with a straight razor, there's a  kkkkkk.  Yeah, it's just...  Alright, you can...  Yeah, thank you. You can pull that down.  No, nobody... You're singing the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sweeney Todd song the whole time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's a blurry  but effective image of me shaving  Jeff. He did  not enjoy that.  By the way,  thank you, Google. I searched for Barber  in my Google Photos.  And you found that? And I found  these.  Poor Jeff. You are  so understanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you were more...  You got talked into more and more  and more. The tattoo being the...  Lisa was not happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much did we raise for you, Unicef?  $80,000, something like that. Thanks to all of you.  And by the way,  it's probably the first and last time you'll be shaved  by a barber in a tuxedo.  Yes.  Just saying. Are you ever going to do the show again?  I really would like to,  but I think it's just... I think I might die  if I did.  Stacey Leo stayed up for 24 hours.  It was 24 hours. So the idea...  The horror.  The horror. The idea was  that...  I had this brainstorm  because one night, one New Year's Eve,  we were watching, you know, the Clarks  rocking New Year's Eve.  He was still alive.  And we were watching it. It's in New York City, but we're on the  West Coast. And at  9 p.m., the ball drops.  And it's over.  And it's like, no, but  we got three more hours until New Year's Eve.  But no, it's over. New Year's Eve in New York, it's over.  So I thought... But that's all that matters.  Yeah. What we should do, and as an  international broadcaster,  is start celebrating when it's  the New Year in Samoa  and go all the way through until the New Year in Hawaii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we did. You did 24 hours on the air?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We did everything we could. We did  every hour. A ball drop and a champagne  pop and balloon drop.  We had a... We had...  We did it twice. We had  John rigged the ceiling  so I could drop the balloons. And then  after the balloons dropped, because we had to do another one an hour,  we would go...  And we pulled them back up to the ceiling.  The first time  they went en masse, and it didn't really work. So the next year  we had... He made hundreds  of individual fishing line  suspended balloons.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We pulled back up to the roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. I forgot about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was so much fun. I really enjoyed doing it.  It was great fun. It was huge fun. I still think it's a brilliant idea.  And maybe the way to do this... And we did it for charity,  which is great. We raised a lot of money. But I think  the way to do this in the future was to get...  To get all the podcasters together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You should get hosts to do like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  six hour shift. Yeah. We're in an hour.  Everybody does an hour in their region.  We did get Skype calls. We tried to get Skype calls  from every region. We got them from many regions.  But there are some places that are uninhabited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who's watching the ball drop there?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the fun was like Sydney,  which is way before we have it in the US.  They have fireworks. It's wonderful.  It's really wonderful.  We had that strange dinner.  Oh, was that that year?  Yeah, that was that year. I think it was.  That was our Christmas. That was terrible.  That was your Christmas. That's right. That was your Christmas.  Please don't remind me.  I feel so bad about that, Jeff.  It was funny.  We flew out all the hosts.  This will never happen again.  And we thought, well, they came to Petaluma.  We should go to a classic Petaluma place.  In Austin, if you were going to take them to  the quintessential Austin place,  what would it be? The Salt Lake or somewhere?  Probably like the Salt Lake.  So I didn't know this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but we took them to the Washu house,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which was an old road house,  a 150 year old road house  that used to have good food.  I don't know if you've ever been to the Salt Lake.  That used to have good food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was fried, fried with fried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was worse than that.  They had vegetables, but they were just god awful.  Oh, it was just terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was so fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it became a shtick, of course.  But I still feel very guilty about it.  No, you shouldn't. No, no, it was great.  Facebook has created something called  Watch Party to watch videos  with your friends.  Is this what you're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, that's just part of it.  That's part of them trying to make  video less a solitary,  depressing situation.  I think that's kind of a fun idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it is too.  Tell me how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, well, I don't know how this works.  I think watching videos with your friends remotely is a good idea.  Really?  I used to call friends up and we would  cue up a movie together,  and we would just sit on the phone and watch a movie together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And how did that feel?  Did that feel good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because like  Mystery Science Theater 3000.  Yeah.  Or you could just be, I mean, it's like the idea of being in a theater.  When something scary happens, you can hear the person go  Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  You know what you do?  You watch Get Out with people who haven't seen it before.  Have you seen it?  I have.  Oh, shoot. I was going to suggest we do this on the air.  No.  Let's all start watching Get Out, because that's one of those movies where you go  What?  What?  Twitter stock at two year high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't know what that even  That's the right reaction.  What is the impact?  High flying Twitter stock.  What's it doing differently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What did I hit on my skate?  One word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Trump.  That's all.  Seriously.  When you have the leader of the free world  free associating on your service  at all hours of the day and night  Why wouldn't your stock go through the roof?  I mean, that's  like having  a fly on the wall in the oval office.  Bitcoin having a little bit of a trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A little tumble.  I think I'm finally in the negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A suicide prevention hotline according to  Motherboard was the top post in the cryptocurrency  subreddit yesterday.  It's that bad?  That's just been  funny.  CoinMarketCap.com  Bitcoin is 11,000.  For those of us that can't get into our Bitcoin wallet  it's kind of like  not bad news.  Just watching the world go by.  Just watching it go up.

Transcript:  Did you read the New York Times article on  what was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everyone's getting hilariously rich  except you.  Nellie strikes again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is her real name  Nellie Bowles?  Or is that a pseudonym?  Because there's a very  famous Nellie Bowles.  Everyone is getting hilarious  really rich and you're not.  It's the story of the Bitcoin bros.  The guys who are making fortunes  because they had the intelligence  or good luck to buy Bitcoin really  cheaply and a lot of it  a few years ago  the wealth  she writes is intoxicating news.  Feverish because it seems so random.  And she visits  the, this, the  what is it called? The Crypto Castle?  Where these  Bitcoin bros live.  The Crypto Castle's king is  Jeremy Gardner 25, a rakish young investor  with a hedge fund who has become the  de facto tour guide for crypto  newcomers.  Early one afternoon he opened a bottle  of, this could have been on Twitter, he opened a bottle  of rose while he charged half a dozen external  batteries so he wouldn't have to  ever plug in his phone in Ibiza  the next week.  I do ICOs, it's my thing, he said.  He wore a pink button  front and pink pants. It's me.  He wore a pink button front and pink pants.  It's me, a couple VCs and a lot of  charlatans.  This, look at the refrigerator with all the  stickers. Where's the twit sticker on  here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You might not be popular with Bitcoin bros.  I might not be. About eight

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  people live in the Crypto Castle on any given  night. Some of Mr. Gardner's  tenants brought out snacks, Cheez-Its and a jar  of Nutella. Ooh.  Gross. They're into the Cheez-It Nutella thing.  Ooh.  One of the bedrooms has a stripper pole.  But I bet there's no women in there.  Mr. Gardner leaned back into the sofa  and rested his feet on the table. He recently did  an ICO for a start-up after party.  You can ICO anything,  he said. Actually, he probably talks like this.  You can ICO anything.  He runs a distributed  100 page magazine about  cryptocurrency that comes out once a year.  That's not a magazine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  now raising $75  million for his hedge  fund. Awesome Ventures  spelled A-U-S-U-M.  Awesome  Ventures.  He said his closest friends are  moving to Puerto Rico to get around paying  taxes. They're going to build a  modern-day Atlantis out there, he said.  But for me, it's too early in my  career to check out. Remember, he's 25.  I hate this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is why people hate Silicon Valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But  this is another  place, the Crypto Crack House,  where they've named the hallways  things like  Coin Ye West  and Bitcoin  Boulevard and Ethereum  Alley.  Oh, I can't  wait for this bubble to pop. I cannot  wait for this bubble to pop.  This is, by the way, do you know Nellie?  Because she deserves a Pulitzer for this.  This is good. She does

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  good work. She also wrote, though,  that New York Times article  on sexism in the Valley that  normalized sexism.  It's OK because everybody's doing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  more like it  was the MRA  people at different... She interviewed  men's rights activists at different  companies, and it was the quotes  about, like, you don't see women as  the CEO of car companies. Why would they  expect them to be a CEO of tech

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  companies? Well, she's just quoting these  offices. I hope it was... I know, but the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  controversy was why would you  put an article like that without  any

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  alternative? It's not as bad as  talking about a neo-Nazi's  favorite food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think Nellie also did  the raw water thing.  Last week's pop culture hit. You know, we've got to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  get her in here. She's in San  Francisco. She's got to be a pseudonym  or else her parents have a real  good sense of humor.  Nellie Bowles was  the woman who  tried to beat Phineas Fogg's  record for going around the world, right?  Was she British?  Yeah. Unfortunately,  the new Nellie is so  famous  that there's no  nothing  of the old Nellie.  But she was a famous...  Maybe I'm making... Am I mistaken?  Am I getting the name wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, you're right. I don't know any

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of this. Yeah, because you don't  you're too young to remember the Nellie Bowles  who went around the world.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Meanwhile, my favorite headline of the week.  Oh, she worked at Recode. Yeah.

Transcript:  To Swaziland. Swaziland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's probably where she learned  her trenchant prose.  Sally Bowles was the...  was in Cabaret. That's a different Bowles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. Sally Bowles.  Maybe that's what I'm thinking of. No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a... I know. I know there's Nellie Bowles.  Maybe it's not Nellie Bowles. Maybe it's something...  Nellie something else.  Nellie Bly.  That's who I'm confusing it with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Google. Sally Bowles and Nellie Bly.  Sally Bowles, Nellie Bly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  makes Nellie Bowles.  All right. Let's wrap it up with  our picks of the week. And then I hope  you, Stacey, have prepared something  fabulous.  Fabulous for us. And for dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So  I have a question. I can  take you on the road with me to show  it to you in person. Or I posted  it on Instagram. Take us on  the road. Take us on the road.  Okay. So, Karsten, are we...  That means I'm going to switch from the nice  camera and the nice mic to  my headphone mic and  other things. How do you feel about that? We have no idea how this is going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  But let's see it. Can we see your  wig collection while you're there?  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay. Why don't you guys  go first? And that way I can tell my family  members to get out of the way if they don't want to be on camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. Aren't you thoughtful? I just forced  my family members to be on camera. I didn't  ever tell them to get out of the way.  I said, you're on.  Let's  start. I don't know if I have  anything this week. I'm thinking now.  Thinking about... I had things.  I could show you how to make an  Android phone black and white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you did show us that. And you showed  us about...  I just warned them. They're fine.  Okay. Did you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  turn off your mic and go, Hey!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm coming down the hall!  Out of the way!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No. I just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can now see the rest of Stacy's room.  We've never seen this before.  Oh, this looks really nice.  It's not the sterile

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  room that I... You see the boring half.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the part that I look at.  That's so nice.  Oh,  we're also testing my Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I like that painting.  That's a pretty painting. A sunny  sunflower painting.  I need my phone. Sorry, you guys.  How are you even doing this?  I'm walking down the hall with  my laptop. This is magical.  It's amazing. What has  God wrought? Wait a minute. You're back in the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had to get my phone to  control the device. I'm sorry.  I'm so confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was getting lost. Yes. I need breadcrumbs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're getting lost in Stacy's  house. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She has two of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  sunflowers. Yeah. Yeah, I love those.  Yeah. You probably have a whole field  somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like we should be playing  the Texas theme right now. She's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  precessing. Wait a minute. I can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm precessing. Okay. Oh, you can't  see the colors.  Did you get those? Oh, you got them.  I'm so jealous.  So this is the nano

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  light. This is all the rage, these  nano lights. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I'm sorry that the color  isn't really coming through well,  but it looks amazing in person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And let's... This is so cool.  So the idea is these can be put together  in a variety of ways.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh,  thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is my favorite.  This is orange that'll come up, but  you may not see it. Can y'all see it as orange?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to know more about these nano lights. We had a  caller on the new screensavers who had them.  But I thought this was like the latest  thing. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They were the hottest gift for Christmas.  Oh, okay. Or a hot  gift at Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it Nano Leaf?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the Nano Leaf light. So each of these  triangles is an LED.  One controller controls 30  triangles. These are 15 right here.  The main pack  has...  Let's see. What does the main pack have? So it's the pattern

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you chose to put up. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay. So this is firework.  And it'll firework every time  I'm saying something.  And that's because it comes with something called

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the rhythm module. So you could play  music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Alexa,  play Hamilton.  Let's hear the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Original Broadway cast

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. Your Alexa's smarter than mine. I have  to actually say Hamilton Original Cast Soundtrack

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's still telling me who's on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, cause I've been on it a long time.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh my  God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to switch here.  That's one of the better light, music  light things I've ever seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a different pattern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know  I'm going to get depressed. How much do these cost?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How much do they cost? Alexa, stop.  for nine panels?  For nine panels.  And then it's $60 for three.  And then how much is the dancing module?  The dancing module now comes with the main one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it includes the rhythm upgrade module.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could have up to 30 panels  total. So you have to think about what you want to do.  Well, now you can.  It's just on a power strip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, or on a power strip.  So you could actually put more together.  You just need more power  converter transformers.  Oh, so the controller can handle more than 30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the power.  Well, the controller is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  no, you need a whole separate.  You need a controller for each 30.  Yes.  I don't know why I'm asking this.  Does it coordinate across them?  Does it what?  Does it coordinate across the multiple controllers?  Does it coordinate across the multiple controllers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think there's a way to hook that up.  Because you see a lot of like bar setups  and kind of at CES,  they had like a massive setup that  was coordinated. So I assume.  How hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was this to install, to hang on the wall?  It's command tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's 3M command tape.  So you just  stick it on the wall.  Oh man.  And then you can  redo it. So here, I'll take you back up to the office.  So my family can come out of wherever they're hiding.  So my family can come out of wherever they're hiding.  Hello family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello Stacy's family.  So it looks like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I found it on Amazon for a little, for less.  2.19, I don't know though.  Does it have the rhythm module?  Yeah. Oh, maybe not.  Maybe that's the difference.  Because I think that's like 30 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you want to see the sunset?  Yeah.  You want to see the sunset?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On a Nanoleaf?  Or in the real world?  Wow, what a view. Look at that great view you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you can't see the sunset.  My head's in the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I can sort of see it. Yeah.  It's really nice. It's beautiful.  That's a nice, what a great view of the sunset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So do you like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  are you giving a positive review to the Nanoleaf?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you like them? I am. I like them.  They're fancy. They're fun.  Your kids will love them.  I'm not practical.  When you're spending this money,  this is purely like the same kind of money you would spend on like,  I don't know, pictures for your house.  As opposed to like, a light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feels a little limited only because,  you know, it's these triangles.  You can only do things that you could do with the triangle.  So at CES,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  starting in fall,  they will have touch-sensitive squares.  And again, that is on my Instagram.  I sat up and got all excited.  Because I'm a goofus.  Are you GigaStacy on Instagram?  I'm HigginBob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm Stacy on IOT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I should know because we showed it  last week when you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thank you by the way for joining us  last week.  That was great.  It was perfect timing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the one right under, there it is.  The touch one is this one here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's kind of neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's kind of neat.  Oh. Isn't that fun?  Oh, so she touches it and it goes,  whoo.  It's pretty fun. Wow.  So somebody says, what's the application  for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's decorative. Like I said, it's like pictures.  So if you would spend money on  pictures, and  art in your house. Here's my

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  nerdy idea. I'd have to get enough of  them. I want to do the game of life. You know, Conway's  game of life on these. You'd have to  write a program probably.  And you'd need a lot of them or there would be a very  boring game of life. You know about the game of life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The one with the  car that you drive around and the little tiny  people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It comes from scientific memory. It's an old geek thing.  I mean, really old. Only  old, old geeks would get it.  Let me just show you an example.  It's a cellular automation.  But see, what is,  this is huge. How big would this have  to be to play  this game?  I can make a, that's a,  you can make a pretty small grid,  right? Let's make a glider.  So you see the glider moves. It'd be really fun  to make this out of that.  But, what, this is a huge,  this would cost thousands  of dollars. But I bet you somebody  with a lot of money is going to do something like that. That'd be  fun to have on the wall. I'd put it on the wall here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can tell them to.  You can tell the Nanoleaf  people to. If you go to their website,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you can see. They do stuff.  They got them. They got a lot of them. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They can do, and that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  their marketing. It'd be kind of fun  to do this.  You know what? I want light up Legos  doing that.  Light up Legos.  Alright. Very nice thing,  Stace. So, there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  your thing. Thank you. Super fun.  No practical purpose  whatsoever. And you can also control them  from Madam A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I could, oh.  Yeah.  But what commands does Madam A have  for, just turn them on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She turns them on and off. I think she also  theoretically recognizes scenes.  However, when I ask her to do a scene,  she does not respond well.  So, that is

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  one of those things where I'm like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  maybe. I haven't trouble shot it yet.  Because I got back from CES on  Friday and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you buy them in bulk? Can you get  like, can you get a wholesale?  Like, if I called them because they say I'd like  400 of them and get a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, you could try.  They did, they show on one of  their pages a bar.  The base of the bar is just these

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  lights. Yeah. Because to do a game  of life, you'd need 20 by 20 at least, I think.  To make it at all interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I still  don't know what the game of life is. But  I'm going to look it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look up Conway's  game of life. That's the real one.  And now we give you our number  of the week for Mr. Professor Jeffrey  G. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, I have  two left.  Apple's going to  recreate $38 billion  in the tax deal. Is that all?  That's out of what? 220?  200 plus, yeah.  240, something like that. But  more interesting than that, I thought, was this. Blackrock,  which is the largest investment firm out there  with all of our 401Ks and such,  sent a letter to  the companies  that it invests in saying, contribute to society  or risk losing our support.  They have $6 trillion in  investments.  401Ks, exchange traded funds,  mutual funds and such. As such,  they are the largest investor in the world  and have outsized influence,  says the New York Times. And thus,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this is great. Forget the Paris Accord,  just get Blackrock to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Society quote from the letter,  society is demanding the companies, both public and private,  serve a social purpose. To prosper  over time, every company must not only deliver  financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive  contribution to society.  Right on.  That's nice. I hope they're  serious about it. I hope they are too.  And what's the definition of positive influence,  we shall see. But what's the negative?  We shall see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to point you,  this isn't really a thing, but I am going to point you an article  that everybody should read.  This is from Atlantic Magazine.  Alexis Madrigal does great stuff.  By the way,  he was one of the people who went to Fusion, right?  Is Fusion gone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fusion? No, no, no,  no, it's now called  Splinter and it's part of the Fusion Media Group  at Univision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Univision owns it and started it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They hired Gizmodo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Roots. They hired Kevin Roos,  they hired Alexis Madrigal,  they hired great people.  Felix Salmon.  Felix Salmon,  who's the woman who wrote  about the toilet in Kansas.  Anyway, so it's still around.  Kashmir Hill.  Love all of these people, some of the  best tech journalists, or journalists in general,  but tech-focused journalists.  And now they're writing for other things. Sounds like  they're not kept busy.  I don't know.  Anyway, Alexis writes about  the strange brands in your  Instagram feed.  See, he bought this fine-looking  West Louis jacket.  It all started  with an Instagram ad for a coat.  The West Louis Businessman Windproof  Long Coat. It looked like a decent camel coat.  Not fancy, but fine.  And I'd been looking for one just that color.  So when the ad touting the coat  popped up and the price was in the double digits,  hey, don't question his taste.  I figured, hey, a deal.  The brand, West Louis,  seemed like another one of the small clothing  companies that has me tagged in the vast  Facebook advertising ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, does Amazon own it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry. No, this is  far worse.  That's what he thought, like  Faraday, Birdwell, Beech, Britches,  Life After Denim.  So perhaps the copy on the West Louis  site was a little much, claiming West Louis is the  perfection of modern gentleman clothing,  but in a world where an oil company  can claim to fuel connections,  who was I to fault a small entrepreneur for some  purple pros? Several weeks later,  the coat showed up in a black plastic bag  emblazoned with the markings of  China Post, that nation's postal service.  I tore it open and pulled out the coat.  The material has the  softness of a Las Vegas carpet.  And the rich sheen of a velour  jumpsuit. The fabric is  so synthetic, it could probably be  refining the bunker fuel for a ship.  It was technically the item I  ordered only shabbier than I expected in every  aspect. It turns out,  and you can watch this video for a 17  year old from Scotland, Roy Gannon,  that people are creating  basically drop shipping companies  advertising on  Facebook and Instagram.  And there are all the tools  out there. This kid shows you  how to use Shopify and a bunch of  Shopify plugins to  generate traffic.  Madrigal calls him the Bob Ross of  e-commerce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He watched me.  We buy stuff in that thing.  The weirdest stuff comes through  these companies too. But be careful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because it's not all great stuff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right? Well, so they not only  do they do this highly optimized  advertising to catch hipster  type people, they also just do  arbitrage against pricing. So sometimes  when you order something, so that's  when we catch them. We catch them when we've  done like lowest price for a good.  And then we get like,  I think we bought some canned air that came  via drop shipping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think increasingly, and this happens on  Amazon too, you're going to have to be very careful  about what you're buying and who you're buying it  from. He, there's  all these Shopify plugins. There's one called Oberlo,  which allows you to pull products  directly from AliExpress. Click a button and something  that was manufactured in the Chinese  hinterlands becomes an item for  sale in an Irish kids website.  So you,  there's literally no work. The one  by hand thing that he would have  to do, which is the actual  drop shipping, he farms  out order fulfillment  by hiring digital workers on the platform  Upwork for three, four, and five dollars an hour.  Madrigal says that when I searched the platform last  week, there were 275 open jobs for  drop shipping.  200 for AliExpress, specifically 132  for Oberlo.  And there's all sorts of other things. There's  little timers that will say, oh, we're almost running out.  You better order right now.  Even though that's not true. I mean,  just on and on. And the kid doesn't own any  inventory, doesn't have to have any inventory.  Doesn't even have to have any money up front.  Basically, this is  he just creates this entity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like Cafe Press, only  bigger and worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really fascinating article.  And I think a cautionary tale.  That's why I want people to read it. The strange  brands in your Instagram feed.  Because, well, yeah, some of these  are fine. I noticed this.  All of a sudden, maybe it's me. I'm  starting to see a lot of, remember it was like those ads for wallets.  I'm starting to see a lot of ads for wall clocks.  And I bet you  they're cheaply made.  They glue a Xerox  of the face, because it looks really cool.  And it's Breitling and stuff. And I'm sure  I bet you. I don't know.  What was I saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So why don't you create the Toots  the Unicorn Fund? I could!  Expose this sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could!  Anyway, that's my thing of the week.  That's our show for the week. And I thank  you all for joining us. And I apologize  if you're a Trump voter.  I just apologize.  And if you're  still here, I don't  know what to say. Thank you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I should have had us talk about a story.  What story? What?  No.  I had this like cool moment  at CES where I changed the way I thought about  broadband access, which was like super  amazing for me because I think a lot  about broadband. So that's why  I was like, oh, I should have put that on the rundown.  Next week. Can you do it next week?  It is totally not timely. It's just really
