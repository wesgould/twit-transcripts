Transcript:  Coming up next on This Week in Google, it's me, Jason Howell, filling in for Leo Laporte,  who is somewhere on a cruise.  Have fun, Leo.  I'm also joined by Jeff Jarvis, Stacey Higginbotham, and Ant Pruitt.  And what do you know, we've got a bunch of Google news to actually talk about this week.  We've got AR glasses being beta tested.  We've got Google with a hiring freeze in effect, Pixelbooks apparently on the horizon, and  then Chrome OS Flex for converting like computers that aren't running Chrome OS into Chrome  OS devices.  And then of course, yes, we've got non-Googley news like the opening of AI, OpenAI to the  public, Netflix's second bad quarter, and a video game with cats that's making real  cats very happy.  All that and more coming up next on This Week in Google.

Learn more at cdw.com slash HPE.  It's time for twig.  This Week in Google.  Like envisioning like the title cards going this week in Google coming towards the camera.  We need to make that happen with the new logo art that you've surely already seen in your  podcatcher of choice.  I'm Jason Howell filling in for Leo Laporte, who is hopefully not getting seasick on a  cruise with a bunch of other twit fans and Lisa and Paul Therot is there as well.  There we go.  So they're having a great time.  I'm planning on having a great time here with the twig fam starting with Jeff Jarvis.  He is the Leonard Tao Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the.  There we go.  Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Welcome, Jeff.  Good to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Given the new logo, I think we should start off like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, right.  Hands up, everybody.  Hands up.  Yes, I love it.  Talk to the hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good call.  Doing that smart ass.  I pulled my earpiece out of my ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what you get.  That's what you get.  Good to see you, Jeff.  Also joining us, it's Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey on IOT.  Welcome, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Welcome back, Stacey.  Yeah, welcome back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good to be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  Oh, so I've got you in the doc last week, but that's right.  You weren't in the doc last week because you were out there.  That was an unpleasant surprise.  No, no, no.  It was just the page from last week, but I had obviously not updated it.  That's right.  You were out and it's great to have you back.  You were gone two weeks in a row, in fact, right?  Yep.  I was.  Are you ready to talk Google?  Welcome back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm so excited about Google this week.  There's so much news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There really is.  Yes.  And we're going to talk all about it.  We actually have a good amount of Google news so we can keep true to the name of  this show for a change.  Also joining us, it's Ant Pruitt, hands on photography and, you know,  maintainer of Club Twitter and all other things.  Welcome Ant.  Hello, sir.  How you be, Mr. Howell?  I'm doing all right.  I had a little bit of a bumpy start with my audio interface not working, but I  think I've smoothed that out and good to go and it's good to see your face.  Not in the office though this week, but that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Likewise, sir.  Likewise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, this is...  If you, you're supposed to have everybody be virtual.  If one person is virtual, that's like the, the way your sister run virtual meetings.  So this is perfect.  So it works out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  It works out.  We're finally learning the etiquette of Zoom.  Doing this online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  None of us are learning etiquette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're rude on this show.  Yeah.  That's what makes it appealing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's good to see y'all and it's good to be able to join you on such a Google  heavy week.  Where do you all want to start?  Cause I see at the top is Netflix, but if we've got a lot of Google, why don't  we start with Google Glass?  Because there's not a whole lot to this story other than the fact that at Google  IO, if you remember, if you recall Google IO, they were talking, Google was talking  about kind of the next iteration of AR glasses that Google is working on, going  to put out at some point.  I feel like when Google, you know, when Google was happening and they were showing  off the glasses, I felt like this was like maybe a couple of years out, but  apparently they're going to start beta testing these suckers.  I think next month, starting in August, you might encounter someone wearing the  new iteration of the new glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  I want to be able to trade in my Google Glass on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that would be nice.  I would do that.  Yes.  Yes.  You know, heartbeat.  Yes.  Yeah, those $1,500 glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  It's probably going to cost you more to send it to them versus what those things  actually worth.  Yeah.  They're not worth that $1,500.  Rub it in.  Rub it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rub it in.  I bought the lenses for them.  I bought real lenses for them so I could wear them all the time.  I'm that much of a schmuck.  Am I going to buy these?  Probably because I'm a schmuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bless your heart.  You're not a schmuck.  You just, you go all in.  You dedicate yourself to the bit.  That's what it's all about.  For the show.  I do it for the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You dedicate it to the bit.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kevin did the same thing.  So, you know, you're in good company, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am.  At least he's there with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But these, so y'all, these are not going to be tested broadly.  It's just like some of their employees and these glasses are different.  They've got, they're for AR, understanding like the environment around you.  They can't take pictures and video except algorithmically.  So, basically they're pulling in data, but it's not data that you can like post on  Instagram or something like that.  And they will have a red light for when they're collecting that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know why I had it in my head that there was no camera on here, but that  makes sense if it's an AR glass that it would have some sort of camera.  It's just, you can't use it to take pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like LiDAR.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't, it's not LiDAR, but it's like time of flight.  Yeah.  Image sensing.  I don't, yeah, I have a hard time under, like we need a new word for taking  imagery for computers and not for people's vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  But, but is this basically a play for Google to take this particular product or  proposed product out of the regular consumer's hands and just saying, you  know what, we're really focusing more so on enterprise and manufacturing.  Do you see some type of fun consumer product coming out of this?  You know, with all of the Pokemon stuff that people still play.  I even heard somebody still plays Ingress, you know, and that's AR games.  That's a blast from the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The last game I played was Myst, so good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Congratulations.  It's about time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if, I mean, so from a consumer perspective, Google is talking  about things like translation.  What else did they talk about?  I'm trying to remember what all they said, but that's the main thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that I remember is translation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably, probably directions and that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now I think given how Google historically, like you do actually need some sort of  image sensing if you want to do, like, you know how Google has their AR directions  now, I don't know if you've played with their directions where it will put that up.  So I'm envisioning something, being able to do something like this on a heads up  display would actually be really good.  So you would need to get some sort of image data from it for that.  For translation, as someone who just spent time in a foreign country, trying to read  menus using my phone, you know, having it again, a heads up display that shows they  can see the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that sounds so nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Instead of sitting there pointing at it with your phone.  Yeah.  Yeah, which was fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm sure, right?  It's fine.  But this would be truly transformative, right?  Like if you were already wearing glasses anyways, it would be less of a, I need to  pull out my phone in order to do this thing and more, this is just a new superpower that  I have when I wear these things.  It just automatically happens.  That's like, that's awesome.  That's a good way to put it, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I think it's a really interesting question that because they learned the lesson with  glass that if you give it to just everyday ordinary schmucks like me, we're going to  end up making fun of it and it's not going to work.  So they realized that the real use of it was for tradespeople and doctors and so on and  so forth.  So I think if they learn that lesson, you never know with Google.  But it would say to me that their reflex should be to start with those kinds of uses and  prove it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis, as someone that has their own theme song, you're not an everyday person,  my man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I wasn't.  Definitely not a schmuck.  You are not a schmuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That the use cases, I think consumers would want this if they had the right kind of gear.  So I think they found the use cases in enterprise because A, they were expensive, but B, because  they weren't comfortable to wear.  So you had to have a really good incentive and your employer saying, hey, this is...  Okay.  Yeah.  So I think, and we're seeing it, if you think about snap spectacles, you think about the  Ray-Ban sunglasses, Amazon made the Echo frames.  They weren't that great.  But you see that we're trying to...  It's very clear that we're trying to figure out how to cram as much tech into a truly wearable  device.  And we're still not sure what the use case is to drive people to actually purchase it.  So stay on that Stacey for a second.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  I was going to say, so I think that's Google's attempt to throw something out there,  start playing around with it and see what that...  I hate to say a killer app, but at least a viable app for glass might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So with the old glass, I don't think it was anticipated that taking photos was going to be  a primary use.  Robert Scoble in the shower and all that.  And I think that what Google wished for was the heads up display giving you information  because it's an information company.  So what's interesting in this case, if they disable photo taking for any purpose other  than data and knowing where it is and that kind of stuff and being able to present an  augmented reality, the design decisions will drive the usage is I guess what I'm trying to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  And we're so much...  Yeah.  And we're also so much further in terms of what these are capable of.  Now we have...  I can't remember.  Was glass back in like 2013?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was almost...  It was 10 years ago, if I'm not mistaken.  Yeah.  So now we have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Glass was 10 years ago.  Real time translate, right?  We have always on wake word detection that can actually like playback music.  We have so much more available to us that isn't taking pictures that still feels both useful and  a little bit familiar.  So I do think you're right, Jeff, that we have these things available to us now and  that'll be kind of exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what do you think the killer app should be, could be?  With this capability, with this superpower, what would you most want to be able to do with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My issue is I need it to be almost as good as my current classes and maybe not as stylish  because these are my most stylish pair of glasses.  They are very stylish.  Rocking it.  They are very stylish.  But have it...  I feel like music playback that's compelling is good, right?  I feel like when I'm walking around a city having directions,  you have to think...  Translate sounds awesome, but how often am I in a boring country?  Right.  Right.  Yep.  So what are the everyday use cases?  Well, could you, George, compare us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could you have imagined using it there?  I would have loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would have loved it, but it wouldn't have been something I would have purchased for that.  Right, for that.  That's like a...  Yeah.  So I'm like, what is my almost everyday use case where this becomes compelling?  Maybe it's playing an AR game and that gets us penetration.  I think directions is really interesting.  Yeah.  I actually don't think notifications is a good one simply because  I don't want to be reading while I'm trying to drive, right?  To send messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I don't know that everybody is still kind of pining to get that notification triage.  Always being completely up to date on those notifications that come in.  I feel like we've kind of shifted a little bit.  I know I have.  Away from, let me know every single little thing that happens as it happens immediately on my phone.  But in front of my face, that's too noisy for me.  The thing that I do every day that I could see this being useful for would be the navigation,  even though the navigation that I use right now is handy already.  But that's like an immediate...  When I think of translation, you're right.  I'm rarely ever in a situation where translation is necessary.  So that's not going to be the killer app for someone to get this in my view.  But I navigate all the time.  So that would be very helpful.  But you don't navigate...  If you're driving on a killer app, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you're navigating on a big screen, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm just thinking about how my Tesla handles...  They have two forms of navigation.  On the big screen, I have the traditional map that you're probably used to.  But then in front of me on the little dash in front of me, I get basically just a little  turn left here kind of thing.  So I think those are what you would see on the glass.  You wouldn't see the map style.  And then as a woman, I never take out my phone when I'm walking places, right?  Because I don't want someone to come and whack me over the head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Situational awareness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I got to be aware.  So I'm thinking about...  There's also...  Like, I really think things like music playback might be good or the ability to  start a voice call could be compelling.  I would love to have like, hey, gee, call 911, you know, in your location or something.  That could be useful.  So I'm just trying to think of places where I have my screen.  And then also, what if you could see things like...  I don't know.  Like, you know how you Google a restaurant and it says like,  oh, I'm super busy or I'm not super busy right now.  What if you could just like as you're walking by a place see like,  oh, holy cow, that's crowded.  I mean, now there...  Maybe you could see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm hmm.  The annotated world.  That starts to make a lot more sense to me, Stacey.  That makes a lot more sense.  That is context.  By the way, it also makes me listen to you guys.  It makes me think it should be disabled when you drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  More driving mode that's simplified.  There only gives you what you actually need for that very specific task.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But your focus comes off the distance and onto the lens, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It might.  Have you used the AR navigation?  Yeah.  The Google AR navigation, like while you're walking?  Walking doesn't work very well for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's always confused.  I'm always going like this.  Oh no, no, no, no, no.  Do the figure eight thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got to calibrate it first, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I look like an idiot on the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, no.  So instead of it, so has it asked you, because Google will ask you instead of calibrating,  it's like, hey, hold up your camera and let us see where you are.  Have you done that yet, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. It works for three steps so that it gets confused again.  I haven't done this in quite a while, in fairness, but it was so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So when you enter that, your magnetic bud, when you enter into that mode,  it does an overlay on top of the real world.  So I could see something like that being enabled in driving mode.  I mean, it's not there yet, but that I feel like could be where it's going.  You can see that on your windshield.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That'd be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. No, we can't bring a car in.  That's a whole other system of like manufacturers of like API calls and like design.  And then I'd have to have a Google car versus an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, Jeff.  Which of course is what I would do.  I would get a Google car.  I'm not getting an Apple car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Being able to throw on a pair of glasses and immediately go outside and get this new  contextual awareness of the world around you.  Talking about superpowers like that right there is the killer app as far as I'm concerned,  based on what were all the different possibilities that we're talking about here.  If I knew that when I threw these glasses on and I went for a walk downtown,  I was going to immediately understand, oh, that place has a really great sale going on right now.  Maybe I should go in there and check it out.  That awesome restaurant is as dead as it ever gets this moment.  Maybe I should go in there and get lunch.  Things like that that actually impact your immediate life.  And actually beyond that, it's almost like you get a window into a world that doesn't exist  without those glasses.  Of course, that was FourSquare's dream was to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Yes.  Well, you don't have to have your phone in your pocket.  Sorry, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I was just going to tell Jeff, or Jeff, Jason, that he will have to still have his phone  in his pocket because we don't have the computing power for this yet.  But okay, what does the killer app they'll never do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They'll never do is, who the hell is that?  Oh my God.  Yeah.  Don't totally do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't want those.  That privacy implications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm terrible at names.  Oh, I would love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What if they did it so like, here's what if they did this?  What if I opted into sharing my face data with my contacts and then Googles like,  this is a contact of yours.  Would that be okay for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could put in your enemies as contacts.  I mean, be fine with me because I'm easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, I would have to opt in to be like.  Oh, you would have to as a subject.  Oh, but then.  Yeah.  Opting is cool.  Yeah.  And then also, I would probably want some sort of like creep mode in that  where I would be like, even though they're my contact, I don't want them.  So I might have to proactively go in and delete, you know,  and I could always opt in to or opt out of it completely for everyone.  What about if they did it that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that.  Some sort of like quick disable or invisibility mode or something like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I still think like I think invisibility mode, like so Google says in there,  they're talking about this.  They're not going to share data from sensitive areas like government buildings,  hospitals, places like that.  I actually think Google has the power to shut that down on the device.  They're just saying they won't keep that data.  But I actually think Google has the power to create an invisibility mode for people.  So, yeah.  Yeah, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  How do you think these...  How is Amazon doing with Echo Frames?  I know that they have the second generation, so they didn't totally kill it.  And I realized that it's definitely, you know, in comparison with what we're talking about,  it's definitely a lot less than, you know, by comparison.  But has Amazon been at all successful with kind of bringing a kind of connected glasses  to the market?  I hear nothing about them, I feel like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't...  Kevin hated them.  I haven't ever encountered someone in the wild with them.  Yeah.  But I have encountered people with the Ray-Bans sunglasses that freaking love them.  Like I've encountered four people in the wild wearing this, which isn't a lot,  but you know, it's more than the Echo Frames.  That's enough for New York Times Trends story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like that is a lot.  Who are these people?  Mostly men.  Were they people that would be panelists on this show?  Or was it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, where?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Random airports or at a convention?  Yeah, tech conferences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So hard.  Men with money at tech conferences.  It ain't a lot of people with them then, if that's the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But still, I can't imagine many of those have been sold in the grand scheme of things.  So that still sits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Best Buy, there's lots of...  There's three or four brands of listen to music glasses.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  So that's starting to be a better known interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And those are like conduction sort of thing?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I've tested pairs of those.  They're actually quite nice.  Because you can hear the world around you.  I would probably wear something like that if I didn't have glasses glasses.  I would pick up a pair of those for biking or something like that.  But I can't see without my glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Neither can I.  Or with contacts.  By the way, if you still have those classic Google Glass and they're not going to take  them as trade-in for these new things, which I'm purely surprised if they did, but hey,  you never know.  I'm seeing them on eBay for like $450.  You can just sell them.  Really?  One will buy them.  Yeah.  Apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your Google Glassics.  Buying collector's items essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Collected.  Exactly.  That's what you're doing there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I contributed my Osborne one to the Museum of Printing and Haverhill Mass.  Maybe I can contribute to my Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And a tax deduction.  Nice try.  I think you should just take the cash myself.  Donated from a schmuck.  Yeah.  On loan.  The collection.  You're not a schmuck.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Show title.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People want to know if their Jarvis is a schmuck.  Well, Jarvis is not a schmuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we'll do an internet poll.  Schmuck?  Not schmuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Swipe left for not schmuck.  Swipe right for schmuck.  Let's see here.  Should we talk a little bit about, I don't know how much there is to talk about this,  but Google has officially announced that they are freezing their hiring process.  They did say that if there's any hiring happening, like they're in the midst of hiring someone,  they're not going to totally shut that down.  But I guess new people that aren't already in the process of being hired by Google,  you're going to have to wait your turn.  Who knows when that's going to be done.  It's two weeks.  Oh, they say for two weeks.  Okay.  I think it was interesting considering the just-  Well, that's a short amount of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a very short amount of time, but I think it's a signal.  I think it says, hold on everybody.  We got a plan coming.  Don't do anything.  Because otherwise people are going to rush in and hire 20 people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  What is that plan?  Is this all based on the downward turn of ad revenues or what?  That's what I couldn't quite understand.  Because they just talked about this last week of the season sort of slowing down or what have you.  And then now we got this report that is basically cold turkey stopping it for two weeks.  What's the timing on that?  This is July.  The quarter's not over for another two months, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but we're in a bear market right now.  So once you hit, it's like a magical time when everyone freaks out.  And everybody is freaking out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the big tech companies seem to be announcing something similar to this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft, Apple, I think is.  Facebook certainly has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're either announcing hiring freezes or announcing layoffs.  The freak out has begun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's certainly a matter of like, yeah, one of my friends just got laid off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no.  TikTok has started laying off.  Even TikTok, even the beloved TikTok.  That's right.  It's an excuse too, to Anne's point.  And to Stacey's, when you hit a downturn, you can start doing things that you otherwise  wouldn't do and use this as an excuse.  So you're not evil and nasty.  You're just, oh, sorry.  It's a downturn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think it's that.  I just think it's like, okay, guys, we're about to enter into,  we're potentially about to enter into turbulent economic times.  We had a plan in place, but seeing these signs, basically you're just putting on the breaks  because you're like, there is a windy road ahead.  And what they'll do, like a two week pause makes total sense.  So let's say you had open headcount, your 50 person division, you're basically like,  you can't fill that yet.  Now in two weeks after they've like, these are the priorities we're going to have.  Then you can pitch your open positions again.  I mean, it's just like tapping the brakes a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You sound like you're just laid off.  It's fascinating that it's just a two week window.  That's, I guess, because I don't quite get.  No, that's because that's what they can plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like, don't hire someone right now until we figure out how we want to handle this.  That's all this is.  Okay.  That makes more sense.  I don't know about you, but if you're looking at the market right now or like we're self-employed,  but like if I had a job, I might be like, oh dude, let's not make any big purchases for a second,  just to make sure, you know, we still see where things are going.  It's the same thing.  Because hiring someone's like making a big purchase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  So now my next question is why is this news?  And I don't mean that.  I guess you can't work at Google anymore.  Why is this news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's an indication that the market is freaking people out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And based on this, we should expect like maybe they'll extend the hiring freeze.  If they extend the hiring freeze and we find out about it, then we know that Google thinks  this is going to be actually more severe than they originally are.  Or maybe they'll be like, we're not going to hire anybody in our ad division.  And that means they're not confident about ads.  Like you'll get an indication of their priorities going forward,  like where they think their growth and what they need to maintain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or if they hire a hundred people in their Chromebook division that I celebrate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff.  We're not one.  I bear a message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll bear my message in a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your dog bears a message, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Messages the FedEx person is here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh goody.  What does the FedEx person bring?  Not a pixel book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The figure of the week.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, oh, that's maybe I should keep this as my thing.  Oh, I'm sorry.  The dog.  Okay.  Kevin says, Jeff, the dragon, is it the Lenovo dragon?  HP dragon flight, whatever his current dragon fly Chromebook that is the Chromebook for you.  Whoa.  Read that.  It was a big, like a big wreck.  This is the Chromebook that pixel would have,  this should have been the pixel Chromebook were his words.  Oh, HP elite dragon fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I saw it in Best Buy and I said, well, HP really.  I do read Kevin every week.  I just hadn't gotten to it today yet.  Oh, oh, Kevin.  Yeah.  So there is actually Chromebook news too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there's a three to two aspect ratio on that.  Does that bother you, sir?  I would assume not as a writer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I've got now.  What I had last time.  Might bother him a little.  Yeah, a little bit.  So, so there's a story in the rundown that says Ostrilow did say that Google plans to  make more pixel books, by the way.  He wouldn't say when that was an IO.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you need something for your-  They plan to make more two years from now or three years from now or what?  It's that's, that's nothing.  First, my bubble ant bursting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, I'm going to keep it straight with you Mr. Jarvis.  Oh, no, this is a new one.  I had to get the go because my old one died.  So my battery just died.  So this is the go, which is, which is fine.  Kevin wouldn't have, well, Kevin wouldn't,  he didn't have the courage to recommend anything specifically.  He didn't want to blame them for anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't Kevin Toffle like the Pixelbook Go, if I remember correctly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he did.  He did.  But it was the other one.  The one I was going to get is one of those that was the folds back, but then the,  then the screen digs into your knees and it's kind of weird and I wasn't that happy about it.  And, and so I like, I like this one.  It's not as bright outside as I want, but it's a good machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not enough mitts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, then you're going to have to wait a little bit longer for your Pixelbook.  I doubt that it's going to be, you know, have the mobile internet support for it, but  I don't care.  I hope I was going to ask.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, once I got rid of my grandfathered AT&T plan that wouldn't do tethering  and finally just surrender.  Okay.  I see.  I see.  Now it tethers immediately and I should have done it years before.  I was just being stubborn.  You?  And so I don't care about that.  I don't care about having LTE anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You can just tether and basically this off my list.  Yeah.  Okay. Well, that's good that that's off your list because apparently they don't really do  that much.  It's not going to be on anybody's list.  It's not their jam.  Not their jam anymore.  On the Chrome OS tip, apparently there is a story in here on ZDNet about taking old  Linux desktops and transforming them into Chrome OS.  I guess Google has, what does Google have a kind of a service now or a way of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. They have a version of Chrome that you can take to all Windows machines.  I don't know if you can do with Macs or not.  Okay.  But yeah, you can have the sense now to finally have a Chromebook.  The way I don't know is what updating they will do of those because Chromebooks do go out of  update at some point.  So if it's an old machine but a new build of Chrome, I don't know how that operates.  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Good question.  Chrome OS Flex is what that is called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of our listeners up in the Pacific Northwest, Ryan Lonsberry mentioned doing this and hasn't  had any issues with putting it on an old machine and seemed quite happy because I was complaining  about my computer over the weekend acting up and he was like, well, I just tried this new Chrome  and works just totally fine.  Getting work done with it too.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to get new things and we missed the big story of the week.  We forgot.  I forgot.  I read this on Twitter.  Very important.  Are you getting a new Pixel 6?  It finally, they finally admitted that it's broken.  Well, sir, it just got here this afternoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Big news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So I'm going to have to wipe the other one and, you know, get everything transferred.  But it just, it made me mad because I said something nice about the dag gum phone last  week on the show and then the weekend, it just totally went to crap.  Everything it just, I don't know what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two inches away from my wifi and it won't do anything.  And it was just dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sitting here looking at the router and it was no wifi.  Phone calls stopped working or the phone would ring and I would answer it and no one would  hear me.  But yet I call back and they could hear me.  I mean, it just totally went to crap.  I'm like, I just bragged about this dag gum phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how hard was it to convince Google that it was dead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, not very hard because I'm, I can write quite sternly if I need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The email was full of capitalization.  That's basically all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that seemed to work because, you know, I used to be in tech support.  So I know about all of the scripts and stuff and that they need to do.  So I've already had all of that stuff ready to go and I literally just pasted it here.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so you showed them all the diagnosis you'd already done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  And I was like, so look, so don't even start your little triage stuff with me.  I don't even, don't even bother with that.  And I usually say that in there and they're like, well, okay, Mr. Pruitt and  here's your order for the replacement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No back and forth at all.  That was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh no, it took about 15 minutes total.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's nothing.  That's awesome.  And you've got to, you got to rent yourself out for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just got to, it's all about stern writing.  That's all it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You didn't even have to hop on the phone.  That's what's amazing.  I'm not even, I didn't call anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did it all over the little chat thing.  Cause they have, you know, they have a little pixel help stuff in no way.  And you just hit the little chat button and literally just hit paste.  Cause I had already started a little note and I just copied paste and waited.  And it was, it was about 15 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The tricky thing about that though is like, I have definitely heard from people  who have had that experience when it comes to the support from Google.  And then I have also heard from people who have had the exact opposite of that experience  when it comes to support from Google.  So, you know, it's never like a, like a 100%.  All you got to do is hit them up on chat and, you know, tell them exactly what it is.  And it's going to result in this sort of outcome.  Sometimes it's hit or miss, you know, sometimes is it dependent on the, the CSR that you  are actually communicating with probably to some degree.  But you just don't really know.  Possibly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But this person, they did attempt to go into their script and I shut it down.  Nope.  You're not doing this.  You've already gone through that.  Let's just go ahead and move this along.  And, and the, oh, the other thing they mentioned was repairs.  And I remember saying, no, you're not, I'm not going to send you this phone to repair it.  This phone costs way too much to have to be repaired in under a year.  Send me another phone.  That was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's good.  Work.  Good.  Good.  So next week we get a report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there was not a please in there at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's where I fall down.  I'm always like, I would like a phone, please.  Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's stern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I can be stern and still say please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I bet you.  No, no, I can't put please in there if I'm going to be stern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have, I have a mom voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd be scared of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our aunt, are you hopeful or optimistic that this new device will solve all your problems?  And you'll suddenly be like, oh, maybe I have a lemon all along.  Like maybe this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm optimistic because the phone did get better with those last two or three updates.  It did get better.  But like I said, I don't know what happened last weekend.  Just, just totally random.  Trying to talk to my mother and just weird and anywhere I'd go in the house.  I know the house has some dead spots or whatever, but this was everywhere I went.  And then you try to call over wifi and none of that was working.  Even standing next to the dad gum router.  So yeah, something, something's wrong with that phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you maybe going through all this to avoid talking to your mother and having a good excuse for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will not say such a thing on air because remember I've told you before,  my mother trolls me when I bring up stuff like this on here.  So I won't say such a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've got some explaining to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's coming.  I love you moms.  Hope you had a good trip to Cleveland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Let's, let's take a pause.  That was a lot of Google in one block.  Didn't that feel good?  Wasn't that invigorating?  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we delayed Elon Musk for that long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Hey, I'm cool if we don't talk about Elon today.  That's just how I feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I think, I think a victory for Twitter is worth at least noting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Of course.  Twitter deserves a little victory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But we don't need a whole cluster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  All right.  So how about this?  We'll give you the victory lap for Twitter.  Although it's maybe it's too early for a victory lap, but it's a victory clap.  But it felt good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A golf clap for Twitter.  Yes.  Yeah.  We'll give a victory clap to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Well, they were...  Well, okay.  Elon Musk was trying to get this trial, I think, delayed into next year for reasons, I'm sure.  Twitter wanted this soon.  They wanted it fast and that's what they got.  It begins in October.  The trial will be expedited.  So five-day trial, which is definitely a point for Twitter worthy of a golf clap.  And that's about all I have to say about that.  I'm curious to know what y'all think about this.  I'm Musk exhausted at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maznik listened to the beginning of it, at least, and had a good report.  And part of what was happening here was Twitter was smashing through Musk right and left.  And the judge didn't question Twitter at all.  Musk's arguments were kind of dismissed.  So the mood of it was...  You can't read too much into it.  It was just about the only issue was the timing.  But the judge made clear that there was damage to the company here if this went on longer.  So Musk wanted February.  Twitter wanted September.  They got October.  And so I think it's a first good sign here on the Twitter case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  He's just got to put up or shut up or...  You can't be in limbo this long as a corporate entity.  So that makes sense.  Imagine if you worked for Twitter right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, God.  Yeah, I have to.  I know no one directly that works at Twitter, but I have to imagine  that this has been really, really challenging for anyone that works there.  You're really questioning your choices and wondering, do I stay?  Do I go?  Am I confident in the vision of Twitter that was versus where it's headed right now?  Everything is one giant question mark.  And yeah, how unfortunate.  It's unfortunate that something like this comes along and completely shakes the foundation.  It's underperforming on Wall Street.  It's just for a company that I appreciate and use regularly, it's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, even with a company that...  Even if Musk was not even in the picture, someone to come in to wanting to buy them out,  how was Twitter's future looking anyway?  Because again, you just mentioned that they're sort of on a decline as far as revenues go.  What did they have in place to sort of right the ship?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't know.  They had...  What was it?  Blue sky?  I mean, the $3 a month that the four of us that only people are using,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's not going to save them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if they got $20 billion in the bank from Musk, just to pick a number out of thin air,  that gives a lot of runway to do a lot of development.  It certainly helps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Blue sky...  We don't have though...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, go on.  I was going to say there's no articulate vision for what Twitter...  Agarwal...  Is it Agarwal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't say his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Agarwal?  Agarwal and Adderall.  There's no vision yet.  I was like, no, it's not Adderall.  What you're about to say, I think Jeff, about Big Sky is interesting,  but is that the future?  We don't know.  Could they invest in that?  Sure, but you don't give $20 billion to someone in who doesn't know what they're going to do with  it from a company perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so that's the question of the board and the CEO.  What happens?  What's about the leadership?  There's also a different ownership structure now because you have...  There was another hedgey who is betting long on Twitter and short on Musk,  and he's now one of the top five shareholders.  We had another one last week called Hindenburg that is also now a big shareholder.  That's right.  So the humanity, oh, the humanity.  And so the shareholders, the large shareholders, I think will have things to say about where  Twitter goes, who runs it to one end.  As you know, I've talked about it at DOSI with the show, I'm enthusiastic about the model of  Blue Sky discussion as a protocol, building value-added layers on top of that.  I think if Twitter basically...  It's basically the way to reopen the excitement of the API days when it started,  and people were doing neat things with it, and if you could make that part of the company,  I think good things could happen.  We'll see.  But I don't want it to get all messed up.  People also go crazy online about it.  You don't want Musk to buy it.  Deborah, it's negotiation.  Unless they get so obvious they're going to win in court, that's when Musk's back is against the  wall. That's when you negotiate with him, and that's when you try to get a lot more than a  billion dollars out of him and get rid of him at the same time. Then it's a win-win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that'd be a smart move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There should be a German name for that. Is there a German name for that, Jeff?  Mike Shin Win Win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seeg Seeg.  I guess. I don't know what it is.  Twitter Seeg.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Twitter Crate.  Is that enough Musk?  That's plenty of Musk for me.  Are we wearing enough Musk right now?  We can move on.  It does Seeg.  Hey, you know what?  Hey, you know what? Dolly too.  They're opening up their waitlist. Apparently they're looking for 1 million users. They plan  to do that within the next two weeks. You can get on their waitlist if you haven't already. You can  go to the site and sign up for Dolly too and start making some imagery. That's pretty cool.  I want to make some images, see what it can come up with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the form is great. First name and the fill in the blank name that's just holding  space there is Salvador. Last name Dolly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Clever.  Yeah. I've signed up. I don't know what I'm going to put in there when it comes through eventually.  Hopefully I get picked off the waitlist, but I'll hold my breath.  Dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm looking forward to building images for my stories because there's no great stock art  for IoT, right? I'm like, oh, what kind of crazy images can I build for spectral efficiency?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, seriously though, I'm going to be really curious to see how this does in that direction,  because that seems what this is really ripe for. Actually with this new transition into essentially  being a paid for service, 50 free for the first month, 15, and it's a credit based system by the  way. So 50 free credits the first month, 15 free every month after, and then you can purchase  additional credits, $15 for 115 credits. I don't think that 115 credits means 115 images. I think  it breaks down less than that, but what this grants you for the first time is full usage rights. So  commercialization, reprinting, selling, merchandise rights, all that stuff. So these images become  really useful and perhaps very valuable for a really low cost. It's kind of crazy. Usually you  would need to hire a digital artist to do a lot of this stuff. And I have to imagine people in  that realm have to be worried at least a little bit about losing some business to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. You've basically created an AI graphic designers, probably a little bit, but yeah,  AI artist, AI mechanic, like yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Graphical artists, yeah. Something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Illustrator, maybe Illustrator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think there will be a problem for that particular industry because that industry has  relationships and they tend to get their business based on their relationships and skills, not just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  their skills. Well, and your field destroyed the business of illustrators before photography and  halftones came along to publications. When Lincoln was killed, Harper's sent illustrators down on  train to Washington to draw, get back as quick as possible to draw them and etch them. And all this  kind of stuff went on and then photography came along and boom, tons of illustrators were out of  work because you and your photography folk got rid of them. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only place they live is in court reporting and in fashion because they're still,  I'm serious. Those are the two areas where you still have actual illustrators working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your fault, Ant.  But I mean, from like graphic designers, I'm sitting here thinking that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That wasn't the right word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Illustrators. Illustrators.  Yeah, I'm thinking more illustrators.  Okay.  I mean, imagine all that silly art you have every time that the Atlantic does another hot take.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  Do that.  Right.  I think it was an illustrator. Somebody was getting logos made with it and it was pretty neat what  I could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, is it going to absolutely replace any human whatsoever out there doing this sort of  stuff? No. But there's probably a lot of people who would much rather pay the low, low cost of this  and just accept what it churns out as opposed to hire someone. I hate to say, but that's probably  true. Right? Like I just need this image fast.  There's going to be people doing that.  And I need it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There'll definitely be people doing that. But if you take the likes of a,  and this may be a bad example, take the likes of a big brand like Nike. They're probably not going  to do that. They're probably going to sell.  Yeah. Nike's not going to do it, but I would do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you're right. No.  Yeah, I would do it. Yeah, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like a little blog or even not a super little blog might do it just because  it's fast. It's easy. You don't have to deal with a person.  Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The people who are turning to a service like Fiverr to get a quick turnaround kind of digital  thing made. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Dotson's daughter. Her soap business. Right?  Right. Yeah. Something along those lines.  Yeah. Yeah. I guess something pretty cool and unique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I wonder, oh, sorry. Did I cut you off? I was wondering if, as this type of thing gets built  out, like we're at a point right now where we can say, Robert Redford, Robert Redford's head is an  ice cream cone. I don't know what the random thing is that you want an image as, but you say  a short sentence and it gives you something and you either like it or you don't. It's either close  to what you were thinking or hoping to see, or maybe you didn't even know what you were hoping  to see, but it's something along the lines of what you said and great. If this system gets built out  to a point to where you can give it multiple layers of instructions, similar to what you could do with  a real digital artist or a designer and say, all right, what I'm looking for is I need a logo.  It's got to be green. It kind of looks like a baseball, but it's all this detail to the style  of do to do. And you can go into that kind of level of detail and then get something back. Then I  think digital artists and designers, they probably would have to worry about something like that,  right? Because then it does get into the realm of replacing potentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still disagree because a lot of digital artists that are creating things for brands,  that communication, that face-to-face communication is really, really critical because  okay, the proposed client is going to have a particular vision in mind.  And sometimes it is the responsibility of the artist to say, you know what, that is a great idea.  Let's shape that up. Or you know what, maybe we should fine tune this a little bit because  you're going to be able to get a little bit more reach, that kind of thing. And that tends to happen  way more than one would realize. Just because you could see a great logo in your head, that doesn't  necessarily mean it's the right logo for you. And that's when those artists come in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's going to be no thing in Dali that's like, by the way, that's really insensitive to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  following group of people. There you go. Exactly. And I think about this, this sort of makes me think  back to the handful of years ago when Adobe Sensei, its AI, started to pick up a lot of traction and  putting tools inside of Photoshop and Lightroom. And a lot of the tech media was saying, oh boy,  this is just going to make it to where photographers are the thing of the past because  their Photoshop skills are just going to be accessible by anybody. And that's not even the  case. What that did was made it easier for people like me to do those repeated tasks a lot faster  because of that AI that's in there. And I think this is just sort of going to play hand in hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You also, though, you could get things that inspire the illustrator to work. I put on something in the  chat right now for Stacey Manley, I think. Waldo Jackwith, who has access to Dali, put in a prompt  of product photograph of the Univac wrist computer made by Sperry Rand in 1967. It's in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitch chat if you want the link. Oh, the great example. Okay, I see it. I'm just moving it over  to the doc if that's helpful. Sorry, I should put it on the doc. No, no, no, no. I'm unable to view  this tweet because this account owner limits you. Yeah, they protected her tweets. Yeah. Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm honored. They protected her tweets. Yeah, you're privileged, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tell us how awesome it is, Jeff. Well, you'll just have to imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's sitting there again at the beginning of the show talking about he's just so every day,  yet he's got a theme song and he's got privileged tweets right here.  You already got a laminated card, Ant. Wasn't that enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Geez. Well, I'm excited to use Dali. Who knows how far and wide it's going to go and make impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's going to hurt anything myself. Just to be clear, I don't think it's going to hurt  anything. It's definitely going to help a lot of people out and it can even enhance some of the  stuff that we already have in place in that particular industry, in my opinion. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you'll see more illustration where you otherwise wouldn't have seen it, where people are now  putting up photos they don't have the rights to. I want to illustrate myself in a little blog post

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and this would be a wonderful way to do it. What I don't want to see is a bunch of board ape stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you know what I mean?  Don't worry.  No computer would make that. Only stupid males would make that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the style of board apes. That's your addendum to any query.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There were all these little 8-bit, it was kind of funny, all over Paris on the buildings,  there were just random little 8-bit drawings of different things. I was like, I wonder what those  are about. My child who at 15 is like, it's a bunch of tech bros in their NFTs.  It is destroyed 8-bit illustration for this person and possibly this generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's great. Hey, Stacey, tell us about what's the matter with Matter? Probably nothing is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  matter with Matter, but there's at least some Matter news and you wrote about it. Tell us a  little bit about Madam A and how it's getting ready for Matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Today, Amazon did their big developer event for developers. Sorry, for those doing it. I'm going  to say the name. If you have an Amazon Echo, this is a good time to mute it or to just  be prepared for things to happen. It's called Live. Basically, Matter is set to come out  sometime in the fall. We're seeing all these companies talk about like,  hey, we're launching this ahead of Matter. The big news for people who like smart homes  are that Amazon is setting up Alexa for what's called multi-admin. One of the big things people  are excited about with Matter is this feature called multi-admin. That means you could have  a Google and an Echo and a Siri and the app from the manufacturer and you do things once in one of  those places and they'll propagate to all of them. Then you'll be able to control your stuff from all  of those places, which is exciting. Amazon said if you name a device, whatever that name is,  it will propagate everywhere and your group names will propagate everywhere. They released an API  for that. They also announced something called the Ambient Home Dev Kit. I think it's the Ambient  Home Dev Kit. That is really cool because they're taking this proactive approach that they started  with hunches. I don't know if y'all use hunches. Do y'all use hunches?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. Not in a tech standpoint.  If you turn it ... Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh. If you have an Alexa to use hunches, if you turn it on, it'll randomly suggest things like it  had a hunch for me one day that like, oh, you're going to bed. Do you want to add your locks to  this routine or do you want to turn on your locks?  That's cool.  Lock your door. Right. It's proactive steps. With this dev kit, now other developers can  have their devices have hunches too, basically. They don't call it hunches. The only thing they  have right now is the stuff that I mentioned about naming for Matter and a home and a way.  So the home and a way will be like, some device will be like, oh, cranky. Stacey's away from home.  Maybe my Roomba device, if I've given it permission and they use this kit, this SDK, they can be like,  oh, you're away. Let's get Terrence, which is the name of my Roomba. Let's get your Roomba clean in  the floor right now. That'll be cool. I feel like there's some other stuff, but those are the two  cool things. And then they updated Thread for Matter, I think, which you may care about or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure. Go for it. Explain. Because you wrote about this too. You wrote about this too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I actually wrote stories this week. Amazing.  I know. Well, I went to Stacey on IOT and yeah, there were tons of stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's when you get stuff done is on vacation, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it was coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or refreshed coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like, oh. With Thread, basically Thread, if y'all aren't aware, it's a wireless low data rate  mesh network that is also IP enabled. Google actually was the birthplace of Thread. Tony Fidel  was like, hey, we should do Thread. And since Google had bought Nest, Google's like, all right,  yeah, we'll do Thread. So basically this update does two big things. One, it identifies what a  border router is. So Thread, you have all these low power nodes that can talk to something called  a border router. And that just basically the border router uses, it's plugged into a wall  and it talks to wifi and the internet. Yes, your individual Thread devices can talk out to the  internet, but it would be silly because it would suck a lot of power. So you just talk to your  border router. Anyway, this update basically says, here's how border routers are going to work.  Here's how you can add devices to border routers. Here's how all this stuff is going to happen.  And that's great because a lot of devices were coming online ahead of matter as border routers,  but they didn't work quite right in together. And it was kind of difficult for developers.  So this fixes that. Then it also makes TCP IP the primary way to get to talk to Thread,  or Thread uses TCP IP to talk to the internet. Beforehand, you could actually opt in or out of  that. And it was kind of a good pain. That's it. These are pretty nerdy, not exciting stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  **Matt Stauffer** We're here for the nerdism.  Here for the nerdy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  **Sylvia  We're here for the nerdism.  **Sylvia  So basically, promoted skills, like it would flash by and say, you can ping this service for blah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  blah, blah. I want to install it or want to add, I don't know. I don't have an echo device, but  something along those lines. And then you could add it from there or ads outside of the ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  **Sylvia I think it's going to be like, Hey, would you like to try the skill up?  And it's going to pop up on your show somehow or in the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  **Matt Stauffer** Yeah. Okay. So you either like that that space is being used like that or not.  One of the things we've been talking about on all about Android is the lock screen ads. I can't  remember if you covered this on this week in Google in recent weeks, but that there's a  possibility that somewhere in the future, that lock screen is going to turn into an ad.  **Sylvia We did discuss that briefly.  **Matt Stauffer** Yeah. So that kind of reminds me of that. And if when you're spending money on a  device, are you okay with the possibility that part of that device is going to be used to  display ads, given you've paid for the device. I could be okay with that if I knew I was getting  a deal on the device, similar to what they do with the Kindle and the kind of lower end Kindle's  subsidy, that sort of thing. **Sylvia Your lock screen is kind of,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a lot of people put photos and stuff on it. I mean, on your phone, we've historically,  when you take away my Kindle, who cares? It's not like I was using that for personalization,  but on your phone, I mean, I don't know anybody who doesn't have like some sort of highly  personalized something there. **Matt Stauffer** Right. Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  **Sylvia I don't like the idea of an ad on my lock screen, especially if it's no type of  subsidy with it. This is my device that I paid for, stop intruding on the dead screen like that.  Seriously. It's not even an app. It's just a terminal at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  **Matt Stauffer** Give me a way to disable. If you're going to do that, give me a way to disable.  **Sylvia There was no please, I noticed. **Matt Stauffer** No, there was no please.  **Sylvia No please from me. **Matt Stauffer** No please at all. Don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  **Sylvia Pretty or otherwise, not there. **Matt Stauffer** Although even when you're speaking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  firmly, you still got like that calm, kind of quiet voice going on.  **Sylvia Oh, he's calm. **Matt Stauffer** Yeah, the warmth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  **Sylvia Behind that calm. **Matt Stauffer** Just set up a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  **Sylvia Just do it. **Matt Stauffer** Just send it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do say thank you at least. I just didn't say please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  **Sylvia Right. What about Netflix here? So Netflix continues to slide a little bit. This is the  second consecutive quarter of losses. Lost 970,000 paid subs in the quarter. They expected to lose  two million, so they didn't lose as much as they didn't do as poorly as the poor they thought they  were going to do. So I suppose that's an improvement from really bad to bad. But yeah,  things are really rocky with Netflix. Netflix used to be kind of something you could count on.  It was pretty stable and now that stability is just kind of out the window. It seems like  they're fighting in a few different ways. **Sylvia They had to pay for all this content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They had to raise their prices by a lot. There's a lot more competition. I mean,  **Matt Stauffer** A lot more competition. **Sylvia That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  **Matt Stauffer** Isn't this the financial corner from what we talked about in the first segment  with Google? This kind of stuff is bound to happen with the economy being as crap-tastic as it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right now, right? **Sylvia That's true. This isn't an essential need streaming. And especially like  you mentioned, Stacey, there are a lot of competitors out there. **Matt Stauffer** There's  competitors. I think that's where it is. **Sylvia I think that's largely what it is too.  I mean, for the longest time, Netflix was one of the earliest to the game, largest catalog. I mean,  even remember in the beginning when they started the online digital streaming, the content that  they did have really wasn't that great. But the fact that they had lots of really not great content  was enough for people to buy into it and be like, well, I'm sure I can find something in here to  watch. **Matt Stauffer** Yeah, because they had a lot of old school gems in it, if I remember,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right? They had a lot of old school gems that tapped into that nostalgia side of you. Okay,  this is worth the $15 a month. Because isn't that what it used to cost? **Sylvia Well, it was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  $7.99. And originally it was like $7.99 plus you got a DVD in the mail. So you had it. **Matt

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stauffer** That's true. Right. **Matt Stauffer** Oh, DVDs. That was such a good day coming home and  opening the mailbox and finding a DVD in there in the little red package. There was a moment of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  delight. **Sylvia Well, we always had the aspirational Netflix plus the normal Netflix  and the aspirational one would just sit there and stare at you. **Matt Stauffer**

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So true. Maybe I should nail this back and free up that slot for something I'll actually watch. No,  I'm going to watch it one of these days. **Sylvia Well, I will watch it entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  **Sylvia I was going to say, I will watch this black and white film that is entirely in a foreign

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  language. Yes. **Matt Stauffer** I've heard that it's worth it. **Sylvia Is there... **Matt Stauffer**

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We hit peak subscription, right? 63% of all new subscriptions in the US go to Wall Street Journal,  Washington Post and New York Times. Everybody else splits all the rest. There's just a ceiling on it.  With so many competitors, as Stacey says, and some getting better, is there just peak?  It's always so much so big a pie that's going to get sliced up. Did they all think they could get

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  their pieces? **Sylvia Yes and no. So here's what I think is happening. I think the consumer is  gradually getting accustomed to paying more for subscription. So historically, you might be like,  well, I'm only going to subscribe to a couple of magazines and maybe a newspaper. So your  subscription pie was this big. And then maybe you add Netflix. So now we have a TV chunk in there.  So now your subscription pie is this big. And we're adding more, but that happens over time. So  you're fighting for an ever-growing pie, but Wall Street wants you to grow and take  100% of the growth of that pie. So I think what's happening is we're not tapped out exactly. We're  tapped out for the products available to us. And that will probably grow slower than anybody who's  trying to sell a subscription wants it to grow. Does that make sense? **Sylvia Yeah. Only time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  will tell. I was thinking the other day, I still pay for HBO and Showtime. I'm waiting for billions  and succession. I never watch anything else. I should get rid of it. **Sylvia Why don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  **Sylvia Yeah. I got to. **Sylvia You should be dipping.  **Sylvia And there's lots of services. Is it true? No. True Bill? There's a service that'll  actually monitor your subscriptions and flop it. It'll just be like, Hey, you're doing this.  Speeding subscriptions. **Bruce Every now and then I'll get a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  message in the family Slack that, Hey, so-and-so show is coming out next week. And that's basically  my hint to go and resubscribe to certain premium service, whether it's Showtime or something like  that. And they will binge right through it. And they know as soon as it's over to let me know so  I can turn it off because I'm not going to keep paying for it if it's a lot of unwatched content

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  out there. **Sylvia Yeah. When succession comes along, you must dip it. That's what you do.  Go ahead. Put that to the 80s. **Bruce That's not financial advice, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  **Bruce You must dip it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  **Sylvia Dip it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  **Bruce Dip it. Good. Let's see here. Oh, but before we kind of veer off of the Netflix train,  ad-supported tier is going to launch early 2023. So we started hearing about this very recently.  And now with the earnings, we're finding out this is going to happen relatively soon. Not all of the  content on the platform is going to be cleared for that ad model. It's going to cost less, of course,  than the current 1549 standard package that we have. So what is that? Well, that's a good question.  I think what I read was that it's going to cost less than. I think everything that I've heard is  that it's a fee, but you still get ads with it. So what is that? **Bruce That's no different from Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  **Sylvia Yeah, I suppose so. Well, actually Hulu has three. They have free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  **Bruce Totally free. Lots of ads.  **Sylvia Lots of ads. And no ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  **Bruce Yeah. Right. So Microsoft has signed up, not Google. Microsoft signed up with Netflix to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  their ad partner. **Sylvia That's because Google YouTube is competing with Netflix. And why would  you help enrich your. **Bruce Well, they were in the negotiations.  **Sylvia Well, no, I know. But I mean, surely that factored against them.  **Bruce Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  **Jay And then the other thing that got me thinking is this plan, you know, password sharing is another  thing that we've been hearing from Netflix for the longest time. They were okay with it. Hey,  we don't care if you share passwords. And then suddenly they care a lot. Now they're testing.  Hey, you know what? Times change, I suppose. It seems like a pretty obvious boogeyman, you know,  if you're losing money to say, hey, maybe we shouldn't be allowing you to share your passwords  after all. So I get it. They're testing charging users in Latin America with an extra fee when  sharing passwords outside of the primary residence. What this got me thinking is,  I've stayed in enough Airbnbs and hotels to realize now when you go to a place,  it's like there's a Netflix app installed and it's like log in with your account.  I wonder how this is going to affect that. That would be interesting. Am I going to have to start

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  paying for doing that? **Bruce Hulu already does this.  Experienced this with the hard head because he's on my Hulu plan or what have you. And he  went off to college that's umpteen hours away and it was like, no, you can't do this. So he  ended up having to create his own account because the home zip code was not close enough to his

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  geographic location. Hey y'all, I have to tell you, I have to correct it. Hulu doesn't have a free  plan anymore. We're old. So they only have an ad supported plan and a non ad supported plan.  Oh my God. And they also have basically cable. Good Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. It's a lot of stuff in their package offerings. At one time I was paying for the live  TV version without ads plus a couple add on things. And then I just started cutting stuff out and now  I basically just pay for their, what is it? It's just the ad free plan. It's not live. It's just  ad free. So I pay for that. But then in August I will re up and go back to the live TV because

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's when football starts. Oh, and they have ESPN. So you can add ESPN for seven bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And then they have the little package with Disney plus because yeah, yeah, I get Disney plus  for some kind of discount as well. Disney plus and ESPN plus. There's a lot of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two new businesses for Ant. I want them to be my customer service representative on my side.  And I want them to be my entertainment concierge. Dipping me in and dipping me out.  If you ain't watching it, cut it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's how it goes. If you're not watching it, just cut it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true. Yeah. It doesn't make sense to pay for it if you're not watching it. Absolutely.  And the system is designed to be friendly to your ability to cancel it and then re up. If it was  the old satellite like when we got DirecTV, it's like, sign up for the whole year. You could just  drop in for the month or whatever. That's one of my favorite things about these streaming services.  When the Olympics comes around, that's when I pay for the entire month for YouTube TV,  watch all the Olympics and then I don't need it anymore. Nice that you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cable used to do that too. Time Warner Cable used to do that to us with the whole  annual package or what have you. I'd have to opt out of that. It's like, no,  let me stay month to month. I would call them at the same time each year. Okay, you can go ahead  and kill this now. Because we'll just stream. And you'd have to actually call. You know what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd have to actually jump through some hoops to make that happen. And then they want to play

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  chicken with you. They'll want to play chicken with you and then offer you another free month  and this and that. And that usually keeps people on, but I'm am prudent. No, I know what I want.  Well, I know what I want. I know what I want. And I don't say please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unless it's tomorrow. In California, y'all are actually, it's actually very nice for y'all  because there's a state law that says if you can sign up on the web, you have to be able to cancel  on the web. Yes, that's right. Yeah. Everywhere should have this. When I wanted to cancel the  Wall Street Journal, I had to call and it was such a pain in the butt. And I was like, God,  if I only lived in California. Because they're like, I would like to cancel. You click on the  thing and they're like, call. Unless you're in the state of California, then click through here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you clicked it anyways, right? Just to see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I clicked it to see. And then I was like, Oh man, I need a VPN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right. I wonder if that would have solved the problem right there.  Right. Right. Probably not. But yeah.  Yeah. That's unfortunate. We're only going to give you the customer friendly solution  if we are required by law. Anywhere that we're not required by law, we're going to inflict pain upon  you. That is the way the world works, unfortunately. Unfortunately it is, but it's dumb.  It's dumb that it works like that. Can we do cats? I'm dying for some cats.  Okay, fine. Let's do cats. All right. From Qualcomm to cats. Tell us about the cats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Relax, Ant. Don't go away. It's not the music. I'm sticking around in.  Memories.  We're not doing that, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All alone in the moonlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what are we talking about? The Stray?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Talking about Line 67. Stray. So last week, Stacey, you missed this. I realized that I  should play some games since missed and I was looking for recommended games to get a sense of  it. Because there's a book you might really enjoy Stacey called Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's on my holds list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's good. It's very good. So, anyway, Leo suggested Stray and I thought, oh, I got all  excited, but it's not available on what I play with. But people were talking about it like crazy.  They're really enthused about it. But of course the people aren't the only ones enthused. Cats are.  Cats are watching Stray and the people are capturing lots of nice little videos. We have  something there on that story. Oh, really?  Of cats watching. It's on the rundown line. Whatever I said.  67. I think.  I know this is more complicated. We can't just go to Leo's machine.  Yeah. 67.  But if you guys could go to that one, it's fun stuff. I should have warned you. Okay. So yes,  if you scroll down a bit, you'll find a few examples of cats. There's one right there.  Oh, that's so cute. Go below. Wait a second. Go scroll down if you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't know this game was only 30 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does the cat get hurt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they just, they want to meet their friend, their cat friends.  If you scroll down to it. I mean in the game.  There this video. That's a good question. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like, like it's trying to walk into the game. Yeah. It's like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. That's so cool. I love it. Isn't that neat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know about neat. That cat should be smarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Kill the cat.  So it's becoming a genre. There's all kinds of accounts now of people looking at  cats watching stray, which I think is really cute. That's cute. Although if your cat has

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  claws and tries to do the paw thing at the screen, you know, might not be good for the  screen. Just saying. You might end up with some scratches. So you might, yeah, just be careful.  That's all I'm saying. It does look like a really cool game though. I have to say I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  very intrigued by it. I didn't even, again, I didn't know it was a $30 game. I thought it  was going to be some expensive game. I may look at this. I just have to reinstall.  Or you money bags.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, clearly. I wanted to play it and I got to buy it. How much does it cost to buy a PlayStation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeez. Oh yeah. Is it PlayStation 5?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot. Like 500. The GPU shortage is over. You should be able to find one easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true. Now that the crypto boys have run away. Since I'm one of two Windows people in the  whole Twitch studio, I'm fortunate to be able to play Steam on my computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  God, but you got to buy a game on Steam and that is like, you need like a master's degree to do  that. Good Lord. I like Steam.  I have to buy my brother's games on Steam and every time I do it, I'm like, okay, it's a process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Unless you're buying it for your brother, it's probably a lot simpler for him.  He just goes to the library and hit buy. Done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. That's what I'm like. I will give you money. Here's the cash. Use it towards this.  But then, you know, then I'm like, I'm like, did you ever get that game? He's like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  oh no, I used it for gas. And I'm like, oh, it went into the gas tank, went into a burrito or three.  That's how it is with my boys actually.  Yeah.  You need gas money, but you have to show up with in and out bags. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In and out is way harder than gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I remember that age. Priorities. Gas money takes a back seat to burgers. Let's be real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, speaking of food, yeah. You want to do a TikTok moment?  Okay. I'm game. This is a democracy. I don't know why you think it's anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  other than a democracy, Jeff. But I know, I know. No, it's a revolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  112. Now the problem is John may get mad at me because there will be some editing afterwards  because he does come up with some words once in a while. John doesn't do the editing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's going to be all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it'll be John is mad at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he defends the editors. He speaks on their behalf. So this guy is a monotone,  own growly chef and he reacts to TikTok cooking videos. You can listen to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I, yeah. I watch him. He's cranky. He's great. He's Jeff as a chef.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not impressed. He had me at the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, is this the salmonella gloves lady?  Now we're going to take this and cover it in some batter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want to make sure it's completely covered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What the actual?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Make sure you fill in the gap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I'd like to see him make one of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She just loves making things in the shape of buns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really easy to criticize from the sidelines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lidl.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I feel like he could be a lot more critical than he's being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm back.  It was for something that's inevitably going to look like she's being super delicate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, live stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He is not safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why?  No, he's not. Definitely not. Definitely not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's hilarious because some of these recipes are just awful and he'll say at the end,  three out of 10, I need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I need it.  I need to eat it.  Yeah, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's positive about like he's got the lunch-offs, which I think is actually kind of a fun TikTok  trend where you talk, you know, the lunch-offs where people who, I think it's probably people  who work in like construction and stuff. They're like, what did my wife or what did I pack for  lunch today? And they all like show off their lunches. Pretty keen on those.  Just like, oh my God, something on TikTok I haven't seen.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the answer is that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff. So if I say the phrase, he's an eight, but I don't have any clever thing, but  would you be like right there with me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But no, no, no. Okay. Let me, now I have to do it.  Let's see. He's an eight, but his online tech shows go on for three and a half hours.  What is it?  Got it.  Then he's a six.  In my book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whoa. We all just got demoted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we better not make this a four hour show then.  Please no.  Yeah. Don't worry. I got you. I got you.  Are we excited about wearables at this point? Are we, you know, kind of what's going on?  Oh, this is good for the show actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is good. You know why? Because the whole thing that makes Android Wear,  Wear OS, sorry, Wear OS, why Android Wear OS sucks so badly is because Qualcomm has not delivered  good silicon. So Apple's like pumping out these amazing chips going into the watch  and Android watches are still like 800 pounds, this thick. And if you don't have wrists the  size of like ants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're perfect for me. I just don't own one, but they're perfect for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So Qualcomm has finally said, and they said this, and you can tell Qualcomm knows  they're coming from way behind here because like on the call I did with this guy,  he mentioned that this was entirely new, entirely redesigned chip for the brand new Snapdragon  Wear 5 platform is what it is. And there's a plus, and then there's a smaller one for  kids wearables. Big things if you're a chip nerd, they're moving from 12 nanometers all  the way down to four nanometers for this, which is a big deal.  That's huge. Cool.  Yeah. And that's going to help you so much with battery life and size.  The other thing they're doing, and this I'm really excited about is they put a lot  into ambient mode. So you know like forever go and you get my newsletter, you'll read about  it this week. We're moving from like sleep and wake mode to a third liminal state. We're  calling ambient mode. And in ambient mode, you're basically going to have your sensors  and they're going to be always on sensing stuff. And then they'll wake up the processor.  Right? So this is going to save on battery life. Qualcomm is putting audio playback,  notifications, always on wake word detection, and a tiny little GPU on their always on processor  for their ambient stuff, which means you can do all that stuff without waking up the Bain  processor for battery. So that's going to be great too because the Google Android Wear stuff  was always so laggy. And so now they can have a really good processor, but it won't be stuck in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  your battery life the whole time. Yeah. They said 50% longer battery life compared to their previous  iteration, the Wear 4100 plus and 4100. So... Yeah, I have. Do you want the battery stats?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I actually have them right here. Let's see. You know, this all depends on what you do on it.  But for like just a Bluetooth fashion watch, they're saying it's going to be about 43 hours  of battery life. Oh, not bad. Yeah. Well, that's not LTE. An LTE watch is going to get you 54  hours and then a tracking sport watch will get you three days. But that's with like double the  battery than the Bluetooth watch. It's a 600 milliamps battery. That's impressive.  That is. Yeah. That's, I mean, we'll see. I mean, you know, their battery, but if you can get through  like a day or two for like an LTE watch, that's pretty good. I mean, I rarely, I just want to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  through the day and have plenty left over by the time I put it on the charger at night so that I'm  not cutting it close and having that like battery panic mode. You know, like, am I going to make it  to the charger? Because it is your watch after all. Yeah, it is your watch. And, you know, so that's  going to help. If it truly is that much longer of a battery life, I think that's a really big win.  Knowing that it's smaller, that's excellent. I think the one thing, and I talked about this a  little bit last night on All About Android is that the 4100 and the 4100 plus, like when those came  out, it was like, finally Android Wear gets its long awaited update, which it had been forever since  Qualcomm had updated the processors that were in watches at that time. This was what a year and a  half ago, let's say off the top of my head. And so they did the 4100 and the 4100 plus, and then  hardly any watches were launched with it. So even though Snapdragon had done this, you know, big  transformation of their wearable processor, no one was using it. So I really hope that we actually  see some output, some utilization of this chip on newer watches so we see some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I asked them about that. And that's why, like that block diagram I threw in there,  everything on there is new. They were like, yeah, no, they didn't directly say this, that nobody  wanted to use it because it wasn't compelling enough. But basically they got the message and  they were like, we're ripping everything out. And so everything's replaced the smaller, like  going down the process node with the four nanometers is going to really help too.  So the first watch will be out in August. It's going to be an Oppo watch. And then the first  Android, that's just the first watch using this. The first Wear OS watch is going to be Mobvoi  and it's going to come out later this year. Yeah. The Tic watch will have that W5 plus,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gen 1. Prior to that, the Oppo watch three, which is going to be a modified AOSP watch. So like you  said, not running Wear OS, but still, you know, a watch and still be able to get from all the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  charities. No. Just a little exercise thing, but it's not smart watch. No. I mean, I had one long

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ago and I'm not lusting after it. I'm just not. Yeah. I'm not missing it when I don't have it on

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  my wrist, to be honest. I would like to have audio playback on mine. Like I don't think the  church has audio playback. Well, when you actually say that, do you mean like to Bluetooth?  No, I mean actual audio playback. Like I want to stream it because I don't want to bring my,  like when I go out for a run, it's less so here because I can, it's colder here. So I have pockets,  but like beforehand, when I was in Texas, you know, you don't want to strap a smart watch on or a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sponed ear. Now arm. I was like, yeah, this thing right here. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you want your watch to have always connected ability, be able to stream from Spotify,  but connect to your Bluetooth headphones that you're wearing when you're out for a run. And  so you're just wearing your watch and your Bluetooth headphones. And that's it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. That's, that's what I would. Yeah. And that's only when I'm out for a run,  the rest of the time I can talk to my phone. I don't, you know, I'm not,  I don't need to be a, like a tiny ass phone on my.  But is that even possible?  Yes. You could have an LTE watch that streams Spotify to your Bluetooth. That's our watch. Yeah.  I think the Apple watch does that, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, I think the galaxy watch four can do that if you've got a,  you know, an LTE chip and inside of it. So yeah, there are watches that allow you to do that, but  yeah, that is nice to not have to bring the phone with you, not have that tether.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did we notice Stacey's very, very subtle nuanced sneak there of a bite of something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was, I was, it's ginger candy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was, it was, it was too late. It's, it's, it's a lot of the mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like, Oh crap. I bet I'm on the screen. I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You never know that Benito keeps you on your toes.  Switches to your camera right when you're eating the ginger.  We should give some props to fellow twit, Renee Richie. You know, he works for the goog.  He works for YouTube. He was hired by YouTube to be their second ever creator liaison. So he's  going to be working. He's still going to continue doing his channel, his YouTube channel. So that's  not going anywhere. He really wants to, from the article that I read, I haven't talked to him, but  he says that he wants to stay connected and close to the, you know, to the creator lifestyle,  to what it takes to be, be a creator, to create and actively do that on a regular basis. But he's  also going to be working with YouTube to, yeah, to be kind of a liaison between other creators and,  you know, inform them on how to do YouTube, right? All the different facets of YouTube,  that sort of stuff. So big time congratulations to Renee Richie. Smart hire by YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very smart hire. He's done a heck of a job. Yeah. Like Danny Sullivan at Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  search. You know, you need your back cuts to have people have faith in.  Speaking of which, has Matt been on one of the shows lately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not in a while. No, I reach out to him every once in a while and it just hasn't worked out. He is  genuinely interested. But yeah, it hasn't worked out yet. I keep trying. So I will keep it up.  We'll get Matt back one of these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been the recipient of a Jason email that says, Hey, you said no a lot of times to being  on the show. Maybe you're just, maybe it's just not a good time for us. Maybe we should stop bugging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, when I hear it interpreted like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true. I love it. I'm like, no, it's so nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, as a person who is booking lots of people on a lot of different shows,  the last thing I want is to continue contacting someone who is like, you know what? My life is  really busy right now. I appreciate it, but at a certain point it's kind of like, okay,  I'll save you the trouble. I'll save me the trouble. Is there a time down the line where  I can get in touch with you and maybe you'll be interested again or your life will be a little  bit easier. So hopefully it comes across like that. No, it totally does. I actually stole your thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I stole your wording for my own like, Hey, I don't want to keep bothering you. So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So just let me know. Yes or no. It's cool. If you can't do it, that's fine too.  I want you to feel like you have to do it. So yeah, totally. Well, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's okay. I'm just happy that it was interpreted well and not like,  geez, he's just nagging me to like, come on all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's so good that I who don't deal well with humans stole it. I was like,  Oh, this is a good way to deal with people. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. There we go. Right on. Cool. I'm happy that was helpful for you.  Let's see here. We've got lots of random stuff, but I feel like it's all really good stuff to  talk about. What about the FCC chair? Okay. They proposed the FCC proposed new US broadband  standards for the US long overdue in many people's opinions. What is it? 100 megabits per second up  20 megabits per second down. Is that? Flip that. Flip that. Opposite. Oh, is it? Is it? Oh, sorry.  20 up, 20 down. Sorry. We're still consumers more than creators.  Yes. Fair enough. Fair enough. What do you think? If this were implemented, is this enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but it's way, but basically the FCC is just like, I want to say they did the other standard  of 25, three. That was like, yeah, 25, three. Yeah. That was Ajit Pai, right?  Yeah. It was Ajit Pai. And at the time when they did it, we were all like, it should be 125. That's  what everybody who was in the world, like the tech world, people who were seeing the future of the  internet, that's what we all said. So like all the way back in 2015, we were like, you need like  100 megabits down. So seven years later we're here. That feels like the FCC speak in all honesty.  I mean, when we got 25, three, we were moving up from like seven something. I mean, it was really  like, it was bad. It was DSL. It was bad. And the reason it matters isn't for like the 90% of us.  It is for things like federal broadband rules. It's for things like the internet essentials  plan. So the FCC and various ISPs have plans for like people who can't afford internet.  Low income.  Yeah. This will set the baseline for those programs, both formally and informally.  And then it also helps determine which technologies make it. So satellite was a big reason we didn't go  25, beyond 25, three and getting 20 megabits per second up is going to be hard for satellite,  even SpaceX. So like it's a big deal.  What are they running now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are they running?  I don't know where they're up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  SpaceX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or Starlink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Starlink. Right. Starlink 50 to 20.  Is what they promise. But I don't know what they promised.  And then like three or four up. Yeah.  I'm sorry, up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Premium services. Starlink claims to provide between 150 and 500 megabits per second.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's it's not synchronous, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Claims to be. Yeah, I'm not seeing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does claim to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no. It claims to be 150 to 500. I don't know. I don't think that it's synchronous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because with satellites, I mean, with any internet service, you have X number of channels  that you can send your data over, right? Like X number of lanes. And most because we're a  consumption oriented society, we tend to allocate more lanes for download than upload. So that's,  it makes sense, but that's where you get like the super fast speeds as you're like,  I can give you 100 down, but only five up because I only have 21, five megahertz channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I want is an FCC or FTC standard for claims of high speed hotel internet.  I haven't been in hotels much in the last two and a half years, but  maybe they've improved, but I doubt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're ultra plans. We're at the best seven megs down. That's their ultra plans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. They're not going to let you stream Netflix for very long. Most of them, but I've actually,  I've actually been recording podcasts. I haven't done twig from a hotel because I'm not like you,  Jeff. I can't stay up till midnight doing. It's like, Oh no. But they're actually pretty good.  I've been doing Google meets and zooms and whatnot. So maybe, maybe the pandemic zoom era forced it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, it could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe there's not enough. Maybe it depends on the hotel. Yeah. Or the resort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Resort. Resort. What do you think we are? Rich aunt? We go to resorts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm looking at you and all of the, the mahogany books and stuff behind you. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I stay here. I'll be honest. I'm fancy. I, I resort it up and you know, most of us are going  to be resorting it up because most hotels are adding a lot of like resort fees, even if they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like, God help you restart hotel. Right. Yeah. And it's like 50 bucks and up per day for those

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  quote unquote resort fees. It's ridiculous. The FTC is looking at those pricing ways. They call it a,  what do they call it? Drip pricing. So in hotels are actually one of the places they're looking at  that right now. The FCC also did something. Rosenworcel in addition to broadband speeds  yesterday sent out a letter to 15 ISPs, mobile carriers, or people offering mobile services,  including the big four and for the big three and charter and Comcast and Google and Mint.  And it said, Hey, I would like to know how you're dealing with location data. Do you keep it? Do  you share it? What's the process? All of that. So she is a Rosenworcel has sent those out. Their  letters are due back from the carriers on August 3rd. So we hopefully we'll get some information  about how that's being handled. And this is related directly or I was about to say, not that  I'm excited that we took away the right to abortion, but it is forcing the tech industry  lawmakers and everyone to understand the data brokerage industry in ways that, you know,  I would like to have not given up my rights for, but you know, silver lining. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Looking for something, some somewhat of a silver lining anyways. Miss Stacey, can we go back to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the first part of this segment here? You said it's not enough to 100 down and 20 up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You said it's not enough. Yeah, but that's because I'm a giant broadband nerd. For many people,  it will be enough. But if you think about AKTV streaming, which does exist. Yeah. But which

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  are we going to assume the people that are on say the low income internet plan will have access

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to AK anyway? Well, I mean, who's to say? Maybe it's important for their job. I don't know. I  don't want to see the internet bifurcate by levels of income more than it already has. Right? Yeah.  I don't think that's, call me a utopian person. But anyway, the point is, I know,  me and my high hopes and naivete. The point is you can, I mean, like a family of four, like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what's your internet speed, Ant? It's not 100 megs, but I'm greedy. Well, yeah, but you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  probably also, yeah, you're probably also, you know, if you're doing actually sending

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  photography files, good. Lots of data back and forth. 500 megabits down was okay, but it wasn't  up to my standard, I guess. So I had to bump it up because everybody's in the house with remote  schooling and stuff like that. Yeah. So I don't, yeah, I think. If it wasn't for remote schooling,  I probably would have been okay with 500 down, but definitely not with remote schooling coming

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  into place the last two years. Well, and not that you want to set policy based on this, but if you  think about the data requirements of something like the metaverse, and I know, I don't know what  that's going to look like, but even things like telemedicine and like needing always on data.  And what I really would like to see is the FCC talk about things like resiliency programs and  then the quality of service you get. And should caps go away as well? Do you think caps should go  away? I have never thought caps made sense. They don't. I remember the argument several years ago,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what do you call them? The vendors would say, you know, we're trying to protect our network and,  you know, keep it stabilized, yada, yada, yada. These greedy people.  Right. So, but then when the pandemic hit, when everybody was at home and everybody was doing  remote work or remote school, you didn't hear one thing about the disability of the internet. You  actually heard those vendors say, you know what, we're going to give you a little more data, blah,  blah, blah, out of goodwill. And I'm sure everybody got their allotment and then some,  and there was no problems with the internet stability then. So why even have those? Why  not have the government come in and say, look, you need to stop all this. This is bad practice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, well, okay. So the ISPs want a scarcity model for broadband. They've never, like,  Intel wants a bigger pie model, right, for selling chips. They want more chips, more places,  more stuff that uses their network. ISPs hate that because they can't make money off the stuff  going over their pipes. They only get to make money on having the pipe available to people.  So by creating a scarcity model, they at least make more money the more you consume. That's all  that is. There's no, the additional costs associated with the network are not commensurate with the  additional costs of charging per gigabyte on a data cap, if that makes sense. They're completely  divorced from reality. And this wouldn't be a problem except we don't have competitive broadband  in the US. If we had competitive broadband, then you would go to a place that offers you good  broadband and no caps because the internet should be something, I mean, it's like water. It should  just, I mean, water is a terrible example because we're going to run out. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's information. Everyone should have access to information is what it sounds like you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And the services because they're essential for being alive today. I mean,  some countries have named the internet and broadband internet as a basic right,  as like a human right and all the power that that entails. We have not. But we should. I mean,  you can't get a job today without the internet. Yeah. Yeah. Totally agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay. What about, let's see here. Are there, oh, we need to do the change log.  Oh yeah. I was, so we forget. Do you wanna? Dang. Do you wanna? I know it is. Let's do the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sound the horns. Let's get in there. It's time. Don't panic. Here it comes. I promise you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here come the horns. Prepare yourself. There we go. Stubbed off their cigarettes and came in to pick

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  up their horns. Yeah. Sometimes you got to assemble the band, the orchestra.  Fine. I'll play your stupid song.  That was good. Thanks. Google Meet apparently adding, according to nine to five Google,  adding support for anonymous questions and poll responses. So you can run a poll out of your  Google Meet. That's kind of neat. I wonder how quick it is to spin up something like this. I  guess you can already create polls in Google Docs or in Drive rather, but now you'll be able  to integrate them into a Google Meet, take the temperature of the room. You know what? When I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  give talks on Zoom or whatever and the organizers will excitedly say, we could do a poll. And I say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  no, we're not. I mean, is that a complexity thing? It's kind of like we could, but that's  too much can go wrong. Or what is that? Stacey, you love data too. So duh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I just like, I like understanding my audience and what they want. If I'm going to  talk about, I often ask people, who has a smart assistant? Who's using these services? And  sometimes people are like, no one raises their hand. And then we're like, okay,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  move on to a different level. In my experience with polls, it's usually, I don't ask the right  question because people will complain about the questions that are on said poll. I just give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And sometimes you find out something really fascinating. Like, I actually was doing a thing  about privacy and smart devices. And I was like, how many of y'all have a baby monitor?  Or have kids that have a baby monitor and a bunch of people raise their hand. And I was like,  so how old do you think your kid will be? Lower your hand if you're going to stop it when your  baby is like, one, nobody really lowered their hand. I'm like, two, bunch of people lowered their  hands, three, et cetera. We had people like when I was like seven and eight, there's like a few  people who are like, still holding it up. So then we had like a really interesting conversation  because it really, so I don't know. That's cool. Okay. I love everything though. And Jeff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you hate everything. Look at his face. The perfect coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, how do you feel about this rebrand to Google Wallet? You know, we've been through  many iterations to get here. Who knows that this is the final destination, but nonetheless,  we're here right now. What do you think? It's another Google branding mess. I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mess. Do you care? I don't care. I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is different about it? I just got the email and I'm like, what, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's, I mean, as far as I can tell, it's kind of about the same. It's just now,  you know, first it was Google Wallet, then it was Android Pay, then it was Google Pay, then it was  Google Pay with Tez. Remember Tez? That was the thing. Then it's, you know, now it's back to  Google Wallet. But if you're in a store and you're paying, it's still, it's still Android Pay when  you're, or Google Pay. No, it's Apple Pay. The second I throw out, I pull out my phone, they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  like, oh yeah, we have Apple Pay. Yeah, we have Apple Pay. Yes, totally. Yeah. Right. Right. And

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you just kind of go along with it. You're like, yeah, okay. Yeah. So it's just, it's just confusing  more than anything that I don't even see wallet on my phone. I have GPay. Yeah, that's it. That'll  change. That's it. That'll change. It's starting to roll out. Yeah. Okay. It's starting to roll out.  So your GPay is going to turn into Google Wallet essentially. And I think, you know, they've even  updated the app. So you're going to get some material you and dynamic theming if you care  about that. About dark mode, Jeff, but there you go. So yeah, I still have GPay for now.  Yeah. I still have GPay as well. I have not got the update. But it matters not because that phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is going bye bye anyway. It matters not to me because I can't put my credit card on it.  Still? You can't put it in? Oh really? My credit card still doesn't go on it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you tried lately? Cause I had the same problem and then it got better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? It's gotta be the bank, right? Yeah. It's the bank. Oh, so can I, can I,  can we just do a slight detour here? A Jeff complaint moment. So trying to get Jeff to play  games, try to make me a happier person. So the recommendation was made to use Stadia because I've  got my Chromebook, right? Oh yeah. So guess what happens? Guess what happens? Did they kill your  subscription? Can't use it appears because I am a workspace. Oh, G-Sweep, G-Sweep, workspace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You got in there right at the tail end of that Stacey. You got it. I'll give you points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cute and sad trombone. I saw where this was going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sad trombone sound. Yes, you're right, Anthony. Geez. Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the club, to a discord last week for you, Mr. Jarvis, I don't know if you're able to look back  at that, but a lot of people were sharing different games. Yeah, there were. And I was,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was looking forward to trying some of these things and then I got some good recommendations  on Stadia. There's one I wanted to play. So I couldn't figure it out. I couldn't figure it out  while we're on the show. I brought out another Chromebook and I signed onto a different account  to my, to a Gmail account I never use and sure enough, go right into Stadia. So I presume that's  what it is. Son of a. It gives me a point. It doesn't say sorry schmuck, you can't do this.  It just gives me a 403. It'd be better if it said sorry schmuck than I know what's going on.  But no, I've got to figure it out for myself. Go, go! Thank you for this little.  I needed to get this off my chest. I love those rants. It's just the gift that keeps on giving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. I should clarify really quick. I should clarify. ScooterX pointed out and corrected me in  the chat room. Google wallet is a separate install. So GPay you could still have on your device.  And then you also have to install Google wallet, which I don't know if that's any better because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Now tell me what each does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. It's a really great question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ScooterX, what does one do versus the other one now? I'm confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, Google wallet is supposed to be where you keep all of your.  Everything, right?  Everything. Your card. That's where GPay operates out of, is supposed to operate out of.  You keep your COVID card. Your, what is it? Your.  E-tickets.  Yeah. Your E-tickets, your loyalty cards, all that stuff is supposed to be held in your wallet,  the Google wallet, right? GPay was the place where stuff like that was kept, right? Now,  my understanding is that GPay is going to continue being a money management  app because you know how Google also kind of created that as part of GPay. Like also,  you know, we're kind of like mint. We analyze what you do. Blah, blah, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So I need to search that and get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Play. Yeah. You can dump that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google wallet. Guess what comes up? Google Pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Pay for now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. For now. There's a link that ScooterX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They plan on the migration then. I guess that's what it is. Cause I keep stuff in that,  that GPay thing. It's freaking useful for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Credit cards. Well, isn't it also where you put your like plane tickets and stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Like my airline stuff's there. The tickets that I buy for  venues or events or whatever that they're in there. It's useful. And then of course,  the tap to pay is already there too. So confusing though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You see, I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leadership at Google. Outstanding leadership at Google.  So your bank is not liking you. Who's your bank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's not. It's apparently saying, okay, now I've got to set a screen lock. I have a screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  lock. Oh my God. We can. Sure you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure you do. Choose a new screen lock. Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is when you're supposed to call in on Saturdays or Sundays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're going to have your credit card on this thing. So it wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I have my finger. That's my screen lock is the fingerprint. The thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, well it asks you if you want to enable biometrics. Just say yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't say that. No, no, it doesn't say that. Oh, boy.  None. Swipe the tatter pin password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody threw up the, the, the tweet bug. So the tech guy can  reach out to Mr. Laporte. Mr. Jarvis here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When Leo Laporte returns from his cruise, he will don his tech guy cap and get in touch with you  and see if he can troubleshoot. Okay, you stupid person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what? We should just have Jeff. Jeff has tech problems. And then that could just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no. Tech has Jeff problems.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Good reframing. There we go. That's what it is right there.  Google docs, getting some notifications that will alert you when there are additions or removals.  So you can be notified essentially if someone makes a change into the doc.  I feel like that seems like that's already kind of there.  No, or maybe. Because I had to turn it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because any time I, you know, turned a story on an editor, I'd get like 8 million and I'm like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jesus, no. Every once in a while,  someone will make a comment in the doc and I definitely get an email that says so and so  commented in the doc. And this is never remark resolved.  Well, this says, so these are notifications settings. So maybe it's kind of expanded around  this notification settings. You can choose to get all comments, comments for you, none of them,  get notified for added or removed content. Maybe that's the chain. Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know what the changes are. I thought so too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This thing sounds like I, yeah. All right, next.  Go home, go get you drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's probably some sort of change, but apparently not that monumental.  YouTube reducing its content ID appeal process down to seven days from 30.  So does that matter for you guys?  It's a good question. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  how does it matter for me? Because whenever I appeal something, it's been pretty quick with

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the, yeah. I feel like those things are resolved pretty quickly.  Yeah. That's because you don't say please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are we still off because of Paddington Bear? Are we still off because of Paddington Bear?  I'm pretty sure of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't know if that got resolved or what I honestly have not checked back on that episode.  That's the thing with podcasts. After like a week and a half, they're the kind of history.  I hate to say. Podcasts that deal with news. It's kind of like in the past and everybody who's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  going to see it is kind of seeing it. What? We have all of our grand performances,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  our best hits. There's always a small group of people who like y'all so much that want to  hang out with you. They will listen to back episodes. They will go back in time.  Y'all are amazing. And also we're sorry. We love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least we continue entertaining you. It's nice to know that we can do that.  Let's see here. Google Photos. Oh, so if you ever take screenshots and they end up in your Google  Photos photo reel, now Google Photos is going to help you find those. And I guess you can delete  them or get rid of them. So you touch and hold the app, then lift your finger. If the app has  shortcuts, you'll get a list. Touch and hold the shortcuts, slide the shortcut where you want it,  lift your finger and that will have, oh, that has a view screenshots bloop thing. So yeah.  Okay. So it's basically on the icon, on your home screen. If you touch and hold the icon,  you know how you get that little menu that pops up if you ever use that feature. Maybe you don't  use that feature. I don't really use it very often, but if you do, you'll be able to jump  right to your screenshots. And I suppose that's neat. Now next, here's the story of the week.  Here's the story of the week. Chrome OS is now Chrome OS.  Yes. Yes.  Branding, branding. Yeah. They just removed the spaces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I bet you they did not consult Dolly with that. They sat down with another person to discuss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You wouldn't do Dolly, that's Image. You would do GPT-3 because that's words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  GPT-3. I do love playing with, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, you're going to like Dolly too. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I didn't say I wouldn't. It's Ant who's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute. I said what? It's Ant who says he hates Dolly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When are they going to virtualize tech punditries who don't know what they're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're just going to be... Oh man. I could see it happening though.  Somewhere in the house. I have a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People talking about Elon Musk's Twitter bid. I want a woman, two men, and I want it done in the style of  Walter Cronkite. Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Done in the style of The View. I'd love to see that actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh gosh. The View. So it's now Chrome OS.  Not Chrome OS. Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chrome OS. Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. It was Chrome OS.  More time than it deserves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. All right. Fine. That's the Google change log. Roll the credits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There we go. Jason, I had faith that you would keep this show on track and you are not living up to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fine. I'm doing the best I can. I feel the pressure to make it longer, but what can I say?  How about we get to Pixel... You want to get to your waffle.  I understand. You want to get to your waffle. I'll get you there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, we haven't gone over the three hour mark. So I'm still... I mean, we're at two and a half?  We're doing good. At this point, we're at two. We started two hours ago. So we're doing okay.  Yeah. So we're doing okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. So is there anything that we've missed before we get into picks, tips, tricks,  all that kind of stuff that you all want to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The sad battery. Stacey and I are excited about the same story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the same battery. Tell us about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know about it. I was just, I saw the sad battery and I was excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's all kinds of efforts to try to store energy, obviously, and ways. My friend Bill Gross  from Idea Lab has one we've talked about the show of moving concrete blocks up and down.  You move them up and then when you want the energy, you move them deck down. And the way  Bill explains it is that the way this was primarily done was moving water up into reservoirs and every  possible place on earth, fewer now that we have less water, had been used. So we went to blocks.  So now these entrepreneurs say that sand holds on to heat for an amazingly long time. So they  create basically just a silo of sand and they heat it and it'll keep it over days. And you think,  well, that's a lot of energy wasted. You heat up the sand and then the sand through an exchanger  goes reverse. But they say, no, it actually holds onto the heat for quite some time and  has minimal loss along the way. So I found sand batteries fascinating. That was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is fascinating. And we need progression or innovation in the realm of battery technology.  Yeah, big time. So it was always right beneath our feet and we had no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We could watch Emanuel the Emu on TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Excuse me. I did have one, Line 59, a Tesla AI boss. How about that?  Is that good news? Is that bad news? Line 59, Tesla AI boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You took us back to Tesla. Okay. All right. Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the AI boss was on leave for several months, I believe, but now they have resigned from Tesla  because there's been fatalities with the autopilot and so forth. So with this  leave gone, is that good news or is that bad news for Tesla?  I'd say that's bad news. That doesn't sound good to me.  I mean, they're getting rid of the leadership and ready to bring in someone else. Is this something  that Tesla is going to continue to work on going forward or just let it go and just say,  you know what, forget this autopilot stuff because we're not ready for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Man, I'd be really surprised if Tesla made that sort of about face on autopilot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because somebody has an ego at the top of that food chain. So I know that's not happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what to say about that. Yeah, that seems like definitely a big  reason for things to slow down at the very least. If you don't have the visionary at the top of the  chain, it's going to take some time to build the trust around that. And I don't know what that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  leads to from a productivity standpoint, but yeah. I wonder how important it is that feature. I wonder  how important it is for people that are potential Tesla buyers. Are people buying Tesla's strictly  because they want the EV? Are they buying it because they want the status and the bells and  whistles? What is their customer base like? Because some people buy a Honda. A Honda is a sensible  car and economical from a petroleum standpoint. But then you have people that want to buy the  BMW for the status and the Mercedes for the status, even though those are very, very nice cars  from an engineering standpoint. What is it like for the Tesla crowd? I don't know. I just see them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  everywhere over here. Yeah. And you're going to see more of them. With all of the energy stuff  in flux, Tesla has been increasing the prices of their vehicles in the past couple of months  because demand has been so high. I feel like in a couple of months. Oh yeah. Could be because of  a gap. Yeah. I think it's largely about that. I should also mention that we are on the waiting  list. We're waiting for the Tesla Model Y. My wife really wanted to get a Tesla. We got solar on the  house. What's that? My neighbor has a Y. Yeah. I mean, I actually fit in the Y, which is one thing.  I don't fit in a lot of vehicles because I'm so tall and the Y has the kind of taller cab.  We test drove a lot of electric vehicles and at the end of the day, it was like, you know what?  This fits us better because my wife's also very tall. We got solar on our house about a year ago  with the expressed intent of someday getting an electric vehicle. And so before the prices started  jumping, we were like, let's just put the order in. We're still having to wait until November,  somewhere between November to January. And we put our order in probably two and a half,  almost three months ago. You don't have to answer this if you don't want to, but this was a decision

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you all made because you just wanted something that's more economical, not because of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  autopilot potential. Right? Oh yeah. We did not pay extra for the autopilot. If we had paid extra  for the autopilot, which I think was another 12 grand in order to get that package, we'd be getting  it a lot sooner. We get it a lot sooner. Tesla, they definitely scale who gets what first based on  the amount of extras that they're willing to spend. And that's the biggest extra you could get. If  you get that, you're probably going to get it. I don't know how it is now, but back when we were  ordering, if we had gotten that, we probably would have got it within a couple of months.  But instead we're waiting because we didn't get that. It's kind of like our punishment

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for not trusting Tesla and their autopilot. Could you upgrade to that or that's a capability

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to just stop there? That's a good question. I believe that you can upgrade to that, but I could  be mistaken on that. I guess I haven't really looked into it too much because I'm just kind of  not that interested in it, to be honest. That doesn't matter that much to me, the whole self-driving  aspect. I don't really care. For me and for us, it's purely about kind of cost savings, like knowing  that we can pull the power from our solar and not have to pay for gas as much as we are right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I chose a Tesla because I think it's fun to drive.  And it's fun to drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's part of it too. My wife has said a number of times in the past couple of months,  she never in a million years imagined buying a vehicle like a Tesla because it kind of has  a flash factor to it and everything. But when she drove one, she was like, you know what?  This car drives the way I want a car to drive. And finally at a point in my life where I  can buy a car that I actually really want and kind of spoil myself a little bit, let's do it.  And I was like, all right, let's do it. Did you try the other electrics?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Drove a few of them. And I just, yeah, the, yeah, drove Leo's vehicle.  What is that? That is the Mustang, right? The Mach-E. And that was nice. I definitely fit into  it. There was just something about, I don't know, there was something about the experience that I  couldn't, it wasn't very tangible, but I was kind of like between that and the Y, I think that was  probably the two that I was considering most from my perspective. And there was just something about  the experience and the Y that I enjoyed better. There's something about the styling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't answer this either, but did you and your wife have any discussion about, yeah, what about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Elon? Yeah, you know what? We honestly have not really had much of a discussion about that. I mean,  I've had that, I've tossed that around in my head because I don't know how closely she's necessarily  following the day-to-day machinations of what Elon Musk is doing. I certainly do. And there's a part  of me that has kind of negotiated that internally. And at the end of the day, I'm kind of like, you  know what? I may not approve. Steve Jobs is approved too, but yeah.  I mean, yeah, I mean, the company is bigger than just Elon. I actually know some people who have  worked at Tesla and who do work at Tesla. And I know they're great people. And so,  to an extent, am I supporting Elon by getting the vehicle? Sure. But I'm also supporting a lot of  really great people as well. So I don't know. That's how I'm justifying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've sat in the Y and I've also sat in that Mach-E. And in my experience, that Mach-E definitely feels  more like a fighter jet cockpit when you sit in it. And the Y feels more like a sensible car.  Yeah. It was just comfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. It's a good way to put it. There was something about the interior styling of the Mach-E  that just didn't work as well for me compared to the Tesla. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is the Y the goal? The doors that attacked Lisa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. No, thankfully. Thankfully, yeah. Our neighbor has the Model X and we have  borrowed it from time to time and it has the goal wings and I hate them. I can't stand them.  They're so unnecessary and dumb. Just give me suicide doors, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Give me suicide doors, not those. Suicide doors?  I don't even know what suicide doors are. What is a suicide door?  Man, y'all need to look up a 64 Lincoln Continental or as we call it, Stankin' Lincoln.  And it's a four-door car. Yeah. And they open up that way.  Yeah. Oh yeah.  Yeah. They open away from each other. Why are they called suicide doors?  I have no idea why they were called suicide doors.  I don't like that name. But I want to say the, I want to say Rolls Royce has suicide doors as well.  Yeah. I don't think any of us are getting a Rolls anytime soon. So.  No. Next year we'll have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. Well, good for you.  They are called suicide doors. Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can search. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could dream. I don't know.  I don't know why, but yeah, one of my favorite cars is a Lincoln, a 64 Lincoln Continental. Just a  beautiful tank of a car and then it's got suicide doors on it. Just, just a little bit of extra

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  touch on it. Love it. Wikipedia says they're called that primarily because they are perceived  as being less safe than a front hinged door. Oh, that's interesting. Didn't know that.  Wikipedia says. Yeah. And today I learned.  Wikipedia knows all. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were in the rear edge. So if the vehicle was moving and they sprang open, anyone who grabbed  to stop what that happening was whisked out of their seat into the roadway. Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's wow. That's nobody wore seat belts back then.  Nobody wore seat belts, but if someone wanted to give me a 64 Lincoln, I'd take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A working 64 Lincoln. I'd take it. Oh, a working working. You gotta be picky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Did you ever read that book? I told you to read.  I'm just now about to finish Clara and the Sun.  Don't get cranky about that. It's called Blacktop Wasteland and it's about a getaway driver.  And I swear there's a 64 Lincoln in that book. Blacktop Wasteland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You gotta read it, man. I will add it to the queue. I will add it to the queue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you. It's like Ocean's 11 meets drive, says the synopsis on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice. I see that. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you. Right on. Let's do tips, tricks, things, all that stuff. We are nearing the end of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  episode. Gotta keep us on track. Let's bring some tricks at the end of this show. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Something along those lines, I suppose. Jeff, what you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, what should I do? Oh, geez. You're going to me first. Oh, no. Okay. Why not?  Just to keep me off my rocker. So Old Country is a novel and a Netflix deal that came out of Reddit.  I think it's pretty cool. Matt Query was in R slash No Sleep, which were first person horror stories.  His thriller My Wife and I Bought a Ranch was so engrossing, says the Washington Post,  it led to a book deal and a Netflix adaptation. It comes out July 26. And early reviews are  comparing Query's writing alongside his brother co-writer Harrison Query to horror masters  Stephen King and Paul Tremblay. That's great. I love that. I won't be doing it, but I love  that it came out of Reddit. I think that is an indication of where we go here is that these are  ideas that couldn't have gone through the gauntlet of publishing houses, which I'm trying to go  through right now, and wouldn't have stood out or it was just a simple little story or an idea and  somebody saw the potential in it. And that kind of finding new talent and collaboration is what  excites me most about the internet. So yay to the Query brothers. That is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How cool to write something and post it to a Reddit forum and end up with a book deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could have made my thing, Emmanuel the TikTok emu, but you would love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just an emu that tries to steal somebody's. Yes, I've seen it. It's not that funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You might also enjoy a history of user interfaces, but I think that don't bother.  No, that would be fascinating. All right. All right. If you insist,  they see can blame you for her hunger. So it starts with the Xerox Alto.  What's the line? It's in my stuff. It's in my things. It's line 165. There we go. You got it.  So dive in, which just scrolls up. Starting with the Alto, it doesn't have CPM. It doesn't have  Chrome, but it has Alto Xerox Star, Lisa. Oh, cool. But you can see, you know,  get the images, which is nice. This is much better than Emmanuel.  Yeah, I agree. I agree. This is much better. Emmanuel would irritate you. That's the whole point.  The honest here. Fair enough. Windows 1.0, 1985. I was brought along to interview Bill Gates  when Windows came out because the editor of People magazine was going to write the profile  of him being the 24 of the 25 most intriguing people had no idea what computers and laptops  and things were. So I had to explain, I had to do like a simultaneous translation between Gates  and him at Windows coming out. Wow. What it meant. That was it. This is cool. I love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is awesome. Very, pretty sweet. Very. That's what I love about it. Right on. Thank you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey, what you got? All right. This isn't out yet, but I've talked to the creator.  I think it's really a cool idea. It is whoosh, W O O S H, air. There was a Kickstarter, but now  it's just the whoosh system. And so what this guy has done is he's recognized that air filters,  the things that you stick in your house when you have an air conditioning thing,  the biggest cost associated with them is actually shipping costs because you have to put their big,  they're not heavy, but they have to be protected and whatnot. So he was like, why don't we  create a filter that is replaceable and can be mailed in like a flat,  not a flat pack, but like a puffy pack. Oh, cool. A puffy baler. No cardboard box.  That takes down the cost. Now what's interesting is once you have a filter that stayed like the  filter screen part stays in place, you can add a lot of sensors to it. So they've added an air  quality sensor. They've added some pressure sensors for air pressure in your vents. So you  can start doing like information about how well your air is moving. And so the guy who did this,  his name is Winston Mock. He's a former Googler and he's trying to work like their goal is to  become a data company, not to make this stuff, but they're working with other companies who you  probably have heard of in this space and with smart, like HVAC companies. And the idea is that you  can create a smarter HVAC system without like, without like putting all your vents, you know,  you know how people are doing like vent covers and stuff like that. So I thought this was a really  kind of cool idea for a bunch of reasons. One, I've seen people try to attach sensors to air vents  and it sucks because then you throw that away and there's now electronics plus the big bulky air vent  thing. So that replaces that. And then you get like good data about like how well your air's  performing in your home. So that's it. You don't have to go buy these things. They just ship them  to you. So that's this, this is kind of more like instead of a thing, it's more like a company. Oh,  look, David wrote that I wrote about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  May I do an addendum to my earlier? There's a Twitter account at cats watch stray. So if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  get into that folks, I thought it was going to be that entire account of that. No, no, I didn't,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't do it. I listen to democracy. I listen to the will of the people.  There is however, the first one in the Twitter account is a dog, but you know, so much for holding

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to the concept. Of course. There's always one messing it up. One dog. So much cooler than all  the cats. Right on. And what you got? For me, my picks are fairly quick. First up, Adobe Max. We've  talked about that in the past. The registration is now open. Adobe Max is going to be on October,  I believe it's 18th through the 21st. I don't know if I will be there covering it or not.  I'd like to be, but we'll see. It's going to be live or virtual because they had a virtual last  year. So they're going to give you a virtual option too. If you can't attend, they're still  working out all of the speakers, but I believe they got a bunch of them pretty much squared away  and just still finalizing a handful left. But go to max.adobe.com and register to hang out at the  Creator Conference. I love it. I love being there and seeing the people and learning some things too.  Next, we're talking about birthdays and pre-shows. And this is a bit of a shout out  to a friend of mine and an actual former Google employee, but she's still back in Charlotte,  my friend Tamika. Her son is playing, he plays football, rec league football, the league football,  and they did their little fundraiser. And I told her I would mention it on the air because I believe  in the little league fundraiser and the little league sports, especially in the black community,  because it gives a lot of kids some guidance and some leadership and sometimes a little kick in  the butt that they may need that they're not getting at home. So I will always advocate for  that. They've already met their goal, but you can still donate to it, buying a bag of popcorn or  something like that. The popcorn people get half of the funds and the football team gets the other  half and it's good because they can use the support. I've worked on these little league teams before,  and I know how difficult it can be because a lot of times what you end up doing is helping to provide  a spot for a kid that their parents couldn't afford to be on the team.  My kids, they both played rec ball, didn't have a problem getting them on, but there was a couple  times where I had to come out of my pocket to help pay for another kid to be able to play that.  I know one of the playing was a good kid and it's just unfortunate his parents couldn't afford it.  And fundraisers like this help keep the coaches from coming out of their pockets like that,  and plus help provide some decent equipment and things like that. So  link will be in the show notes and happy birthday to Mika. And lastly, just follow me on Instagram,  anti underscore Pruitt. I've been having fun playing with Instagram,  playing around with the whole video versus photography thing on there. And that algorithm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  has been quite fascinating, quite fascinating. You have a new headshot too. Did you take that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of yourself? Oh, that's good. I liked that. Yes, sir. I did. I was like, I need a new headshot.  And I've just been lazy with getting it done and I finally shot it and put it out there.  It just needs to be updated. Thank you. Yeah. Looks sharp. And you did that all by yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You didn't need a camera person to come in. How do you strike that like authentic like spur of  the moment? Like, you know what I mean? Sometimes it requires the camera person to kind of like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  pull you out of your own head. I just sit there and hit the button and say, all right,  okay, does this look okay? And I have my camera tethered to the computer so I could see what the  camera is going to produce. And so I'll take probably 20 shots or so. And then I'll stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you'll run it through Dolly and say, give me the perfect version of this shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it will return. It already is, sir. Yeah. I can do nothing more. You nailed it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Andrew. You win. Meanwhile, mine will be Stacey. Pick a better shot. Thanks, Dolly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my pick is just something that I thought was kind of cool. Apparently there's now a logo,  sorry, a Lego kit for the Atari 2600 console. I guess, what is it? It's the 1977 debut. So  this is the 1980 revision of the console that comes with just shy of 2600 pieces. It's 2532  pieces. Oh, really? Come on. I feel like they could have like, yeah, I feel like they could  have boosted that somehow. That would have been perfect. But anyways, kind of cool looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, these engineering minds around, they could have come up with that math, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, they were that close. They could have done something. Let's be honest.  But it's going to be available August 1st, $240. So a little pricey, but very cool for the video  game nerds out there. And actually on the inside, it's like, it's not a fully functional console or  anything to my knowledge anyways. But if you open it up on the inside, it's a recreation of like a  1980s living room. I don't know. It's super nerdy, but I love it. It has a couple of cartridges that  you can put into it and everything fits the cartridges. Wait, does the living room have the  faux wood paneling? It looks like it has wood paneling to me. I mean, they're brown Lego pieces.  So yeah, it looks like it has someone playing a keytar and a CRT monitor and a boombox and  all the things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a little phone that's apparently, no, I guess that's how big phones were.  It looks a little big, but I'm like, no, actually I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they were pretty gigantic. Yeah, that's a pretty large phone. Yeah, that's a pretty large  one. And actually the joystick that you build as well actually moves. So it's not static. Like  you can actually move around the joystick and stuff. So it's a dynamic joystick.  Wow. I mean, it moves. I don't know if it does much more than that, but it's still pretty awesome.  I love it. Hey kids. What's that? What is that? I don't understand. What is that, Jeff? That thing's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  fancy. It has the little cordy cord. It's talking PBX too. From the museum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. Somewhere a number of years ago, we acquired a phone that looks a lot like that and it became  like a toy for the kids, like for them to pretend. That's what those old phones are good for now.  They're good for being toys. That's a thrift storage in my dear sir. Yes, indeed.  Yes, indeed. All right. That's it. We've reached the end of this episode of this week.  Always so much fun hanging out with you. Nice work, sir. Nice work. Thank you. It's a lot of fun.  Stacey, what do you want to leave people with?
