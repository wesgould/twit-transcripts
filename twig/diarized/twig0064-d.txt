It's time for Twig This Week in Google.  And today it's actually going to be This Week in Facebook and Microsoft as well.  Anything that happens in the cloud, we talk about it here.  And unfortunately, I have some very sad news.  Gina Trapani is on vacation.  She's actually like literally not going online during this vacation, but she has nominated  in her place.  I'm very glad to have her.  The wonderful Jennifer van Grove from Mashable.com, Jay Bruin on Twitter.  Hi Jennifer.  Hello.  I'm from San Diegan, but now San Franciscan.  Good to have you also with us as usual.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York where he teaches journalism.  You may remember him as a TV reviewer for, was it Us Magazine or Entertainment?  How dare you?  People Magazine and Entertainment Weekly.  Entertainment Weekly and People Magazine.  You got a memory lane.  I don't know.  It's amazing.  I love those.  I love those trash magazines.  What's TV?  I love TV.  Also, glad to have you.  He's the author of the book which gives him great credibility.  What Would Google Do?  We never know what Google will do next, but if you wanted to know, you would read that  book.  Finally, last but not least, and his forehead is not scarred.  It just looks like it is Robert Scoble who apparently has burned out some.  You know Robert, you just did the laser thing.  You burned out more pixels.  Did I really?  Yeah.  Awesome.  Now it's not just your forehead, it's your cheek.  You got to sit and burn out the rest of it.  No, no, no, no.  Is that a red laser?  It's a purple one.  Purple.  It's pretty.  Purple one from Warren Laser.  The ones that are illegal are the green ones, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because they're very bright and the human eye sees green very well.  So the light scatters off the atmosphere and pilots really don't like seeing those things  aimed at their eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why Waz of course uses nothing but green lasers.  Which I will take advantage of that to mention that Waz will be joining us in a couple of  hours.  We're going to start a feature interview show right after our Tech News Today show with  Tom Merritt.  Tom and I will interview big names.  Next week, John Perry Barlow, one of the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  But this week, Waz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John was a lyricist on the Grateful Dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, he was.  Do me a favor with him.  I know he gets a little bit embarrassed about it, but have him do a partial dramatic reading  of his Declaration of Independence for cyberspace.  I will.  We will have that on tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Thank you, Jeff, for reminding me.  It's such a seminal document.  I know you did your own version of it on your blog.  But it's just great.  Yeah.  BuzzBudgetshen.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's over the top, but I don't care.  Have him do it over the top.  A dramatic reading would be fun.  Has he ever done that before?  I don't know that he has.  He really should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's got a great voice too.  It'd be really good.  Yeah.  All right.  Deal.  Remind me, Eileen, dramatic reading.  Internet villain rights.  So Waz is coming up.  We've got questions for Waz.  We're still taking them via Twitter.  Use the hashtag Waz on Twitter.  Now let us get to work.  I'm in the middle of security now a few minutes ago, and Eileen, my producer, comes running  in and says, quick, there's a streaming Facebook press conference with Microsoft.  And I thought, oh my God, it's finally happened.  I don't know what.  Something.  You know, anytime Microsoft and Facebook.  Facebook brought Microsoft.  Yeah.  Well, Microsoft owns 5% of Facebook.  They got a good deal.  They put $240 million in.  It's worth probably twice that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody made fun of them.  $15 billion.  How ridiculous.  And it is double that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  Yeah.  The valuation that Microsoft's purchase gave them made it $15 billion company and everybody  agrees it's 33 or more now.  Nice move, Microsoft.  And Facebook has done a deal in some odd way with Microsoft.  According to the press conference, Mark Zuckerberg was there along with Chi Lu, who's the search  guy at Bing, and they're going to add, and by the time you hear this, probably it will  have already happened, a Facebook module to Bing that will essentially incorporate Facebook's  personalization into Bing search.  Now, if you go to Yelp right now and you have a, if you've ever logged into Facebook, you  have the Facebook cookie on your machine, you go to Yelp, it'll say, hey, your name  here.  It'll even show you a picture of yourself and say, many of your friends are also here.  Would you like to know more?  And it's a little creepy when it first happens.  I think it happens on Pandora as well, doesn't it?  Yep.  Among other sites.  And when I first saw it, I thought, I don't know if I really want them to do that.  You can turn it off.  It's called a Facebook personalization.  Besides Pandora and Yelp, who else does it, Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Rotten Tomatoes, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rotten Tomatoes does it too?  Yep.  Okay.  It hasn't been a huge thing.  I mean, not a lot of sites are doing it yet.  And it's more subtle than it used to be.  It used to get a big colored bar.  Now it's just a little bit of text right at the tippity top of the page that says, Yelp  is using Facebook to personalize your experience.  And then you see friends activity, 100, and you see some options.  What is this?  Being the first.  Not you, log out of Facebook and don't want to be connected, how to turn this off.  But if you click friends activity, you'll see what people who are my Facebook friends  have done recently on Yelp.  Similarly, when you search for something on Bing, and they give a few examples.  If you search for a Toyota Prius on Bing, you'll see which of your Facebook friends  have liked it, reviewed Priuses, have liked articles about Priuses.  You'll get results, Prius results based on your social graph.  They showed searching for movies and TV shows.  They showed interestingly searching for people and the ability to customize your experience  according to something Chi Lu called social proximity.  And I thought this was kind of like a location based search where it knows where you are.  So it gives you results that are appropriate to your zip code.  Social proximity based search would say know who your social graph is and give you name  search results that are appropriate to who you know.  So if I search for Jeff, I'm going to get Jeff Jarvis, assuming that you're my Facebook  friend.  I don't even know if you are.  I certainly hope so.  It will be available, as I said, by the time you hear this, they said this afternoon, which  we're recording Wednesday, October 13th, so Wednesday afternoon.  Still to come, they'd like to bring in likes and profile pics anywhere across search results,  not just in a Facebook module.  By the way, that module rides pretty high on the page.  It's well above the fold.  It looks like it's like almost the second item in there.  They'd also like to be able to kind of give you some information about which of your friends  are experts.  The example Facebook gave is if you search for the Marataj restaurant in Sonoma County,  just up the road a bit from here, it would show which of your friends have actually been  there.  So when you read the reviews, you know these people might know whereof they speak.  Robert, for a long time, you've talked about using the social graph in search and how much  juice Facebook has because of all this social information.  Is this the other shoe dropping?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Part of it, and certainly it exposes the rift with Google.  If you work at Google, by the way, you're not allowed to integrate Facebook in any real  way into any Google product.  And there's a widening rift.  When I talk to executives at Google, they think Facebook is the number one to aim at  right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Isn't that what Eric Schmidt said?  He said, I don't fear Apple.  I don't fear Facebook.  I fear Bing.  And actually, in fact, now he can fear Facebook and Bing together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.  And that's probably why he feared Bing because Bing could get back in the game and get some  more percentage of share away.  Each percentage, I think Danny Sullivan said, is a billion dollars or something like that.  So in revenue a year, something like that.  Something crazy.  Callahan has always said that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Each percentage of search business is a billion bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now if you can get even a few percent of the Facebook users to use Bing instead of  Google, that's pretty significant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Laura, your colleague Ben Parr was there.  He covered it live.  Mashable did a live blog of it.  I don't know if you got a chance to watch what was going on.  What are your thoughts on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I didn't get to see the announcement, but I did read Ben's post and I've kind of been  following it.  I think it's extremely interesting and it's certainly something I'll want to check out  once it does go live.  But at the same time, a lot of what Google has done to incorporate Twitter into search  results hasn't necessarily made that search experience better for me personally.  I know they like to talk that it's enhancing that.  So I mean, really it's going to be in terms of utility.  Knowing that my friend liked a movie is maybe a little bit more interesting than knowing  that they liked a Toyota Prius.  I mean, I don't really care that they like a Toyota Prius.  I care if maybe they own one or if maybe they know someone who owns one and that experience.  So I think there's a little bit more to it than just the like and I want to see it and  play with it before I can actually say, oh, hey, this is amazing.  But I do think it's part of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although, Jennifer, when socials put on a search listing like Plancast, I love Plancast  because it shows how many people are going to the web versus GnomeDex.  And I can decide which event to go to based on which of my friends are going there and  how many are going there.  Right. That has direct relevance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what Jennifer's saying, I think, is that just to find out that somebody going  to the web also happens to drive a Renault means nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the relevance is very high.  And so there's a subtlety to this to give me people who are doing things that add value  to the search and don't just say, oh, we're social, which is the risk for both Bing and  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Well, Google's been doing...  social link right now, if you go to Google and you click the social link on the sidebar  there, it'll give you nearby, it'll give you social.  And so I searched for the web and social.  And so I can get...  I guess these are people who I'm connected to via Twitter, via friend feed, I see, via  Wave.  I guess they haven't disconnected that yet.  So Google's obviously sees the value of this and has done some of this.  But Google, as you said, Robert, Google doesn't have Facebook.  How important is Facebook to this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, most normal people use Facebook.  The geeks in the audience are probably on Twitter, and people who love watching celebrities  are probably on Twitter.  But normal people, and my wife is a Facebook fanatic.  So if you want to reach people like that, you got to integrate Facebook in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  So this is potentially a differentiator between Bing and Google and something that could be  a value.  You can see why Microsoft would do this.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You can see why Google's been trying to go for some social thing we're yet to see.  And by the way, I'm told that whatever that is, is imminent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and you know, there's some...  I would give it some credence because of another big story, which is that Marissa Meyer has  moved from what is really the catbird seat, being in charge of search at Google, to being  in charge of location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's the new catbird seat, Leo.  You think?  Eric Schmidt has said recently that...  He said a while ago that Google will eventually make more money from mobile than from the  web, and it makes as much as God on the web.  And figuring out that strategy, figuring out how to give you relevance and intent in a  logical way through these... through not just tablets and phones, but being connected through  your cars and every which way.  And I keep on saying we're going to make...  Mobile becomes...  That's why I'm glad they didn't call it mobile.  Mobile is an irrelevant word.  This is about you being...  So this is the same as mobile, though, in that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's as valuable as mobile.  Yes, it's around you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is the third wave of the web.  The first wave was search, right?  And that's what Google capitalized on.  Second wave was social.  That's what Facebook and a whole bunch of other things, LinkedIn and Google Buzz and  whatever, capitalized on.  Now it's location and mobility added to search and social.  And this is the third wave.  It's very important.  I think she's still...  I totally agree with Jeff that she's still in the catbird seat.  Plus, you'll probably get one of those cool Google cars that drives her around, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll talk about that in a second because, Robert, you had the scoop on it, but you buried  the lead nine months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had no idea I was driving right next to the coolest car in the world.  You buried the lead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But let's talk some more about Marissa Meyer.  The New York Times, which broke this story, says in sentence number one of the third paragraph,  the change is a promotion for Ms. Meyer in case there were any question about her being  demoted.  She was also named to Google's operating committee of top decision makers.  So, this is...  She wasn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is she a senior VP now?  She was a VP, not a senior VP, I think.  Does this have a rank and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't see a rank, at least in the New York Times thing.  That's an interesting question.  Yes.  She was the VP of Search Projects and User Experience and very famously was the one,  the keeper of the clean interface at Google.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you talk to her backstage at conferences, it's very clear that she has her fingers in  every major acquisition that Google's doing and probably a lot of the strategic direction  as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was their 20th employee, the first female engineer there and has really been trusted  the keys to the kingdom.  I think it's very telling that you take this person, this very, very important person and  you say, you are now in charge of...  Let me give you this exact title, geographic and local services.  The New York Times article says that this is an indication that Google is taking the  business, the local business market very seriously, but it's got to be more than just local business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Certainly more than that.  Google's always taken that seriously and they've been really trying to push place pages for  a long time now and there's been a number of feature upgrades on that front.  But I think what they've shown over the course of the past few years is that they don't really  understand how consumers want to use location.  So latitude technology is great, it's there, but it's not exactly consumer friendly.  It's a little bit too implicit.  And then they messed up with dodgeball.  So they had Crowley and they had his innovation and they had that little bit of magic around  that location and then they dropped that.  And so they get the business side.  I wouldn't say that they're doing it perfectly right now and they can certainly improve upon  that.  But in terms of the consumer, I don't think that they've ever released a product that  is a must use or even has the weight of a four square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John Battelle in his search blog says location is a key factor in the future of search, social,  commerce and media among a lot of other things.  Obviously he thinks it's very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the most important signal.  Google's all about intuitive intent and Marissa understands that in her DNA.  And so the signals that Google can take to do things with you, right, social is one,  but location is in a way the most reliable.  I'm going to give you what's around you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John uses the phrase database of intentions.  That location is an important critical element in understanding intent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true.  When you talk to Google VPs, they talk about when you walk into a store, for instance,  you are communicating to the world that you have intent to do something.  I used to run retail store and my boss used to say, nobody walks in the front door without  an intent to buy from you.  So make sure that they buy something from you before they leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love that.  He knew that.  I think it was Larry Page or maybe it was Sergey Brin who said, the third part of your  brain, we want to know what you want before you want it.  Everybody thought that was kind of creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Eric Spitz said a few weeks ago that we know where you are and what you want.  And that's what this is.  A lot of creepiness, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just kind of discover what the intent is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Robert, I haven't thanked you, but Robert and I had before it died a WAVE interview  for my next book.  And I just used part of what Robert was saying about when you were at a photo store, you  memorized the inventory and prices of your competitor as well as your own store.  You were a database.  You were presenting this kind of valuable information to somebody and that's what Google  is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did that because I was paid on commission.  If you could sell something faster than the guy next to you, you would make more.  And looking prices up in a book wasted time.  Wow.  That's dedication, Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm surprised you're not still working in a camera store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd love to, but in a way I still am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just get more than cameras, that's all.  I'm in a mental block right now or a senior moment.  Who's the Google executive everybody likes?  Who was on Android and then was moving over to kind of local?  And I thought that he just had a role in local and I wonder how this matters against him.  Who, Vic?  Vic Guindotra?  Thank you.  Vic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Vic's new job.  He's building the next social piece that's going to compete with Facebook.  And I just talked to him a couple of days ago and he knows his job is hard.  Well, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you move Marissa because you're about to launch this platform or is this Marissa planning  for the next platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I both because anything, Google's strength is they know, they have a graph of all the  places in the world.  This is why they can drive that car down the road, right?  They have maps of the road.  They understand the businesses when you search.  In fact, if you want to find out how to get to the Twit cottage, the Twit cottage is  on Google Maps.  Well, why?  Because Google has a social graph of the businesses in the world and they understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, because I tell you why, because I added it to places.  That's why.  But they've been saying it, as Jennifer said, they've always taken this very seriously and  they've incented people to do that.  And there's a lot of reasons to add yourself to places.  And they do this.  It's complicated.  You get a postcard in the mail saying, were you really the guy?  Or you can verify in other ways.  I think they can call your phone number, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I've always thought that in terms of technology, Google, you know, they've built  the infrastructure to be great at location, but it's not a technology problem, at least  in terms of consumer.  Like I said before, it's an emotion thing.  They can't create an emotion that wants, you know, that kind of ties you to any of their  products that they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then it raises the question, is this Facebook Bing thing late to the party?  Oh, they suddenly discovered social and Google said, social is nice.  But we're doing location.  Have they left? Have they leapfrogged?  Is this something better than?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, of course not, because first they're different.  But at the same time, Facebook has their Facebook places.  And I'll bet that this gets incorporated into this pretty soon as well, because, you  know, your friends like in a restaurant, I think that was even an example that showed  up. They did. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They said the Marataj, we can tell if he's an expert whether he's been there or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know, I tried to switch my iPhone over to Bing for a month and I just don't  like the search results as good as well.  So for me, this is not enough to switch me over to Bing.  I'll play with it a little bit to see what what's fun about it.  But it hasn't nailed the search experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think, Leo, the question you're asking different questions.  One is a user question, which, of course, is always where Google starts.  But the bottom line is not a user question at all.  It's an ad question. Where is the higher value going to be in commerce and  advertising? And where is all the growth going to be?  Well, you know, I talked to hyper local businesses and basically there are those  who are saying already that not only have newspapers but local blogs have already  lost out to Google on place pages and such.  I don't agree with that, but that is where the war is going to be.  And if Google is going to drive your car to the nearest pizza and, you know, hello,  we just delivered you a prospect.  You know, it's kind of beautiful.  And so I think on the advertising front, there's huge growth to be had and there's  a huge signal to be had. I think Jennifer's absolutely right.  It's not it's not as if it's one or the other and Google would kill to have  Facebook, I'm sure.  But they make the best of what they have.  And this is going to be really important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's talk a little bit about the creepy factor, because as soon as as soon  as Facebook and Bing announced this, I think privacy issues crop up.  And a lot of the questions that Mark Zuckerberg and the others took at the event  today were basically privacy questions.  We're going to talk about that in just a second.  I want to take a little break.  We are talking about Google in the cloud on this week in Google and joining us.  We're very glad to have Jennifer Van Grove from Mac.  She's sucking away at her.  That's all right, Jennifer.  You may have your beverage.  You thought this was a time for breaking and it is.  You look like you're on weeds.  She does. She has the the clutch, the claw.  That's what it was. What's her name that in Weed's?  Mary Louise Parker.  Mary Louise Parker.  She's always holding the I don't know why is that and sucking her frappuccino  through a claw. I don't know.  Anyway, that's something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not intentional for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyways, did you do the claw?  I just now I see how you grasp it.  Yep. That's the Mary Louise Parker claw.  All right. So maybe that's just normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a female thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. It's a girl thing because guys like to hold it like that.  That's another story.  Also, you're Jeff Jarvis.  From Buzz Machine.com, the Scobelizer is also here.  Robert Scobel and we will be back with more and we'll talk privacy  and how men like to hold it.  But first, let me tell you a little bit about Squarespace.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks to you, Leo, I've been recommending Squarespace to my students.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, good. Yeah, perfect for a student.  Perfect for a student.  And I go on and on.  I won't because we have other things to talk about.  So I always get a little creeped out when I see the Facebook personalization.  It's like, whoa, you know, and I think it's one of the reasons that, you know, the like button has just taken off everywhere.  Every site. If you don't have a like button, all of my podcasters on the Twitter network are saying, why don't we have like buttons?  Everybody knows that's how you generate traffic is through a like button.  But but but very few sites have adopted this Facebook personalization.  Yelp. You can name them on the fingers of one hand.  And I think that this because there's a creepy factor, even though we know that it's just a cookie, that no information.  In fact, Zuckerberg said, look, Bing is not getting any more information from us than you would get if you went and you looked at that person's profile.  It's whatever they've made public.  So anybody could do it any time.  We're just giving them the information programmatically.  He also said no information goes from Bing to Facebook.  That's a concern. Right.  That Facebook might be storing your search information.  I mean, bad enough. Google knows everything we search.  But, you know, Facebook could and who knows, you know, how long that'll last?  Because as we know, Facebook's willing to change things.  Does this does this concern you?  Is this is this addition into a search engine?  Something of concern? Will it actually scare people away from being Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With the privacy and certainly will in Germany, where they go about this.  I even, you know, even on Yelp and things, I think it's it does come to a question of value and relevance.  When the like button came up on Facebook, I was one of those who said, oh, there's there's privacy problems there because it's going to report information back.  And I was wrong and nobody cares. And it's fine.  So the same may be true here.  But I think it's it's mainly creepy.  I think if it comes out of the left field, if it's really useful, right off the bat, as Robert for Robert to know what other people are going to the same conference he's going to so we can stalk them.  You know, would sound even worse in a way, but it is more relevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Robert, you're like ceiling cat. You're looking to.  So it's all an implementation because the like button, you're right.  I mean, I, you know, I said at the time, I'll never use a like button because I don't want to give Facebook a window into the world of my users.  But, you know, say that comes a time when you just got to give up on these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think right now it's a it's a conditioning experiment.  So Web users were not used to going to a page and seeing the content personalized for us.  And so it's a little bit unfamiliar, maybe feels like there's something creepy going on.  And Facebook is pushing that, you know, pushing that boundary, pushing against it and, you know, condition, condition us to think a little bit differently about how a Web page, how the content on the page can be shown to us in different ways.  And I know that my sixth sense is kind of going down that path as well.  You know, they they have their own formula and they're trying to get website publishers to implement their API so that when you go to your page, what you see is completely personalized to who you are.  So I think that the whole Web is going in that direction.  It's not just Facebook. Facebook just happens to be the one who's doing it right now in the kind of the most obvious way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess the difference for me is my sixth sense, I'm opting in to use my sixth sense when I go to a Web site, when I go, I do a search and all of a sudden other, you know, your face and your face and your face shows up in the search results.  That's kind of creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, you added that data into Facebook and made it public and there's ways to remove it if you're that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's disconnected from the experience.  So it happened at a different time.  It's the buzz problem.  It's the buzz problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I expected this to be used in this way and oops, whoa, it is used that way.  That surprises me.  You know, I think that Google would be more clever about this.  I think the idea of just saying, oh, these are pages your friends have liked or something doesn't help me.  Whereas if you really study my social graph and find out that I hang out with geeks, that when I search for Windows, I'm not looking for Windex.  But you can you can you can make the algorithm smarter in far more subtle and meaningful and relevant ways than just these obvious social, supposedly social things, which are really just they're window dressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And these semantic search systems that are just coming probably soon.  The one I saw today is coming out in November.  They do exactly that.  They understand the context of who you are, right, because of the graph of things that you touch and the people that you talk with.  And so it knows exactly that that you're talking about Microsoft Windows, not Windows cleaner or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is what is semantic search, Robert, just before we moved on?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, systems that are using these semantic databases track entities like Leo Laporte and track all sorts of data about Leo Laporte.  So you can click on your name and see photos, videos, pictures, associated news articles about you, stuff like that.  So click on a recipe and it knows, oh, these are food ingredients.  It doesn't take you to paint or something else.  It takes you the things that are associated with that with that entity, with that topic that you're trying to learn more about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It understands what you're asking for.  It understands what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's looking for signals to intuit intent again, rather than just saying you have this this this connection.  And so the more I mean, you know, Amazon should be doing that if I could put my Facebook look at this way,  if I put my Facebook stuff into Amazon and it just knew who I knew and it behind the scenes with the revealing nothing to me knows what all my friends buy,  then it would recommend Leo Laporte books to me.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The guy who did the Amazon system that does that guessing of what what else you would be interested in, you know, you bought Harry Potter.  Here's some other books that you might be interested in.  Now owns World, by the way, and they just announced which is a competitor to Foursquare and Walla.  And they just announced this kind of look up.  You know, you've gone to 800 places.  Here's some other places that we think you would like based on the social graph that is around those places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the irony is that that Microsoft bought a company that did that.  My friend and partner on Daylife, you Pender Chardonnand out of his MIT Media Lab dissertation did collaborative filtering and did the original Ringo.  Remember, which became now I'm forgetting the name of it.  Oh, this is horrible.  Became.  We're all getting old.  Our brains are going.  Oh, tell me about it.  At least you got a laser in your head.  So you got an excuse, Robert.  My pixels are dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got a hole in his head.  It looks like.  I'll move over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the reason Microsoft bought it was to get the wallet feature, which, of course, no one trusts Microsoft to use.  And they had collaborative filtering in a way that they could have built into search long, long ago and didn't know what to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can move too fast for people.  I mean, you can scare them away.  And it's I keep thinking that that more and more now, maybe it's because I saw that movie, but more and more I'm thinking Mark Zuckerberg is kind of several steps ahead of the rest of us.  And and so he's kind of the difference between Mark and maybe some others is he's pushing us farther and faster than we are really ready to go, even though we may at some point say, OK, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good place to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think I think Larry and Sergey and Eric are and Marissa and company are ahead of us, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they're cognizant of the risk, I think, in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And also, I think the challenge is that they've got more of a challenge.  I interviewed Eric last week for my book, and it was an interesting interview.  But but we saw some line going by about what's your biggest challenge?  And he said growth. And I think it means both sides of that to keep on growing big, but also to keep doing things that are ahead of us when you're so damn big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the stock market requires massive growth multiples, you know, big like doubling every year for your stock price to go up.  Just look at Microsoft's stock price versus Apple's, which, by the way, is now over three hundred dollars today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's Louise. I sold it.  I sold it at twenty two before it split because you knew you knew, didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You knew where it was headed, didn't you?  Now, Google's is flattened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what's up, Microsoft?  That shows you how smart I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you can see you can see how there's a pressure for a public company if they want to keep those stock valuations up.  And that's how you acquire talent to to grow at all costs.  But so that's clearly one thing Eric was talking about.  But I think just managing existing.  That's what I'm saying.  It's challenging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the problem.  So so Zuckerberg is smart.  He is ahead of things and he still has a company that's right sized to change.  And as he said in the movie, we don't know what it is yet.  And I think that's a huge advantage for him still.  And not being a public company remains a huge advantage for him.  And it's hard to be Google.  It's getting harder every day to be Google.  It's wonderful to be Google.  We should all be Google, but it gets harder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want to be Google.  You don't want to be Google?  No, too much growth makes me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just want a Google car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got that too funny because Robert, you had the scoop nine months ago.  If you go to YouTube and you search for autonomous vehicles.  Yeah, there's Robert driving alongside a car that well, did you not know it was autonomous?  I didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I knew it was an interesting car.  I thought it was a mapping car because it was spinning wider on the top of it.  And I thought that they were driving around making 3D maps of the world.  But I kept seeing them.  I've seen them maybe a dozen to 20 times on the freeways here.  They've been driving them a lot.  They're stalking you.  Well, they drive them around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They drive them around Mountain View.  They drive them around here, right?  Yeah.  And they've logged a hundred forty thousand miles.  Right.  Yeah.  So they got to be driving them around somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, I've seen them.  I've seen them in Half Moon Bay.  I've seen them driving around and I got video of them twice.  In fact, last December I had video of another one.  So, you know, I keep seeing these cars and I just find them  fascinating creatures to look at because of the spinning LIDAR.  So last night I was really fascinated.  The wife of the inventor of LIDAR calls me up and talks, tells me a little bit  of about what went into developing that LIDAR.  It turns out the guy who Dave Hall, I think is his name, invented LIDAR,  was the inventor of the Velodyne subwoofer, which I sold in my camera store in 1980s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much did that cost at Ritz Camera?  The LIDAR?  No, I'm just kidding.  You can buy a LIDAR for $29,000 now.  So LIDAR, how does that differ from radar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a spinning laser.  So it has, I think, a row of lasers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's your video from nine months ago and you could see the LIDAR.  You actually have a clearer video than anybody does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's so it spins these lasers and spits lasers out to the street, to the trees,  to the cars around you, to the humans around you and measures that laser coming back  and then makes a 3D image in real time of the world around it.  If you go to engineering TV, you'll actually see some video of the LIDAR.  I posted on Twitter last night and the imagery that comes back from it.  You can see lane markings.  You can see trees.  You can see people walking around.  You can see everything in the environment around the car.  And this laser, this LIDAR spinning around five times a second.  So every every fifth of a second, it makes a new picture of that environment.  And if if a car moves a little bit closer to it, it can it yields that that LIDAR sees it.  Now, the the guys at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon use that imagery to write algorithms  for controlling a robot, a car, in this case, around this environment.  And so they they wrote algorithms to say, oh, that's a tree.  You don't have to worry about that unless you're heading straight forward.  You know, that's a car and it's moving in the same speed you are.  That's a different kind of object than, you know, a car heading straight towards you.  And, you know, that's what they what the Google guys are doing is writing these algorithms  to understand the environment and understand how to stop at a stoplight.  You know, how do you know that that's a stoplight you're looking at?  OK, we can see that on the LIDAR.  We see the position of the light, which was really brilliant engineering  when when somebody developed the stoplight to make it a different position than the green light  so that the LIDAR can measure that.  And off you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's clever. You think they did on purpose? No.  I, you know, I know someday they'll be LIDAR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think they did that because humans can't discern color very well,  but we can discern position and LIDAR isn't really good at discerning color, but position.  And you have on your screen an example of a LIDAR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is from engineering TV, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's probably walking around in an environment.  They put one in the exhibit hall and you can see people walking around.  Now they're putting one on a military vehicle.  And that's two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One, you shot that video while you were driving.  Remind me never to get a ride with you. No kidding.  But it was very clear. It was very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the trick, though, because my car has some of this technology built into it.  So I have a camera in my car that keeps me in the lane.  And my my camera, my car has a radar on the front of it  that automatically follows cars in front of it.  So I can actually do a little bit more than just drive with my car.  And my car is maybe 10 percent of going toward the Google system.  My car, if somebody slams on their brakes in front of me, my car slams on its brakes.  It's really a remarkable system.  And I think every car should have it.  I think in 10 years, if your car doesn't have this,  you're going to wonder why it doesn't have it the same way today.  If you didn't have a car with seatbelts, you would be like, I'm not getting a lot of control.  Oh, this is this is a remarkable technology.  It puts you back in control and it's way faster and way more safe than you are.  It doesn't fall asleep.  It reacts faster to road conditions.  It can see stuff that you don't see that maybe is a blind spot that you're that you have.  It works at night in in conditions where you're human.  I can't see. I came up on a car that didn't have any backlights  and totally pitch at night and I couldn't see this car,  but my radar slowed down because it saw the car.  And so these things are going to save lives.  It's just humans are very resistant to these new technologies  and letting technology take over their lives this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, one of the reasons you didn't know what you were taking a picture of is there's a guy at the wheel.  Yeah. And it looks like somebody's driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Question if you slow if you do a frame analysis or his hands on the wheel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I couldn't quite see that it looked like it, but I couldn't see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet you I mean, look, they don't want to scare the hell out of people.  They don't want to scare people.  I think it would be funny if they put a monkey in the in the driver's seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what was funny and I should have, you know, if I had a news team working for me,  I should have thought about this.  The guy instantly put on his brakes when I came along.  He did slow down. Yeah.  He saw my camera and he he stepped hard on those brakes.  So in the car, they all have manual override systems and they can,  you know, click a button or step on a brake and get out of a situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty obvious this is a this is a Larry or Sergey or both kind of fanatic project,  something they're kind of they want to do and they think is neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was the argument online where Henry Blodgett said that they should  they shouldn't be doing it in the company for the stockholders sake.  And also the better way to develop this is a startup.  See, I disagree. I agree.  I totally disagree.  This is the thing for them to do.  Well, they got to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, first of all, understanding doing research like this  will find you some new things.  For instance, it might turn into better turn by turn navigation on our cell phones.  Right. Even if you're not going to use a car that drives itself,  you might get a benefit because they understand the environment better.  They understand all sorts of different signals and signs.  And they can warn you about turns that are dangerous.  If you're going too fast into a turn, your phone might warn you.  Trappster does this for me. Right.  People have marked certain turns as being very dangerous or  have put in there that there's a police camera,  a speed. I'm sorry.  A stoplight camera at a certain intersection.  So don't run the red light here.  And and it warns you as you're driving around, it talks to you.  It says, hey, don't don't run the next red light. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you think of the economic implications, you know, if we use this, could be huge.  It's going to it's going to save lives. It's going to save money from that.  It's going to save fuel.  It's going to allow emergency vehicles to go around.  It's going to provide more spare time, which is what Eric said before this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm sure it's cheaper than owning three company jets anyway. Yeah.  I spend money on a lot of things.  The place I'd expect to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I'm going to be the huge naysayer and said, say that, you know,  I'm not really interested.  I mean, the technology is impressive, but I'm one of those.  You know, those drivers that when I'm driving, I like to be in control of my car.  Like I I've had cars with cruise control. I don't use it.  Obviously, it's Robert.  I totally agree that the technology is important technology  and will certainly go a long way.  But there's also that once this comes to market or even in the testing  and, you know, on the streets, that if something catastrophic happens,  then it's going to be Google's name in the lights in a very negative way.  And that will potentially negative, you know, affect the stock.  So it is it's it's it's it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's why they were trying to keep it secret.  You know, the New York Times found out about it  and forced Google to talk about this.  They they didn't Google didn't want to talk about in public.  The I interviewed the guy, the head of safety at Ford.  And he said exactly this, that he's done customer research.  And most customers don't like the idea of having a car in control.  So in the Ford Taurus, the 2010 Ford Taurus or now the 2011,  they have these radar systems, but they don't take control of the car.  They just warn you when you're about to hit something  or you're doing something stupid or you're falling asleep.  That's the system they have.  Yeah. And that's smart, right?  That that that also demonstrates where this research could expose itself,  even for somebody like Jennifer, she might want these kinds of safety technologies.  She doesn't want the car to drive.  But you know, if you're about to hit something, you fell asleep at the at the wheel.  You'd want to be warned about that and get woken up.  And Jennifer, I think you're right about current culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Robert, you're right about where it's going to expose.  I, Jennifer, I think you're right about current culture.  But but you start to imagine a time when you really could take time off,  do something as you drive, which is what what Eric talked about.  You imagine maybe being financially rewarded that if you if you let the car drive,  you you don't own the insurance.  Yeah. And and there are other ways to consider how  there can be economic motives here that really matter.  What what hit me was I always thought that it was an all or nothing,  that either the roads are entirely controlled by technology or not.  The idea that you can have an automatically driven car  interacting with human driven cars is was was was that's what was relevant to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I interviewed the guy who wrote the software for the Stanford car  and he now works on the Google team.  I interviewed him back in 2007.  I I asked him, well, how do you how do you decide who gets to go through an intersection?  You know, if you have a four way stop and let's say you have two robot cars come  and I and two human cars, humans know how to look at each other  and decide which way to who goes first. Right.  But how does the robot decide that?  And he said, well, we've we've come up with algorithms  that will move the car a couple inches into the intersection.  And if nobody else moves, it goes a couple more inches.  That's what I do. Yeah.  And I'm so happy to.  And if anybody else moves, then they stop and wait until, you know,  and and decide a random set time before they try again.  And when they tie a face it up, you hang around with a fast crowd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a very interesting thing to do.  I'm with you, Robert.  You know, I talked to Alan Mullally at Ford.  He said people like to drive their own cars.  We don't have any plans to do autonomous vehicles.  I think what we're seeing, though, is that autonomous vehicles are here  and and consumers may not want them, but they're here.  And it may be in time that there might be other overriding considerations  like highway safety, fuel, driver cars, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't like to drive across Nevada, right?  It's a very straight road and very boring.  I think this will be used in the trucking industry, by the way,  because those people are getting paid to drive.  And if you could buy one of these devices right now, that that LIDAR  cost twenty nine thousand dollars and the PC that goes in the car  cost five thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All it takes is one horrendous crash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I mean, I don't think you're going to see a crash with these things.  They are so fast and so accurate at reading the environment around them  that they're going to avoid crashes more often than they're going to get in them.  But it's ironic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, we have horrendous crashes every single day.  Yeah. 40,000 humans are stupid.  United States die a year.  But nobody's nobody's saying, well, humans are not to be allowed to drive cars.  But you have one crash.  In fact, I think of the Bucky Fuller's Dimexion car.  He invented a very efficient, brilliant three wheel vehicle.  And unfortunately, it got in a fatal accident and the guy, the test driver died.  And that was it. Yeah, that was it.  It was over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody was going to. Google cars have only been in one accident, by the way,  and it was rear ended by somebody else. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So but that's just it, though.  I mean, you can't always account well, at least from my knowledge,  you can't always account for, you know, for the stupidity of other people.  I mean, I'm sure the algorithms are very sophisticated, but there's  how can it possibly know every single potential outcome  of every single maneuver of every single car on the road?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because actually, it's pretty damn when you see the LIDAR work,  it's pretty damn good at figuring that out.  You know, and you can write algorithms.  Hey, there's a car moving toward me.  And my laser is my radar is so good that it  it doesn't see anybody coming toward me.  I use it on on a very curvy road and people come right towards my front.  And it's very good at discerning.  Oh, that car is coming toward me in the other lane.  And I should ignore that.  If you look at the video I did with Ford,  they actually show on the screen what the algorithms are doing.  And it's classifying each object that it sees and it sees everything.  It sees the line markers. It sees everything.  It sees signs right coming toward you.  Why wouldn't a car robot care about the sign?  But it classifies that and says, oh, that's that's not dangerous to our environment.  This car that's breaking right now is dangerous for our environment.  And we're going to do something about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the artificial intelligence real time, the data that's going through.  That's happening locally in the car.  The Google car, I assume, is going back to the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Google car uses the maps data from the cloud  to figure out where it's going next. Right.  And figure out a little bit about the space that it's in before it gets there.  So it knows like the light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Our calculations are happening locally, you're saying locally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because that's too much data to be sending.  And also, we all know how AT&T wireless is not very reliable, even if you have,  you know, Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so all right.  So I think we know Jennifer would never drive an autonomous car.  Not never, but I you don't even like cruise control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, I want to see.  I'm trying to get a ride in one.  You should come along.  I want to see you sit in the backseat while this.  We know Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Robert would buy one in a heartbeat and would sit back and read a book,  text, Twitter, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Debono fell asleep in the one.  He did.  Yeah, he really was.  Not not the driver's seat in the backseat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you are that you are the guy, the tiebreaker, Jeff Jarvis.  Would you ever ride?  You bet. You do it.  I would do it, too.  So actually, we we outnumber you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But isn't like, you know, part of the thing about driving the experience.  Like there are drivers out there who love to drive.  That's what Malali said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He said people really like driving.  We're not going to take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Guess what? You can turn it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can still drive it.  I loved my stick shift until it almost got me divorced before I was married  because my wife won't drive one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think it's really interesting.  This is what I think is interesting is that this is a very science fiction  concept, and it's here.  It actually happens. It works.  It's there. It's done.  Yeah. And, you know, Google's had this for a while.  Yeah, we drove one hundred forty thousand miles.  No, no, it's like what else is out there that we don't know about?  That's done. You know, that's cooked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, Vic, Google says they have some other secret projects  that I don't know yet about.  So you got to wonder how I'm going to be watching what's on the road a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you have or the scars, one of the attitudes, one of the attitudes,  I've heard Google say this, one of the attitudes at Google is they're engineers.  There's a problem. We can engineer a solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Right.  Now, and if you watch engineering TV, they just had some video  of the General Electric video cameras or sensors  that they're putting on planes and drones.  I mean, this stuff looks like science fiction, but, you know,  it's amazing stuff.  And again, it categorizes what's on the ground.  Is that a threat? Is that, you know, as usual,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's the military that gets the first application.  And they've been using LiDAR for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the Stanford stuff was developed for the military. Right.  DARPA, you know, sponsored the first autonomous car contest.  And this stuff was designed for them at Stanford.  They were testing these quadcopter rotors, helicopters.  And now you can buy for 300 bucks.  But those were developed for the military.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So who does engineering TV?  This is great. I don't know.  But that's what we're going to get a big.

Transcript:  Last night. And I'm in love.  I, you know, as a geek, you get the book around there and it's very geeky.  It's it's a little dense on engineering terms.  But when you find once in a while, you'll find a video that's like,  wow, that's possible.  It's crazy. It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks like it's Electronic Design magazine that does this.  It's engineering TV dot com.  And we thank them for unwittingly giving us permission  to run that video of the lidar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the Internet. We all steal from each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, we don't steal. We promote Robert. We promote.  And that's why we link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We send traffic to each other.  That's what I'm doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sending them traffic from one one network broadcaster to another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And hopefully they're using Squarespace so that they stay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go. Now you're cooking.  Hey, we're going to talk about Google TV.  There's more to say there as well.  And just a little bit.  It's great to have you, Jennifer van Grove from Mashable,  Jeff Jarvis from Smart Machine.  I mean, Buzz Machine.  I'm mixing you with Gina now. Buzz Machine dot com.  And Robert Scoble from Scoble.  Lizer dot com and Rackspace.  Let's not let's give him a plug. Rackspace.  Hey, maybe Rackspace will get you a new camera.  I lazy. Well, you've lasered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're only like six ninety bucks, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, the C510 that I was talking about, the new Logitech is 60 bucks.  It's really nice for 60 bucks.  Hey, briefly, I want to mention my friend Tom Johnson,  who does the best anti-spam solution ever. MailRoute dot info.  I want you to check it out.  Now, this is really for people who have their own servers.  You know, if you're using Gmail, you've got anti-spam.  Gmail does a great job. Kill spam.  I'm not going to try to sell you an anti-spam solution,  but there are a lot of people who run their own mail server,  exchange servers or other kinds of servers for whatever reason.  People who have their own domains like I do, Leoville dot com.  For the last six years,  I've been using MailRoute to kill spam before it even gets to my server.  And I'm going to get a little geeky here.  You set the MX record in your DNS records to MailRoute.  It gets all your mail, filters out the junk and then sends it on to you.  And you get this kind of pristine stream.  It's kind of like sewage treatment for your email.  And let me give you an idea of how much sewage is in my email.  Over the last 12 months, I got roughly a million messages of which  all but about 40,000 were spam.  That means 96% spam.  MailRoute got them all with not one false positive.  And that's what I really like about MailRoute. Once you get it working,  once you set it, you could forget it. It's just there. It just works. They are not,  Tom has gotten so much interest from people who say, but,  but I would like an anti-spam solution that he is now talking to individual users.  So there are individual accounts there.  You could check out the pricing at mail route dot net. It starts at,  I think as low as $2 per seat. I think there's a $20 minimum,  although for individuals they're going to do a special deal because they realize  if you just have one address, it's not quite worth $20 a month.  So go to mail route dot info, take a look at the pricing,  take a look at the setup. It's very good. Tom has been around for a long time.  He created something called front bridge, which was acquired by Microsoft in 2005  and is now called Microsoft exchange hosted services.  He knows a little bit about mail. A mail route is the best 99.99%  availability for message processing.  It's up more than your server is and you can try it free right now.  Mail route dot info. If you use a, if you use that URL,  you get 10% off for life, the life of your account.  And you'll help support this week in Google as well. Thank you, Tom,  for your support. Thank you for checking out mail route.  We are talking about now Google TV. Let's talk a little bit about that.  I can't remember, Jeff. Did we talk about Google TV? We did some last week. Yeah.  Cause cause the Logitech review had been announced that's the Logitech. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, so Sony now adds there as we saw the previews of the remote.  The remote is true.  It is. And it's, and it's, we said last week, it's so Sony, you know,  Oh, we need a button for this and a button for that. And it has no elegance,  which is odd for Sony given the days. But I versus the Logitech, you know,  I do, I want this little thing or a whole big keyboard. Well, that's true.  The size of it does have some, some merit.  So I want to know is I just, I have a new Sony TV. I'm going to jinx like you.  And I don't know what just bought one. Sony Google TV to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, see, that's the interesting thing.  And I guess that's question number one is what's the more,  what's the better way to do this to buy a TV with the internet built into it or  my preference, maybe that's cause I'm a geek.  I like the idea of having a great TV.  I don't care if it's got internet and I will buy a box or two or in my case,  I'm using actually,  I only have five HDMI ports and all of them are attached to Roku Apple TV.  There's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but down the line, Leo down the line,  isn't your TV just going to be connected to your cloud?  I'll tell you why I don't like that because well, Samsung, for instance,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  doing their own thing. So that means their own UI,  their own special flavor of stuff.  And what I want is the ability to easily upgrade and the ability to choose  because there's very big differences between Google TV, Roku, Apple TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's hard to say this at some point, but we're not, it's the, it's the,  I want to choose the TV, Jeff, and get a great TV.  I agree with that, but the same way I want to choose a computer and behind that is just the internet.  I want to choose a TV and behind that is just the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I tell you why I don't think that's good because you really don't want to,  do you really want to put the internet on your TV and just have like a browser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I want that same kind of openness that I don't have to buy different boxes to  get different stuff. That's, that's the balkanization here that's absurd.  Yeah. Right. If I want to connect to the world of entertainment,  I shouldn't have to worry that Hulu's on this and not on that and Showtime's on that.  But it is, but I mean, that's the case.  That's not the way the world should work. That's the way the world does work, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For now.  So you think at some point there'll be a standards based solution that,  it has to be,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  okay.  There has to be because, because you're going to get this thing we now call it.  It's like at some point in the future, the word mobile becomes meaningless.  The word telephone becomes meaningless and I'll get crap for this in the chat  room, but what the hell?  Even the word TV becomes meaningless because you may be watching this show on  what you can now call TV or on what we now call tablets or what we now call  phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, I think we're going to standardize around screen size.  We have handheld iPad or slate, something like that screen,  you know, desktop or laptop, and then a big screen,  a 50, 60 inch screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you Robert. That's fine. But the point is,  if I want to watch a weeds on the brain now,  because you did it to me Jennifer, because of the claw.  If I want to watch weeds, I watch it on my iPod. I watch it on a tablet.  I watch it on the TV. It doesn't matter what size device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Sony is going to be the first to market because they'll be in stores on  Saturday. I think the way to talk about this is as platform,  right? I mean, what, what you want,  and this is where Microsoft powered the PC revolution by building a  standardized platform, not open, but standardized called windows.  So every developer could develop it for it and,  and many manufacturers could manufacture for it. And that,  the success of that platform was, I think comes from those two facts,  not from any particular technical merit, but merely ubiquity.  The internet is a platform anybody can develop for.  Now you have these proprietary platforms you develop for the iPhone.  You don't develop for Android.  And you know, anybody can develop for the iPhone.  Anybody can develop for Android.  You may develop for the iPhone and not get approved, but, but, uh,  they're separate, but equal plat, let's say separate, but equal platforms.  And I think that that's the future. Isn't it? Isn't that, I mean,  are we ever going to see? Yes. I know it's a horrible future,  but isn't that where we are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's where we are today? But by God, let's fight it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in phones, I mean, I guess Android's your best bet for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's open source. And at some point, you know, some, uh, um,  Amazon just came out with its new short form books that they want to sell just  on Kindle. So I can write the 40,000 word book booklet and it appears there and  you can't get it on, um, uh, you know, iBooks.  Well, I agree that holds it back. I agree that.  Right. That's ridiculous. And, and, and so we wouldn't tolerate that.  We don't tolerate that today with books.  We think that's ridiculous that you can't get books on certain platforms. Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the same true TV shows. We may think it's ridiculous,  but we do tolerate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. We tolerate, we're stuck with it. Well,  and it's why I won't buy, um, I'm not, I,  I kindles where all the books are.  Do you have a Kindle? Uh, I will just broke, but,  but I'll use the Kindle app across any platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so you've supported the Balkanization in books.  All right. You just, you just did it. Yeah. So, uh,  I mean, I agree with you. I, it's not desirable. In fact,  the reason the PC succeeded is because it was that way.  It could be very well the reason that a Google TV or Android doesn't succeed  because it isn't that way. Although you can say there are some negatives to the  Android model. Uh, people have complained before about the fact that there are,  you know, 18 different ways of doing Android and there's no Android,  two Android phones are alike. And, um, you know,  the all the horrible customizations that the company's wireless carriers do  because they can, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and then everyone's running a different version of the operating system.  So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and I think we're headed towards that kind of Balkanization in the TV space  where Samsung's got its platform, Panasonic's got it. There's Yahoo.  There's popcorn. There's Sony. There's Roku.  It's ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are we really in that world where we're tolerating where we wouldn't tolerate  Betamax versus VHS.  We wouldn't tolerate Blu-ray versus whatever the hell the other one was.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tolerating Netflix versus Amazon or Netflix versus something else.  But this is my,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is my argument against having it in the TV because then you buy into the  space. You're kind of saying, okay, I've, I've chosen Blu-ray. I've chosen HD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Right. Okay. I buy that. But I think Leo down the line,  you would certainly agree that if you could get, um,  a TV that just connected to the entertainment cloud, you'd be happiest.  Yes. Yeah. Okay.  So who's going to move?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are the forces that are going to move us that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. So you get your TV and it's going to have Hulu and Netflix and YouTube and  a few other things. And then, uh, you know, next year,  maybe a ESPN comes out with this exclusive sports package that's only available  on boxy.tv.  That's why you're going to go and buy a boxy. It's going to cost you a hundred  bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. But let's talk about the business model behind that. Right. ESPN's  interest in the early stages of technology is to get somebody to pay them.  And that's why content went exclusively with one phone company versus another  at the beginning, because the phone company would pay to differentiate.  ESPN's business model in the long run is to get largest audience possible,  either for advertising or subscription or both. So it,  it doesn't pay for ESPN in the long run to be stuck with just  the AOL in the future. Right.  That's what AOL and Prodigy and Microsoft did back in the day. Now, of course,  it was absurd because you could go around, but, but, but, but what,  once the web came along, it just killed all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm already noticing some brands that are common. I mean, I have an Xbox,  I have a PlayStation, I have a Roku, I have a Apple TV,  I have a Mac mini with a boxy on it.  And I'm going to get the Google TV if I can find 300 bucks in my, my gadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've got a great wife, Robert. You've got a great wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet you, Maryam can't figure out how to watch TV though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, she is, she's doing all right. The Apple TV is actually pretty easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to have to buy a separate TV for your family so that they can watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TV is not that hard because the Comcast box does the TV, right?  In our case, we have a direct TV.  Exactly.  And that, that we figured out because you have to figure that out if you want to  watch, you know, CNN and stuff like that, you have to figure out how to use that.  It's, it's all the other stuff like Netflix now, you know,  which system are we going to buy? Are we going to watch Netflix on?  So far the Apple TV is one. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jennifer, what do you watch on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm an Apple TV person,  but I will probably get some sort of TV that has Google TV just  because I want to see if it is what, you know,  it promises to be. Cause I do think that there's longterm potential there.  But in terms of like consumer preference, you know, so far,  consumers have voted for the, you know, the, the extra box, right?  So the DVD player and I'm not sure if they're going to be,  you know, ready for this. Okay. Well,  the internet is integrated into my TV experience.  I'm not sure that they're going to be ready for that.  And it should be interesting to see how people respond to it.  And I'll certainly be watching that. But I also, I want to play with it myself.  And search is a huge problem though. That is,  you know, cable providers kind of suck at.  And so Google can do it better and help you find the stuff you want,  but it's the actual content that you want. Then, then there's,  there's some magic there. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I worked with a cable company when I, when I worked for my last real employer,  they own Bright House, which is in Florida and a few other markets.  And I tried to come in and my boss had me come in trying to bring kind of  internet thing to it. And you're right. Search was the thing.  It was all about discovery and recommendation.  And they just don't think that way. They just couldn't think that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's impossible for me to actually find the show that I want to watch because  sometimes they don't know what channel it's on, what network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never know anymore. We used to know that. Right. No, nobody knows that anymore.  The whole idea of a channel is kind of absurd. Right. Right. 500 channels. No,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's zero channels is what you want. Well, it's really,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  as soon as you add the internet, it's infinite channels.  So now we really got a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. How do I find a twig? You know, that's what I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's where I think Google has an advantage.  I think we're moving, you know, as we did in search,  we moved from the categorized world that Yahoo was.  Yahoo was like the cable guide to the search world that Google is.  And I think the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So now go back to search and Bing. If you want to have an advantage,  social will matter greatly in entertainment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Because I want to know what Scoble's watching so I can avoid it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which boxy, boxy tries to get social, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, there's a lot of,  a lot of systems are trying to watch Twitter for mentions of things.  I mean, you know, during big news events. Well, like last night,  everybody was talking about the minor minors being rescued and people were  saying, oh, I'm crying. I love this. You know, it's, it's interesting.  And they would link to the various places you could watch it, right?  You could watch on CNN or you could watch on Fox or you could watch it on a  weird Spanish channel on YouTube, you stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the fascinating thing, Robert, was it was all the same government feed.  Yeah. And so it was exactly the same video.  I watched on BBC because I couldn't stand to watch it with Larry King.  But yeah. And the BBC correspondents are bilingual.  So I got a better sense. But the fascinating was here,  the video itself was exactly the same everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We are, we have run out of time. I can't believe how much we've run out of time.  There's so many other stories. Andy Rubin says,  the world doesn't need another platform. Windows Phone 7 came out this week.  Very different than Android and iPhone.  Very data and OS centric compared to app centric. Of course, if I'm,  if I'm a Microsoft, I think I've lost the app war. So I might as well do that.  Any thoughts on Windows Phone 7?  Looks nice. No apps.  Looks nice. Pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't believe it got good reviews.  I've made fun of Microsoft OS's for that for ages and you know,  people are liking it to their surprise. So, you know, I will at least look at it.  I'm not going to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a very nice OS, but I have 350 apps on my iPhone and you know,  you can make fun of that, but I use a good percentage of those.  And I count on them now.  I can't live with a phone that doesn't have those apps. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I rely on apps too. I like everything pretty much that I do when I'm out and about  on my phone is contained in an app just because that experience is so much  better. I mean, if it's as elegant as it sounds, then you know,  the hardware makers, they might embrace it.  It really depends on the quality of phone that gets delivered to the consumer.  And if the consumer can, you know,  use it and then do what it is they want to do. And maybe they, you know,  want a much more limited experience than, than I want on my phone. But I,  well, we haven't seen that happen because they have voted in favor of apps.  Should be interesting though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'll be able to buy a Galaxy Tab soon.  This is the tablet version of Samsung's Galaxy $649 unsubsidized,  $399 with a two year contract, at least at T-Mobile.  Verizon might also have a tab.  They look like they'll have a launch date of November 1st sprint on the 14th  AT&T and T-Mobile sometime in the fourth quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And no, no, a wifi only coming yet.  Just 3G. Just, just 3G.  What do you say, Oh Leo, you're going to do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm on buy one the minute I can, you bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jennifer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm going to pass. I mean, I think it's kind of like the,  the iPad and the zoom.  I just don't necessarily see the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Robert, you're buying one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's tough because it's not on Verizon. I need a new Verizon phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to be on Verizon, but it's not a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't use it as a phone.  Yeah, thanks.  The reason I want a Verizon phone is so I can use it as a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why I use a Droid X. If I need to make phone calls, I use a Droid X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking at the Droid Incredible.  It's very nice. Very nice phone.  What's the hot Droid, what's the hot Verizon phone right now?  That's, that's what I'm going to be buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think a Droid X because I like the big screen.  You should take a look at the Droid X before you opt for the Incredible.  The Incredible is very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The guys who are just here had a Droid X and it looks pretty nice.  I don't know.  That's an aside.  It's on T-Mobile. T-Mobile doesn't work in my house.  I can't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they said Verizon, Sprint.  It's going to be in everybody.  Everybody. Verizon, November 1st.  Verizon. Yeah. Verizon.  Verizon. Yeah. Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, everybody.  And AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then I might buy one for my Verizon.  It's for 3G only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. No, no phone.  RIP GOOG 411.  I guess it did its job.  It's it's it's over.  It's sad. I know.  Yes, I was using it.  I loved GOOG 411.  I have to go back to paying a buck seventy five for a listing.  Give me a break.  Why did they kill GOOG 411?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They got what they wanted out of it.  They got voice samples of the yin yang.  Yep.  And it made them smart about voice and they are good about voice.  And I guess it was costing money.  I don't know why they killed it.  That's what I don't get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you have a smartphone, you can pretty much do it,  especially if you have two point two on an Android phone.  You can pretty much do the same thing  by just pressing a button saying, yeah, and it'll give it to you.  That's true.  So you don't really need it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't used GOOG 411 in so long.  Yeah. You know, because I just use the Google Maps to look at places  and phone numbers and you use voice, Robert,  10 percent of the time, maybe five percent.  Here's a little tip, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can text. I didn't know this.  This is from Mashable.  You can text Google.  And the name of a text, the name of a location of a business to Google,  they'll give you the phone number via text 466453.  That's what Google is.  Let's see here real quickly.  Hardware acceleration won't happen until Chrome 9.  I think that's pretty much all of our stories.  Yeah, that's a good stuff.  Let's now we don't have a tip of the week unless Gina Turpani,  Jennifer told you to come up with a tip, did she?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She didn't, but I have my own.  Well, give us a tip.  All right.  Well, I've just started using it, so I can't totally vouch for it.  But email Oracle, it's a browser add on that works with Gmail.  And so you can track the email messages that you send and kind of get some  some analytics on that really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it know the does it know the email before you get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you mean? Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just making it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, actually, like it.  What do I mean? What do you mean? What do I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean nothing.  So it's a it's a it's a Gmail plugin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's actually a browser plugin that works with Gmail.  So I'm not sure if it works on.  I'm sure it works on a bunch of different browsers.  I'm using it on Safari.  But it starts a little tracking image into your email.  And then if your recipients are opening their email, I hate that.  I know, right. I don't as a as a recipient, I don't want it.  Right. But as a sender, it's kind of interesting.  You can set reminders.  So if you haven't heard back from somebody, you know, in three days,  you can get like a little reminder for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a website that offered this service, like,  who who read this or something like that.  So it's receipts, but it's sneaky receipts, sneaky receipts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's less creepy than going to Bing and seeing Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's saying a lot.  Email Oracle dot com track who opens in response to your email.  Thank you, Jennifer. Jennifer is at Mashable dot com.  You can follow her on Twitter at J.  Bruin. Anything else you want to plug?  Upcoming things you're doing now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm kind of boring.  Actually, I have a couple of speaking engagements next week, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where, where, where?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, actually, I'm doing a crap something at the AMA  next week and the local a local sponsored panel should be  should be interesting on social media and and business and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Perfect.  Our number of the week, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All righty here.  We have Comscore coming out with the latest video viewing, watching,  and Google remains way ahead with one hundred forty four point two  million unique viewers. Wow.  Yahoo moves up to fifty four point four million.  Facebook is to to a horse race.  Microsoft coming in fourth.  Hulu is in ninth place.  But interestingly, Google gets two hundred sixty minutes per viewer.  And Hulu gets second to that, even in ninth place for the hundred sixty  three minutes, which I guess would speak to watching real shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google gets two hundred sixty minutes per viewer.  Yep. That's per day, year, week, month, per month.  Two hundred sixty minutes a month.  That's like ten minutes a day.  I guess that makes sense.  Two videos a day. Yeah.  Three videos a day. Yeah.  Fred Figglehorn.  That'll take up a lot of that time.  What is that all about?  I know it's about twelve year old sense of humor.  My tool of the week is in honor of our San Francisco  Giants who are going to the National League  Division Series to face the Phillies.  I almost want to say to get beat by the Phillies, but I have hope.  And I was following. Actually, I love this tool.  And it's really nothing new.  You've probably seen it before.  I might even have recommended it before, but it's just in time for postseason.  It's Major League Baseball's at bat application.  There is an iPhone version of this.  There's an iPad version of this.  But it is on Android as well.  And I was using it like crazy when I had to go out and the Giants  were playing the Braves and I wanted to know what was going on.  Very important even during postseason.  Now, it's not it's not cheap.  I think it's I can't remember what it is.  Nineteen bucks, something like that.  It's expensive, but you can listen to game audio.  You can watch game video with an add on that's cost even more.  You can see what's happening.  And of course, you can see when the World Series happens,  you'll be able to see that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there any reason to use that while you're watching the game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, if you know, if we had a game, I guess I can go back in time  because it shows pitch counts, it shows lineups, it gives you a lot of extra.  You know, baseball fans are pretty darn geeky.  And just the ability to see the box score as it's happening,  the plays play by play, you know, I was watching the TV and somebody said,  who hit that home run?  And I just said, well, no problem.  Let me go back here.  Bottom of the second. Oh, yeah.  It was a it was Pat Burrell.  Burrell, you could see the fielding, the field itself,  but you can also see the plays as they happen  because their game isn't going on right now.  It's not showing it, but it'll show you as the pitches that come in.  And there's even little video clips that you can watch after the fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it is going to be it starts Saturday night.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  And yeah, I'll be using I'll be using this to keep an eye on on what's going on.  I have to say it's it really is a nice little application.  And I think it's going to be the inspiration.  I know the NBA is doing something similar for Google TV.  It's going to end up being the inspiration for.  Oh, now I've really got copyright.  Now I've got Major League Baseball on.  Oh, they're coming to get you.  Oh, now I'm in deep trouble.

Robert Scoble works at Rackspace,  where he interviews some of the most interesting people in the business,  not just of cloud computing, but all kinds of stuff.  You just interview some really good people.  You were saying today, who did you talk to today?  I can't tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yesterday, the reason I have a business card in my hand is I interviewed  Cardmunch, which takes pictures of your business cards  and sends them up to the cloud.  But what they do then is they use Amazon's mechanical Turk  to send that image over to a bunch of different people  who will type in the information and send it back to you.  And they have an algorithm to figure out the accuracy.  And they have an NDA so that, you know, your cards won't get  shared, supposedly, with other people.  But they do it. iPhone only.  iPhone only today.  I think they're working on other platforms shortly.  Cardmunch. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I use a card scan app on the on the iPhone that is mechanical.  And it would be much so much better.  Yeah. OK, I'm going to check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Worked pretty good.  The cards come back to you in 10 minutes to an hour.  Something like that. Scobalizer.com.
