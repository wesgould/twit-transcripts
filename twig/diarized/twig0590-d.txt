Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I just had random like intermittent fevers. Oh  Just tired I hadn't I had an ear infection. So very random  You know when you get sick after you've quarantined like crazy in your own mess. You think how did that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How could that possibly happen?  And flu disease it is way down because of this  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah  fine, I  Think it's cuz I'm showering or doing too much in my trying to stay too clean  Here no, I'm asking and then I put my then I got an ear infection. That's the bottom line

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, here's the good news FDA today approved the first over-the-counter  Home test for kovat 19 at last at last. It's an antigen test, which means you can do it in 10 minutes  It just a little nose swab  The only negative is you can get it you'll be able to get a pharmacies you get it online  The only well, there's two negatives one is $30  Cuz it'd be great if they were less if we're a little more affordable  I'd put a stack of them out front at the studio and before you come in you test  And you and you have to wait 10 minutes and if you're okay you come in  That's one negative is a price. The other negative is they they say they can only make about a hundred thousand a month  So it's not exactly gonna be they actually a hundred thousand a day  Australian manufacturer says it's gonna have three million tests next month, but they will be ramping up which means maybe price and availability  Will become better  So this is good news. This is that this is the rapid test that dr. Minnet at Harvard has been begging  for for some time

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I read about it and I was a little confused because it said if we have a negative on that test  You could trust it  No, I didn't think you could trust it. Oh  If you're sick and you still have a negative then you can't trust it  But if you're healthy and you have a negative you're probably fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It delivers a small percentage of false positive and false negative results  People who get a negative result but have symptoms should follow up with the health professional  Because maybe you do have it after all but it's about 95% effective the point being  It's effective enough to reduce the are not  It doesn't have to be perfect. Right and but it has to be available and fast  so  Thank you, Stacey. I'm glad you're feeling better

Oh man did they hate it I  Thought you guys  Were great, I thought you guys hated the little wimpy flute theme well  This is your way to make us love it and well I guess so as it turned out  I actually did a poll on the twig community, and I said I will consider myself bound by this poll  So whatever you and I got a lot of like the electoral the electoral college of just like the electoral college  Exactly of themes let me log in real quickly I have to do my two-factor  I'll show we'll get the we'll get the real-time vote results, and then I hate change  Yeah, I knew that I said that even before I did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  emails

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People actually had an opinion about this that's what's amazing the funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well the really the really funny thing is that then there were a bunch of competing polls so  so  My poll got 13 votes. Oh well then let's show the results bring back the flutes 54%  Keep the drums 31% what theme?  15% and then then somebody else had a much more elaborate poll who's a tab?  I love it make it the theme of all the shows. I like it. Please don't change it. I don't care  I don't like it. Please change it soon. He got 20 votes  And notes well, but I don't I'm curious  Now this is from May so this is the one that says don't change it from May I get it  Oh, so this is the flutes so really the people have it  The people have all all we're bringing 28  We're gonna do the drums of Facebook by the Federal Trade Commission  46 state attorneys general and Guam and Washington DC. It's not a theme. It's it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  twiddling your thumbs on a table

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, okay, the people have spoken that's the flutes the flutie flutes are back  Did you know I want the blobs now? I want the blobs we could I can make a thing with the book  I've often thought I should fire up technology  Yeah, exactly fire up garage band and do the whole thing  so  Facebook we're off to an unnewsies start. Well, no, we're getting back to it  Facebook bought full page ads today in the New York Times The Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post  We're standing up to Apple for small businesses everywhere  Come on really for small businesses you're doing this for small businesses  Apple as you may know has changed how iOS works  they've added something they compared to nutrition labels for food privacy labels and  Furthermore, they've surfaced a switch. This is the real thing  The turns gives right when you install an app and first run it gives you the opportunity to turn off the ID  for Apple advertisers  This was always available to you in iOS, but it was buried deep within the settings Facebook says  Many in the small business community have shared concerns about Apple's forced software update  Which will limit businesses ability to run personalized ads and reach their consumers  effectively  Okay, you think  Speak up they made a page  Speak up for small business small businesses deserve to be heard Apple's latest update threatens personalized ads  I thought they were just protecting privacy, but no they're actually putting people out of business  Man where do you stand about that? I think it's a good thing. I think everybody these things should be exposed  Facebook should be making its case to end users saying please let us spy on you and  Let them make the decision as opposed to putting ads trying to get Apple to change its defaults Jeff  You want to defend personalized ads?  Well, I'll tell you one thing there's very little evidence of personalized ads to actually work  So I think I'm gonna call foul on this oh, we're just trying to survive it's gonna put us out of business  That's much ado about nothing  Advertisers have always wanted more information  They beg us for more information, but ultimately they survive just fine  Otherwise the Super Bowl wouldn't be able to sell  multi-million dollar

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  30-second ads that they all they know is what the product is and depends on whether you have that much money  It's also a matter of efficiency and efficacy and  And it varies greatly so knows targeting in many cases does work depends on the case  Does it really their advertising Budweiser you don't need to target right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I was gonna ask what evidence you have this that that proves that the personalization does not work  And if it's not working why isn't it working? Is it because of what you have is happening behind the scenes well first of all

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think we have to prove that it does not work  I think you have to prove that it does work because you're invading my privacy in order to do it  Your privacy yes, you are privacy. It's not you don't think Facebook invades my privacy  No, well I mean I choose not to use it  But even if you don't use it Facebook still collects as much information about you as you can in these so-called shadow dossiers  So I and I would say that it's really incumbent on Facebook to prove that it works  Yeah, because in order to but but I but I think we can say  That the problem with personalized ads probably isn't the personalization if it worked really well  Maybe it would work the problem is that most of these systems just look at the TV shows  Netflix recommends for you or the or the purchases Amazon recommends for you these recommendation engines are notoriously awful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I fall into the 1% though regarding those services  I'm not a Facebook user, but I use Instagram the Facebook property which is highly customized right and  The ads that are presented to me are really good  I have to admit that they present things to me that would make me stop scrolling and say hey  What exactly is this?  even though some of the ads that come through are  Pretty bad products, but they are photography related. They are content creation related  You know they they figured it out and same goes for Netflix the recommendations that I get in its newsletter  Once a month as well as what shows up on the screen when I turn on the television  They're pretty spot-on

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, then I guess the also the second question is to advertisers really need that now Jeff makes a case that it's more efficient  Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because simply put especially on Facebook if I have to go to every woman  to sell this one product versus women who blank and blank and blank I can go to fewer people and  It's not about the targeting working in terms of hypnotizing  You it's the targeting working and not wasting your money to go and people who have absolutely zero interest and what that does is  Give you greater relevance for the ads that are there that to me is a service now the relevant ad  Might also be obnoxious and horrible. That's a different issue  But just to not give me ads that I couldn't possibly give it to them  Don't don't advertise diapers to me. It wastes my eye space. No, stop. I don't need them anymore  Well, I will soon but that's my god. That sounds so entitled

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I don't want to see this because it's not possibly something that's useful for me. I mean  You're giving up your privacy. You're giving up all of this data  Won't be inconvenienced by diaper ads is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Giving them privacy to reveal that I'm a grown man and and listen in the day so fine  I would have bought Esquire and it wouldn't have had diaper ads, you know, that's how it worked there

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You targeted you know, you buy twit and you get ads targeted at tech enthusiasts. Yeah. I don't actually bad model

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so here's an interesting thing though  Some of these and this doesn't really bother me but it is kind of funny some of these and this is where they're not very accurate  They use my love of tech for example for the longest time  They've used my searches and information to to assume I'm a man  so I get lots of irrelevant ads because their  Personalization isn't great. This does again doesn't bother me, but it does kind of tie into this doesn't really work

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's so that's my initial contention is  That the recommendation engines they're using don't they don't work very well  They're they make all sorts of dumb assumptions and and we all know that because we've seen the recommendations  Amazon produces and stuff like that if it really worked you think Amazon would recommend products that you really wanted now  I have to grant you aunt  Instagram does a fine job  I know so so maybe we should stipulate that done properly done properly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a different market. It acts might work. Yeah, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think about it a little more  regarding a recommendation engine for Instagram versus say a Netflix I  Know I feed Netflix with that thumbs up thing pretty regularly  I don't do that so much on Instagram, but I'm assuming Instagram does a better job to what I scroll and stop on exactly  you know, so I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you know I  Deleted my Instagram account for a long time created a new one  Within literally a few weeks of using this new account it immediately started suggesting stuff to me that I could barely resist buying  Clearly it's possible that it works. Maybe Facebook's got it. I do reject  Entirely Facebook's premise that Apple should not be telling people that they can disable this  Because it's gonna hurt our business  That is I call BS on Apple should absolutely be telling people and do you not agree Jeff people should have the right to say  Don't track me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I also think that that's like saying you have the right to see the New York Times without ads  well, no, the New York Times has the right to say this is my business and  You got you then no, but that's a step farther saying yeah, it's the same kind of thing  You set the terms of the you want this free well, I don't use Facebook I can set the terms of you getting it for free  Yeah, I agree. I and you don't want it then don't use it. But those are my terms. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's why I don't use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I don't use it with ad blockers. I mean, I know I could use ad blockers and but I don't want to give them the information  It's not the ads. I'm bothered by it's the it's the information that they're sucking up. They're hoovering up that I don't like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just don't want to support their business model. Yeah exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why that's exactly right well their business model is media's business model. That's the funny thing about it  Media created the attention-based business model and the mass media business model and the problem with the internet today is that they're copied the old  model rather than creating new models and  And we're I think we're the dying embers of the old model before they figure out that it's not gonna work much more  So that's why I'm not so concerned  I think the ad model as we've known it is gonna disappear because you're irritated with it because it's not gonna work because you can  Avoid it right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So do you while agree that Facebook is the doomsday machine? Oh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can imagine my blood pressure when I saw that and from somebody and a publication. I respect I respect Adrian LaFrance  I respect the Atlantic, but Jesus a better textbook example of moral panic you cannot imagine

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, then I won't ask you to summarize her point

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think maybe you'd be gave up on it like I gave up on our on our one-week theme

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it didn't even last as long as that probably  He's she says  Limitations to the dude she's talking she starts off really kind of dramatically  Yeah, that's kind of small. It's kind of moral panic saying remember when  It was the the notion of mutually assured  Destruction was what kept us from a nuclear war and at one point scientists even thought maybe what we should build is an automated  Doomsday machine that should a nuclear war happen will just take it the rest of the way and destroy the planet that way everybody  Involved would know any attempt to start a nuclear war will guarantee the destruction of the planet that will keep us safe  This fortunately nobody ever built although Adrian does say that the Soviets did  But I don't know. I don't know. Maybe it didn't work. It's all I can think  This if there's a doomsday machine sitting somewhere under the Siberian ice now. I'm a little nervous  anyway, she says limitations to the doomsday machine comparisons are obvious Facebook cannot in an instant reduce the city to ruins the way a nuclear  bomb can and  Whereas the doomsday machine was conceived of as a world-ending device  So as to forestall the end of the world Facebook started because a semi inebriated  Harvard undergrad was bored one night, but the stakes are still life and death mega scale is  Nearly the existential threat that mega death is no single machine should be able to control the face of fate of the world's population  And she says that's what both the doomsday machine and Facebook are built  To do the cycle of harm perpetuated by Facebook scale at any cost business model is plain  To see as the woman from mass media but keep going most people who are complaining about big tech seemed to the complaint seems to be  It's too big and that's in effect which what she said the mega scale of Facebook is what makes it dangerous  Facebook has conducted social contagious

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook is also what enables people who otherwise could never have been heard in mass media to finally be effing heard  Because they weren't because because gatekeepers like editors kept them out and communities and people were never heard couldn't be that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So he was what allows voices. Don't you think though Facebook has been used?  Most notably not exclusively but most notably to promote extremist causes. No, no, no a million times

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't see any of your damn. Who do you follow Nazis when you're on Facebook?  I see nothing extremist in my feed nothing. I think except you I think you buried your head in the sand Jeff  I think it's very cool. I'm telling you my feel I'll share my feed with you look my entire feed you  What I don't hear you're saying is it used predominantly for it? No Facebook hit  Well, it's no I give me the evidence hello like just like I had some minute ago give me the damn evidence

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is the definition of my proud boys resourcing in Washington to see or the evidence. I think you and honestly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the rise of extremism if not directly correlated is related. I mean I look yeah, I  Look at my dad doesn't believe that Biden actually won the election like he is a smart man

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And does he watch Fox he somehow well Fox is just I'm not saying Fox is not  Complicated although Fox is declared by the winner Facebook. Yeah. Yeah Fox was okay  It's not it's not that Fox is okay so much as Facebook is bad  I know I'm not gonna defend Fox or anybody else. That's another problem. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's one person but

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, it's not just one person Stacey that's I hear that all the time and I know people for whom that's an issue  I know a lot of people a lot of people who have who get their news from Facebook and YouTube and who believe it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My father doesn't people also argue that watches Fox and he gets it. Yeah, some will also argue that not Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  CNN and Fox are just as powerful as

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Facebook I disagree the cessationalism. Yeah, there's certainly that but I think that  old media  doesn't have the power that Facebook does to do this and and  Honestly, I think we're lucky that Mark Zuckerberg has not shown any interest in deciding who should be running the United States  Because if he did he has the levers he could pull you don't agree Jeff. No, I do not no you you give you give the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  American people no agency no credit for making with their own mind  You think and this is this is the perfect third person effect you Leo can't be affected  But everybody else are sheeple who are gonna be changed how they vote now  They run the country because Mark Zuckerberg decides something give them some credit  Yes, we have idiots in this country about 40% but we were there anyway. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think that if you see enough people saying enough the same thing enough time  It becomes less outlandish if I told you if I got on here every single show and I was like  y'all  Toothpaste is not as effective. I know this sounds weird, but if you use oatmeal instead of toothpaste  I do it. I would do it. I'll clean your teeth. I will say she said if I said it if Stacey said it, of course  And if Jeff you tried it you were like, well, I don't know about this  But Stacey said it sure and then Jeff started saying it and every week  That's what you saw was Stacey and Jeff talking about how their oatmeal oatmeal is so much better than toothpaste

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People are gonna start watch out watch out. Here comes a Gutenberg reference. Watch out warned you  When print started  Nobody trusted print because they didn't know who made it  What we trusted was what we would now call rumor because I knew the  Traveling salesperson who came through town and the innkeeper and I knew what they said and I trusted that this print stuff  I didn't trust print

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sound trust in rumors

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but the point is it did not it was not operated at that mega scale  It was very much limited by the fact that I had to walk from one to the other  It did happen but it didn't happen at the rate and the magnitude that it's happening now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I beg you to ask the ghosts of witches who got killed because of print  There was plenty of  Bad stuff like that and print print was blamed the same way  The point here is it takes time to invent the institutions that bring the authority  It took time to invent the notion of the editor and the publisher and the academic  Related to printing that came along to say that is reliable. That's not that's a newspaper or that's a book publisher  This is not we're doing the same thing now and we're in the very early throes and we don't have those institutions now  So what happens is there's a vacuum into which yes trolls and bad people go and manipulate that until we need to invent

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't you shall think the scale of Facebook quantity changes  The quantity of Facebook changes the quality of what is going on. I agree. It's not always made always gone on  I was a TV crew, but we weren't at that scale yet  We are now at that scale nothing before has had two and a half. It's a privilege. It's not privileged nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You've got your you've got your platform, but who all didn't have it wait a minute nothing in the past

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nothing now has had two and a half billion daily active users  Facebook operates at a scale that has never been before been seen and no two people see the same face saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You presume there's one bad thing on Facebook. Everybody sees it. No, that's not true Facebook's algorithm

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Promotes all sorts of stuff and that algorithm is in is really been given way too much power in the overall  Give me the data bud. Nope. There's lots of data  You've got your own sense Jeff. You just really you've already decided you do not want to hear what's going on  I'm just tired of having this argument week after week after week after week  You're not even opening your eyes. Well because because the rest of Greek can we go there Jeff?  We disagree wait a minute Jeff. The rest of the world is going there  You're the only one dragging his heels the reason this out of world panic even crops up is because you refuse to accept what is  Painfully I criticize Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This lots this is obvious  Doomsday machine is BS of BS and what it does is it hurts the internet and it takes off the voices who finally have  Their place and so we're gonna kill section 230 and we're gonna kill the opportunity for people communities  We were never heard in this country to be heard. I want to kill 30 and I don't want to kill

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's where you guys where this go kill face. That's where it's real quick because I think Facebook is very anti-democratic

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stop fighting

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This guy refuses to accept the way things are you refuse to accept that you need some data

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Asian of the American people  People voted for Trump. What does that prove nothing?

Transcript:  Have my issues just with with people in general the original posters of this  Ridiculous stuff that actually gets onto Facebook and continues to spread like wildfire and I'm not just talking about the political stuff  But people in general is just some weird societal norm now  You want to post a video of some people fighting out here in the streets?  Why why do we want to see that as people humans and then it just continues to spread and Facebook?  You know, they see that on their little data chart that who this particular post is just going out  So Facebook says, you know, let's just keep pushing it on over there and nobody thinks to say that's some bull crap  Stop spreading stupid stuff like this and you can take that to the next level with political lies and other crap, you know  So it's not just

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would I would agree with Jeff that that stuff has always gone on  What has changed is those you know, those people are people voice rumors are always been part of America of society  Especially American society, but what has changed is  This bully pulpit now  I agree with you Jeff that the pulpit is important to people who haven't had voices  So I don't I don't want to throw that out, but I don't I think you've you've got to acknowledge  There's a problem that somehow and I think it's because of the algorithm Facebook  Clearly elevates this garbage that you're talking about and  Because it generates engagement it gets clicks and that's a big problem  And so yeah, I don't know how you can say that's not a problem  I'm not trying to say get rid of the Internet or get rid of saying you 30

I'm all for that  I agree  There are real problems with the app store and Apple has responded to that by reducing  For any company making less than a million dollars a year reducing the  Their vig to 15% which I think is a very that's a good thing to do. Yeah  It's not the end of that and I think there are problems with the app store  I'm absolutely agreement, but I don't see any problem with Apple exposing to anybody who uses an app on their platform  Here's what this app is collecting. Okay? No, no, I'm okay with that. Okay with that. I'm fine with that  Yeah, but Facebook's not why do you think Facebook's not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Technology powers X should I give you two things that are really stupid that Facebook did sure would that make you happy? No  I  Know I'm criticizing them and I can't win. I just can't win would that make you happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, cuz you're you want to kill it. So I'm trying to give you ammunition. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right  Give me something that'll kill Facebook honestly  It's online 33 take that fella  Facebook working on TLDR

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To the first thing they're doing is they're working on an algorithm to summarize news articles so you don't have to read them  Oh, that's gonna make them real effing popular with the news industry that hates them. Good Lord

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're also looking all the trouble Google's getting from snippets. This is worse than snippets

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we're gonna summarize your article and take it away  And then the other thing they're working on is a means to I think they would talk about this before to read your brains commands  Another thing that Facebook's the last company on earth. You would trust to do that  I will admit that fully

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bonanza's you don't want them to read your brain even I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Know you and I even you found the line

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Point is they are reading your brain. They just don't have to put anything. Oh jeez  Oh, we are you don't think they have sentiment analysis and they know  That you're in a bad mood today or you're giving you an inch you take a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doing that we know they're having having this service to summarize the article does nothing in my opinion because  Most people just read headlines and keep there are already summarized  And reshare it after they read the headline because they fell for the clickbait

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The articles are too damn long. Anyway, they deserve to be summarized  That's what axios does as a business model

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It works the these announcements of product demos are part of an end-of-year company wide meeting which of course was probably private  But anyway, it's always leaks out  BuzzFeed news obtained audio of the meeting which is not public but was broadcast to thousands of employees. So  shock a  slew of pre-recorded company executives some who called 2020 a trying year as the company weathered a global pandemic  Oh, maybe what do you think you think and the backlash of the police killings of George Floyd Brianna Taylor and other black Americans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Despite the church takes a long time to get to the point actually  So it actually needs a summary it takes a long time to get to the stuff of the yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you know what I could use that tool to summarize this  Story it's called TLDR it can summarize news articles in a bullet points just like axios  Yeah, what's the difference if a human does it? I mean, that's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what we do. That's what we do every week, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, we comment on it we comment on it or entertaining arguments around them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We just use the story as so traumatizing really

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  First of all, Jeff and I love each other so like brothers why it worked but second this is important conversation  I think in the American future we're gonna have to deal with this don't you think  We could do mommy and daddy should not a top volume

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You asked for my microphone to go louder see I told you  Tl dr potted me down and you ruined it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  TLDR stands for too long didn't read in case you  Didn't know  You know honestly Facebook. This is an example of Facebook not thinking about  Anything except well, we know people want this so let's do it  We know it would generate engagement. So let's do it. Damn the torpedoes full speed ahead, right? Go ahead Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So well, I was just wondering, you know Twitter did there  Maybe you should read the article if you try to retweet something based on headlines and I'm curious how often you encounter that  Hey, maybe you should read this and never changes your behavior at all. I never get that. Do you get it?  Yeah, I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well trying to retweet one reason I know I never retweet there's that I don't retweet you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I do sometimes and sometimes it's because I know  I've already read the article, you know, and I encounter it again in Twitter and I'm like, okay, and sometimes it is it's just like  Oh  Maybe I so a couple times I'm like, oh, yeah  I guess I should be checking out the article and they call that feature something TDL TDL are so  Wondering if anyone else interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I get that on Twitter every now and then because there are some things that I will change your behavior because pardon  Does it change your change your behavior? She's asked  No, because when I typically do that  It's because I know the source and I already trust the source that is coming from it's like another creator that I want to support  I I know what they're putting out there. I know they're not putting a bunch of crap out in and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so I just whether we share it it's the value of value of a pre-print  Communication where you trusted the source rather than because you knew them rather than the publication, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But most of the time I do go ahead and read things  before sharing it, but if I already see the source and  You know sometimes he doesn't change you it's just out of your behavior

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has on occasion  Yeah, no, I usually trust the source but sometimes it's someone  retweeting something else or  Yeah, there was a scientific paper  Oh, there was a scientific paper the other day that I tweeted because I was like, oh, this is fascinating  And I had put it in Google keep to read it and I scanned it just like I clicked through scanned it  But I guess I didn't click through long enough because Twitter was like, are you sure you want to retweet this?  Are you sure you want to retweet this? Oh really?  Oh, wow. I don't know if it has a timer  and I  Was like yes, but you know what? I should have read the whole thing carefully because they were right  I could have been more accurate. It wasn't inaccurate. It just could have been Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter new Twitter slapped your wrist

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's funny because  Computer science has been working on these summary things remember word used to do this for a long time until Facebook said  What if we did this?  Nobody see nobody even noticed nobody even noticed these summarizers you used to be able to I think you might still be able to in  Microsoft Word take a long article and say give me a 200 word summary. Give me a hundred word summary. Really? Yeah  For a long time. Am I am I nuts? Does anybody remember that?  I'm not gonna say you're nuts

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never summarize

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's been around a long time Facebook and I take it line 35 is the other one  Facebook builds this is a good idea. This was not mine. This is Facebook doing cameo  Cameo is the strangest thing ever, but it makes perfect sense  Do you know about cameo you can pay a lot of has-been celebrities?  A lot of has-been celebrities to do a special message

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not has been not has been there's a lot of those folks out there that they're not working right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And this is just not working right now as a synonym for has been no  So, let's see personalized videos featuring your favorite stars Floyd Mayweather  Gabby Douglas Drew Brees, he's got nothing to do. He got hurt. He's just on the sidelines

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Roseanne Barr for 200 bucks. Oh, you couldn't pay me

Transcript:  Well, I guess you know if I were a celebrity I would really pay attention to what my price is like  Debbie Gibson $249  Yeah, Roseanne Barr's to 200 bucks Johnny we're Olympic figure skater 95 bucks that's a bargain

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Johnny we're some amazing. Yeah, that's a bargain

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's the Johnny he's the guy who looks busy that was the Winter Olympics that was two years almost three years ago  So maybe people have forgotten them  So this is an interesting way to make money

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Santa 59 bucks see Dougie fresh one of you my husband would love it Dougie fresh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's what by the way, that's exactly what they ask you to do. Oh, I'm not gonna do it. I wouldn't do this  Sugar Ray is only 90 bucks. That seems weird. Well, maybe he makes it up on volume  And you again yet somebody's at your door Stacy you want to go get that go ahead for me it's a package for Stacy  Johnny Damon a hundred bucks  shooter so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, maybe like you can oh my lord them having their own patreon accounts

Transcript:  Jenner is 2,500 bucks  Boozy badass  Who's boozy badass?  Boozy badass is $1,500 do you think he's getting a lot of work?  Shark Tank investor

Transcript:  Did you but okay?  Did you see the videos that the professors did at the beginning like a bunch of professors at a college got together paid for Snoop to  Do a cameo and then they edited the cameo into their video for like reading their syllabus  That's awesome, and it was actually really creative kind of thing brilliant  And  so I  Think the idea of getting like when used that way as opposed to like just sending someone a birthday card  It really kind of opens up weird avenues of creativity that I know Jeff likes to you know like you're at a toy video, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And this didn't exist until this is because of kovat right these people are all at home or no did this  Yeah, but it really took off  Yeah, so now face is it Facebook who's doing this Facebook's doing it  So sorry  This is this is kind of what the antitrust thing was all about was as soon as they see something successful  They say oh we can do that and they either buy them. Yeah, well, that's what I was gonna say this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a service that exists. Why are they adding this right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Where are they adding it after they've been sued it's called super it will let creators entrepreneurs or celebrities host live interactive video events  Oh kind of it's a mix between twitch and  Cameo viewers can tip creators by buying them digital gifts or pay to appear alongside a creator during the live stream to ask a question  to take a selfie  YouTube

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Coffee

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, now if if you see me on this  Sometime in the next few months, you'll know things have gone very poorly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it also kind of like only fans oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, only did you see how only fans now only fans which initial initially or at least in my mind  Always was about adult is this issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But now everybody's doing yes playing this to me. Is it is it now not just porn? I haven't gone there out of fear  Same here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because I'm going there  No, yeah  Yeah, so it could be a lot of things because you gotta sign in can find non

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Adult there's a lot of I could start there like Stacy explains it all for different topics, I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's like patreon. I mean patreon is the first of these pretty much, right? Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well, but patreon's a little bit different because you don't have to do the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Activity in right there in the platform page and rewarding something they're already doing. Yeah, you're rewarding the creativity  So it's a little bit different than creating a revenue. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Only fans does a similar thing with this with its super chat feature if you're doing a live stream like you would on twitch or whatever  And if you have enough subscribers  You can do super chats where they can pop into the chat room say what they want to say, right?  They select to do a super chat. It pushes them up in the queue  So you you as a creator see what their message is or question is a little bit and they pay for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they pay for that and it could be you can make a lot of money on twitch. Have you ever done that at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What twitch? Yeah. No, sir

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just you I know people who do quite well on  Twitch I know people there because there are also super donors  So I don't know if I can say who this person is, you know  But I won't say his name but he does it and he told me there's there's one woman who will throw thousands of dollars  Adam just like every once in a while just  So you can make some money  Only I know only fan people is gonna earn 300 million in profits  According to a person familiar with the matter from 400 million in revenue  90 million users most of which are paying subscribers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's very lucrative. So from their blog examples of the safe things  Soap making with may call  bathroom renovations with Winnie designs up photo editing tips with from Danny Batista and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See, I think this is a this is exactly what you were talking about  Jeff the really beneficial side of the Internet is giving people this direct drive access to their audience  Yes, it's great I think it's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh and well not just their audience but but and importantly when it comes to the hashtag to each other  Yeah, it's a it's a because the first amendment doesn't just protect the right to speak but also the right to assemble and  The Internet so the ability to assemble I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will also say though it can be a scary wild  Unpleasant place in most platforms who are trying to make it you connect don't think through  The effects of certain design decisions for  Marginalized or people who might be I agree. So I I think  Absolutely agree every time you rush out find your audience  You're so in danger of finding your we'll call it the anti audience can also you you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I see I say it's that but it's also if you don't design to avoid manipulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But so when we talk about those I feel like you shut things down  Because you you shout moral panic when what we might be talking about  I know we are just saying like Facebook is evil blah blah blah  But some of the decisions that people are trying to make and why people are suing Facebook is to implement some of these better  design decisions or to help mitigate the optimization for  You know crisis or in  In  So  I'm all for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, when you have a normal conversation like you being a mature smart  I am not going back to him. I don't care what you say  Then everything's fine, but if you're gonna scream that it should be shut down and it's a doomsday machine ruining earth slightly different things case  It's the scale of the  couch

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Google was out  You ever thought about being a therapist you have that nice calming voice you're very soothing you could offer cookies  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you have to be able to take well I would do that emotional heat in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you know come on man. You need help. That's why I'm here. Dr. Hickenbotham  I don't care you need some other help

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't deal with you. I can't help you. I don't want to help you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're not worth my good because I don't want to live with him anymore  Google was down on Monday and then down again a little bit on Tuesday  I know you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you want to know why we used to talk about this all the time?  And now it's now it's news because it happens so rarely yes, I do yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Stacy does it happen it's it's news also because more and more people are relying on the cloud for instance  We use gmail Lisa for an hour or two yesterday couldn't get in any mail  And this is a crunch time right now a lot of a lot of advertisers  Make their last-minute decisions for next morning right now, so this was a big deal that she wasn't getting any mail  So I think the reason it's a bigger story now is not because it doesn't happen more  You're right it happens less, but because when it does happen people are really relying on this stuff  So this was apparently related to  Google's authentication  system  So the root cause was an issue in Google's automated storage quota management system  Which in turn reduced the capacity of the authentication system and of course if you can't log in  Or you don't have the cookie and the cookie can't be validated  You can't get into anything in this case on the Google Cloud platform platform  Which is Google console Google's cloud storage big query the kubernetes engine Google workspace  Which means gmail calendar meet Docs and drive  You were getting authentication errors

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You imagine why mail wouldn't work for me on the web, but wouldn't work for me on my phone  Because it's I'm authenticated through the phone or

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Probably related to the fact that you had authenticated more recently on the phone and you needed a  Reauthentication on the web because you hadn't authenticated so lately so in other words the phone would eventually have failed  But maybe but it would have taken longer  Yes, so that that actually that's a kind of really nice piece of evidence your phone continued to get mail  But your desktop did not  So that that exactly sounds what like what they said it was the authentication went down. Yeah, you're right  It's not as big a story and yet it is a big story  Amaz remember Amazon was out for like five hours fail. Well, yeah, that's right Twitter used to go down  routinely all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now they're being heard

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you see that they're moved to AWS? Yeah, that's a big deal  Because they used to run all their own servers. In fact, remember they used to have a just dedicated Justin Bieber servers  Because he was

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Knew the guy who built their original architecture and then as that failed a bunch  Rebuilt it and then that continued to fail as they scaled. Yeah rebuilt it again. You knew that guy  What is he doing now? I have no idea spends a lot of time in bars. That's it. It was my old it was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The fail whale

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, I know the woman who drew the fail whale initially really yeah, he links Ying Liu she affect I have a  Her original drawing on the wall that she did for me and Lisa  She did it was it actually that's an interesting story  She did it herself just as an illustration. She's a very talented illustrator, I think from Hong Kong and  Wonderful person and  She did those drawings Ying Liu  Call it was called it was a birthday card  Called lifting a dreamer and it was on a stock image site and Twitter just said, oh, there we go a fail whale  It was a whale remember was a whale being lifted by Twitter like birds birds. Yeah  And they bought it though, right they didn't just yeah, although because it was stock photo  I don't you know stock image for it. I don't think they paid a lot  She's very she didn't she was very gracious. She was very happy about it and  She still calls the illustration lifting a dreamer  She I think she was very happy. I  have  Somebody I'll bring it in because we had her we must have had her on the new screen say we had her on something  and she just was wonderful and  She said she asked Lisa and me. What's your favorite animal?  And I said mine and she said an elephant and I can't remember what Lisa said. She drew us a little  Lovely little drawing in that same style. She's very talented  Cool, that's good stuff. Yep. Cool. Yeah

Transcript:  Get y'all's take on on when the pandemic will be over

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just remember it's not a democracy. But in this case, I'm gonna allow it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because because Stacey has better lobbyists than I do see yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey as my mom always told me you catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I actually I think it's actually the possession of this challenge coin that has made me feisty today

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  or a hole

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think this is really what's changed my life  I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alright Stacey work from home. Google said they're gonna let their employees. Oh, yeah work from home until September  2021 which I thought so September of next year they've moved it back from July  But then they also said they're gonna do they're gonna try this flexible workweek  That makes you work three days in the office and the other two days can be at home  Forever. I was I wanted forever forever the end of time. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's funny because Apple just announced June and a day later Google says no September  Which I think is far more real I think September is realistic yeah  I think it starts well in everybody to be fair

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple has they make physical product they need people in yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you got it and those are highly secretive, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's amazing. They need all their privacy army there. Yeah, yeah  It's amazing what they've been able to do without if they were good at ad sales

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They'd be out in the field, but they're not so they don't need them

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who yeah, so y'all think September 2021 is when we'll be able to  We'll be back to more of a normal setting. I'm curious when business travel will ramp back up and why I hope so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It all sort of depends on this vaccine to though, right? Yeah  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The one unknown we know the vaccine will work the one unknown is how many people will take it take it  But I predict you know there's been a lot of resistance affects transmission  That's right. Isn't that we don't know that right we have two unknowns

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's gonna take it and will it stop actual transmission or just suppress symptoms. I think it's gonna stop transmission

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they don't know it because they don't have enough data. Yeah, haven't studied it. Yeah, but I think I didn't realize

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw a really good thread today from a doctor who decided to enter the  The trial actually still  And  He goes through about how he was dubious about the speed of it  But then he researched it and found out why it was so speedy. In fact, it's quite amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why they've been working on it since SARS? That's why exactly and the woman who invented it invented it  30 years ago and was poo-pooed  She was actually demoted at her university because they said you'll never be able to make a vaccine that way  All right. It's a great story. The history of the vaccine is fascinating  But no, we have been working on it for decades and a sexist story too. Yes, very sexist

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So anyway goes through and through and through then I didn't realize somebody said in the comment that that he decided to do the  Trial because they needed it. He's a doctor himself, but I didn't realize that if he believes he got the  water  and  Wants to switch the placebo vaccine. Yeah, he's not supposed to for two years because they need to track him for that long  Oh, that's a bad thing. So if you commit to the trial, I didn't  You've got to commit to giving them data for some period of time

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you're in effect saying if you do get the placebo, I won't get the vaccine for a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what this this kind of state's my believe it or not. I don't know  I believe it was I just realized it was pretty obvious that  You need data for a certain amount of time because we don't know about things like transmission, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or even long-term effects. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Suspect people are most vaccines don't have long-term rights, right? Like it's mostly short, you know within within months

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just like most vaccines  Actually suppress transmission, but we just aren't for sure. No, right  And but but now I do think that when push comes to shove people are gonna do it  I think a lot of this resistance was in the abstract once it's actually available and your doctor calls you up and says when you're coming  In I think people are gonna do it. I have high hopes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll see I will a hundred or even though I'm like one of the last people who's allowed to take it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know I feel sorry for you Jeff and I I'm ahead of all of you. We're like way ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm gonna call it my house bourbon  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mean it's my house bourbon is basil Hayden's, but I would in a pinch. I will do angel envy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Angels in angels envy okay, all right the thing I even in a pinch  The thing I learned that I was really disappointed is that a lot of what you think of as good  Bourbons or whiskies like bullet are really not they're made in a giant vat bias by a company that resales them to other companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know about that a lot of them share the same mash bill. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's kind of depressing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But not Abel or recommend though

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Abel are not Bainbridge Island distillery no we have a little one over here called Griffo  We had our Christmas party there last year. I have their gin here. It's okay  It's I don't think their whiskey's that good though. Is it I like the gin the gin is nice and botanical  Google used a 64 camera rig to train portrait portrait lighting AI

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is this brand this is what I wanted that reaction  So they're essentially they're using machine learning models to understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Portraiture so that they can then put that model in the camera is that what they're doing it  Well again you go back to not hate to make this about Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now hate to make this about Apple, but go back to what Apple did in its last release with  the camera app and  Figuring out you have portrait mode. Yes, where it's gonna  Aesthetically blur out the background for whatever person you're trying to shoot  but then you need to have some sort of light light source in there that may not already be there and  That's the beauty of being able to sort of drag it around on the screen and make it to where it's natural looking  And not just the blob of an exposure exposure increase and this is just the next step in that to making  Photography on the smartphone is still just a one-click thing and not a lot of thought process into it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is on the Google AI blog  enhancing portrait lighting with machine  learning and  they actually this rig they they brought in 70 models and  64 cameras  331 individually programmable light sources and they just photos photograph people with different face shapes genders skin tones hairstyles  Clothing accessories for each person they generated  synthetic portraits in different lighting environments. Here's an example and  Then I guess the machine learning  It created a model a data set  So that the machine learning could then look at your picture and say where how they're gonna apply the light

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. Wow, and this is great because you can put this in  any type of smartphone camera that doesn't necessarily have all of the  Hardware, you know to be able to pull this stuff off because it's computational right? So that means keeping these phones under a thousand dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The other thing Google does is and they talked about this at IO  It to a year and a half ago is they are able to get these models once they train them and they're very large when  They train them but but they can then get them down to a size small enough that you could easily put them on  A smartphone this model is portrait lighting model is 10 megabytes. That's all  Hmm. It's kind of amazing  Lots of training lots of information. This is this is AI for the good not the evil

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like I said, I think I mentioned this last week where  My family there. They're just sort of used to it. If I say hey, let's get a picture  If we're out and about somewhere they automatically look to see where the Sun is, you know, they  Time yeah  How to how to make it work for the for the camera?  But now they don't you know, if something like this is in place  You don't have to think about that because it's just snap it and go

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  sparing but then  Economical what what are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? What do you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I meant like your tips in

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll tell you the deal. Yeah, I've realized this and I mentioned it in a couple of shows  So I apologize if you're hearing me repeat this but the the the the camera phones do too much  They take they they give you a great picture, but they do they tell all the creativity out of it  They decide this is the image is what's gonna look like this is gonna be the best result and ant  You still need ant you still need a good tool  You need the creativity if you want to do if you want to make those decisions not the AI

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You need to kind of a kind of a in a way a dumber camera a more

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Manual camera, right and then you need the help of ant. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hope to step in on the creative standpoint of it  But I also want to step in far as the fundamentals, you know to help people understand why that AI is doing what it's doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can you optimize?  Can you knowing that the AI is gonna be doing something the example?  I always use I took a great picture with a good camera and then with the  iPhone of my family sitting around a fire pit and the picture I liked was the one where the with the I  Turned the exposure down. So it's profiles and just lit by the fire and the phone said no, no, no, no  You want all the shadows you want everything and I don't I hate that. Yeah  So is there a way to kind of anticipate what the phone's gonna do and override it I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't speak to the iOS side, but at one point in time the  Google camera app had that HDR plus feature where you can toggle it on and off  I haven't seen that feature in there in the last  Two updates or so, I don't know why I can't turn it off  It's almost like they're saying, you know what we're gonna make this better for you. And in general, yeah  That's is great to do that  But you know, just like you said every now and then you want to have those dark shadows there because it sets the mood for  the scene

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google is is actually adding to its memories feature. Do you like the memories feature? I'd love the memories feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what is the member is that where they like just are like I say do you remember all those great meals you had in Paris

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Rough during the pandemic. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm like I kind of don't like actually I do like them because it's mostly pictures of my kid and then we all  It's cute because since we're all at home. I'm like, oh  Remember when we did this  Sad moments were like, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I  Absolutely dig it because it's been a bit of a bright spot every now and then  It's amazing dealing with so much crap with this pandemic  Exactly stuff going on socially and just every now and then that pops up just at the right time to say hey remember this  And just it just takes you back for a second and you know, it's one of the reasons I love my Google Nest hub max

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, they discontinued that but no they did they did the max  Yeah, the big man here, which I also love and I'm very sad about that is an awesome  It makes me they were gonna just  But the one with the screen because I get a great slideshow and  And it's it's always going and every and same thing and I'll go. Oh, remember that that was fun  He was so young then that kind of thing it's so much fun are you doing so we

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google just enabled this but  Sorry, I think we're in the middle of the change. Look should I tell you this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Play the drums play the drums quick. Oh wait before she says anything  In the change law go ahead  They just changed it they just did it  I guarantee you they added something called family note. I don't know. Oh, yes, that is new to the display

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, you use that something so I just started using it  And at first I just left my daughter because it shows so what you do is you say hey geez  create a family note and it's like what do you want this to do it to say and I  Started out with just silly notes like I love you kid and all these right  But now they in they display on all the displays around your house on top of the photos  Yes, like a post I do things like so  My daughter when she's downstairs, I'll leave a note and I'll be like  Bring up your laundry and then she'll see it and she'll bring up the laundry and it's nice because I know she's  It's just a it's a less obtrusive way to talk to her when she's not  in  Upstairs with me and but I'm not interrupting her school. So we're using it a lot actually they got this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  November 18th, so it's new enough. I don't think we I don't know if we talked about it  so  It's you can leave a note for somebody right? Can you put their name in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And well you say, you know Andrew do this or okay  So do this and then I'll say it's wrong  You have to say you also have to make sure you say family note because if you just say note

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know where it goes, but it doesn't it goes into your note. Yeah, you probably Google notes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it goes somewhere else never to be seen again

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So good, there you go, that's a guest appearance by Stacy Higginbotham in the Google changelog. Congratulations Stacy  Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But a democracy known as to Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did half the changelog. I put half the change

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you, Jeff in there. So just take that take that Google Photos is rolling out a series of updates to its memories feature  That's the thing that we were talking about the surfaces your photos from from the good old days  Memories will be expanded to include  3d  cinematic photos  updated collage designs and new types of memories  Which may include the most important people in your life or your favorite things like sunsets activities like baking or hiking  Whatever seems to matter to you based on what they can determine from the photos that you upload you can hide  specific people  Jeff or time periods if there are parts of your photo history, you don't want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also Google's gonna think I love receipts

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was a great receipt from the old days

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cinematic I get a lot of those remember that meal you ate. Here's the receipt for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Cinematic is neat. So  It uses machine learning. This is more machine learning to create a 3d representation  So on the left is a picture of a young girl in the fall leaves and it the cinematic is on the right it created  Look, she's she's moving closer to you. It's almost like the Ken Burns effect. Yeah, Harry Potter. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Google Google did that like it turned like if you took a couple photos that would turn them into a gif  Yeah, I never liked that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Giffy thing. Yeah, they're weird. Yeah, occasionally it worked really well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would I would try to bracket a shot and it would think that's a good action shot. Yeah, it's just yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and then here's I don't want to screw this up. Here's an example of what a collage  Would look like so it's a number of photos kind of like it would be a scrapbook

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it do you say it collage? I always thought it was collage. It's collage. Oh, okay. Good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, so the emphasis is in the second second syllable syllable. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been saying it wrong my whole life back to the I have to rethink everything back to the change  Back to Google photos with I know they added these features in but I wish it gave you a better  Search for going through those highlights of memories because if you go into the app and you just sort of swipe through  It's pretty limited. I  Don't see any of the things that it showed me a couple of weeks ago  but I  Wish I could just sort of pinpoint and say hey, I want to look at a memory that you select that you suggest it to me from  November  2020 something like that collage

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, I'm still trying to find somebody who says it. I like to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you do they're wrong apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's the lodge and there's the collage  It does it together with the lodge college collage, so it's like college

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sort of college

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's not like college. It's just college

Transcript:  He says yeah, I say yes boss to Lisa too  Yeah, but if you had like a lot of enterprises use  Actually though you're gonna think of it if you use workspace. I think you get a terabyte per employee anyway  So I don't know I get lots of yeah, there's a ton of storage so rich  Yeah, I don't know what that this is for for people using the big 10 terabyte  Maybe it's for photographers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I had to go up to the two terabyte. I used to as well. Two is a good amount

Transcript:  You see probably clean things up. I went away and said I'll just search everything in my life. It's easy  It's much better. That's just sloppy just sloppy the other day

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was I've never done this and I don't know why I've never done this but I have as we were talking about the  Nest Hub max which has a camera and  The other day I did a meeting in it. It was great  in fact if you use  meet  With Google meet. Oh, it's actually around. Well now that's the story. I was meeting up to that. I'm sorry  Yeah, you sure did Stacey cheese not that I've ever done that of course  So that's good  You can now do zoom calls on your nest hub max as well as Google me and do I should I think I did duo  But you know, it's good because the camera follows you around. It's a little my I was doing with my daughter  She said that's creepy. Stop it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I was going like this and the camera would move over

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I am really excited. I'll be honest surveilling for  Google to with their next generation  Like displays to do what Amazon has done by making the portal. Yeah  So Amazon now has it on their displays where it physically moves around. Yep, which will be key and then  When Google can do it Google does do it. I was just saying physically move the display  They just move your they move they they move the camera  But they can't rotate the display to follow you as you like the portal rotates  The portal I believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Amazons rotates Amazon's on I had the original Porter. It didn't go anywhere. Just oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Google's Google's displays have followed you for a while because I was in my old house and it would follow me around

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, talking to people. Yeah, I was really surprised. I didn't know that. No, I wasn't saying what I just I was saying  That was new to me  It's like family notes. Yeah, it's like family notes  And by the way, they are going to upgrade the Google or nest Wi-Fi system for video calling  So they're gonna automatically that's interesting. Yeah, explain that to me boss  It's a QoS quality of service a lot of routers you can do this manually  Where you say look if I'm you know this this IP address  I want this to get an improved service because I'm streaming or whatever  the device will detect video call traffic for either me or zoom and  It should prioritize it and say no. No, no, no  neutrality in my router  No, well zoom is not a Google product. So maybe that's me. You know what that may be why they're doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That may be whether because normals aren't doing QoS settings, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because it's hard. Yeah. Yeah, you gotta know what you're doing  So as you said, I'm very sad and I think we're gonna add this to the Google graveyard the $400  12 pound  Giant speaker in the Google family the home max. It sounded good  I think it it was as good as you know, the home pod any other high quality digital speaker  I really like it. I listened to it this morning. I listen to it all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think $40 is probably too much and I saw that's for dozens a lot and last week  You gasped on Twitter at the new Apple headphones

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah that's um, but the thing is  They're gonna still sell a ton of those because the people in that Apple market are used to that type of pricing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is a little weird that Google now the best speaker Google offers is just a little hundred dollar  Nest audio loss

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we actually talked about this a while back Kevin and I just because I was in this market for I have a huge room  It's like by 20 by 20  Everything upstairs basically and we were trying to figure out what I needed to fill that space adequately  And really the only option was either so knows  You know tied to something like the big so noses or  You know go for actual real speakers. That's what I would do. Yeah, I went with two nest audios and they sound really really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They because you compare them for stereo sound. They're only 200 bucks with $100 each and you think that that's a good sound

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a it doesn't fill the whole room. No, but it's okay, but it sounds really good and  It's better than the echoes which were too bassy for me  Yeah, and I even like it the home pods I have two of the home pod minis. Sorry to home pod minis $100 ones  Yeah, and so of all the $99 speakers as a pair those the nest audio were interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You prefer those to all the others. Oh look, what's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brave and many it's a beer can speak these for 20 bucks now looks like one of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  100 calorie Coke cans

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can get a pair of these and they'll do stereo I sound good two of them and I stick them in a room and it  Fills up the room nice, especially if you put them in a corner, right you get the the reverb. So  Yeah  20 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going the other direction. I ended up buying went out and bought fancy  Elac speakers and upgraded my audio everywhere. I just decided if I'm gonna be stuck at home  I'm not compromising. Although the max is so the max is in the bathroom now  That's it. And that's fine for the bathroom. Yeah, I have nice huge thing in a bathroom. I  Got a big bathroom

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And a lot of leather bound books, yeah, I got a book show

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  70 inch TV, you know  No, the bathroom toilet the bathroom is has two sinks and in the middle  It's a lower thing which I think is supposed to be like a vanity that you would sit at  But nobody uses that so it's perfect for the max. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I used to have a speaker in the bathroom in

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's great because I listen to podcasts or music, you know  If I'm going to work and I want to get up, you know  I haven't played little Bruce Springsteen and get get in the mood and stuff like that. I find that very  Yeah, it doesn't need to be a great shower  Yeah, it's not in the shower. So it doesn't have to be waterproof  But it's and that's so it gets a little not as loud when I'm in the shower, but it's okay. It gets me up  It's good. And I listen this morning. I listen to podcasts on it  It's good way to start

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The shower screaming

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm telling you the wild anything else in the change lock. Yeah, I'm going on the wild and the innocent the East Street Shuffle greatest  album ever made well the first three songs anyway, um

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's it. That's that's all you're doing. You're not gonna do the pixel feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Oh, I missed that one. You're right. There's a new I got it right here the new pixel feature drop  It adds more battery optimizations adaptive sound and yes, you don't have to have a pixel five  You can have a 4a 5g or a 4a  The pixel 3 or newer so this 4xl will also get it  You're gonna get hold for me the one where you put it on hold and then the assistant says hey, they're on now  Come on back, which I think is great  Extreme battery saver mode screen sharing on duo calls  Let's see what else  So these are this is one thing Google really I think does right  They it it I guess because it makes you feel like well  Why don't they give it to me in the first place?  But at least over time even with an older Google pixel you're getting new features a better stuff, which is pretty cool  And I did get that it got that in the December  Security update at the same time. So I think that's there's a good reason to have a pixel phone if you're gonna use Android I think  There's new suggestions in good in Google Photos including dynamic  Which which enhances brightness contrast and color and oh that's cool and a set of sky suggestions  Which help you create stunning sunsets, even if it wasn't so stunning  AI AI AI AI  Adaptive sound is an interesting idea it uses the microphone on the phone to  Adapt the sound quality from the phone speaker, which is terrible. I don't I mean I've seen things do this in fact all those  Digital speakers we talked about in theory use the microphone to adjust the acoustics  The mic the problem is the speaker in a pixel is not the greatest in the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google says the greatest on most phones, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I don't you know, how much can you optimize it?  but it  Equalizes the sound based on your settings and Google is quick to tell you that all microphone audio is deleted shortly after it's recorded  It's processed locally never leaves your device and audio and background conversations are never sent to Google. I guess I gotta say that  You can change the grid size wow  This is you know  I use a customized launcher a third-party launcher to do this but you now can use the pixel launcher to customize  The grid size of your icons. There is a feature  I wish they would add because I this is one of the reasons I use a third-party launcher the action launcher  I like to get rid of I know that's the phone  I don't need a text underneath the icon to tell me that's the phone or the Play Store or Google Chrome  I wish I could get rid of all of those but no you can't do that, but you can at least squish them in  Tight together so that's all in the new drop if you don't update your pixel regularly you should and that  the Google change log  Your picks of the week we will wrap this puppy up with a bow  In just a little bit, but first  You want to do it again really

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One more time it's just like I was doing the Facebook is evil story over and over and over again  So you might as well do the change log a few times. You know, what's the difference? Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  so  If if you want me to never again mention Facebook on this show

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm not saying that God's please I would love it. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The heck is this spritzer Stacy? Well, wait a minute now close the window

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hold on because I searched for it and I don't think you're gonna talk about what I just found so you better tell us

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, I  Already know that it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me just not Google it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twinkly three-dimensional lights it is from twinkly and so I am using this  I didn't pull it out into a circle kind of formation  I just pulled it out a little bit and now it's a star on my tree

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, which is get ready here comes a video of the spritzer from Holodynamics  Which is one of the companies that sells it but you say this is a twinkly lights thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this it that is it  That's it  So he has it all into the ball shape, but you can actually do it more in a fan shape  Which makes it better you can actually use it like that as a tree topper, too  so  and it comes in I think 200 and 120 and  y'all  Just these lights. This is my second year with them  I have them outside for like six months. I brought them inside for my Christmas tree

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So these are also like spritzer. These are app controlled

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Next year is icicles. John's all in  so the twinkly spritzer

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm just gonna say the twinkly lights so far  Still going strong still loving them. The app is great people complain a little bit about the mapping which can be a little  Iffy and you have to the one thing I will say is every time you get a new tree you have to hardware reason  You have to reset the lights because if you get a real tree, you're gonna set it up in a different configuration  Oh, yeah, you can't get the lights where they were last year. Yeah, that makes sense  Exactly, but if you have like a curtain kind of they have curtains like what you're seeing there  You could just set it once and let it yeah, John's curtains will always look that way. Yeah  They don't have to though. You can download new patterns  And just apply them with a flip of a button. I love these things. I love them so much  I'm sorry. I didn't tell you about them earlier so you could buy them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's too late. We already decorated my tree. Look at this. This is cool  So you can take you can actually kind of like paint your tree with the app  So the lights are on the tree and now he's in the app. He's painting  By dragging his finger on to light up the lights. This is so cool. That's crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you're like us I will say if you are like a  Completist OCD person these will drive you nuts because when you're painting they're never perfect every single  Yeah, and you're gonna be like I want that one, right? And that's gonna drive you nuts, but I love these they're pricey but

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So good, you know, it's funny because I couldn't remember who recommended them pretty much  Every one of our hosts seems to be using them now  It  So Laurie Gill has them Andy and I co has them was Laurie the first to mention Twinkly. Okay  so we give Laurie a credit, but Stacy's also been flogging the Twinklies and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not flogging the Twinklies. I bought them last year cuz I have been I will say for the last  Eight years ever since I got into IOT. I have tried many versions of to do all of lights. Yeah, and  Those were the first ones that I like was like you do everything I need you do it in a way that's easy and  Consistent because a lot of them not consistent and the nice thing is now and probably in the next year  So you're gonna see the Twinkly  Twinklies and those probably should be fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which would they be bright enough John do you have them like behind me in the studio or that they would be they're pretty bright  Okay, so I we should get some Twinklies is  You probably can you go to the Home Depot and get them or do you have to get you can okay  So I might run and get some so that we can have it for our because Jeff is just trying for it for a tent  Aren't you Jeff?

Transcript:  Yeah, I can't believe he only gave me eight. I'm just bummed. It was all for effort to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't do wrong. Do you really don't do well in class, but you get an eight for effort because he showed up

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's pretty much why technically it's not your home though. Leo. It's it's a studio. It is so it's not fair  I shouldn't really be in the competition. Yeah, we have actually the fact that you got an eight is really shameful

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He didn't see all the things and okay Jeff your number of the week

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so Mackenzie Scott  Who received used to be Mackenzie Bezos? She might know her right? I don't want to use her dead name, but yes  Okay, that's not a dead name bad. Jeff. It's not what is it?  It's her former name, but she did chose chose to change the name. Yeah  Yeah, she didn't want to be a basis got yeah, just gave away four point two billion dollars  to three hundred eighty four organizations across the US in the past four months  Including I am I'm delighted to say not to my college not to my school particularly but to CUNY my university  Sixty million dollars what we're the largest. Whoa, guess we've ever gotten for Manhattan Community College and layman's so great  Which sir?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, she gave Prairie View a and M which is it's I don't know if it's a formally historically black college, but that is I  Think it might be  Yeah, she gave them 50 million dollars to pay for students tuition bills  Nice for like during this time when a lot of kids who have to also work and do things to make their yeah  So I was like I saw that I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's actually interesting because she in her divorce settlement she got 38 billion  But like so many billionaires  Covid has been very very good to her. She made an additional twenty three point six billion dollars this year alone  so  Good for Mackenzie Scott giving away  So much of that money she plans of course to give back much of her wealth

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was it was so she says on the on the medium post where she announced it the team sought suggestions and perspective from hundreds  Of field experts funders nonprofit leaders volunteers  Leveraged this knowledge with collaboration with hundreds of emails and phone interviews

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the hardest thing is you may have the money, but it's hard to know where to give it. It's very hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, let's be is hard  They looked at sixty four hundred ninety organizations  undertook deeper research into 822  And then they put these 438 out there for evidence of impact on proven management team. Oh, I'm sorry  They put 438 on hold while they I think they could do better, but but it's research driven and rigorous  But that gives them the opportunity to be human and soft she says

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there was this this pandemic was a wind you know as much as it hurt  the lower 90 percent the upper  1% and especially the upper point 1%  It was a huge boon to them and they should feel guilty and they should give it to charity at least some of it  They should give back what the windfall profits from the pandemic I think and good for her  She's doing it and I think now now the onus is on the rest of them  We should do the Mackenzie Scott ice bucket challenge  She said okay now I challenge you Jeff to give 40 billion away. Good luck. Hmm. Yeah  Nice number and Pruitt pick of the week for boy for boy. No, it's 40 for boy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but Jeff should give ten times more away because he's Jeff. Yeah. Oh, I see right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He can  My pick I have to first one is going to be this  interesting  inexpensive camera gimbal  People watched our awesome  Hands on tech where I did the review of the van moved ebike. Yeah  Oh, is this a lot of comments about the b-roll? Yeah, and I said well  Yeah, I used a gimbal and it was this gimbal here that I was trying out and uh, it's inexpensive  It's about a hundred dollars cheaper than the DJI model that's comparable to this one  It doesn't require an app to be used. You can just balance your device on there and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
