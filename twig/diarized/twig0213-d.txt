It's time for This Week in Google, the show that covers  Google, the cloud, Facebook, Twitter, anything that we  really want to talk about, basically.  So when you have a panel like this, you don't hold them back.  You talk about Chipotle and Glee, too.  Gina Trapani is here from SmarterWear.org, founding  editor at Lifehacker.  She's the author of Think Up, which is a great Twitter  analytics program.  And To Do Text, a great To Do Text program.  Hi, Text Basis To Do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello.  Hello, Gina.  Hello, good to see you.  A new update to To Do Text this week.  Oh, good.  And I was actually just looking at the developer  console, and I have zero crashes and zero ANRs.  And ANR is an application not responding in the three days  that it's been out, which is like, ah, the heavens open.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there's instrumentation that you're automatically  notified if a program crashes or has a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I see the version of Android, the version of the app,  and the device that it's running on.  So I can test and reproduce, which is really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's really cool.  Neat.  Jeff Jarvis is also here, buzzmachine.com.  He is the author of Public Parts.  He's in his office at the City University of New York,  where he labors to teach the tenets of journalism  to a bunch of callow youths.  And greed.  And greed.  It's an exhausting job.  Also here from GigaOM, one of its most senior editors,  great guy too, Matthew Ingram, at his lake cabin.  So jealous.  Hey, Matthew.  Hi, everybody.  Good to have you back.  Thanks for having me.  Is everybody running out and buying a new Nexus 4?  No, I'm also jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jealous that Matthew has, obviously,  has good bandwidth in his cabin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you on 4G or something, Matthew?  Or do you actually have internet there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is internet.  It's a high-speed microwave from a tower across the lake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you can go there any time you want and work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Considering that you have the choice between taking a rope  swing and jumping into the lake and sitting on Skype here  with us, I'm really honored that you decided to join us.  You should be.  Very grateful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll make this painless and quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I interrupted you, Leo.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm just saying, I noticed.  There you go.  There's your Nexus 4.  I bought one a month ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bought one a month ago.  I did too, Matthew.  Isn't that funny?  I finally broke down and bought one,  and now they've dropped the price.  Me too.  It's $200 for the 8 gigabyte, which I don't think you want.  You know what?  You've still got deals.  Yeah, it's still cheap.  That's true.  That's true.  And it'll be what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I went back and forth between the S4 and the Nexus

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and finally went for the Nexus.  I think you made the right choice.  The S4, I've kind of given it up on just there's so much.  Samsung stuff on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I didn't want.  Yeah.  And I like the updates.  Yeah, 4.3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're already at 4.3.  I like it, in fact, so much that I decided not  to put my launcher.  Normally, I put Nova Launcher on all my Android devices,  but just to do really pure Google.  Really?  Yeah, and I like it.  Yeah?  They've come a long way, baby.  Jelly beans very usable.  I got my Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, you and the Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now what?  Now what do you hate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, well, I haven't opened it.  I need your advice.  I went into the store to look at it  to say if I fall in love with it, I'll open it.  If I don't, I'll send it back.  I'll wait for the Nexus 5 or whatever,  or I'll get the Moto X eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that way, you have to get a black or a white one, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  And a 16 gig, not a 32 gig.  But here's the thing.  The screen, to me and my old failing eyes, looks weird.  The text has a blue cast around it, like a blue drop shadow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you not used an AMOLED screen before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is that the issue, Leo?  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw your post on Google+, and I looked.  I immediately went to my Moto X, which has since been returned.  I had a loaner.  And I didn't see any shadow.  And a lot of commenters on your post  say, what are you talking about?  So maybe there's a defect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but then there was a lot of what kind of screen it was.  Somebody said it could be my glasses,  which I think is the case.  I went to the store today just before the show  and looked again.  I took my glasses off and looked.  I didn't see it so much.  Then I compared in the AT&T store my Nexus 4 and the HTC One  and the Moto X one after the other.  The Moto X is just many times brighter white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's of the three that you just mentioned,  the only AMOLED screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And so I guess maybe it has some impact on my correction  or something like that.  Could be.  But there's this weird blue haze around the letters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would look at a set.  But you've looked at several different ones, right?  I mean, it's all of them do the same thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and somebody said on my post, well, it's been burned in.  Well, no, it's been there for one day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say don't get that then.  Yeah, I was going to say.  I don't see it.  And then apparently, it's not common.  But if you see it, you shouldn't get it.  The Galaxy Nexus, I didn't like very much  because I thought it was a substandard screen.  I've kind of come around on that.  You mean the Nexus 4?  I mean, what did I say?  Yeah, the Nexus 4.  The best screen out there is still probably the HTC One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But there, the difference in brightness of the white  was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but it might be more natural.  What AMOLED does so well is contrast ratio.  Blacks are blacker than any other kind of screen,  and whites are whiter.  The contrast ratio is amazing on AMOLED.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do I dare ask this?  What does AMOLED mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Organic Light Emitting Diode, OLED, is different from LCD.  So most of these other screens are LCD screens,  which means they have a shutter which lets light through.  So they're backlit, and the light comes through,  and the shutter opens and closes,  and it does colors that way.  OLED screens are actually direct view.  They're emitting the light.  Each cell, each pixel has its own,  is emitting its own light.  There's no backlight.  And so they tend to be brighter.  They're also more efficient.  One of the things Motorola is taking advantage of  is the fact that you can turn on individual pixels  without turning on the backlight.  That now explains it.  You know such neat stuff.  You know that?  Well, then that's why you have that hovering,  that pulsing wake up while it's sleeping,  because they don't have to turn on the whole screen.  And so it sips it juice.  The other thing that you should know about OLED screens  is when they're black, they don't use any power.  So you always want to use a black theme  for best battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so glad you asked, Jeff,  because honestly I did not know this.  I appreciate the explanation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought everyone knew that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I, you know, it's one of those things where,  yeah, hardware just never...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not interesting, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, not as interesting, but when you explain it, Leo,  it makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, back in the day, when I, you know,  many years ago, my child was listening to Twitter,  and they would get going in some kind of thing about a TV,  something going on with video drivers,  that kind of stuff.  I was like, oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're talking about tech TV.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Video drivers.  Well, you know what's funny?  One of the reasons it's interesting,  you asked that, is I just got the first OLED television set.  LG and... Oh, you got it.  It's coming tomorrow.  LG and Samsung are selling, for the first time,  OLED-based screens.  You know, all our screens now have been plasma or LCD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You need to invite six people to your own boxings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a lot of people coming over.  Robert Heron from Revision 3 says, can I review it?  I said, yes.  Scott Wilkinson's flying up to calibrate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of geeks are into this.  How much are they?  9,000, which is, the way they got me,  that's the TV right there,  the way they got me is that the LG is 15,000.  So I thought, oh, this is a great deal.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's curved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's curved for no apparent reason, yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because they can.  Because they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's more energy efficient.  And the blacks are better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Blacks, well, and Consumer Reports  has already reviewed this particular thing,  and they say it's the best HDTV we've ever reviewed,  with the best contrast ratio, the best blacks,  the best whites, and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For nine grand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What people complain about OLED,  and of course Samsung uses its Super AMOLED screens  on the Galaxy S4, is that it's inaccurate.  So, for instance, the HTC One is more accurate.  That's why the white isn't quite as bright,  or the colors are maybe a little more accurate.  But I don't think accuracy in a screen this size  is all that important.  No.  So the fact that it's bright and easy to read,  to me, is more important, and better on battery life.  Just makes it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you thought I was just gonna complain about the most.  I did.  I thought we've had a nice lesson.  I did.  Educational moment.  I thought you were gonna whine some more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was such a teaching moment.  So did you get it?  So you're still undecided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's still sealed at home.  Which is very hard for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff, you're so slow to make these decisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I appreciate how much thought you put into them.  Look, every single purchase like this,  there's trade-offs, right?  Like you're never gonna get the perfect, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's, I keep saying that there's not,  I've yet to see the perfect smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, well, if we arrive there, then that's good.  Well, Apple thought we had it, but we didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, our mobile guy, Kevin Toffle,  was gonna get an HTC One because he was seduced  by the hardware and so on.  And he actually either sold it,  or, and he's getting the Moto X.  Yeah, Kevin really likes the Moto X.  Yeah, he said it's the ultimate Android phone,  as far as he's concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say that's pretty close to true.  It is almost a pure Android experience.  The places where it's not are the advantages of the camera,  twist the wrist camera and the, you know,  the wake-up thing and stuff like that.  In every other respect, it's very pure Google experience.  Right, it's like progressive enhancement

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  based on sort of specialized hardware, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  And I do like the, I do, you know,  I like how it feels in the hand, which is hard to describe.  You know, you can't describe it,  you have to just go try it.  It really feels, of all the phones, the best,  for some reason.  There's something about it.  It's a little smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I was concerned maybe,  I've gotten so used to a big screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, at 720p too, which is a disadvantage.  Yeah.  It's not that small a screen,  but it goes almost edge to edge,  so the overall device is-  How's the battery life really running?  Excellent battery life, which I think,  I think watch carefully what Apple does in a couple of weeks  because I suspect that's going to be one of this chief  new features that people aren't really talking about  on the new iPhone, is battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Better battery life?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the rationale of the Nexus 4 for $100 less,  if this were Apple reducing price,  they're getting rid of stock and it means,  oh, something new is coming.  But that's not the way it seems here.  They did it all around the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there's a,  I think you could pretty much say there's a Nexus 5  just around the corner.  I think you could pretty much say that.  But we don't know anything about it.  There haven't been any leaks, have there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, not that I'm aware of.  There's been a lot of speculation.  Although I missed all about Android last night,  so I'm behind on my Android news,  but no, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Gina is one of the hosts of All About Android.  That's where we look to her for that information.  You know, Kevin just wrote on GigaOM.  Guy Kawasaki, every time I say anything about the Moto X,  for some reason, I think that's changing now,  but people for a while thought I knew something,  which I didn't.  But every time I said something, it would get quoted a lot.  Guy Kawasaki sent me off.  Why did you say it was only $350 to make?  And I said I didn't.  That was Goldman Sachs said that, and I was quoting them.  Well now, according to Kevin Toffle and IHS,  IHS does this kind of assessment  of what the components are.  A tear down.  And a guess at what it must cost.  IHS says, no, it ain't 350 bucks, it's $221.  Or $226, depends on the...  Yeah, that's a good price.  And it's one of the reasons I think maybe  I'm surprised that Google doesn't offer this  as the Nexus 5 or something like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well then they'd undercut.  No, they can't, can they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Carriers.  Yeah, you're right.  And actually, if you think that seems awfully low,  that's actually right in the, according to IHS,  the iPhone is 207 bucks, a little less.  The Galaxy S4, 237 bucks, a little bit more.  So it's right in the...  Right in there. In that range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The developer versions?  The developer versions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Go ahead, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just gonna ask when the developer version  of the Moto X is...  Any minute, right?  ...to be available, and soon, right?  And there will be a Google Play edition?  No. Or there will not?  There will not.  No. Okay.  It doesn't make sense for them to do it.  There will just be a developer unlocked.  Yeah. Right, because the extra features  take advantage of the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so pure as it is, by buying a Google edition,  you'd just be stripping useful stuff out without any gain.  But they will have developer editions.  And all that means is unlock bootloader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unlock bootloader, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the words developer edition on the back.  Oh, it's just kinda cool.  Yeah, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm gonna get one for one of my developers,  and I wanna get the developer edition,  but I want some holding out on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It will be also a 32 gigabyte,  and we're starting to see the off-contract prices now,  right?  629 bucks, I think it was, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  674 with tax and delivery.  Ooh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But again, this is kind of normal.  I guess the only reason that you might say,  well, it should be less, is it's a 720p screen,  it's not this super high-res screen.  I don't know if that makes a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, here's the thing,  but is it a bit of price fixing, just to be provocative,  in that because of their conflict of interest  and channel conflict, they don't wanna undercut HTC  and Samsung at all too much?  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, right, they have to pay attention to that.  They wanna keep these other guys happy, I think.  Definitely.  And then the issue is, of course, of the Android version.  I think you're gonna get Moto X to 4.3 very quickly.  I don't think that's a real problem.  Although, you know, the HTC developer,  just the HTC One, is now at 4.3, right?  Or isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the Google Play,  the Google Play just did get the update, yep, yep.  Which was nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  HTC said, we're gonna do it fast, and they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So anyway, I'm sorry that we got into an Android discussion.  We should defer that to all about Android,  but it is kind of a big part of Google's business.  Yeah, it is.  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just a little tiny part.  Just a little tiny part, but interesting.  But interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, we're getting a little echo from you now.  I don't know what that's, who's that coming from?  Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Haven't isolated yet.  We're, okay, we're working to isolate that.  As soon as we've triangulated it,  We'll send a team out to handle it.  Here's a product I like, the Robocar.  Apparently, according to a Jessica Lessons blog,  Amir Afrati writing,  Google has started to talk to people who build cars.  They're contract manufacturers, not the big names you know,  but people who build cars for other people  about building self-driving cars.  No one's talking, but they've been talking to Continental AG  and Magna International to manufacture a Nexus car.  I hope they call it Nexus.  Oh, what one, what one.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I put the Nexus on, but I think that if it's,  Google should name everything that's a Google edition,  should be a Nexus, right?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, the Nexus.  It only comes in primary colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope it's like that Tesla that,  was it Larry or Sergi was driving?  The Batmobile?  Yeah, the Batmobile, and had the chrome logo on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what's interesting, it would be self-driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, the other report rumor is that they would actually  build instead a fleet of self-driving taxis.  Taxis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  They could do both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  I love the idea of self-driving taxis.  Yeah.  And apparently Uber is interested in acquiring these.  It's the investment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, the Mongo investment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the robot would have to take you to Brooklyn,  you know, for as long as.  Yeah, exactly, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All cars lead to Brooklyn.  According to this article,  at first, robo taxis would require the human in the car  to sit behind the wheel in case of emergency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they would just talk then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  To you.  I don't know if this is legal or what,  but I hope they do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That would be very cool.  Well, meanwhile, the war is coming up.  The next story on the rundown is that Nissan is saying,  not so fast, Google, we are gonna build  self-driving cars too.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, is that, you know, I mean, I assume they are,  but their target seems incredibly ambitious.  I mean, you can't just whip up a self-driving car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's not whipping it up, Matthew,  because I think all of the manufacturers  have been looking at this for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess they probably have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  GM had a concept car two years ago at CES  that was an urban transport,  autonomous urban transport vehicle.  I rode around and it was very cool.  It only had seats for two.  I said, well, what if, you know,  what if you have a family?  They said, well, it's autonomous.  You just get a few more and you daisy chain them  and they just drive, they go wherever you're going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's like, oh, that's the further rendition of,  we can look it up real quick, Chad, the Homer.  The Homer is the ugliest car ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody's making the Homer, right?  No, Homer Simpson's car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, I don't know how serious they are.  There were two bubbles.  And so the kids were the other bubbles.  You didn't have to hear them.  They have leg irons in a shag carpeting  and many cup holders as you can imagine in heaven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the actual.  The leg Homer.  Here's the actual.  Leg irons are optional.  Yeah, leg irons.  Here's the actual Homer car.  Somebody has built it  and I think they're gonna start selling it.  Wow, no.  Well, I don't know.  They don't, I don't see how you guys know.  There's a model version.  Here's the full size version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.  Oh, kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just a modified something.  I like the Bentley grill or whatever,  the Rolls Royce grill.  Maybe it's a Rolls Royce.  You won't catch me driving that thing around.  There's the Homer, ladies and gentlemen.  The horn.  There are three horns because Homer says  you can never find a horn when you're mad.  And they all play, of course.  La cucaracha, la cucaracha.  Gigantic cup holders.  Powerful like a gorilla yet soft and yielding  like a Nerf ball designed for the average man.  The team at, believe it or not,  there is a company called Pork U Beamer Motors has built one.  It's a race car.  They're gonna race it at the 24 hour of Le Mans,  not Le Mans, Le Mans,  which is in Buttonwillow, California, not France.  Buttonwillow.  Buttonwillow, I don't know where that is  and I live in California.  24, oh no, I'm sorry, I wasn't pronouncing it right.  Lemons, L-E-M-O-N-S, the 24 hour of Lemons.  Now, now I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See, this is what's gonna happen now  with Facebook and Google.  When they start making cars, we're gonna become auto-weak.  We're gonna become a phone-pock.  We're everything now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Closest airport.  Not enough cup holders.  More cup holders.  Actually-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't this the head of GM who said,  no matter what they do to their cars or Ford,  no matter what features they add,  the number one criticism is not enough cup holders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You cannot have enough cup holders.  That is the silliest thing ever, right?  So my new car, which comes in two weeks, three weeks,  something like that, has Google Earth as its map.  Get out.  Get out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does Google Maps- What kind of car?  ship with most cars at this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. Or is it usually the cars now system?  So I was thinking about Google building self-driving cars  versus Nissan building self-driving cars.  This is where Google's brand trust plays such a big role.  Because Google has been navigating me around,  whether I'm on foot or on my bike or my car  for a long time now.  So I trust Google to get me where I need to go  because they've been doing it.  Because Maps is everywhere.  So I'd almost be more likely to choose the Google car.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that's a really important point.  And the trust is not just directions.  It's also trust really in technology.  At some point you understand how a car car works  and the brakes work or whatever.  Okay, that's physical.  But to get to the smarts that are necessary  to make a safe self-driving car, who are you gonna trust?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Google's the moonshot company.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't want Apple Maps in your GPS.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although I should say there's a couple of companies  who've shown that because they're putting Siri  and like a lot of companies are putting Siri in their car.  And who was it?  We saw Apple Maps.  It was a Chevy.  It was one of the car companies.  Has Apple Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's Google Earth that's coming with your new car,  not Maps.  It has Google Earth.  Yeah, I wonder why there's a distinction between us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's an Audi.  You have an Audi coming?  I have an Audi coming.  Ooh, which one?  I ordered it in May.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whoa.  Jeez.  Is it custom or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, apparently they're all custom.  So we would build this for you and you give us $5,000.  Then we'll talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's for the doors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have to drive it across the Atlantic.  It takes a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you gonna be on vacation when your car shows up?  He's so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You should have gone and done the pick it up in Germany.  I should have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really wanted to and I almost did actually.  But then I thought, oh, I have a job.  That kind of ruined that.  Plus, I still can't figure out  how you get across the ocean.  Just they build that into the price.  They do.  We did that when I was a kid.  We went to, was it Darmstadt in Germany  to get our Volkswagen?  Wolfsburg.  Wolfsburg, that's right.  Went to Wolfsburg, got the Volkswagen.  And then you have to arrange transport.  And we came back on the Queen Mary  with the car in the hold.  Really?  Yeah.  We got a better deal  because we were taking a car with us and passengers.  I guess it's $50 for the extra bag.  I don't know.  This is 1967, everything's changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have this vision of a different lifestyle for Leo  that you had your nanny and your maids with you.  We did.  We did.  Crates of personal belongings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had my steamer trunks brought on by the boy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He has a little red hat.  No, it was much more like the Marx brothers  jammed into the cabin.  My dad was a professor, Jeff.  You know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, speaking of which,  did you get your Nexus 7 LTE version yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no!  I want it.  It's for sale every day.  Every damn day I search for Nexus 7 LTE.  Way to go, Leo.  And we're gonna get it.  No, and now here's the latest in dignity.  It's for sale in Germany, the UK, France.  I'm telling you, France gets it first.  What the hell's wrong here?  How dare they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're Frenchies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not-  Jeff, you have friends in Germany though.  Just get them to send you one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, because it's the different frequencies.  You don't want the German version.  Oh, right.  You want the US version.  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nice job, Leo.  We don't get stuff all the time in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm pretty used to it.  Right, you are, you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no point in getting a Canadian Ryland.  See, that's the nice Canadian thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead, screw us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We'll apologize for it.  Sure, send it to us a couple years later.  We're not like that down here, Ingram.  I want my Nexus LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Matthew, you really have to adopt

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the American sense of entitlement  if you're gonna be on Twig.  That's right, get with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where's my Chromecast?  I had this vision today that the Samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and I had this vision today that somebody  with a sense of humor at Google would put it on for sale  right now during the show  and I'd have to order it during the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll order it for you.  I've gotten very good at talking and ordering crap  at the same time.  It's a major life skill.  I can get stuff like that.  I put my credit card in all prefilled and everything  and just push a button that goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's it, you got four Chromecasts with four.  That's like five.  Did you get five?  And you got five Netflix codes as well, right?  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You got them early enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did, but now they say you can't use them all at once  but I think, I'm believing that I can apply  the next one in three months.  Or three months.  And the next one in three months after that.  They have that, I'm a little disappointed.  Nothing's been added to Chromecast  and in fact something was just taken away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, but don't get your knickers and knots.  Oh good, good.  And everybody went crazy on that story.  Everybody went crazy on that story.  What's the name of the app?  It was first the back.  Allcast.  What was it?  Allcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was Allcast, he changed it to Allcast  because of trademark reasons.  And I think it's Kosh I learned.  He pronounced it Kosh.  It's not Kosh?  I was pronouncing it Kosh, it's Kosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And so it suddenly wouldn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So there's stories all over about how Google's cutting this  out, Google has a grand conspiracy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google has this, Google has that.  Well, it turns out it's just that it's a beta folks  and they made a change and it's not compatible right now  and they didn't do it on purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kosh kind of fanned the flames by saying that they had,  he felt that they had intentionally changed  a particular parameter that he was using.  He wasn't using the SDK by the way.  He reversed engineered the protocol.  So he was completely going around.  So they changed a little bit of the protocol  and he said they did it intentionally  and yeah, turn it into a whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's on the rundown below that story, Leo.  Google put out a statement saying,  Yeah.  Nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, although, isn't it using dial?  Isn't it using this open source protocol called dial?  Which was why Kosh could probably reverse it.  It seems to be from what I looked at,  that everything Chromecast is doing is based  on various open source technologies integrated into.  That would surprise me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, the Google cast protocol, right?  Maybe that's based on dial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is a similar, very similar open source, open standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I have a problem with Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's strange that they're being so conservative  and shutting down apps this early on  or like not enabling streaming a video  directly from your device to their Chromecast.  I mean, what Kosh did was very basic.  I don't know why they would have.  You're still believing they shut it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Their statement said they were just screwing around  with the SDK and changing things.  And so it wasn't deliberate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're saying they didn't deliberately shut this down.  They made a change and that change had an impact  on something that they didn't have any role.  This happens all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He probably had hooks into it somehow  and they changed the parts that he was hooking in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're a developer, Gina.  This happens all the time.  If you develop with a non-public API,  it's not Google's fault if that change is underneath you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it really is.  It's a bad, I'm waiting for Matthew's post about this.  Matthew will be writing this probably while he's on the show.  You could order things, Leo.  He'll write a 40 inch post on this.  While we're on the show, I guarantee you.  Because it's a journalistic issue here  that he'll piggy on.  That is, right, Matthew?  That is that the world,  I went through looking for the rundown  and I went through by Google search,  there were stories everywhere about Google shutdown,  Google shutdown, Google shutdown,  and nobody did any reporting.  This is the problem with our current tech press  is nobody sat back and looked at something and called  and said, what's going on here, Google?  And when you do, gosh, amazing, fascinating things happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think we're very, first of all,  part of that is cynical.  You gotta be, in the blog world, you gotta be first,  you gotta get the headline.  It's a much better headline to say,  Google shuts down Kosh, Kosh, Kosh,  than it is to say, oh, Kosh used to,  Kosh used to unpublish API  and it got changed out from underneath him.  And of course, he fan, as you said, Gina,  he fan the flames by complaining about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He framed the story that way.  He said, I believe they did this intentionally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The biggest problem for me is a lot of the tech press  isn't technical.  And so anybody who's technical,  anybody who's, we've seen this over and over again,  APIs, unpublished APIs are always risky to use.  It happens with Microsoft and Apple too.  If you use an unpublished API,  you're running the risk that things will get changed  and your stuff will not work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  In fact, even if you use a published API,  you run that risk.  Yeah, sometimes that can happen.  We've seen lots of startups,  rely on Twitter's API or Amazon's API,  and then they change it.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know, Kosh is kind of a rock star in the community  and people really look up to him and love his stuff  and he makes really cool stuff.  So I think what he says,  Google intentionally broke my app.  That's what gets.  How old is he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's probably a kid, right?  I mean, how old is he?  He's 11.  He probably is.  He's 11.  He probably doesn't know that, you know,  hey, knock it off, Google.  It's fun for him.  He's a one man army of, he's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think you know,  to get serious about the journalism part,  Leo, I think that it is much more,  you're gonna get more page views,  you're gonna get more people excited  if you say Google did something bad  or Apple did something bad,  then you will kind of calmly explaining  that something totally rational happened.  And that's unfortunately, you know,  the incentives are all mismatched.  Like you're not gonna get as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you've been after you've seen this too.  When you actually,  the one person who does go to the effort  to do the reporting and to call Google,  you know, I don't report much anymore.  But when I do do that,  I get more attention to those posts than anything else  and they actually have substance in them.  And that's what people do end up passing around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know, you can win in the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true.  But you have sort of 100 of the other one.  And then there's the one person who writes  the kind of debunking post and says,  just relax, this is what really happened.  And I do find those have a lot of value,  but it's usually like one to a hundred ratio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, everybody's aware,  everybody's a little cynical,  everybody's aware of,  you know, a how this is how money is made.  And, but I also think there's a kind of a dearth  of technical information.  There's certain blogs that you could trust  that you know when a non-tech says something,  ours technical when John Sircus says something,  there's certain people that you just know  when they say it that they're coming  from a deep technical knowledge of the thing.  And they're not writing the,  and they probably don't generate as much traffic.  Well, speaking of which,  we're gonna come back and talk about  twerking and Miley Cyrus in just a moment.  But I'm not gonna talk about that.  Miley Cyrus in just a moment, but.  Oh God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's always that tension  between explaining something in a way that's like grockable  by people who are interested,  but maybe not developers are highly technical.  You know, that you always, I always felt like a life hacker.  I was worried about being too reductionist  or too simplistic when explaining things, you know,  but you want to explain enough.  I mean, there's some of that, but you know,  but no, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you guys always did a great job.  I thought like, I am not a super technical person.  I know enough to get around,  but I always thought life hacker hit that mark really well,  where you explain enough to make it obvious  that you know what you're talking about  and to give people a grounding.  You don't go into mind boggling detail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you. Thank you.  I mean, the more technical posts would alienate  kind of new readers, right?  And like in our goal was to bring in more readers.  And as the time went on, the sites, you know,  it was like we need to appeal more to our mainstream audience  and bring more of an audience in,  but you alienate a technical audience  with an oversimplified post and you scare off new readers  who maybe aren't as technical  with something that's too detailed.  I mean, it's just a tough line to walk.  Not that I'm defending.  Look, I'm not saying that people shouldn't, you know,  pick up the phone and call and find out  what exactly happened and not take, you know,  a well-known developer's word.  I mean, he was obviously offended and annoyed  that his app that he spent time working on broke,  but you know, in this case, but yeah, no, it's a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's meeting with them.  It'll work again.  It's in Google's interest to make it work.  That was why it was a surprising story.  Just think about it.  Why would they turn that off?  Meanwhile, I've got a complaint about Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it has nothing to do with the Moto X.  Nothing to do with it.  Yeah.  Here's the problem.  I mean, it does have a lot to do with my Pixel.  So here I am using the God, the blessed Pixel,  the Google blessed machine,  and suddenly Chromecast stops working  in Google Play and Netflix.  Doesn't show the icon, doesn't show Jack  in Chrome on my Chrome Pixel.  It still works in YouTube.  It still works on the top of the screen  for casting a tab,  but I suddenly can't do Netflix or play.  I put this up online because somebody says,  you know, one of the helpful user suggestions,  did you try installing the Chromecast app?  Yeah, because I'm telling you it doesn't work.  I just told you what it works in.  But somebody else did the same thing with the Pixel  and said, yep, same problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Google, hello.  I'll try it at home tonight.  As you know, I have five Chromecasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you're so good at purchasing things  while you're live broadcasting an announcement.  It's kind of scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's scary.  It's like there's Leo purchasing five Chromecasts,  interacting with the chat room,  running a show, doing an ad read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just bought a house five minutes ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't need...  It's like your aunt.  It is the greatest radio show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is, it's what you learn when you're in radio.  You're doing 18 things at once.  I used to be on with Ron Owens on KGDO

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  in San Francisco all the time.  And Ron is a pros pro.  And Ron would be sitting there.  We were friends.  We talked to me and he'd have the, you know,  why is my gun mute?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's betting on horses during the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm thinking, how is he doing this?  I was, and then he said, once and all,  he put up his hand and he hit the mic and he said,  why do you say that?  Turn it back off.  You gotta come back to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then he's got his pager out  and he's going Miley Cyrus in the fourth.  Yeah, I like that.  I like that horse.  It's got a nice rear.  So, let's see.  Surgeon live streams operation using Google Glass.  I'm not going to that doctor.  I don't want that to happen.  But a surgeon from Ohio State, Wexner Medical Center  donned the new headset during routine.  It was routine surgery last week and streamed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not routine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Every operation, it's critical.  You're right.  It was to medical students.  This happens all the time.  I'm not a fan of this either when you're in surgery  and it's worse when you're in the hospital  and 15 med students come in.  And then they start probing you and saying,  now why do you think Leo's pain is in his left side?  What do you think that means?  Anybody?  Anybody?  That's what you don't want.  Now they're doing it with Google Glass.  He also consulted with a separate colleague  through the headset.  First time a live point of view collaboration  has ever occurred during an operation using Glass.  That's an interesting thing.  Well, do you see what I'm seeing?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that a spleen or is that the liver?  I think that's a great idea.  I mean, I don't know if I would want it to be me,  but particularly if you're a teaching hospital,  I would think that would be fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was performing ACL surgery,  which is it is pretty routine knee surgery.  Pretty routine, yeah.  He says Glass didn't get in the way.  To be honest, once we got into the surgery,  I often forgot the device was there.  That makes sense.  People who have Glass, Gina and Jeff, you report that, right?  You just get, it just blends in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not me.  Not if you wear glasses, no.  No, it's always...  Not if you wear glasses.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because you're constantly having to readjust it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The surgeon does wear glasses,  but he decided not to for this operation.  I don't know.  Apparently the medical center  has a chief innovation officer, Dr. Clay Marsh.  So, there you go.  This is some innovation right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what happens.  Another innovation that's on the right now.  I love this.  Shriner's Hospital is using Glass  to try to get disabled kids on wheelchairs  to be able to navigate their wheelchair.  That's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, neat.  That's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are the good uses of Glass.  For all the way that people make fun of them,  for looking crazy and turning alls into cyborgs,  all of us into cyborgs and privacy.  These are the kind of applications of Glass  that are really gonna matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there's quite a few of them.  I mean, Trey Radcliffe's taking people  who can't get out of the house on photo walks.  That's great.  That's amazing.  That's awesome.  Yeah, that is awesome.  That's awesome.  So yeah, I hear a lot of these applications,  and I think they're really great.  Meanwhile, let's do a little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was looking at Field Trip even.  I remember when we were first talking about Google Glass  and I had been in Italy,  I was looking at Field Trip.  And just the way I could pull up information  about the thing you're looking at would just be hugely...  I'm not sure I would use it all the time,  but if you're in a strange place, it would be fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to Venice in a couple of weeks.  Do you recommend I put Field Trip on my phone  and turn it on?  Yes, definitely.  I turned it off.  I used to have it.  It kept annoying me because there's a place down the road  where Peggy Sue got married was filmed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah, the filming location was pretty noisy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, I know that.  I don't really care.  I walk by that house every single day.  It'd be nice if you could say ignore.  But I think for a new city...  Yeah, it's not intended for that.  It's intended for your...  New places. New places.  So I'll turn it on in Venice.  I think it'd be pretty cool.  Maybe you just wear earbuds or something, right?  Yeah.  That'd be almost like a plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I turned it on up here, there was nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, now it should be...  I zoomed out like 50 miles, there was nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This guy named Jeff Jarvis,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  he has 2.6 million people circle him.  So he must be a big wig of some kind.  Has been using Auto Awesome...  This was fun yesterday.  To show off the fact that he was at the US Open,  you lucky dog.  Yeah, that's sad.  How fun.  And so, how are you doing this?  You're pressing, you're doing a...  I'm using Nexus One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, Nikon One and just holding it down  and it's put the sequences in,  but you don't know what it's gonna do.  So there were some odd ones that didn't work,  but that's Tommy Haas yesterday.  This is really cool.  And it kinda worked well.  Yeah, it's really neat.  And I made fun of the guardian for the idea of using,  and that's his opponent.  What's his name?  There's some really auto, interesting auto.  So this is for people who don't know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the Auto Awesome feature of Google Plus Photos,  where if it sees a number of pictures  or takes a picture of you,  it's gonna be like,  where if it sees a number of pictures  were taken in rapid succession,  it'll turn them into an animated GIF,  which is pretty cool.  It's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I take a bunch of pictures of the baby  and get great stuff.  I'll think, oh, four of these are blurry or whatever,  but then it'll Auto Awesome them  and you'll see kind of an interaction  that you didn't catch it.  It does a really nice job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like the...  I made fun of the guardian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Leo.  Well, I was gonna say, I like the...  I'm sorry.  You go, you go.  I like the inadvertent Auto Awesomes,  which you get occasionally.  Andy Iannacco had one.  He was walking by a fire station or something.  And I guess as a matter of course,  let me see if I can find it.  Here it is.  As a matter of course, he takes a number of images  and the fire trucks aren't moving,  but what you see is the reflections of people going by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's cool.  So there's a lot of these that are very...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and you would never have known it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Richard Gingras is in Northern Iceland right now.  And he has some really nice ones of just streams.  People love streams on Auto Awesomes.  What a cool idea.  I'm gonna go.  We had to show this in the show some weeks ago.  I did a neon sign, a flashing neon sign in London.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that was another one.  Yeah.  Is it G-I-N-G-R-A-S-S?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Pronounced Gingras.  Gingras.  I think he'd be consistent about his Gs, but he's not.  He should talk to the GIF guy.  He's the GIF fight embodied in a person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One name.  One name.  One name and it's all there.  Moving on, let's see.  Did you see?  Does anybody have Siri?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't get a chance.  This is a great story.  I didn't get a chance to try it out myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've heard it.  No, I've had it actually.  Jeff Needles, who is an iPhone bigot,  used to be our intern here.  He's gone now, thank God.  He kept doing this.  So if you say, okay, glass to Siri,  it says a number of different things.  Stop trying to strap me on your forehead.  It won't work.  Just so you know, I don't do anything when you blink at me.  Glass, I think you've got the wrong assistant.  Good on Apple for throwing that stuff in.  I like that.  That's good.  Yeah.  Sense of humor.  Love it.  Don't say okay, glass to Siri.  She doesn't like it.  Little snippy about that.  Remember when we talked about Larry Ellison saying,  he said, I like Larry Page.  He's a nice guy.  Oh no, it's not evil, but they stole Java from us.  Eric Schmidt on Google Plus had a little something to say.  Here are the facts, he says.  Google didn't just take Oracle's stuff.  It's not my opinion,  it's the judgment of a US district court.  The court ruled that the copyright could not be used  to block others from using the structure, sequence,  and organization of APIs.  This actually was a very famous case about APIs.  The ruling participants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the one where the judge had coded  a very simple class, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He wrote, what was it, a sort or something?  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A sort or a number, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The ruling protects a principle.  Vital innovation, writes Eric Schmidt,  you cannot copyright an idea as you can a method of operation  or like a method of operation.  No one can copyright the idea  of adding two numbers together.  So there you go.  I think that kind of flattens it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he's right and Larry's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, but Charlie Rose, again, an example.  Charlie Rose is a general purpose reporter,  but you wouldn't expect him to say,  but remember in 2012, the judge said,  you cannot copyright an API.  Jiving with Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Larry's point of view, he just says things.  Like he just says things and you know,  right, you're expected to believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, it's like a politician basically.  You got to fact check them.  So this is Jarvis and Lionel Hampton and the King Cole Trio.  What the hell?  Is this some fan of yours, Abdul Jabbar X?  Somebody sent this to me,  no, somebody just sent this to me out of nowhere.  So this is like Farfuk Nugent  or whatever that other reggae thing.  Here we go.  Listen everybody.  Jiving with Jarvis.  Jiving with Jarvis.  Jiving with Jarvis.  So Jarvis must be some guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, some woman who had the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it was a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Show.  I like it.  It should make it my ringtone.  Yeah, Jiving with Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is your theme, so I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it was a tribute to Los Angeles disc jockey,  Al Jarvis.  I don't hear the xylophone a lot anymore.  Was that your dad, Al Jarvis?  No, no, no, no.  Those are vibes, man.  They're called xylophone, that's vibes.  Just like a xylophone.  What is the difference in vibes in a xylophone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I hope I never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never heard of a vibe until just this minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Like I never want to know what twerking is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think, oh, I can show you that.  I think the vibe, a xylophone,  I think he uses a wooden mallet  and vibes use a softer mallet, something like that.  Okay.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Point taken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A xylophone is what you see in a marching band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't Tony Stark's assistant named Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.  The suit, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, enough of Jiving with Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see Elon Musk is building one of those?  No.  Hand-activated.  No. You didn't see that?  This was one of the best moments probably  on the internet last week.  I think it was on the weekend.  He said on Twitter that he was building  a motion-activated holographic design tool.  And then Jon Favreau, the producer of Iron Man,  responded to him on Twitter and said,  do you mean like the one in Iron Man?  And Elon Musk said, yeah, exactly like that.  I liked it so much, I'm building one.  Great idea.  It was the nerdiest moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great Twitter moments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Incredible.  You've seen the great account Bored Elon Musk.  He said, yeah.  Yeah, but this is straight out of Bored Elon Musk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Elon tweets, we'll post video next week  of designing a rocket part with hand gestures  then immediately printing it in titanium.  In titanium, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That guy is Tony Stark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We figured out how to design rocket parts  with just hand movements through the air.  Now I need a high frame rate holograph generator.  Anyone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anyone get an extra one?  Anyone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  God, it must be good to be the king.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can you loop it down to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hyperloop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, hyperloop it.  Well, hyperloop it.  I'm ready for the hyperloop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm thinking bathroom problems with the hyperloop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no.  That's the whole point.  Before you have to pee again, you're there.  35 minutes, you're in LA.  You can go a half an hour, Jeff.  You're a younger man.  Really?  Can't even go half an hour.  I found I can no longer sit through the entire show,  the four hour shows we do here at Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you do?  I get up in the middle of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did we talk about the technology?  I did it on Sunday.  No, I did it yesterday on the MacBreak Weekly.  What I do is I try to launch a conversation  about something that I know is just gonna go, right?  And then you run to the bathroom.  And then I go, yeah.  What if it doesn't go?  It didn't.  Renee Richie just stopped talking  and all Chad could do was switch to my chair empty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You need a code word or something like that.  I do.  You insert into the conversation  so that everybody knows to keep coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you were Elon Musk, you'd build a robot of yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, really, if I were smart,  I'd stop drinking nonstop coffee and water  during these shows, that would probably help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could probably hook a catheter up to that chair or something.  Oh, easy.  Easy, easy.  I think there's a little holder for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are methods.  When you have a Dr. Evil chair,  it's got all sorts of special features.  That or astronaut diapers.  This week in P.  What are you looking at?  Are you looking up that?  Are you looking it up, aren't you?  Catheterize my host.  All right, I'll tell you what.  Let's take a break, come back with the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hurry!  Hurry!  Hurry, hurry, hurry!  Hurry, hurry!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, drummers, tympanists,  flutists, horn blowers, it's time for the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now here's Gina Trippani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll stretch this out so Leo can run to the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good, I'm gonna leave right now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google releases the Chrome 30 beta  for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android.  The Chrome beta lets you right click or long press  on an image and search for it via your default  search provider.  So a little bit easier search by image.  All the people who do the catfish show  will really appreciate that.  Chrome beta for Android has received new gestures.  So you can swipe across the top toolbar,  the Omni box basically.  You can swipe across the top toolbar to switch tabs.  You can drag vertically down from the toolbar  to get into a tab switcher view as well.  And you can drag down from the menu in order to expand it  versus just tapping on it.  So some nice new gestures in the Chrome beta for Android.  In Google search, Google's improved definitions in search.  So if you do a search that's to define a word.  So if you do define fortuitous, for example,  they'll get that one box result.  In the one box, you'll see now the new things there  is sample sentences that highlight how the word is used  and synonyms.  There's also a translate dropdown.  So you can choose a language,  translate the word directly from the one box.  And then once you choose a language,  every subsequent definition search you do from there  will automatically translate into that language  that you chose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is heaven, this is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is really, really nice.  And that chart of like use of the word over time  is also amazing.  Great, great for word geeks.  Yeah, yeah.  I went to Catholic school.  So the nuns beat it into my head  that when you find a word that you don't know,  you look it up.  And I actually do after all these years.  I'm almost 40, I still do it.  I love data geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's really what these guys are.  They're just data geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they are.  But that, yeah, that one box is far as I'm concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I loved it when Google got the define  where you could type define colon and then the word.  I used that all the time.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But actually you don't,  it's not even, you don't have to use the colon anymore.  You just do define space and then the word.  So it's a little more natural.  Google Now has also updated, speaking of cards,  they've updated with car rentals, concert tickets,  and a few other tricks.  So if you're traveling and you have car rental receipt  or concert tickets confirmation in your Gmail inbox,  you'll show those cards in Google Now.  Public transit cards have updated.  So it'll now notify you when the last train home leaves  and the location that you are really good also  for traveling.  And you can check NCAA scores.  They've got a new football card for that.  And let's see.  Oh, they've also got a couple of new features.  If you look up an artist or any sort of media music  or TV or movies, they've got a new remind me button  on the card, which means that Google Now will notify you  when your favorite band or TV show author  releases something new.  And there's a new TV card,  which I haven't actually had a chance to try,  but Leo, you said you're smart TV.  Google Now, no, Google Now did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was so weird.  I opened Google Now and it says,  I see you have a Panasonic Viera on the network.  Would you like to listen to whatever?  Would you like me to listen to what you're listening to,  watching, and I'll tell you more about it?  I said, wow. Amazing.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so it'll figure out what you're watching  and then show you information about what's on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's another one that you didn't mention,  but it's kind of weird is that for some reason  it's now giving me updates on people's commute.  So I have circled somebody named Nathaniel Mosher.  I don't even know who he is.  Nathaniel Mosher has allowed you to see updates  on his commute.  Interested in updates on his commute?  I can say yes, and it's gonna tell me  how his commute is going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it says he's at work right now?  So he must be sharing his location with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which I am too, and I think people are getting this too.  Leo would like to share about me.  Leo would put,  but why would I care about somebody else's commute?  They mentioned they were gonna do this,  but I just don't understand what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't imagine caring about anyone except my wife's commute.  But that would be useful.  I would love Google Now to say, hey, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So maybe they'll just keep offering me people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's gonna be late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, she's gonna be late, stuck in traffic.  I love Google Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Before the show I was singing In the Mood,  and Google Now has given me three different versions  of In the Mood, a card saying,  oh, you were looking at In the Mood.  Here's your song. No, Leo, please, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I just think that that's really great.  I'm sorry, but I just love this.  I don't find it intrusive at all.  It's creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's making me out at first,  but now I'm like smart. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's great.  Yeah, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just surprised me at first.  I had done a search for Palm Springs.  I was looking, and then suddenly Google Now  was giving me directions, was telling me,  oh, about an hour, two hours, light traffic.  I was like, what?  Yes.  So it surprised me, but now I'm like, oh, yes.  And you can swipe a card away if it's not relevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They need to get a better way of letting me know,  because you forget to look at Google Now.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the widget on your home screen,  I keep the widget on my home screen, which I really like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you do, all right.  It takes up so much space.  I don't want it to be on my home screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Don't you get notifications on the Moto with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh.  Did you set that up?  Motifications, I don't know.  On the home screen?  Motifications.  I need a modification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although, Google Now mis-parsed something in my inbox  that made it think that I was traveling to Switzerland.  Yes.  So I was getting tips on what hotel I should check in  in Switzerland.  I was like, I don't know why this happened.  I just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Same thing happened to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  Something went wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was like, it thought I was going to, like,  yeah, Lausanne or somewhere.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like, I don't know why you think that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's Google telling you to expand your horizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe it's aspirational.  Maybe it's actually encouraging you to go to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We feel you would enjoy a trip to Switzerland right now.  Wouldn't you rather be in Zurich right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Theo, you need a break.  What happens when the Soviet electronic army

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like hacks Google Now?  Forget DNS records.  When they're sending Google Now reminders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How would you like to visit Syria right now?  Say yes or yes.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your commute will take 11 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm really looking forward to seeing what Google Now does  as I travel around Europe.  That's going to be a great experience.  It's fascinating.  Yeah.  It's fascinating.  And I bought a big package of data from AT&T,  an 800 megabyte package of data,  just because I wanted to keep this on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the airline thing was the most useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it put the barcode of your check in up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, when you get to the airport, it goes, ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it just pops up.  Love that.  So they can just scan it.  And it will tell you, it told me my flight was delayed.  It told me there was traffic on the way to the airport.  I mean, it was, and that alone was worth,  was worth the cost of all the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you have to use Gmail  to get any of this advantage, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it gets it from Gmail.  My wife was traveling  and she had sent me her itinerary via Gmail.  So Google Now was telling me,  oh, this flight is leaving then.  And then she, whatever, her flight got delayed  and she had to reschedule.  So she sent me her new itinerary  and now was smart enough to overlay those cards  with the new flights and said,  hey, you should be leaving for the airport now, basically.  Like it figured out that I was doing the pickup.  It was really, it's really great.  It's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, one more item in the change log.  And this one's for Jeff.  Chrome OS users gain immersive mode  and more in the stable channel upgrade.  So Jeff, you might have to explain what immersive mode is.  From what I understand, it's like full screen on crack.  I didn't get a chance to take,  break out my pixel and give this a try.  Yeah, it just takes away every bar and every everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it's nice.  I like it.  The problem is that you have to turn back on to get,  you have to do something to get the address bar back.  But there are certain times,  so I don't use it all the time,  but there are certain times  when you really want to watch something  or look at something and get a sense of it.  Or take it, by the way, take a screenshot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's, oh, that must be nice for screenshots.  Yeah, I like how on Android,  the address bar just kind of slides up  and you don't see it while you're scrolling.  I feel like on the pixel, that would be useful as well,  or particularly on the pixel when you're scrolling.  That's a good idea.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  That's all I got for the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Play the Dums, drums.  Dums.  Dums.  Dumb, dumb.  Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.  Different instrument.  Dumb, dumb.  It's played with a velvet mallet.  Thank you, Gina Tripani, for the Google change log.  New stuff at Google.  Google.com, of course, because this is the 50th anniversary  of Martin Luther King's March on Washington.  Has, I think, a beautiful Google doodle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can you see it?  They also did a special media thing to watch the speech,  but I couldn't get it, it was broken.  Did they?  Yeah, if you go to the Google, I think the Google blog,  they have something about it, and it looked gorgeous,  but I couldn't make it work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of ironic because I understand  that President Obama speaking about  the I Have a Dream speech says it belongs to all of us.  Ironically, it doesn't.  The rights prohibited from...  Yeah.  The estate of Martin Luther King is very clear,  it does not belong to all of us.  No.  Oh, God, save us from rights, rights issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Plus, you know, if you think that Martin Luther King  really can look down upon this,  he must be saying to his heirs,  you can't take the money with you.  It's the ideas that live on.  Right, you'd think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a mouthful, Jeff.  I think.  That is a mouthful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I always...  more than anything else.  Yes.  And my friend Jay Rosen says that he's never made a mistake  by revealing an idea he has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's always worked with me.  Yes.  And it's so counterintuitive  and it's so hard for so many people to get.  But just try it, it works so well.  Although I think Jesus said it best when he said,  cast your bread upon the waters  and it will return to you a thousandfold.  Did he not?  That's just casting your bread upon the waters.  Hey, it's 2000 years old.  It's not a new idea, kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were just talking about twerking.  I'm getting like...  I know, this just got really deep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of ideas Jesus had are good ideas,  never really got implemented.  He needed a better marketing or something.  He did his best.  Oh, by the way, speaking of twerking,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  in the rundown in the chat on the right,  I put in...  Oh, is it there anymore?  Nick Kristoff, legendary New York Times columnist.  Hold on a second.  He was on twerking.  He was trying to figure out what twerking is  and so you'll see this in one second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, don't, no, no!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can't unsee this.  I don't want twerking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, Jesus didn't say cast your bread upon the waters.  It's from Ecclesiastes.  Thank you, chat room.  God said it.  God said it.  Well, mine's not working.  The Hebrews said it.  What is this gonna be?  What are we gonna see of Kristoff?  It's not worth it, nevermind.  It's a vine.  It's a vine about twerking.  This is, by the way, my problem with vine.  This happens to me every time I go to vine.  Won't play.  It doesn't play.  It's like guys, I'm loading.  I'm loading.  Find that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is that?  Is that a plug?  Is it flash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's their servers.  Their servers suck.  Their servers suck.  You know who owns vine?  Although I would thought Twitter  would have solved this by now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that Twitter,  I thought that Twitter had fail-wailed its way  to site stability generally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But every time I try to play vine, it doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nevermind, it's not even that good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So here's the whole verse.  This is Ecclesiastes 11, it's the Old Testament.  Cast your bread upon the waters,  for you will find it after many days.  Give a portion to seven or even to eight,  for you know not what disaster may happen on earth.  If the clouds are full of rain,  they empty themselves upon the earth,  and if a tree falls to the south or to the north,  in the place where the tree falls, there it will lie.  He who observes the wind will not sow,  and he who regards the clouds will not reap.  In other words. Amen, brother.  Put it out there, don't worry about  what you're gonna get back.  Amen. Amen.  Hallelujah.  Preacher. Preach, preach.  Preach, preach.  You know who preaches great?  Did you see, oh, I loved this.  The speech that, what's his name, Gabe?  This is another thing.  Along with peeing a lot.  This is another thing that comes up as you get older.  Kevin Spacey. Kevin Spacey.  Matthew knew.  Kevin Spacey gave at the Edinburgh TV Festival  about exactly this, which is,  there's a huge opportunity here,  and greed is preventing it from, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And his point was, it doesn't matter what the platform is  or what the package is or what the machine is  or what the thing you're watching it on is,  it's all about the content.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So good.  So good.  I could play, I'll play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Netflix or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it starts with the conversation about House of Cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  House of Cards, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it really is, let me find it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a big deal.  It's heavy stuff.  It's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so good.  This was a YouTube event.  This is the Edinburgh Television Festival  was a YouTube event.  Why?  Well, I see YouTube on the podium.  By the way, 800.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's ironic, because this is a television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  YouTube horns in on it.  It's a message that YouTube wouldn't mind  spreading to the rest of the world, I think.  I'm gonna jump, you should watch the whole thing.  It's too long for us to, we'll give it short shrift,  but if you watch the whole five minute piece, you'll love it.  But let me jump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TV or watching Game of Thrones on their computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here, let me skip back a little bit.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But for kids growing up now, there's no difference.  Watching Avatar on an iPad or watching YouTube on a TV  or watching Game of Thrones on their computer.  It's all content.  It's just story.  And the audience has spoken.  They want stories.  They're dying for them.  They're rooting for us to give them the right thing.  And they will talk about it, binge on it,  carry it with them on the bus and to the hairdresser,  force it on their friends, tweet, blog, Facebook,  make fan pages, silly gifs,  and God knows what else about it.  Engage with it with a passion and an intimacy  that a blockbuster movie could only dream of.  And all we have to do is give it to them.  The prize fruit is right there,  shinier and juicier than it's ever been before.  So it will be all the more shame on each and every one of us  if we don't reach out and seize it.  And I wanna leave you with the words of a man,  as good as any, to address the nexus of commerce and art.  Mr. Orson Welles, who once said,  I hate television.  I hate it as much as peanuts,  but I just can't stop eating peanuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you.  He is so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's Kevin Spacey speaking at the Edinburgh TV Festival.  And urging broadcasters and everybody else,  this is The Telegraph, by the way,  published that video, Jeff,  to just get it out there.  Don't worry about channels and control.  People want this stuff.  And if you give it to them,  they will celebrate it in a way  that you will reap the rewards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's interesting, that was really good.  He could have gone a step further.  He was separating the creators from the audience  a little bit.  They want it from us.  He could have gone a little bit a step further  and acknowledge that the audience creates  around the things that you create as well.  I mean, he mentioned the silly gifts  and the mashups and all that.  But there's still that us and them.  Look, Spacey has earned his stripes.  And I guess it makes sense that he has an us and them.  He's reached a level that most entertainers  and actors don't reach.  But still a little bit of that us and them mindset there.  Well, that's a really good point.  That he's old school.  He's old school.  They're just waiting for us to give them.  But yeah, that was a good speech.  I'm definitely gonna watch the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a big step forward.  The next step is to say, and we're all creators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See that with my two daughters all the time,  the Tumblr addicts, whenever they're watching a show,  whether it's Doctor Who or Teen Wolf or whatever,  they discover the content through Tumblr.  They share it through Tumblr.  They live blog TV shows and live tweet them voluntarily.  Nobody's paying them to do this  because they love these shows so much.  They're so invested in it.  And the animated GIFs and all the stuff that's related to it,  fan fiction and whatnot is just part of that experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And meanwhile, record companies are suing Larry Lessig  for the use of a French band's hit single in a video  that he gave in an online,  or that he made of an online lecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For him for standing up too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  The band.  Who could forget the band Phoenix  and their 2009 hit Listomania?  Listomania, I remember.  It's a great tune.  It's a movie too, right?  He put it in a lecture.  He used music.  The lecture was describing how people had used that song  to create dance videos, mashups and so forth.  The Australian record company that owned the rights  threatened to sue Lessig.  He's counter sued, actually pre sued,  in federal court, accusing it of abusing copyright laws  and singling him out even though his actions are fair use.  EFF.  Good for Larry.  Carrying the water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I'm also glad because Larry's kind of tried to move on  past copyright into corruption and money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He really is all about campaign finance reform right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right, but I'm glad he couldn't resist  to go back and fight another boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I also think the reason he's in this,  what he realized in this fight, this copyright fight was  until we get the money out of the pockets,  the corporate money out of the pockets of our legislators,  we're never gonna get a change.  So the first thing to do is to eliminate  the malign influence of corporations  in government, which is right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you play with John Perry Barlow's acceptance  to the amendment. Should we play another speech?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, what the heck.  This is the guy who does that,  what was it, the rights of man?  Yeah.  All right, should I play the whole thing?  It's pretty short.  I haven't seen it, here we go.  John Perry Barlow, the great, who by the way,  we've had on triangulation.  He's a wonderful guy, love him.  His accepted speech to his induction  into the internet hall of fame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The electronic frontier foundation,  please welcome to the stage, John Perry Barlow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'd say I was humbled by this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but I usually reserve that for when my car's been towed.  I'm very deeply honored, surprised,  and gratified.  I am a member of another hall of fame,  which is the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,  and let me tell you,  there is a lot more narcissism involved.  And one of the things I really love about this  is that I'm looking at people  whose ideas were the important thing,  and who knew that,  and who knew the elegant solution when they saw it,  and caused it to be born.  And I'm grateful to all of you,  because I care a lot about the architecture  of the internet.  You can't endow liberty  in the absence of the ability to take it away.  And so it has to be part of the architecture.  And each and every one of you has been an enormous part  of creating a system that is difficult to shut up.  And I am very profoundly grateful to you for all of that.  And finally, I wanna accept this  also on the behalf of some people  that I hope are one day members of the Internet Hall of Fame.  And they are Edward Snowden,  Bradley Manning, and Julian Assange.  Wow, great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Great.  There you go.  John Perry Barlow, he's in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  because he wrote lyrics for Grateful Dead songs.  He's a Montana rancher,  and as they mentioned, the founder of EFF,  and really a great guy.  His declaration of the independence of cyberspace,  Jeff's been trying to get him to do  a dramatic reading of that since,  as long as I've known him.  He actually, I don't know if you watched that section  when I asked him about it, he kind of repudiated it.  He said, well, I wrote that a long time ago.  Some things are different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then I went up to him again and asked,  he still kind of believes it,  but I think he was over the top.  That's what's so delightful about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is.  You wanna read it as a firebrand,  I declare, I'll do that.  I'll do my preacher voice.  I think we, anything else you wanna say  before we go to our tool tip?  We gotta get Gina out of here in a little bit.  Our tool and tip and number of the week.  Mr. Matthew Ingram, always good to have you from Giga Home.  If you've got any tips or tricks  or anything you'd like to share with us,  we can let you do that too.  Let's start with Gina Trapani, her tool or tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hi, I found this one on Lifehacker.  This is actually a Facebook tip.  If your newsfeed is overrun with stuff  that you don't really care about,  Facebook has offered a tool  that will help you organize your friends.  Basically what this does,  if you go to facebook.com slash friends slash organize  and chat or Leo, if you do this,  this will show a list of your friends.  So if you're concerned about that,  maybe don't do it on air.  You can go to facebook.com slash friends slash organize.  And basically Facebook will say to you,  hey, here's a list of people  that you haven't interacted with in a really long time.  Would you like to add them to your acquaintances list?  Now people who are on your acquaintances list  are quieter in your newsfeed.  You don't hear from them as much.  And I think really just only the posts  from your acquaintances that really kind of pop  or have a lot of interactivity show up in your newsfeed.  So, and it's pretty smart.  I did this, I did this and it was several screens.  I was like, hey, people on this list,  Now, some people I was like, oh, hey,  I actually still wanna keep these on my friends list.  And I would like to see every post in my newsfeed,  but there are actually quite a few that I thought,  I can relegate them to acquaintances they don't know.  If I'm not interacting with their posts  or conversing with them much,  then it's a little quieter in your newsfeed.  So I thought it's a pretty smart tool.  And apparently it's not,  Facebook isn't really promoting it  or there isn't a link to get to it in Facebook.  But if you just go to facebook.com slash friends slash  organize, it will get you started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you'll get, these are just people that you haven't had  back and forth with in some way or liked or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the people who you haven't liked,  if you haven't had back and forth with,  who you just haven't messaged with,  I imagine it's just people that you haven't interacted  with in a while.  And do you wanna-  So you can uncheck them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Most everybody on Facebook.  Huh?  So for me, that's gonna be most everybody on Facebook.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm getting a lot of people who are actually like Tom Merritt,  who actually are friends,  I guess I just don't interact with them on Facebook.  However, there are also a lot of people  who really are acquaintances.  So by moving them into the acquaintances category,  I'll see-  You need to see less of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Less of them.  In your newsfeed.  Which is, so it's true.  If you don't use Facebook a lot,  basically everybody is gonna be listed, right?  Right.  So you can check and uncheck the people that you wanna move.  But it's a nice way to kind of,  I mean, cause so rarely do we,  so rarely do I take the time to organize my friends list.  I have better things to do,  but like people who I interacted with  or worked with two years ago,  I haven't spoken to in a while,  I don't necessarily wanna unfriend them,  but maybe I don't wanna hear about their dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who's this Chad Johnson?  I don't wanna hear his stories about his cats.  Let me just uncheck him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I want Chad Johnson's redhead in my newsfeed,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  even if I haven't liked this stuff in a while.  But it's a nice kind of automatic way to prune things  without having to go through the list manually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is good.  It's taken me five pages.  There seem to be some organization,  cause that whole page was all people I work with.  So there is some organization to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, if you put people like on a list,  like if you made a Twitter list,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they'll say, hey, this is the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, these are the people from this Twitter list  who you haven't interacted with in a while,  do you wanna add them to a Crains?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, good.  This is a very useful little thing here.  I'm doing it right now.  Cool. Thank you.  Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Finally, I'm probably off your list.  No, no, I know I love your stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there are people that I just,  I don't even really know who the hell this person is.  So I think I'm gonna make them an acquaintance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had a couple of like, ooh, what, when?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Should I keep my accountant on my acquaintance list  or my friends list?  Always so difficult to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How compelling are your accountant status updates?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a big drunk, so he's actually quite fun.  If he's entertaining, I'm just gonna say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I went through something even more radical.  I started with that type of tool  and then decided instead of moving a lot of these people  into a list, I would just get rid of them completely.  And I think I got rid of about 80% of my Facebook network.  And then I wrote about why I did that.  And it made Facebook a lot more usable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you really should.  It's a good idea to prune, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've heard that from a lot of people.  I just, I worry about hurting people's feelings.  Maybe I'm being too nice.  Do they know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I did do that.  And I did do that.  I had to apologize to a few people.  Really? People knew.  And I added a few people back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it say Matthew just pulled you,  just defriended you?  How do they know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but if they go back,  if they go and look at their connections,  they can see that you're no longer connected  or they can see that they're only,  now they're subscribed to you or following you instead of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is probably why Facebook  has this acquaintances feature, right?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a way to demote people without letting them know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You put somebody in purgatory without telling them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is why there's the subscribe feature.  Right.  I hit the limit, not on friends, but I had the total.  I just would never say no to anybody.  I just let it sit there.  And so I got thousands were sitting there.  And then I couldn't add, nobody could add me.  I let it sit there for like nine months  when nobody could add me.  And it was kind of nice.  I do find it odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like letting your voice box fill up.  When I post a photo,  it gets liked by 15 people with foreign names  who I have never met.  And I don't understand what is going on there.  I think they're subscribed to me, I guess.  And so, yeah, I just don't understand.  Damn ferners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, you're Canadian.  So that means us, right?  Yes.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People with funny accents.  Most of the damn world.  Yeah, I was gonna say, don't found a startup

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and apply to YcomBand because that accent's way too thick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I say oot and a boot.  No one will fund me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, I finished the whole process.  And at the end it says, you've organized your friends.  Now let them know how easy it is.  And you can actually share this.  I said, nice tip from Gina Trippani on Twig.  And I can share this on my Facebook timeline.  So they are publicizing it in this fashion.  You can re-share it.  Oh, very nice.  Yeah.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm so attention, my attention span is so short.  We never got there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm so done.  Too many screens.  I'm so done.  So many screens.  Hey Matthew, did you wanna share anything with us,  tip or an idea or anything  that you think people should know about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do have one thing that I've found incredibly useful  on my Nexus is a weather app.  And I know everybody has their own favorite weather app.  And I know everybody is looking for specific things.  This one's called Arcus, A-R-C-U-S.  And it uses dark sky.  I don't know if you guys.  I love dark sky.  Yeah, dark sky is pretty amazing.  So Arcus, I've found it's not 100% accurate  because no weather forecast is,  but it's so granular.  So you pull it up and it says,  light rain starting in eight minutes,  lasting for 12 minutes.  Oh, I want this.  It's not just, oh, it's gonna rain sometime today.  It's like eight minutes from now,  it's gonna start raining.  So I find a thing that you can get,  and it pulls in data from basically every,  radar installation and weather map,  and it just mashes them all together.  And it's pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just installed it.  Love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Cosine and Arcus.  I think I talked about this on Twig.  Oh, on A-A-A, yeah, it's a great app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's $1.98 for the pro version,  which I would guess is, you know,  fewer ads or something. More stuff.  More stuff.  Always like more stuff.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just a minor one.  A service called Parsley, parse.ly,  put out a little report on the traffic to news sites.  And the general presumption, I think in recent years,  has been, oh, Facebook has overcome everything.  According to their sample set, which is the caveat,  Google still drives three times  the traffic to news of Facebook.  So as my German friends get all mad at Google,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  just remember, you don't wanna piss them off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's Google search, not Google Plus, or eating?  All Google sites, all Google sites.  All Google, it includes Plus,  but it's probably mostly search, right?  Yeah. Yeah.  Cool, that is a big difference.  Look at that.  Towering over everybody else.  My tool, I have two tools.  I'll give you two different tools.  One is, of all things, an alarm clock.  But it's just the coolest alarm clock I have ever seen  and has a feature I've never seen before.  It's called timely.  And you want it, if you have multiple Android devices,  you want to install it on all of them.  Because when you set an alarm,  it sets it on all your devices.  So sometimes I'm, yeah, sometimes I miss alarms.  You're not gonna miss it now,  because I've got, when my alarm goes off on my phone,  it goes off, it has a timer, by the way, built in.  It's also beautiful.  I mean, you can modify the theme and so forth.  It's free, but there's an in-app purchase.  But when I set an alarm,  it'll go off on the other devices that I have  with timely installed.  So a Nexus 4, HTC One, Nexus 7.  I don't know what that is, the Moto X.  So all of these go off at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the thing you don't know what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you dismiss the alarm or when you stop it,  it also stops across devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that a good idea?  It's that brick alarm.  Yeah, it's fantastic.  What's this called?  It's called timely.  I got it on the screen here, Chad.  Timely alarm clock.  It's beautiful too.  Looks great on, and you can buy different themes  and so forth.  I realized what that other device was.  That was a Galaxy Note 8 phone, which I was reviewing,  and I'm gonna now remove from my managed devices  since somebody else has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The only thing is with it going off  is the reason I set it manually on more than one device  because it acts as my snooze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  My double snooze.  This has some really good snooze features too.  It's got an excellent,  has a variety of excellent sounds for alarms.  It's really kind of a neat little thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Timely.  It would be awkward if you were traveling  and you set the alarm on your phone.  It would go off at home.  Inside your bed, and all the stuff at home went off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what happens when you're a single guy.  You don't really care.  Good morning, home, empty home.  Why are we looking at all about Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they tested this on all about Android yesterday.  Oh, you're kidding.  And this is them showing it off  that when you snooze it.  Small world.  When you snooze it on one device,  it snoozes it on the other  because they happen to have multiple devices  with them at the time.  So it hits it, and then on the other device, it stops.  I know that because my alarm was going off

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  all over the house the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is the Google voice problem too, right?  Like Google voice rings,  and like several of my phones ring.  My wife hates it.  She's like, ugh, why is, why are all the phones ringing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the worst is it's not really in synchronized.  It's not synchronized.  So it'll go off sooner on one phone  than the other. Second later.  Lasts longer on some, it keeps ringing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good way to find your devices though too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is a good way.  And now my computer started ringing, like through Hangouts.  So my computer rings now and on my phone.  So it's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this one is for Gina.  I have one more thing for Gina.  And this is really ridiculous.  You use a case on your HTC One?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did.  I wound up getting a case because I checked in.  It was a four square special and I got it for cheap.  So yeah, it's this plastic spec case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't you feel bad doing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do. I take it off.  I take it off a lot because I actually,  I really believe in like just using the device.  I love the device.  I want to feel it in my hand.  I don't want to do the whole condom thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you feel even worse if you dropped it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I bought a ridiculously expensive case.  It's almost 60 bucks, called the Devil Case.  And I've seen it all over Google Plus and I bought it.  And what it is, is this is a milled aluminum.  So it actually looks really slick.  I mean, it feels like it belongs with the phone.  But there is a negative.  It has tiny little screws that you have to,  it comes with a screwdriver,  which I put somewhere and I don't know, I've lost it.  It comes with a tiny little screwdriver  and fortunately a couple of extra screws  because I immediately lost it.  So to get the case off, you literally have to unscrew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's kind of like a bumper.  It's a bumper case, which is nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because the back of the HTC One is beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's really about dropping it on the edge.  And I have dropped my one on the edge and it does ding.  So, this is probably not a practical case  because it doesn't really protect anything.  On the other hand, it's kind of cool.  That's the Devil Case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I scratched my one up here and it broke my heart.  I know.  It just broke my heart.  I was like, no, it's just that first car.  Like first time you scratch your brand new car.  It's okay.  That's life then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I went into AT&T today to look at the Moto X.  Don't worry, I'm not gonna complain.  They had to put the burglar alarm thing on the screen  so you could see that they had scratched the glass.  Oh.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, not good.  It's like that Chromebook commercial  where they're just destroying computers.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't let your dog lick your computer or your phone.  I haven't seen that.  Is it Chromebook commercial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was an old one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was for the old, the Samsung.  Babies were standing on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember, it was like it's for everybody in your family.  It's so cheap, you don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right.  That cheap.  Not my Pixel, that's not the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, certainly not with the Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, thank you all for doing this show.  It's so much fun.  Matthew Ingram, I cannot thank you enough  for taking time out from your lake house to be with us.  I'm happy to.  Thanks for having me.  It's so great to have you.  GigaOm.com, we were saying before the show  that you are so prolific, so many great articles  and the week is only halfway done from Matthew Ingram.  So check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Next time Matthew's on, we have to end the show  with him jumping into the lake on the rope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you do that just to,  here's what I want you to do, Matthew.  Sure.  Turn the camera towards the lake.  I want you to strip down as you run towards the lake.  In your tidy whities.  Down to whatever you feel comfortable  and then jump in the lake.  And we'll end the show that way.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give us some thought.  I tried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your headset doesn't go that far, Matthew.  I tried.  That's, that's.  You can take the headset off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't jump in the lake with the headset on.  We got Jeff Jarvis.  He's from the City University of New York  where he teaches journalism.  He's also the author of Public Parts  and what would Google do and is a blogger at buzzmachine.com.  Don't forget, Guggenberg the geek.  Anything else you want to plug?  No, that's a.  That's a pretty good range of stuff.  He'll be looking at a Moto X at an AT&T store near you.  Stand in there looking perplexed.  Buy the damn thing.  You'll be glad you did.  I will because I already bought it.  I have it.  Open the damn thing.  But you, now you didn't do the Moto Maker.  You could have had it colored.  Yes I did.  Oh you did?  Oh yeah.  So you already got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You already got it.  Navy blue with a nice silver accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, that's kind of cool.  You can send it back even though you've customized it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I didn't engrave it or anything.  You can still send it back I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think they care.  I think the engraving washes right off.  It's a useful feature.  Navy blue, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Navy blue with a silver accent?  That's kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apparently you don't have to disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nautical.  All right, pull up the thing.  What would you get?  What color would you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got red with also with a gray accent.  MotoMaker.com.  But I'm not gonna buy it  because I don't want another AT&T phone.  I have far too many as it is.  I'm waiting for the unlocked Moto Maker.  Because I want, and I want a wooden case.  Don't you want a wooden case?  See I didn't like most of the colors.  No I didn't either.  I think I got cherry.  No that's not, I didn't get cherry.  That's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am so boring.  I would totally just get black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Black, black or white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well the other thing though is that the plain old black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the one I got crimson, which is very lovely.  And then I got a, the front I got white.  Okay.  And then the metallic silver for the trim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is that, now that's beautiful.  I did, I did the blue with a metallic silver.  Yeah, that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's nice.  The thing about the red is isn't it like cars don't,  like red cars have a much higher rate of being stolen.  I feel like the red would really sort of call attention  to the phone.  You're more likely to get a ticket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're speeding with that phone buddy boy.  Then I don't know why you could pick your wallpaper,  which I think is really kind of silly.  Cause I'm not going to use any of these anyway, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was clearly just,  let's throw this in to make it seem really custom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do like this though that you, they will,  they will put your Google account on it.  You still have to put the password in.  So it doesn't really save you that much time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A and B if I sold the thing, speaking of which they did,  they changed the, they expanded the language we talked  about last week on the resale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, they did.  Oh, they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They did clarify it.  That makes sense.  Try to clarify it.  Good.  So that was just the early adopter language.  You can now, you can now resell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no.  They just clarified the language more.  No, it's still the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You are allowed to sell it, but only what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You bought to give it to friends, but, but you can't,  if you do sell it, they won't get the warranty.  They won't get anything else.  We really don't want you to sell us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't want you to sell it too bad.  And what I do like, you can get matching in your headphones.  So you get the crimp.  Oh, fancy.  See, schmancy, schmancy fancy.  But I'm waiting for unlocked.  Gina Trapani is at smarterwear.org, think up,  no, just thinkup.com and todotext.com, TXT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You need to follow.  And you really want to follow some people  because now they've put in-stream ads.  And so you're getting posts from things  that you don't want to see because they're ads.  Here's George Takei, he's worth following.  Squirrel Underpants.  Blame Marissa.  Yeah.
