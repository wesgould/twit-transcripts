Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff Jarvis and Stacey Higginbotham are both here.  We're going to talk a little bit about Apple's announcements at WWDC and compare and contrast  their Do Not Disturb features with the Google features they announced in Android P.  We'll also talk a little bit about Larry Page's flying car. It's coming out, but six miles an hour?  And Stacey catches one of my gadgets from me. But I'm glad to give it to her. It's all coming up next.  On Twig.

This Week in Google, the show where we talk about the latest news from the Googleverse  with Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at the City University of New York, blogger at BuzzMachine.com,  author of such great books as What Would Google Do? Public Parts, Geeks Sparing Gifts.  Hello, Jeffrey.  Hello, hello, hello. Glad to be back.  Good to see you. You were all over the place you were in.  London, Oxford, and Lisbon.  And Lisbon was for Google's European newsgeist.  What is newsgeist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is an unconference, normally run in the US with the Knight Foundation in Arizona,  but Google started one in Europe four years ago and in Latin America two years ago.  And it's an unconference. You get together and 150, 200 people in the field  and we write little post-its and decide what we're going to talk about.  And I help compile those because it's really interesting to see what people care about.  And then we have great discussions.  I enjoy those.  And, yeah.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bill, I mean, Phil, Tim O'Reilly, Bill, Bill O'Reilly.  Tim O'Reilly used to do that up here in the Sebastopol called the Food Camp, Friends of O'Reilly.  And it was so much fun. I went to a few of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then the open version of that was Bar Camp as in FUBAR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  FUBAR, right. So is this based on that same?  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, O'Reilly was involved in the early days, then I think he got bored and moved on.  And so Google stepped in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the most fun things that we've ever done.  If you get the right people together, it's just great.  Yeah, it is.  Also with us from Austin, Texas, Stacey Higginbotham, the IoT Maven from stacey on iot.com.  Hello.  And she's promising us a special delivery in the middle of the show today.  Maybe.  Maybe. If you guys are lucky.  Oh, how exciting.  Whatever could it be?  As IoT, you know, there's been a lot of attention on IoT lately because of Microsoft and Google both getting very much involved in Microsoft's talking at Computex,  which is going on right now in Taiwan about the Intel.  They call it the Intelligent Edge.  It feels like this this might have been might be the year of IoT.  Microsoft's called Windows 10 IoT Core Windows 10 IoT Core.  Every year is the year of Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm like every year is my IoT year.  No, Microsoft has really come out with a complete suite of products this year that are really well thought out.  And, you know, last year, AWS came out with some products, but it doesn't have the kind of messaging and the complete the completeness that Microsoft has.  Microsoft's really helping the enterprise.  So with the IoT, I can never remember.  Everybody's like IoT Hub Core, whatever.  A couple things they're doing there like they're boosting their support.  They're promising it for up to 10 years, which is crucial for industrial and enterprise operations because three years of support is nothing if you want to like set up a conference room or if you want to build a product.  And then the other cool thing that Microsoft's doing with their services is making it so you don't have to change your products.  You don't actually have to update them.  They're promising stability for 10 years.  We talked about this on Windows Weekly today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just had a laugh that if you pay Microsoft, you don't have to update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so but it really matters for if you and, you know, each individual IT organization.  You have to do security updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just don't have to do feature updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, but it's a really big deal because you don't want to have to add new things to like devices that you don't want to be having your developers waste time on.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, especially in an IoT device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and think about like a medical device or a manufacturing plant kind of equipment in a manufacturing plant.  You don't actually want to change those things once you get them, you know, streamlined and perfectly working.  You want them to stay exactly as they are.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We need you need security and IoT very much needs security updates.  But you don't want your light bulbs to start working differently either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sometimes I would like my light bulbs to work differently.  I'm like, you know, give me some more features.  That'd be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't mean you can't get an update.  It just means you don't have to get an update.  I just we thought that was such a hoot.  But Microsoft has really I think we talked a little bit about this.  They really see it a benefit.  And I think this is true if everybody's using the same version of Windows and and and they all they need.  Look no further than Apple and Google.  Apple talked on Monday at WWDC about the fact that there are a million active IOS devices and half of them are running the current version of the operating system.  That's phenomenal.  Meanwhile, on Android, it's fragmentation city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, they're working on that.  I mean, that was Project Trouble, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Trouble's been a success, kind of born out of necessity.  But everybody looks at Apple and says that's the gold standard.  If we could just get all of our users to update whenever there's an update so that we have a comp, a feature complete, you know, set of users that developers it's all about.  Ultimately, it's all about developers.  It's called Chrome.  Yeah.  So an interesting story there we are also talking about on Windows Weekly.  Microsoft bought GitHub, which is I'm ready to do that happened on Monday.  Seven point four billion dollars, huge amount of money.  But what I didn't think about and Paul Thurow brought up is that GitHub developed Electron, which is the chromium based application framework that a lot of apps are running on, including Microsoft's app Skype.  And it includes basically includes a copy of Chrome or the open source for Chrome chromium in every.  And it's one of the reasons a very big file in every Electron app.  So Microsoft now is going to be distributing Chrome unless they unless they release it to the wild.  I don't know. They may not.  They may not keep it around.  It'd be kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was the reaction in your world to the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I noticed a lot of open source people saying, oh, that's it.  We're out of here.  I mean, Microsoft has a really horrible history with open source, which is, you know, I think turned around since the arrival of such an Adela.  But nevertheless, people feel bit by Microsoft and don't want to take the chance.  So I know it's a lot of there was a big spike on one of GitHub's competitors.  Get lab had a big spike in signups the day this was announced on Monday.  Is this just usual grumpy geeky?  I think it's probably is.  But we'll see.  I mean, Mike, it's up to Microsoft to maintain it.  They say it's going to be independent, but that they every time there's an acquisition, that's always what everybody says is not going to change.  It's going to be independent.  And then we see, I mean, it Skypes maintain its independence pretty well.  No, no.  Microsoft stopped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember when Skype was actually a good service.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but the management of Skype is kind of separate from from Microsoft.  LinkedIn maybe hasn't been such a great success.  Nokia, of course, the worst example of a Microsoft acquisition.  So it can go either way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, what did they buy?  Oh, the guys, it's software.  I can't think of the guys.  They bought mono.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They bought Miguel Diaz's business and turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no.  Starts with an R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're Sinovich, Mark, Sinovich and now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, I'm just just I'm giving up.  I'm giving up right now.  Age, Daisy, age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  GitHub also spoke with Google, but it was a relationship with Nadella and Santana Nadella himself.  Right.  They brought it home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Revolution Analytics asks ScooterX.  OK, now I'm going to tell you every R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Roy Ozzy.  Oh, Ray Ozzy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ray Ozzy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They yeah, he was the creator of Lotus one, two, three, and they brought him in.  It wasn't R.  They brought him in with the groove.  Microsoft Groove was the thing he developed.  That's what it was.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He's gone.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gone and Groove never really got anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so is Microsoft ever had a successful acquisition so far?  We haven't listed anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, there's tons of I mean, yeah.  And actually, which is the Miguel de Acasa mono acquisition is huge.  That's been very good for Microsoft.  You know, a lot of this comes back to another great quote.  Ben Thompson all the time.  Gosh darn him.  He's too smart.  But a great article today or actually yesterday and Stratecary, his blog called the Cost of  Developers, and he's talking about how dominant Apple is.  Apple at WWDC said that they have their app store serves half a billion weekly visitors.  Developers have now earned over 100 billion dollars.  Remember, Apple gets about 30 percent of that.  So that's a big chunk of change for Apple.  Developers love it.  And they just the way they used to love Windows because Windows was a place a developer could go and make a make software develop a relationship with his customer or customer sell, make a lot of money.  It was a platform.  Apple's not nearly as open as Microsoft, but Microsoft's really lost.  Look at compare the you know, the Windows app store to the Mac app store or heaven for fun.  Compare either to the iOS app store and you can see where Microsoft is really losing out to Apple.  So they that's the explanation for the GitHub acquisition is Microsoft needs developers if it's going to continue to succeed.  And at this point, Apple really is taking all the oxygen out of the room.  And Apple does not treat developers well.  They released on Monday, they released an app, a dopey app.  There was no reason for them to do called Measure, which used a kit to you measure things by turning on the camera and you go edge to edge and you can measure it.  There are at least a dozen apps in the app store already that do that, all of which are now out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's that's the way it is when you're a developer building these tiny little features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is when you're a developer in an ecosystem.  See, that was what was great about Windows.  Windows initially didn't do anything and they did very little and they let everybody develop on top of it.  Apple with iOS, Apple took control of it very tightly and developers are really living in the mouth of the alligator and just hoping that the symbiosis continues to be beneficial for Apple.  Because at any point they could snap it down.  In fact, it happens so often there's a term for it, you know, it's called being Sherlocked.  Have you ever heard that?  No, I have not.  So there was a great app for the Macintosh called Sherlock, which was a find, I think like a finding app.  Let me see if I can find the history of Sherlock, the forgotten map Mac application.  So what happened with Sherlock was huge in Mac OS 8 and 9.  And what happened was Apple built in Spotlight.  And in 8.5 and the minute that happened, Sherlock just died.  It was like they were Sherlocked.  And pretty much every Apple keynote now, you're looking for the apps that are getting Sherlocked.  This time around, it's the measurement apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that happens.  I mean, that's what every AWS reinvent is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Apple can really, though, just put you out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I feel like it's a smaller business.  But maybe that's just me.  Well, having seen what happens with some of these AWS kind of feature launches, those can take out a full startup.  I mean, just not just an app.  This is like a full company.  Gone.  I have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I showed everybody this on Sunday on this week in tech.  And let me see if I can find it.  This was the App Store Developer Earnings in 2018.  The number is going up.  But what's really interesting is the top grossing iOS apps.  Now, I almost don't want I want you to the number one app is Fortnite.  I wish I could do this without you seeing the numbers here.  This is the number one app.  Then Candy Crush Saga, Pokemon Go, Candy Crush Soda Saga.  How much do you think Fortnite makes in this isn't a fortnight?  Fortnite's free.  No, yeah, and a fortnight.  Four nights free, but they sell like clothes for your skin's one point nine million dollars a day.  Geez, I believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe it.  Man, my daughter will spend crazy amounts of real money on digital accoutrements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, skins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why people put up with any behavior Apple wants to exhibit.  One point nine million dollars a day selling skins.  It's a mind boggling.  All right.  Let's let's talk about Google.  Apple. One of the things Apple announced on WWC on Monday was Screen Time,  which is Apple's response to the complaint by people that their phones are too damn addictive,  including, by the way, shareholders in January,  Janna and the California Teachers Retirement Fund,  both big shareholders of Apple stock complained to Apple.  You got to do something. Your phones are too addictive.  So Apple has come up and will ship this fall something called Screen Time in iOS 12.  But remember, Google did exactly the same thing, announced exactly the same thing for their next version of Android, Android P.  They call it digital well-being.  Good article.  This is the equivalent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the equivalent of that damned voice on the escalator telling you how to walk on an escalator.  Drives me freaking nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the mind the gap moment.  Yeah.  Both of them will allow you to set a limit on how much you use an app, although Google's is strict is stricter.  When you reach the limit on an app and on the iPhone, you can override it with Google.  You can't you cannot actually use the app unless you turn off the limits.  You have to go into the settings and manually.  You know, you really have to dig deep in.  Parental controls are strong now.  You'll be able to keep your kids from playing Fortnite all the time.  Stacey, there's also doesn't play Fortnite.  Oh, she's too young.  Still, she will.  Is she doing a Kim Kardashian game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She just thinks it's too violent.  She's really anti-violence.  Good for her.  I know it's not gory, but she's just like, no, I don't like it.  Oh, it is violent.  You're sure. I mean, you're killing people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So there's violence and there's violence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple will has like the new Android, the ability to disable notifications doing do not disturb.  So you don't even know you've got notifications.  Google's doing a better job, though, with its overnight.  Do not disturb. They dim the screen.  They go black and white.  They really discourage you from picking the phone up.  Apple didn't do that.  Nanny culture.  You don't like it.  You don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know, people who bemoan the nanny culture.  I'm all about that, except some people need that.  And these phones are actually I mean, the apps on them and the phones themselves are designed to be appealing to people and to take advantage of psychological weakness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So knowing that, it's you got to help people.  You don't have to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just a tool.  Yeah.  Right.  Of course, immediately after Apple shows this, then they announced Memoji, which are customizable emojis of yourself that will make you want to spend more time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aren't those like Bitmojis?  How are they different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, yeah, they're like Bitmojis, except they're animated.  You can stick out your tongue, as you can see.  And they're cartoons.  They're not unlike Bitmoji and Samsung's whatever they call it in the S9.  It doesn't take a picture of you.  And then actually Bitmoji, you can you can design one of your own or you can use a picture.  It's more like the former.  You start basically from scratch and you add your hair and your eyes and all that stuff to make it look like you or as much like you as you you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So then it's like Amiibo.  Amiibo?  What the hell are those?  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What the hell are those?  She said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those Nintendo things.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mii.  Mii.  Oh, yeah, Mii.  Mii.  Mii, right.  But did Nintendo kill that?  I think so.  I think they turned off the server.  Memoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem I have with this stuff is that it's it's patronizing, paternalistic and fundamentally says that you don't have agency or sense.  Right.  People make choices and those choices are OK.  And and for others to come along and test, the world is just too addicted to this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stop, stop, stop.  Some of this stuff, if you read the profiles about like psychological manipulation in these, it is akin to something like nicotine.  And you would not tell someone who's trying to stop smoking just quit.  You would try to help them with nicotine gum or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, I would point out that that's exactly the complaint people had about seat belts and helmets for motorcycles.  It's the nanny state.  But seat belts have saved.  Seat belts have literally saved hundreds of thousands of lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is that you're not smashing into walls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But little kids who stay up all night.  No, but like, OK, my my 11 year old daughter, should she be like so unable to get off her phone because there is a real both device kind of action here and then the apps on it being leading to social pressure.  She could not sleep for five days straight.  And maybe she gets kind of upset and maybe bad things happened to her because of that.  I mean, no, you're not running into a wall.  It's a much more slow motion problem, but it's still a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All I'm saying is that is that the same exact arguments were made about books.  So we have people who spend too much time with books.  They spend too much time to do this to touch time doing that.  And this is about personal agency and finding a good point, Stacy, that if somebody wants an aid to give them an aid is fine.  But I still think this fits into a larger narrative that, oh, my God, these things are terrible.  They've addicted us all.  They're ruining our lives.  And it's just not true.  It's simply not true.  And that's the problem I have is it fits into a larger narrative that I find patronizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a lot of friends who can't go dinner without looking at their phones.  And so I would say that's a choice they make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm used to say that your decision about that is right.  They made their choice.  You don't approve and you don't do it.  But what's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got little twitches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you feel about nicotine gum, Jeff?  Nicotine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I Stacey's right.  It was a good analogy.  It's like nicotine gum for your phone.  But I'm not I'm not buying that this is addictive physically.  That's because you're addicted.  You're classic denial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What did you say?  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could go at any time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a second.  I feel I feel like I I'll be honest.  I have mixed feelings about this.  I don't feel like I think it's fine.  I think it's great to offer these tools.  I don't feel like these tools really help.  So I guess what I might say is that this is the companies doing the least they can do  that they've weaponized attention and not knowingly and and and weaponized engagement  to make it more addictive.  And now they're offering you these tools that, you know, see, we don't we can help you stop.  I think these kind of reminders in that sort of thing are actually sort of the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they?  So, yeah, I mean, like there are times when I'm laying on the couch and it's late at night  and I'm like, I should probably go to bed.  Let me just read a couple more articles.  And then if my phone were like, let's just make this slightly less attractive to you,  because really you should be sleeping.  That would actually be nice.  So I wake up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know better, but I wake up every morning at four o'clock and I've tried different things  like putting my phone in the other room and stuff like that.  And I will actually get up, go get the phone.  See, and that's that is kind of I mean, that looks like a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You would probably be a little happier if you didn't do that.  I regret it.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I and I keep buying things on Instagram and I need help there, too.  But it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's another story.  Well, you see, you'd be my father in law.  God bless him.  Used to buy capital, Monte on QVC with a stop.  Yeah, you don't remember.  So the early days of the Web, right?  What do we all do?  We browse.  We followed all these links.  We can go in the hole for hours.  Right.  And then we finally got bored with it.  We said, that's enough of that stuff.  And there's not much to do.  And we stopped browsing.  Give us time.  We figure it out.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still go down Wikipedia rabbit holes for hours.  I'm like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Stacy, perhaps you need some Wikipedia help.  Maybe I needed to go dark out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe I'll pay my five or ten dollar donation in the next month.  I'll pay my five dollar donation and it'll go dark after like an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  So somebody in the chat room said, and I think this is apt, it's like a drug dealer offering you, you know, hey, buy the cigarette companies saying, yeah, we have smoking cessation programs, if you'd like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We see this is the problem I have.  This is this is this is the narrative that's out there.  And this is the Tristan Harris and all that.  And they're equating technology to nicotine and drugs.  And that does not help in the larger discussion when you're going to four places like Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The apps that are out there are designed to be psychologically addictive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we're so we're novels.  So we're so we're novels are far less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So are.  Oh, that's true.  But I've got my creative, my creative hack for mini series.  So I am.  I stopped before the cliffhanger ending.  And then I watched the cliffhanger and wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You haven't talked about that before.  So what's this?  What do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so when I'm watching like Stranger Things or something on Netflix that totally, you know, they're like, keep going.  We always stop it like right before the end or we watch the next section.  So you don't see the cliffhanger.  We either don't see it or we see it.  We go a few more minutes and then we stop and then we start the next, you know, that's that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's an old other illness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, like sometimes you watch the cliffhanger and then you move on until, you know, you get the dating on the fun, like intro to the next problem.  And you're like, click, we're done.  It's silly, but it actually works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to pull your family about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My husband is totally for it.  He actually thinks it's hilarious that I feel the need to do this because he's like he can totally stop watching.  I, on the other hand, am like.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, don't you think, though, that there are, I mean, are you asserting that it's not addictive at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm asserting that it's not nearly that it's not physically addictive.  What about the dopamine rush?  This is not the new heroin.  Listen, you can get addicted to anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're saying it's addictive, but it's just not that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, well, let me say you could be, you can have a habit form around anything.  You could have a compulsion.  That's true.  Anything.  Washing your hands.  Right.  Exactly.  And and and so anything can become that.  But that doesn't make the thing bad.  The problem is this is being used as an argument for why these things are bad and the companies that make them are evil and they're they're manipulated.  No, they're giving you what they want.  That's OK.  And people have agency to sound like an academic.  I'm not.  And they can choose what to do when they do.  You're an academic, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got bad news for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did I did a string on Facebook, words that academics say that no one else says.  My favorite one is agency agencies.  The other one is normative normative.  Love it.  Mm hmm.  Chat room.  What are the words?  There's lots of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's lots of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what the others were.  Anyway, all right.  Onward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've had our we've had our disagreement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm addicted to the to the rundown.  So I want to make sure we get through.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google has decided not to renew Project Maven.  This was the Pentagon Pentagon drone AI imaging program that Google had bid for successfully  won and was working on until hundreds of Google employees sign a petition.  Thousands, I think thousands of thousands of doesn't quit.  Four thousand doesn't quit over it.  It doesn't quit.  And then thousands of thousands sign a petition.  Project Maven.  Google has decided not to re up.  They will not seek another contract for Project Maven.  And they're getting, believe it or not, some criticism for not continuing on.  Michael Bloomberg says Google has abandoned national security.  It's a grave error.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so this is again, this is like loaded language.  Of course, that of course, some people who disagree with it are going to say they're  abandoning national security, just like the people who don't agree with it are saying  Google's not become going to become the Panopticon.  It's like that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Another way here, Stacey, it will.  Let's talk about the real issues.  No, but anyway, we're World War Two and Ford says we don't want to make tanks.  In some views, that would be bad either way.  That would be bad.  But what Bloomberg is trying to say is the same thing.  And I understand the argument.  I'm not sure what I think myself on this, because I saluted the employees who said this is not  what we want this company to do.  And they spoke up and the company listened.  And I think that's the right decision.  However, and apart from venal administrations, we may or may not have.  At some point, there are things that are in the interest of national security.  The Pentagon does depend on private companies to do many things like build hardware.  And so what it's a fascinating question to me is all I'm trying to say.  It's a fascinating question to say what would be anti patriotic, anti American, what would  be against the interests of your nation and what's for?  I don't know what the answer to that is, but I think it's more than just dismissing the criticism.  I think the criticism has its value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And my frustration with this is we are only going to have the debate at these high level  terms like, oh, they're destroying national security.  Oh, they're not creating the panopticon.  When reality, we need to dig into these nuances.  And I would say that Google and especially Internet companies more so than others are  so international.  I can see why an argument for national security may not really resonate with them because  they are an international company at kind of the highest level in terms of where their  audience is, what they're thinking about.  Yes, they are headquartered here.  But yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Bloomberg says that the program that Google is part of, and I quote, is intended in large  part to help the military avoid accidentally striking noncombatants and civilian infrastructure  by being more accurate.  If you presume that the operator is trying to only go after combatants, then is it wrong?  Is it evil for Google to help stop or lower the level of civilian deaths in the war that's  going to occur anyway?  Or is it evil that Google helps war in any way possible?  Same argument about the robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is like the Oppenheimer dilemma right there.  Should you build something that could be utterly evil?  And I think the Google employees who kind of took that stance where, hey, this could  be good in one sense, but horrible for mankind in general, you know, or for democracy in  general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Bloomberg is also saying that he trusts the Google employees to leaven the decision  making being made and that he wants them in that debate in their voice.  Again, I'm not arguing either way here because I respect what the employees said and I respect  what Google did.  But I think this is, as you say, it's a nuanced argument.  And I think Bloomberg's arguments are actually nuanced.  The headline may not be, but the argument is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, my arguments with the headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I find it very, I don't, you maybe know better than I, Jeff.  He was your mayor.  Actually, he wasn't your mayor, but you do work in New York.  Does he do a lot of bylined editorial pieces?  No, he doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what's so interesting.  It's very rare.  This feels very political to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This feels like a first volley in a presidential campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I watched him at a off the record conference talk about the last time, and he went through  a really good argument for why an independent just cannot succeed.  This is going to change in a second.  But his argument is that, A, it's hard as hell to get the votes to win at all.  Even if you do win, you can't get anything done in Congress because both parties are  against you because you're independent.  Well, that was pre-Trump.  Trump is kind of a Republican, and he's kind of an independent that's taken over a party.  I could see Bloomberg running as a Republican.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just to get rid of Trump.  Just to get rid of Trump, a moderate Republican.  I think this is the kind of thing you start with, which is a patriotic defense of America.  I think it's a point.  How old is he?  He's a little old, but he's not as old as.  Okay, Google.  How old is Michael Bloomberg?  He's not as old as Dianne Feinstein.  76 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  The election's in two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's 78.  He couldn't be more sp- I've seen him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been a friend of mine since literally across the desk from him.  He's peppy.  Oh yeah, he's in good shape, Michael.  Very good.  But you're right, Leo.  I think this is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's almost moot whether he's got a point or not.  I think this is really more a political gesture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think there's another thing that happens.  So to me, it's fascinating, the dynamics here, because I- at some point, I expect an argument  from some people to want to retake the Republican Party.  Or there's kind of a new center that goes with the Clinton-esque Democrats trying to  pull in the David Frums and the Michael Bloombergs.  But meanwhile, you have Bernie Sanders on the far left trying to torpedo some centrist  Democratic candidates this week.  And the dynamics are head exploding in terms of all the permutations and complications  that could occur here.  So yeah, Bloomberg could just be making a larger political move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the kind of thing you'd want to do if you're going to come in as a progressive  Republican.  Start with waving the flag.  Yeah.  That would be- before you start saying, and by the way, no more big bottles of soda.  So this-  Yeah, speak of the nannies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was actually thinking of that.  I was like, oh no.  Now I know how Jeff feels about the soda tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that still in place in the-  No, no, no.  He lost.  He lost.  He lost that.  Yeah.  Rightly so, probably.  People- see, that's interesting.  I don't mind Apple and Google putting anti-addiction features into their phones, but nobody should  be stopped.  Stay away from my Dr. Pepper.  Nobody should be stopped from drinking a gallon of soda, if that's what they want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought the soda tax was a good idea.  I am not going to lie.  I thought it was a great idea.  What's next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Spiekreen tax?  I would pay it to time.  Well, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's next is Uganda's social media gossip tax.  Yeah, that is a funny one, isn't it?  It's funny, except for people who want to be able to actually talk.  It's not, at the salary rate in Uganda, not trivial amount of money.  It's a significant amount of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty clear, and Greg Farrow brought this up, this is just another way of extracting  money out of a company, out of a country.  Some politician will get access to this fund.  It's a daily fee of a nickel, but that's a lot when the average per capita income is  $600 a year.  A daily fee of a nickel for anyone who uses social networking, messaging apps and platforms  like WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter.  The president was a vocal supporter of an advocate of the bill.  He says social media encourages gossip and maybe other things like uprisings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  3% of your income, you do it every day.  That's a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But hey, I bet they're not addicted to their phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's something I might get addicted to.  Larry Page's flying car made its public debut today.  Kitty Hawk unwrapped its updated vehicle on Wednesday and allowed a CNN reporter to pilot  the vehicle with less than an hour's worth of training.  The update says it's so easy that you can learn how to fly this flying car without hardly  any training at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to give you the predecessor here, very important.  Hold on one second.  This is something that may be too old even for you and me.  Look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at it.  It's so cute.  It's got to be noisy.  Can you hear the, are you getting my audio cars?  Maybe they're not going to give us the...  Look at that.  That's got to be noisy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is cool.  That is cool though.  So then what happens to the wheels?  So when it lands...  It's got 10 propellers.  It's got pontoons.  So it post-wards, lands vertically.  And then does it drive?  I want to see it drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a car.  Or does it just land in the water?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why is it only flying around?  I thought it was like a car.  I think it's a drone.  No, no, see?  Well, I don't know.  Leo, I just put it in the run down in the comments.  Okay.  This is so old fashioned of Larry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Larry's just not weird.  This is children.  All right.  Let's look at this.  Let's look at this YouTube video here.  Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was a show.  I remember, I think it reruns, not originally.  I don't know what year it was on.  Bob Cummings.  I remember this.  Bob Cummings.  Yeah.  Give it a sec here.  Here it is.  See that plane?  It looks exactly the same.  It's a car and it really turns into a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The new Bob Cummings show.  This is the open.  Oh, Bob.  Oh, Bob.  He was such a dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bob actually was.  He will actually, he was.  It's an issue.  Oh, really?  I didn't know that.  Oh, shoot.  So the Aero car.  Yeah, that wasn't in that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the 1960 Aero car.  Here it is.  Watch this.  Here we go.  Here we go.  I don't know.  Do you have, what's the deal?  Are you not getting my audio?  I don't understand.  So weird.  It comes and goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this is like trouble music right here.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what I'm watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What the hell am I watching?  Oh, here it is.  Here it is.  It's driving onto the Mac, Adam.  It looks like a Trabant.  Where's the wings?  Okay, and the CNN reporter is being shown how to drive it.  That's Larry Page in the green hat.  Okay.  Here you go.  Let me just attach the wings.  I like that knob.  Oh, gosh.  It's a thousand feet up there flying along just like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm so, do you guys like scooter rides?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't see the, how's it going to take off?  Oh, here it is.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  We attach, we attach the wings.  Oh.  It tows the wings, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hahaha.  That seems like a terrible idea.  Hahaha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Humans are messed up.  Humans are just strange.  Okay, now they're detaching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was much easier when Bob Cummings did it.  I've got to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is from 1961.  This is the Aero car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this is not.  This is much easier than this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm disappointed to learn that Bob Cummings was a dog.  He seemed like such a nice guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice guys can be dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have that friendly guy.  Oh, this is fun.  Those are the worst ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got it on What's My Line 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my God.  This is a little harder than Larry Page's.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hahaha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're now, they're now.  I'm not getting up in the air on this thing.  There's no way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think by the end of the show, we're going to get you to buy one, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All they need to do is an Instagram.  Were they sending the two little girls in there?  An Instagram ad.  Yeah.  Don't let the little girls fly.  I think this is, they're not going to actually go in the air.  This is, this is no longer.  This is.  Okay.  That was my fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was the.  So I'm listening to Jim Fallows, Jim and Deb Fallows.  Jim Fallows, the wonderful Atlantic columnist.  I've missed him.  Yep.  Their book about flying all around the nation from 2014 to 2016.  I think it's very good.  It's about finding hope in America today.  It's about finding optimism and good ideas and people are doing good things.  But Fallows is a pilot.  Right.  So he's flying the Cirrus, one of those planes with the, with the, with the parachute.  You know about that, right?  No.  Yeah.  It's the Cirrus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The one of those.  What?  The Cirrus.  Yeah.  It's a plane.  If you go to a CI double R U S a aircraft.com, it's a plane with a parachute built in for  the plane.  So like it's planning on crashing.  No, it makes you, makes your wife feel safer.  It says Mrs.  Fallows.  So if you look at the S R 20 and then Cirrus airframe parachute system, there's video there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you know all this?  I'm just weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go down 20, go to the 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Perfect dual role airplane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now scroll down.  Red cat, red type there.  No, no, no, no, no.  Up, up, up, up, up, up, up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The caps, the airframe parachute system.  So if you have, if there's a problem.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got a single engine.  You deploy the parachute.  It doesn't work.  You deploy the parachute and you come down.  So this is what he's driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  All around the country.  Actually, a scooter X says a few lives have been saved by this life in this thing.  So she was flying in this plane, flying along, flying along.  And then all of a sudden.  And it just, that's so interesting.  Isn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Huh.  These are now, I think Cirrus are now the number that he said in the books and where  I don't know what the, the, the category was, but largest selling plane in their category.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently we have some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just, they're also more comfortable evidently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have, we have somebody in the chat room who flies them.  Says he's, it's a heck of a plane to fly.  Oh, look, there it is.  It's coming out of the sky.  Wow.  That's what can we see?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's talking about, there we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Isn't that amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  And all they had was a cracked thing.  So save that, see if this lady's life.  Yeah.  Well, that's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pretty good.  All right.  This is what we do.  We go off on tangents to tangents to tangents.  If I ever buy a plane.  It's just like the old days of browsing the web.  And I for one find it addictive.  And I have no problem with that.  I'm addicted to our tangents on Twig.  Is that why you're here every week?  Yes, because I'm addicted.  I try to give it up, but I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't they have a buy button on the website?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does it cost?  What does it cost?  Have you ever, did you ever,  I've got to guess Leo,  that there was a time in life  when you wanted to learn how to fly?  Never.  Ready?  Are you ready?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you ever want to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  $439,000 and 900 cents.  Really?  Yeah.  Yowza.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So those parachutes are saving the 1%.  Half a million smackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, Stacy.  Half a million smackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's cynical of you.  Now, if you want to get it loaded,  it's $539,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you probably want it loaded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's their cheapest plane.  The SR20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, the cheapest.  The jet is $2 million.  I don't know if the jet has a...  Does the jet have a parachute?  I doubt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it costs less than leasing my Tesla.  Not quite as practical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  So Kitty Hawk went up in the air.  Kitty Hawk.  We were excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kitty Hawk, the mysterious flying car startup  funded by Google co-founder Larry Page,  unwrapped a huge update on Wednesday.  It's promising to get people in the air in under an hour.  It's now open for test flights  for people to place pre-orders.  What does it mean in the air in under an hour?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Without training, you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's how much training you need.  Right now they're testing it exclusively over water  at a facility in Las Vegas.  After just an hour's training,  the CNN reporter, Rachel Crane,  was able to fly the machine at a speed of...  No, this must be wrong.  Six miles an hour?  That can't be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At a height of 10 feet above the water?  That can't be right.  Or Sebastian Thrun strikes again.  Sebastian Thrun.  The creator of the Google self-driving car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's easy to use as playing Minecraft.  It's powered by a lithium-ion battery  which can be used for 20 minutes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't think ahead.  Two miles an hour.  There's people on the road

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  who can't think ahead to passing one car.  That means you can go two miles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The joystick is so intuitive.  But it's not the most comfortable thing I ever sat in,  said Rachel.  You can definitely feel the vibrations.  10 motors, 2 control sticks.  It's conducted 1,500 test flights so far  among interested business partners  and social influencers.  We have a chance.  Why didn't they invite you?  Me? You?  I'm not going up in that thing.  Maybe this is good for, like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you know, in Sydney with the water taxis.  Or if you think about a place like, I don't know, Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They hope the vehicles will be able  one day to fly it up to 100 miles an hour  over populated areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As opposed to swamps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the 6 miles an hour must be a typo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean, that might be.  I mean, this is brand new, right?  So I don't know how fast the Wright Brothers plane went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me see in the video how fast it looks like it's going.  Looks like it's going a little faster.  Maybe not.  Oh, it's faster than 6 miles an hour.  Yeah, it's faster than 6 miles an hour.  It's faster than 6 miles an hour.  6 miles an hour is as fast as you walk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or slower than you walk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's interesting.  I don't know.  See, I just want to keep my feet on the ground.  That's why I never really hankered to be a flyer either.  I don't mind commercial flights, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey, if you were given a free hour of training, would you do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I'd totally do it.  I'll tell you what I.  I want to go hang gliding, so I am clearly nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really want to buy this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did it once.  I did it in Napa after enough wine samples.  Well, I've done a glider in Napa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to hang glide summer.  Hang gliding.  You did a hang glide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm not doing that.  No, I'm not doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're in a glider.  I did a glider.  It's like a plane with really big wings and then they pull you up in the air.  But what he didn't tell me is that right before the flight, they were trying to decide it was so windy if they should go up or not.  And they said, well, this will be the last flight of the day.  Or your life.  And then as I'm getting in, my wife, we just got married, said, do you have insurance?  I said, yes, but it's not in your name.  I waved goodbye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've just gotten married.  I hadn't had a chance.  I didn't die.  Here's the good news.  This is what I want.  This is a Google project called Project Oasis.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, I like this too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is kind of dumb.  I got to figure out why my audio comes and goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Inside, but inside a box.  We live in between nature and technology and we usually look at...  Let's do this from the beginning.  Here we go.  I'm Harpreet and this is Project Oasis, a voice controlled terrarium that recreates weather outside, but inside a box.  We live in between nature and technology and we usually look at them as two very different worlds.  Project Oasis brings these worlds together and lets you interact with them by using your voice.  It's a self-sufficient closed ecosystem that can mimic sunlight, rain and clouds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the weather like in Hanoi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Reported.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now they're making the weather in Hanoi in the terrarium.  Weather in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Reported.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Unfortunately, it's too snow.  Project Oasis was made with Google's tools, Dialogflow and Cloud Publisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You also can't tell the actual temperature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is just a simple experiment to expand a conversation with nature and technology.  Right, so I don't really get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can build your own terrarium by using the following...  I think it is an awesome project.  It's on GitHub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a cool project for science class, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a great project for science class.  It's also like, I mean, okay, I like terrariums.  We have lots of plants in my house and millennials, they love plants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey, you know why you love this.  This is IoT comes to plants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is IoT, yes.  It's IoT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's too bad Father Robert's leaving us because he could totally build this.  It uses an Arduino.  Wow, you know what?  We should build this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's kind of fun.  Oh, no, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  It's a Raspberry Pi 3 and an Arduino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you need the computer for the Pi and then the actuators attached to and managed by the Arduino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mist rain lights.  Something called...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's also, it is a terrarium, so it's self-contained too.  You don't have to walk around.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something called a peristaltic resonator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Peristalsis is when you like throw things up.  So, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you use, you got to get openweathermap.org.  You get an API key and it uses Node.js and the Raspberry Pi.  I think I could do this.  Should we build one?  Go for it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they did put it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Make it larger.  Make it like human-sized.  You could live in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Make the studio be the terrarium.  The studio into the terrarium.  And then you could say, you know, Jeff, you could say, hey, let's make it like Hanoi in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It starts raining on Leo.  So, Stacey, you don't get the punch, but you get to soak Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that would be okay.  Weather in Antarctica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does use Google's cloud.  I mean, the whole point of it, I guess, is using Google's cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it uses their voice kit.  You know how they've got these.  They've got these new voice kits.  They have another one that's like a servo kit or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google's Dialogflow parses natural language for the required parameters of city, location, or action.  So, you got the Dialogflow functions, the cloud pubsubnode.js listener, and then the arduino sketch doing the whole thing.  It's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not saying this is, I mean, there's nothing here other than like, hey, we have cool stuff and you could build cool stuff with it.  It's a science project.  It's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like it'd be a perfect eighth grade science project.  Oh, man, you'd get an A for sure.  Why don't you build one with your daughter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm actually contemplating that.  Maybe that's our summer project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, maybe we should have competing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to compete against my daughter?  Yeah.  She's 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have all the resources of like everyone there at Twig.  How are you going to feel when she kicks your butt, Leo?  Bring it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, were you worried when Google removed the tablets section from the Android site?  Yeah.  And then they brought it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But.  My daughter was today was asking how big a one of the Kindles is and she said seven inches.  How big is seven inches?  Funny you should ask.  Out comes my old Nexus 7, which I adored so much.  So good.  So.  I loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  We'll come back with more.  Jeff Jarvis, Stacey Higginbotham.  This week in Google.  Google, our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  Number one lender in the country.  As of December, number one in volume, but always number one in your hearts.  Eight years in a row, according to JED Power, number one in customer satisfaction for mortgage origination.  Number one for the last four years in mortgage servicing.  People love Quicken Loans and they're going to love it even more when they find out about Rocket Mortgage.  It's an entirely online mortgage approval process.  No more dressing up to go to the bank.  No more big applications going to the attic and getting paperwork, calling the bank and saying,  do you have my bank statement from 2012?  None of that.  All you got to do is go to rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  You could do it right now.  Set up, you know, the set the account up without applying.  And then the next time you're in an open house or you see a house you like, or maybe you just want to lock in the low interest rates because interest rates are going to go up.  You can refi right now.  All you got to do is go to rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  You can do this on your phone.  Answer a few simple questions.  Then because they have relationships with all the financial institutions, once you give them permission, they can go out and get everything else they need.  You don't have to go through the attic.  They do.  And it's great because based on income assets and credit in around 10 minutes, usually less, they'll analyze all the home loan options for which you qualify and get back to you with the one that's just right for you.  You choose the rate, the term, the down payment, and you're done.  You'll apply simply.  You'll understand fully and then you'll mortgage confidently.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  Equal housing, lender, license in all 50 states, and MLSconsumeraccess.org number 3030.  I know this is kind of the home buying season right now.  People going out and looking at houses.  Go armed.  Get right now.  Go to rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  Get it all set up on your phone.  And then you'll be ready.  You see something you want.  Before you leave the open house.  You can show the realtor.  We're approved.  See, it says that right here.  They've even got for the old timey realtor, they've got a button that says print out a letter that says you're approved in case they need this.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  I think on Monday, Apple took an opportunity to definitely to poke Facebook.  And not in a good way.  And I think even a little bit of Google as well.  So, for instance, in the demo on digital well-being, on hiding stuff, they showed usage.  And the three sites that they showed, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube.  But also, they're beefing up Safari.  And this one, Steve Gibson brought this up, and I thought this was a very interesting point.  They're going to add tracking protections in Safari to prevent ad tracking, new privacy tools.  And they specifically mentioned Facebook.  And this is the question that Steve asked.  They're going to block the like button and they said share button, similar buttons on sites so that Facebook and presumably others can't get shadow dossiers on you by just following around on the net, whether you're a member or not, based on the like buttons.  That's a good thing.  But Steve pointed out, is it going to ask permission for every single thing it sees?  And isn't that going to bug you?  Are you going to say, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just like being in Europe.  Like those cookie ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, God, I know there's cookies. Click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is going to be more-  Having just come from Europe, Stacey.  Everything now.  We're all getting this on our email newsletters right now, right?  But you're there.  It's just bombarding you with verify, verify, verify, verify with GDPR.  So that's really interesting.  Yeah, I bet it will be like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Craig Federighi said, we've all seen those like buttons and share buttons.  Well, it turns out these can be used to track you.  It's true. Whether you click on them or not, it's true.  And so this year we're shutting that down.  And so he showed the web browser will prompt you, do you want to allow Facebook.com to use cookies and website data while browsing a website?  Yes or no.  Presumably, they'll also be allow forever, allow for, I don't know.  But if they do that for everything, it's going to be incredibly annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that an anti-competitive move?  Well, now what I'm wondering is maybe they're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Antitrust move?  Yeah, maybe they're only going to do it for Facebook and maybe Google.  I mean, maybe and maybe Twitter.  Maybe they're going to say, well, allow because because I don't know if you know this, but every site you go to has multiple trackers on it like that, including Google Analytics or even our site.  And we're not collecting any ad information, but we have Google Analytics.  Chartbeat is another one because we want to monitor traffic on the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As I always say, this is Apple turning a bug into a business failure into a feature.  I'm really trying to sell advertising.  They failed.  They don't know how to use the data, so they don't want that.  They don't need the data.  Thus, they can go after everybody else.  Their competitors who do use the data as part of their business, which is not going to just be Facebook.  Not going to just be Google.  It's also going to be Amazon.  Yeah, they didn't mention Amazon.  Amazon is making a fortune in advertising now, and Amazon clearly needs to track you to make recommendations.  So the big three.  So they're going after they're the fourth horseman attacking the other three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and then there's this issue.  The New York Times said that Facebook told it that the Apple, Samsung and others had asked for information about users on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook, isn't this for the old feature phones?  Isn't this going back to an earlier and stupider time at the company or?  Oh, I don't know.  Facebook had reached.  I believe this was going.  Microsoft, do they have phones now?  Blackberry.  This was back to devices.  I didn't read the full all the stories about it, so I can be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it goes back, but they said that some of these are.  The relationships.  In the original, the relationships continued.  Facebook says we're going to start turning these off, but they've been going ever since.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They started it and then they let it go on for all kinds of modern devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Times said most of the partnerships remain in effect, though Facebook began winding them down in April.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just as Cambridge Analytica occurred in 2014, they said, oh no, they cut it off in 2015.  They've got to audit their earlier life because there's stuff that might have been OK at the time, might have not been OK at the time.  In any case, it ain't OK now.  And they got to figure this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook allowed the device companies to access the data of users' friends without their explicit consent.  Which was the case in 2014 for us.  No, no, even after declaring it would no longer share such information with outsiders.  Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from user friends who believed they had barred any sharing the New York Times found.  Then Tim Cook says no, it didn't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and Facebook also kind of took issue with their reporting, but in a very self-serving way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Facebook got a non-denial denial.  Tim Cook says we've never been in the data business.  The things mentioned in the Times article about relationships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they tried to be for a while.  Actually.  And they also keep data on you and your apps in a way.  And then they piss off publishers because they don't allow publishers to own the relationship.  Apple's not so pure, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and I've said this for a long time, which always irritates the Apple people.  But it's clearly true.  And remember, they were going to do iAds, which were in advertisements that would clearly have been targeting you.  That failed.  Well, guess what?  Exactly.  According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple is looking to expand advertising business with new network apps.  With new network for apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In its controlled world where it knows a heck of a lot about you and will be sharing data.  Guess what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've met with Snap, Pinterest and other companies about participating in an Apple network that was distribute ads across their collective apps.  Now, you and I both know, Jeff, there's no way advertisers are going to buy those ads unless they can target them.  Yes.  It's not competitive if you can't target it.  Why would they buy it?  So, yeah.  Yeah.  Under the concept discussed internally and raised with potential partners, users searching in Pinterest's app for drapes might turn up an ad distributed by Apple for an interior design app.  Snap users searching for the NFL might see an ad for a ticket reseller app, one of the people said.  So, Apple is only pro your privacy as long as it's good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. As long as they failed so far at delivering a good marketing-based business one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, Tim Cook said, no, no, no.  We never, Apple requested, we have, this is so foreign to us and not data we've ever received at all or requested, zero.  So, somebody's lying.  I don't know if it's Facebook or Apple.  Here's what Cook said.  What we did was we integrated the ability to share in the operating system and made it simple to share a photo and that sort of thing.  So, that is true.  So, that is true.  In the operating system, Facebook and Twitter were kind of preordained.  Once you connected your Facebook and Twitter account, you could share within Apple apps right to Facebook and Twitter.  And that was a nice convenience.  By the way, a convenience which has been eliminated apparently from Mojave, the next version of Mac OS, doesn't have that connect with Twitter or connect with Facebook anymore.  So, it's interesting how, you know, I think Apple, it's true that Apple's business model does not, for now anyway, does not require them to track you and so they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they have you trapped in their ecosystem.  Right.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  No, I was just going to say they may not have used the data, but they had access to it too.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Back to the Facebook.  If I were them, and the Lord knows I'm not one of them, but if I were them, I'd be hiring some major consultant to go and basically do an audit of everything.  2017 and earlier.  Every old deal, every old API, every old business structure and just see what still is living on and get rid of it before it comes and bites again.  It's just keeps on coming.  It's a fertile field for reporting, that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what happens when they discover something that's actually making them money?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, at some point, now there's a different balance of the potential damage.  Though damage hasn't really been there.  They haven't lost business, they haven't lost users, they haven't lost stock value, so, but there's still damage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's, I mean, it's very cynical of me, but I think it's safe to say that any corporations' number one concern is monetization.  They're there to make a profit.  They have a duty to the stakeholders, especially if they're publicly held, to use every opportunity to make profit.  And Apple services now make more money than both iPad and Macintosh.  They made almost $10 billion in services this last quarter.  That's a big and growing part of their business.  So it's not just a hardware company anymore.  Yeah.  iCloud, by the way, bit Paul Manafort on the butt.  Did you see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I did.  This is one of those cases where sometimes tech is just too hard for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Manafort is being accused by the feds.  They want to withdraw his bail and put him back in jail because they say he's tampering with witnesses.  They're accusing him of tampering with witnesses.  Two witnesses contacted by Manafort provided the messages to the feds, sulling him out basically, saying they were sending, he was using WhatsApp and Telegram encrypted messaging services to contact them and persuade them to commit perjury.  The evidence obtained by the FBI came from Manafort's iCloud account.  Turns out even though he was using encrypted messaging, the contents of the messages were being backed up unencrypted to the iCloud.  And of course, the feds sent a warrant to Apple and got the message content.  Does that happen automatically?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought they already had a warrant to search his devices prior.  Maybe they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, iCloud.  It's unclear whether this was a new warrant or existing warrant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the people he had contacted evidently contacted the authorities and said he's coming after us to tamper with our testimony.  But my technical question is, if you're on an iPhone and you use Messenger, does it back up automatically to iCloud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you back up to iCloud.  Most people do.  Apple encourages you to back up to iCloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So everything you do is backed up?  Uh-huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, when you saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this is this is where things like Google Photos and iCloud and all of these services, you are you don't think about how far they go.  And that's that's why I'm saying tech is just sometimes too hard for people because you're like, oh, it's so convenient.  I get all my stuff when I lose my phone.  Neato.  But then you're like, oh, it does live somewhere that's not my phone.  And that means other people get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the message you get with from iCloud on backup your chat history and media to iCloud.  So if you lose your phone or switch to a new one, your chat history is safe.  You can restore your chat history of media when you reinstall WhatsApp.  That should be, by the way, right there.  A red flag.  It does say media and messages you backup are not protected by WhatsApp and and encryption while in iCloud.  Oh, that's nice of them.  So you did. I mean, it was he just didn't read that.  But who does? And I think there is very much the general sense that, oh, Apple, everything's encrypted.  Apple's protecting my privacy.  I don't have to worry about that.  But but it's backed up unencrypted the cloud.  And there is a box you can check that says encrypted.  But it's not I don't this I'd like to find out more about.  But I think that means it's encrypted on your machine.  I don't think it's I still think it's not encrypted in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although I would say if you're going to tamper with witnesses, go the old fashioned way.  Do it in person. Do it on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And a guy named Joe. He has ankle. He has ankle bracelets to him.  He can't leave the house. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so then he should he should make well, his phone's probably tapped.  Yeah, he's screwed. Then he's going to have to get creative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he's going to have to he's going to have to have a friend of mine who can who can have a chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would be a shame if anything were to happen to your nice home.  Signal and wire don't allow you to back up.  So and both messaging apps allow users to set up messages to self-destruct.  So signal and wire don't let you back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they manage to block that function in Apple.  Yeah, they're not part of the backup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got it. So just a word of warning.  Next time you want to do a little witness tampering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or anything really that might be considered illegal or ill founded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or you just don't want anybody to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How did he communicate with the Russians?  You think he would have some training along the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this stuff's hard.  But the competence level being exposed here is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you remember when we were laughing at Facebook?  In fact, Jeff, you came up with a solution for this because I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is why I put it on there. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They said, if you don't want revenge nudes to be posted of you, we can prevent that.  But first, you need to send those nudes to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That way, they'll hash them and destroy them was the argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but but what they do.  Yeah, but I think somebody's going to have to look at them just to make sure that they are.  It says there. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. So we review by human being that alone.  Right now, I argued when we discussed this originally that they should give you a hash so you can you can scan your own photos and send the hash to Facebook already hashed.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then the problem you could they're they're concerned that then you might hash just photos of yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. But the solution to that is that when there is a match, then a human at Facebook, they review it.  Right. But wait until there's at least wait until there's a match before you look at my nude pictures.  It's a solution.  I think there are better ways to do this, but at least they're they're doing something about revenge porn.  So I can't really complain.  A team of five count them five Facebook employees will be looking at your nudes.  Unix all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was curious about this. So five is this each photo or just a team of five is going to handle all revenge porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I find it hard to believe that a team of five could handle the volume.  But how many people are going to send new photos? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so this was a confusing number of people to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, the the the images transformed into a hash and deleted within seven days.  So they want to keep it around for a little longer so we can pass it around a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, my assumption is they will have a backlog and you've got seven days to deal with it.  I could be wrong. I mean, so the idea here is someone I break up with somebody and they've got naked pictures of me and I'm concerned about what they do with it.  I would send them my version of your copy of those naked pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that person has the naked pictures. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's that assumption. And then there's also the assumption because hashes can be deceived by just altering bits of the original photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you could just crop it and it might it would be different hash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So there's there's a lot to be concerned about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless they just took the body part or something like that.  It's terrible. I mean, it's terrible. It's a terrible thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's terrible. We have to do.  I have several good friends who had this happen to them that, you know, malicious exes have distributed nude pictures of them and it is devastating and there's nothing you can do.  There really isn't anything you can do about it. It's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is why I'm like very against nude pictures.  I don't care what. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No sexy photos for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of a sensible general statement here. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't let anybody take pictures of you.  I mean, the problem is it's your husband or boyfriend or somebody you know you love and trust at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and guys also really pressure girls into that, especially younger girls.  There is a huge amount of pressure at younger ages to be like, oh, yeah, so is so send me a picture of their boobs.  I want to see yours. It's like part of flirting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now and now among young people, right, that sexting is very common.  Maybe the answer is there'll be nude pictures of everybody in the future, so it won't be a big deal.  So it's not it's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that would be my kind of answer. Right. So that is your answer.  This is the ultimate publicness.  So I was talking to somebody the other day who took a course in photography at Harvard many years ago with a famed photographer.  Of course, it was Harvard and the first assignment.  I said, I want you to pair up for an assignment.  So as this woman who told me this said, well, you look for the cute boy, the cute girl and then you should regret it because the assignment was to go and photograph each other naked.  What? What a horrible only way only this way.  So this professor, you could you understand how you the person is making themselves vulnerable to you when you go take their portrait.  That professor's a dirty old man.  That ain't happening today.  What hopes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do remember an acting class.  I had a love scene, not a naked love scene, but like you'd be kissing somebody, which is very hard, by the way, to kiss to just kiss somebody in an acting scene.  But but I had a partner and we'd rehearsed it and we got used to it.  So it was fine.  And then the and then the day of the performance, the acting teacher says, OK, switch partners.  It was like, what? It was it was not it was surprisingly difficult.  But I think that was the intent, because if you're an actor, I think you have to get used to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I don't think let's watch it.  Don't tell me what happened.  Do not tell me what's happened because I have an episode and halfway from the end watching the Americans.  No, I can't hear any of it.  I know I can't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're safe with me.  I've never seen it.  Oh, I want to see it.  I haven't seen it.  Raving about the last episode like it's the best thing ever.  But I don't want to hear anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jatt room. Nobody.  I don't hear anything.  But when they kiss, because, you know, I have a crush on her.  She's she's wonderful.  And and so they had a crush on each other.  And they now are a couple and they're having a kid.  But they had a kid.  But when they kiss on the show, you just look at it differently.  Right. You know, it's not an actor that moment, but it isn't an actor at that moment.  That's interesting to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I always feel really bad for actors that have to do love scenes.  I really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he's got this crazy Welsh accent.  Yeah.  Yeah. If you ever see him talk, you're like, what the what, Philip?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the actor himself is Welsh, but he plays an American.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, or is he a Russian playing a Russian who plays an American?  Wow. So how many seasons?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Five or six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. I got a lot to watch.  I'm saving some really good shows for the old age home because I figure I'll be watching more TV then.  Or download them for the cruise.  You should watch the Americans soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I started.  They'll still be good shows.  I watched the first season, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was not popular at the beginning. I liked this at the beginning.  I love her. I think she's great.  Or she is just great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Billions? Have you watched Billions?  Billions is great. I'm all on to date on Billions.  Oh, I just started that.  Oh, what a good show.  Babylon Berlin.  Best show ever. Excellent.  Also, interestingly, the most expensive TV show ever made.  Wow.  I'm not sure why, but I guess they recreate Berlin in 1928.  Oh, yeah. It's phenomenal.  Yeah, it's a beautiful show.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the other question.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, we like talking TV.  I had to give up on Handmaid's Tale. It was too dystopian.  I couldn't watch it. It was grim.  I couldn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Season two.  Season two. I gave up episode one. I couldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was stuck on a plane, so I gave up midway through season one and then I watched the rest on the plane.  But then I was like, season two, I was like, no, I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you start at all or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I saw some of the...  Actually, no, I did see. I saw a screener, the first screener, and I was like, nope, done.  I didn't make it through the episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sonos has announced a new speaker with...  Yes.  Madame A.  Madame A built in. It's the Sonos Beam 399. It is designed to be a sound bar, but it's small.  I think it was Dieter Bohm in the first compared it to a baguette.  It's 24 inches. Look at all the speakers in here.  And it has Madame A built in. So it would... The thinking is...  And HomeKit, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And HomeKit. The thinking is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Google, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has seven array mics. It doesn't do Google out of the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no Google out of the box. Sorry. So just Siri and Alexa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They say eventually Google Assistant. It does support AirPlay 2, Apple's new protocol,  which they just put out a year after they announced it.  So the idea of this is... Dieter Bohm says it is like a Dieter Rams design digital baguette.  The idea is for somebody who wants a assistant device,  but doesn't want to have one sitting in the living room.  So this is your TV sound bar and it's your assistant, which I think is an interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're going to stop seeing standalone assistants in another year or two.  I think you're right.  Which makes sense. I mean, this is...  You can now have it in a thermostat. So now it's in your hallway.  I've got it in light switches. So now it's wherever that needs to be.  And in your media places, you'll have your Sonos devices.  And I don't know, what else has these things built in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And both Google and Amazon are really fostering this, right?  They have APIs that make it easy for companies to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I actually in the information a couple of weeks ago did a story talking about how if you are a Madam A enabled device hardware partner,  that Google doesn't want to play with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sounds kind of obscene.  Madam A.  Madam A. Sounds like S&M or something, but keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get your mind out of the gutter. It is a responsible...  It's like a polite name for something.  Yes. I just call it Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, but it just sounds so mysterious.  Echo seems safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Echo does seem safe. Okay. So let's see.  Let's see if I can find that information article, because that was really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if they know that you're doing that, they say, no, you're not going to be able to use our Madam A.  Right.  Interesting. So there is a little competition going on.  Yep. Yep. Yep.  One at a yada. You got to decide.  Amazon themselves have launched, this is weird, four new PC designs with Madam A built in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're doing my show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. This is you, baby.  This is what Kevin and I talked about.  These are with something called ODMs.  So it turns out Dell and other companies actually in many cases don't manufacture their own computers.  They are manufactured by original design manufacturers, ODMs,  and then sold by with other people's brands.  So whether this, I'm not sure if this will be over an Amazon brand.  The lineup includes all in one desktops from Wistron, Compile, Quantum,  none of whom you've ever heard of, but you probably owned at some point a Wistron or a Compile or Quantum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They also make their big server in, they started out in the server business with them.  Now they do the PCs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So there's a couple of notebooks, convertible notebooks.  There's an all in one PC and all of these have Madam A built in.  I'm not sure if that means Amazon will sell them or if Amazon is going to make them available to HP, Lenovo, and Acer.  Speaking of Lenovo, that Lenovo Google Home is coming in a few weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, they took, we saw that on B&H Photo.  They took it down.  And they took it down.  But it was, the ship date was 9-3, which I believe is Labor Day or the day after.  It's supposed to be July 17th.  What's the price of that one going to be?  No, it said you could preorder, but the ship date was 9-3.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do we know the price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It depends on if it's an eight inch or a ten inch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have a nice big one and that's the one I'd like to get.  I love the, everybody hates their Echo Show, but I love it.  You know, I don't love mine, but I do want, especially if I keep the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially if I keep the...  The screen is nice.  Yeah, if I keep my Google stuff, then, or rather buy the Google stuff, then I would want it.  Because it is nice to be like, who's at the door and see a picture of them.  Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or Jimmy Fallon's monologue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My daughter watches.  She asks Madam A for TV shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Little YouTube videos and stuff.  Did you read the Wall Street Journal article?  Article, Kristen Grind and Deepa Sitaraman.  Behind the messy, expensive split between Facebook and WhatsApp's founders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I split with the Wall Street Journal, so I can't read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't have access to it either.  Oh, but I can tell you that the Lenovo ones, I'll tell you, eight inches, 150, ten inches, 229.99.  Wow, that's very great.  That's cheap, much cheaper than the show.  And they're nice and they can go, the big one I think goes in portrait and landscape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got that weird dog ear to hold it up.  Okay, sorry. Back to that. Back to drama.  Apparently, the WhatsApp creators are leaving $1.3 billion on the table walking away from Facebook.  Now remember, they made $22 billion.  Yeah, exactly.  So it's not like they're going away poor.  But apparently the dispute was whether there should be ads in WhatsApp.  The WhatsApp duo of Jan Kuhlman and Brian Acton had persistent disagreements.  We kind of know that because both of them have tweeted nasty things about Facebook.  Acton said everybody should get off Facebook. It's terrible.  In recent years, the two have battled Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg,  who grew impatient for a greater return on the company's 2014 blockbuster $22 billion purchase of the messaging app.  Many of the disputes with Facebook involved how to manage data privacy.  We're not surprised Facebook wanted some of that WhatsApp info.  Also about making money from WhatsApp's large user base, including through targeted ads,  which Kuhlman and Acton had long opposed.  In the past couple of years, Sandberg and Zuckerberg pushed the WhatsApp founders to be more flexible  and move faster than other plans to generate revenue.  Once after Kuhlman said, I don't have enough people to implement a project you proposed,  Zuckerberg dismissed him with, I have all the people you need.  That makes sense. You paid $22 billion for something. You want to make a little money back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you paid $22 billion for something and then you told them that you weren't going to do something  and then decided to change your mind, I think that's a little different.  If you're going to promise them not to sell ads, but you're still going to shell out $22 billion,  maybe they're not worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is again Wall Street Journal. When Facebook bought WhatsApp,  it never publicly addressed how the divergent philosophies would go exist.  The WhatsApp founders were very privacy focused. That's why they created WhatsApp.  Zuckerberg told stock analysts that he and Kuhlman agreed advertising wasn't the right way to make money  for messaging apps.  Zuckerberg also said he promised the co-founders the autonomy to build their own products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what you say every time you buy something.  This is again, Mark is not a trustworthy individual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He is very much whatever needs to happen will happen.  Maybe let's call it real politic if we're being nice, but I would just say he's a straight up liar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Trustworthy to whom? To his shareholders? That's the other way to look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but his shareholders then, you can't go spending $22 billion on something  and promise them that you're not going to do the one thing that could make you that money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, all I'm saying, all I'm saying, this is Siva Vaidyanathan makes this point  where he says that I'm too optimistic about companies. The companies must be companies.  They can't be anything else but. And so of course they're going to do this.  That's what they should just recognize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, and if we want to recognize that, then we should take much stronger steps to rein them all in, I think.  I mean, these guys are promising to be so social, to be so lovely and friendly and change the world for the better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they had stayed till this November, Acton left last year, Kuhn leaves mid-August officially.  If they stayed till November, Acton would have made, both would have been fully vested,  which would have meant $900 million to Brian Acton, $400 million to Jan Kuhn.  They were so unhappy that they left that money on the table and walked, even though all they would have had to do is stay till November.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but they already had money.  I mean, yeah, I guess once you have a billion or two, it doesn't really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah. Still. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, yes, it's a lot of money to walk away from, but, you know, they probably felt pretty bad.  I mean, put yourself in their shoes. They created this thing and it is now, they sold it, which was probably kind of dumb of them.  And now, they're watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it wasn't dumb. Are you kidding?  $282 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From their point of view, based on what they built it for, then they're having this attack of conscience.  It's probably easier to walk away from that so they can sort of still live with themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Journal says that it wasn't a spoken disagreement.  There was a lot of passive aggressive stuff going on.  The WhatsApp employees were very noise sensitive.  And so there's a sign here that says, please keep noise to a minimum.  A sign in WhatsApp's offices at Facebook headquarters.  Some Facebook employees mocked WhatsApp with a chance of, welcome to WhatsApp.  Now shut up.  Koum was from the Ukraine, not the Ukraine, was from Ukraine.  Ukraine.  Thank you. And very focused on privacy.  They sat across from each other at Yahoo. Remember that story? It was a great story.  And hated it. And they left Yahoo because they were really upset with the display ads.  They thought it was garish. It ruined the user experience.  So they kind of melded over how much they hated the ad experience at Yahoo.  And they wanted to launch WhatsApp ad free. Remember the charge 99 cents.  No ads designed to be secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The only thing is how do you actually, when you sell your company, you give up your company.  That's called selling it.  I mean, are you going to have a, what do you call it when you have a piece of property that has a big coin in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. But they did have a duty and they tried to meet it to their users where they had stipulations on the sale.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But there were stipulations. Were there contractual stipulations on the sale?  Apparently not.  You can't do that when you sell a company. There never are.  There's two reasons I've never sold.  The board's not going to let you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's two reasons I've never sold Twitter. I mean, I really seriously, I never wanted to give any, I knew, you sell it, you give up control.  I never even took investors. The other reason is nobody offered, but that's, that's neither here.  I always wanted to keep control. It's, you know, if you, if you even take investment, you're giving up control.  That's just what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. It's just, it's just reality.  Everybody knows.  And yeah. So, so I'm not, I'm not arguing, Stacey, that they weren't fighting the right fight, fighting the right battle.  No, they were.  It's naive as hell to think once you're selling a company that you still have control of it.  You don't. That's the definition of sale.  Oh, wait a minute.  You gave it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Blah, blah, blah.  Mr. Zuckerberg assured Messrs. Kuhn and Acton at the time, this is the Wall Street Journal report, that he would, that he would not place advertising in the messaging service.  They also negotiated an unusual clause in their contracts that said if Facebook insisted on making any additional monetization initiatives, such as advertising in the app, it could give the executives good reason to leave and cause an acceleration of stock awards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why didn't they, why didn't they get their full vesting then?  Well, maybe they could.  Or did they get an accelerated, maybe they got an accelerated vesting. Maybe they got more than they would have gotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody really knows. Yeah.  Acton initiated the clause, but Facebook's legal team threatened to fight, so already worth more than three billion, Acton just walked away. He left nine hundred million on the table.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.  Yeah, but that's, that's, that's, it's in your contract. That's what it is. And there's always a clause that says they can change their mind and here's what it costs you.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't know that there won't be more action in this.  It's a great story. It'd be worth paying for the Wall Street Journal just to get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't do it, huh?  Wow. See, I won't pay for Bloomberg. I won't pay 35 bucks a month for the Bloomberg website.  But the journal I'll pay for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The only one that's bugging me that I haven't paid for yet that I may end up paying for just because of what we do here, but I haven't is is Wired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I think Wired's only five bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's super cheap.  That's worth it. And you get a YubiKey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think, I think Condi did the right thing with Wired. I'm really surprised Bloomberg's asking for so much.  Although they have great content, I'll probably end up paying it.  What are they asking?  35 bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dude, the Wall Street Journal's asking for 1850.  But you get a newspaper.  I don't want a newspaper. Then I got to go down my front yard. I got no, I got no intelligent gadgets.  You got to recycle with everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's not cool.  Lisa likes the newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, she can come down. She can walk down my driveway and pick up mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We might have gone all digital, but we started, she subscribed to it early on and then we got the digital as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, you can now get Madame A's Echo Look in your house for a mere $200.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw that and I was like, oh, but it's still so expensive.  Leo, I'm sad that you never sent me yours because I have all kinds of fashionista things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sending it to you right now.  All right.  It's just sitting in my office. I'm not going to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really want, because I was like, oh, $200 is too much to pay for that, but I'm really curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Merry Christmas.  When's your birthday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  April 12th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Happy birthday. I missed it. I'm so sorry. It's on its way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's a scary invasive camera that will take pictures of your clothing.  And it's still linked to my account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a job one.  I don't use it, so you're absolutely welcome to it.  I also have the scanning wand for your refrigerator. Would you like that? I'll throw that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, my daughter discovered that ours makes noise. I guess she never realized this.  So actually the last two weeks she's been running around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Soon your Apple Watch will do that too. That'll be nice.  The Apple Watch is adding walkie-talkie functionality like those Nextel phones.  Do you remember how horrible that was when people had Nextel phones?  Did you ever get stuck with, you know, like in a subway car, Jeff, or, you know, with those push...  Oh, yeah.  All right, Leo, can you pick up some bread on the way home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was thinking the other day how that was...  Yeah, honey.  ...the Nextel, that was the only thing that kept them alive, but it was a key feature for some businesses, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. A lot of construction people, it was the end of the world. Look at that.  I'm going to pack that up. That is going to you, Stacey Higginbotham, your very own Leo Laporte camera in your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just going to call it the Echo Look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would you do me a favor, though, when you pose for it, would you say, Hi, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  No? Oh, well. Oh, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll give you my feedback on the show. How's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's cool enough. I mean, it's got to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe my outfits will be better. That's what I'm...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you'll get more better results than I ever did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I have a lot more variety.  Yes. No, it's not for me, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you... I mean, for somebody who has... I don't have outfits, but if somebody had outfits and looks, it would probably be a good thing.  This is the thing that does a style check and it will say which look is better, and I'm not sure how it knows.  They say they do it with machine learning, but also human fashion experts.  I'd be very curious what you think of it, actually. This is good. I'm glad I can send it to you.  I'm glad we mentioned this. I had no idea you wanted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yay. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anything you see of mine that you want, just tell me, because most of this stuff ends up in a box somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dibs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just like, on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're really knocking it out of the park with these batteries. This is a very interesting...  From Australia to Puerto Rico, the company is changing the world's power grids, according to Fast Company, and making renewable energy more reliable.  These giant batteries store the energy. This is always a problem with solar arrays and wind arrays.  You can get a lot of juice, but the problem is at night, or when the wind dies down, you don't have any. Storage is critical.  The cost of battery storage, thanks, I think, to a great degree to Tesla, is dropping 73% between 2010 and 2016 from $1,000 a kilowatt hour to $273 a kilowatt hour.  They expect that to keep dropping by 2025 to $70 a kilowatt hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bill Gross from Idea Lab, our mutual friend, he has all kinds of businesses around energy storage involving hot rocks and all kinds of things.  He explained to me that a lot of times, water is pumped up and then comes back down as an energy storage mechanism.  The calculations around the cost per kilowatt hour is just fascinating. Absolutely fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. It really solves this issue of renewables because they're not consistent. It's like a generator.  If you can solve this, it's going to be huge for us all. It's going to change the world.  One research firm estimates annual energy storage deployments will go from 2.3 gigawatt hours last year to almost 10 times greater in 2022 to 21.6 gigawatt hours.  It's all about Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So is he uniquely good at making batteries? Does he have something that other batteries or does he just see a market differently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he focused on it early on.  Put a whole bunch together.  Built the Gigafactory.  I think Elon was really smart. He doesn't see electric cars as the end game.  It was a step along the road to a better world. A world where we're not relying on fossil fuels.  He rode it all out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Less a better world and more like stopping us from destroying the world before we hit Mars.  A world we can continue to live in. Mars, Mars, someday.  No, that's his plan though. That was his...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He likes Mars.  That's fair.  I'll give him that. It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like Mars too. I don't know if I'd really want to live there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I question whether we'll be able to live there, frankly, whether it'll be worth the energy.  What do you think of this?  I love Nusselt. I'm a big fan of Nusselt.  We've had Jonathan on. The guy who created Friendster. Nusselt is something he created.  I use it all the time.  They've decided to do... Jonathan Abrams who founded it has decided to do something that actually Elon was thinking about doing with his Pravda thing.  Nusselt rank, an authority ranking of news sources using signals from top business influencers. Have you seen this, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I have. Jonathan said it to me. I think it's very interesting.  I'm going to be doing a fair amount of work around this question of how to help determine quality in news.  It's not an easy thing to do at all.  I saw the sunlight coming into my house.  I like the idea that it will incorporate signals from actual users.  I ran a session at Newsgeist on this. Here's the six areas of signals about quality that I see. Ready?  One, self-declared signals. Trust Project. Sally Lerman and Richard Gingras.  80 news sites have promised to ascribe to certain standards and that needs to be audited.  Two, observed signals.  Add companies like Trust Metrics and Moats. Look at sites and say, oh, they have junky ads or they have hate speech or this or that.  Three, algorithmic scaling of the above.  Four is behavior. You failed 100 fact checks.  Five is public opinion, which is that some subset of the public.  And six is endorsements. I trust you, Leo, to tell me who good tech sites are.  And at the end, there's all kinds of people doing signals across all those kinds of areas and they're all disparate.  And I'm going to try to work on a project to bring them all together into an aggregation to make them useful to platforms and add networks and add agencies.  So all these efforts to create more signals around quality and lack thereof in news, I salute and I'm glad it's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll be curious about that because as a small site, you know, I feel like I'm eminently credible in the area that I cover.  But conveying that can be tough.  Like in the idea of having. Right.  Well, in the audit, like an audit or something like that is interesting.  So long as it's something that I can, as a single person or two person shop can handle.  Right. So that gets like, oh, because I'm credible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look up the trust project, Stacey.  Is it something that that that I think is mainly for larger sites?  The Washington Post is doing it. The Globe and Mail is doing it.  And I'll be interested to hear what a burden it would be on a small site.  Maybe not at all. It's things like labeling opinion versus news coverage, having a masthead, having a reporter bios, things like that.  But let me know. Here's what Jonathan writes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are three components to calculating a Nusselt rank score.  Proprietary Nusselt data, including reading behavior of our users.  I read Nusselt every day as part of my news gathering.  So they pay attention to what I what I click on, what I read.  Integration of external signals about the engagement and authority of news sources.  I'm not sure what that means, but it's kind of what you were talking about, Jeff.  That's what I'm talking about is all those things that may exist. Right.  And then partnerships with initiatives like the Trust Project and NewsGuard.  And so they they have 100,000 sources Nusselt does.  So presumably with 100,000, that would include Stacey on IOT and a lot of other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a lot. If people link to it, if I link to Stacey on IOT enough and you do, then Nusselt picks it up.  That's something. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And surveying is not, I think, a good you can't ask somebody is this trust.  Well, it's what Facebook did that around broadly trusted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I talked to a guy named Rasmus Clayson Nielsen, who's a brilliant researcher at Oxford Internet, Oxford Institute for the Study of Journalism.  And he argued that it is an important factor, that it's only one and it can be it can be outweighed by other factors.  But he's next week he's releasing a study that on top news sites against political views and other factors.  And and he argued that that matters because it's what the public is telling you one way or another.  What's interesting about Nusselt is he's defining it as business leaders.  I don't know how he's if he's cutting off some users and emphasizing others.  I have no idea what he's doing, but Nusselt is pretty much a news junkie service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it sounds a little bit like page Google's PageRank, which is the higher ranked the source that's ranking you, the more stronger that signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I heard somebody recently say the PageRank is as much as a goner because it's just got game so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's too bad. Gaming is always a problem. It's going to be a problem with always, always the problem.  Humans are terrible that way. So I went to Nusselt.com slash rank and it's not live yet.  But I look forward to seeing it on its Nuzzel.com if you want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We had Jonathan on the show. Have you had him on a triangulation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've done triangulation with him. I like Jonathan a lot.  And I think he's been on. We could get him on.  I think he's been on. I think he's been on with us, actually.  Yeah, I can't remember. Yeah, I like him a lot.  And I think what he's doing with Nusselt, you know, he's kind of hung in there because I think it's probably been tough.  It has been. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a case of having a good service without necessarily coming in with a business model.  But it's a really good service. I use it every day, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually told Alan. Oh, gosh, what's his last name?  Now he's the editor in chief over at Time, Inc. or Meredith or whatever.  Alan Murray. Alan Murray. Thank you.  He was asking me where I like how I kept track of everything.  And I was like, oh, Nuzzel, it's great. So he started using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The irony of Nuzzel is it gets his signals from Twitter and if you included Facebook.  And so I can it's a great way to stay on top of what's going on on Twitter without reading Twitter.  I really like it. I really like it for that reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm curious. I'll roll this.  Have you guys been using the new Google News? Oh, yeah, every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mine's still not getting better, Jeff. I'm not loving it.  I am constantly telling it how sucky I think its decisions are to me.  And it is constantly showing me sucky decisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me see what my top five are just out of curiosity, because I think it varies.  It does vary. I agree.  CNN, number one, Trump's great night for Republicans in the California primaries wasn't so great after all.  Number two, NBC News, Melania Trump making her first appearance.  Jalopnik, number three, tear down of Tesla's Model 3 battery.  So it does kind of know what my interests are.  Number four, FCC accused of spreading lies.  Number five, the beam. Sonos is at the ambition.  So those four or five are actually all articles I would read.  It's clearly paying attention to my signals.  But remember, Stacey, if you hit the headlines button, that's not in any way algorithmic.  That's just all the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, but for me, so my first Stacey's briefing today is President Trump today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Trump predicts Red Wave, Kenan Thompson, SNL, Kanye's, Project Wyoming from Pitchfork.  And then Valve says it will now everything on Steam unless it's illegal or, quote, straight up trolling.  Of those stories, I would probably only click on the Valve one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Huh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And I'm talking-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am President Trump today.  This is basically a home run for Democrats.  Attempted burglary of a car in the next town over.  Siri, Google, Alexa aren't yet equipped to handle people with suicidal tendencies.  Uh oh.  It's interesting how different our five-  And here's everything new in Android P development preview.  It's funny how different these three are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So different.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still have so much celebrity news that's ridiculous.  Yeah.  I had more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the first- that's usually my complaint, Stacey.  I agree.  This one, funnily enough, it's down.

Transcript:  Well, there you go.  So this is good.  So they have a Father's Day gift guide.  Let's see.  This is good.  The Google Pixelbook save $250 on the 128.  Oh, it's the low end one, not the high end one.  Did you say it was the high end one, Jeff?  That's what the headlines said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they mean Pixel high end in general.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Not the high end Pixel, but the high end Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's $750 for the base model, which is what I have, what you and I both have, and  it's fine.  Yeah.  That's a good price.  $750, I think that's fair for that.  Students can save 10%.  All right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are adding new phones.  Oh, really?  On top of that?  I don't know if it's on top of that.  They are adding new phones to Google Fi.  I'm happy to say you can now use Motorola.  There are a couple of phones from Motorola, like the G5, the G6.  You can also add your kids to a family plan now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Google Fi family plan can now include kids.  That's good news.  Under 13.  Obviously, it's up to the parent how it's run.  Someday I really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  After they turn 13, you just pay for them on another...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're another adult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're another adult.  Dude, I don't want...  This drives me nuts because my child at 13 is not an adult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  She does get more...  That's a different matter.  But if you...  She gets more things, but...  Actually, 13-year-olds should cost more than adults.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On a phone?  Yes.  Yeah, probably.  Of course they should.  I don't talk on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guarantee you she uses it more than you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, not more than...  No.  My daughter...  I bet she spends an hour on the phone a year.  What?  You mean talking?  Well, yeah, talking, but also she has a phone that she never charges.  She is constantly just on her computer.  That's awesome.  But it's because they don't go anywhere.  And when they go places, they just go places with...  She loads up her computer and goes to her friend's house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is so weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's an outlier.  I don't even know.  And she may also be too young.  Well...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See what happens in two years.  Her school is an outlier, because all of her friends do this too, I think.  Maybe that's just what they think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You do what your friends do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So...  I have bad news, you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My special...  It didn't come.  It didn't come.  Well, I do an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It said it was delivered, and then it didn't come.  Let me do an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe it'll come during the ad.  You can run downstairs.  Maybe it's by the garage.  You said it was delivered?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's good.  Maybe they put it in the wrong place.  Go check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it might be.  I still have something cool to show you, so it's not the end of the world.  Fire when ready, Stacey.  This was the Wyze Cam Pan Cam that I was going to show you.  But now...  I ordered one.  I ordered one, too.  It was supposed to be here today.  I ordered three.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wyze Cam?  We talked about it.  You weren't here.  That's why I ordered three.  They're cheap.  They're cameras that will pan, tilt, zoom.  Do they tilt and zoom?  No, just pan, probably.  No, they tilt and zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They 360 and then 93.  Wyze Cam V2?  That's it.  No, Wyze Cam Pan Cam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  $20 now.  No, no, no.  The V2 is the second...  Wyze Cam Pan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  W-Y-Z-E.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if mine's on its way, too, since you got yours.  But I didn't get mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it came to me instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you order it before you talked about it that day?  I did.  I had ordered it that morning.  Oh, that morning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  But I ordered it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if you can see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Oh, wait.  This is the wrong camera.  Lower the lower...  It's hidden behind the bug.  Yeah, there it is.  There it is.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I love these Blair Witch style videos I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shakey Cam.  She's unplugging it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to go get it out of the way.  I'm going to go get it out of the way.  I'm going to go get it out of the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to go get it out of the way.  I'm going to go get it out of the way.  I'm going to go get it out of the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the Aware Glow and this device is a air quality monitor plus a smart outlet.  So you have the pass through right here.  Oh, no, we're no longer looking up.  There it is.  The pass through right there.  So, or you can have it.  It's a plug.  Yeah.  The light, there's a light that goes around here that acts as a nightlight.  And then there's another light here that glows green or yellow or red to like give you a  visual indicator of your air quality.  Oh, and I just got two minutes ago that the CO2 in here is high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's because of the hot air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stop breathing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a lot of hot air.  Right now we're in a rush hour reward situation.  So my air quality is about to go way down.  What's a rush hour reward?  Oh, it's demand response.  Sorry.  I'm not sure what rush hour reward my utility.  So let's go to the score.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I see you get your electricity cost less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they turn my thermostat down or up rather because we're having trouble producing enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  power.  The utility does?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a voluntary program.  Oh neat.  So how do they access your thermostat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will show you.  It's my Nest and they just go right in there and they say, that is not my Nest app.  Let's go to my Nest app.  So like right here, it's like 81 degrees in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's like, yeah.  It's getting hot in here.  That's really hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is hot.  Isn't that hot out there?  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like 102 degrees right now.  But you don't have AC in your house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, I do have AC.  It's just right now it's set to 82 to save energy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, because it's a rush hour reward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  And if, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys don't have this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Okay.  Here in Petaluma, it's always a balmy 72 degrees.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's nice.  And dry.  And dry.  We don't really have the extremes.  People don't have AC out here.  In fact, I actually had a house for four years that didn't even have heat.  It was an unheated, un-air-conditioned house when the kids were young.  And did you have plumbing?  Yes, we did.  There was a wood-burning stove in the kitchen and that was all, you know, it doesn't really  get that cold here.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Bring me back out houses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, the coolest thing about this device.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm like, I don't know what to say to that.  Is you can actually plug this, you can plug, if you plug certain devices like a fan or  a humidifier or a air quality or air filter through here, you can detect, you can tell  the app what kind of device is plugged in.  And it will actually, when it gets too hot, it'll turn on the fan or it'll purify your  air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you're in New York.  It's so much work to get up and turn on the fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  It's automatic.  So what we have it plugged into an air purifier.  And so when it detects high chemicals, but if you have like an out, if you have a window  unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what does it detect besides CO2?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  VOCs, CO2, humidity and temperature.  Not pollen.  That's particulate matter in the air.  So that's carbon monoxide.  Not carbon monoxide.  Not carbon monoxide, just carbon dioxide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just CO2 and volatile organic compounds like paint.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's not expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do you get too much CO2 in the air besides hot air to be people?  She needs to open her window.  So what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It gives you little notifications like, hey, open your window.  This is happening.  And you know, like when I'm cooking, I can see like, holy cow, my chemicals in the air  are going nutty.  So that's interesting.  And you can actually set it to prioritize different things.  So I have mindset for allergies because we all have allergies.  You can also set it for productivity.  So then it tends to want to keep it cooler and notifies you if it gets too warm and if  there's too much CO2.  So I don't I mean, is this the most accurate sensor on the face of the planet?  I think not.  But it is nice for general trend tracking.  And it's for $99.  It's also a lovely smart plug.  You can actually use it without just to turn it on and off remotely, like if you stuck  a curling iron in there.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cool.  And it's not expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like that.  Can I ask you about the wise camera?  I missed last week.  Yes.  No.  So here's my issue.  Stacey, you're so mean to me.  So here's my issue.  Wonderful little lovely cat.  Girl can't pee in litter box for the damn half the time is peeing like right out in  the litter box.  Fear there.  But somehow managed to be.  We have no idea how this happens.  We don't know what to do.  We don't have no idea that we tried high boxes, low boxes.  So which camera should I put on?  Do I need the full pan cam and all that?  So I guess what I need is a motion sensor and then it turns on.  Yes.  That's what it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That has motion sensing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Both of them have motion sensors.  Both have motion sensors.  It turns it stays on.  I mean it motions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you can stop it from moving if you don't want it to move.  That's just a feature, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's a feature where you're like, you know, it's the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'll also scare the cat, stop her from peeing at all.  And then we'll have a hell of a mess in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So wait, you just want around.  You want the camera just to like send you a picture of the cat not peeing in the litter  box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, peeing in the litter box.  I want to figure out how she pees because we cannot figure out how she knows this camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is going to really pick that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you're going to have to.  I don't.  That's sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, record her pain.  Now, I'm waiting for you privacy nuts to go after me and tell me that the cat has some  level of privacy.  I'm violating here.  No, the cat has no level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If the cat is peeing in front of you, the cat doesn't care.  Well, we'll be in front of us.  That's the problem.  You'd have to put it near the litter box close enough so that you can actually see what's  going on.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We'll do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  15 frames a second, 8x digital zoom, 1920 by 1080.  That's pretty good.  It sees pets.  See that?  See that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's on norm, which is Kevin's dog.  So yeah, just it's 20 bucks, Jeff.  Just stick it in there and see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So which one?  No, so I get the Wyze Cam 2 or I get the Wyze Cam Pan Cam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the pan's going to move.  And if the pan moves and your cat freaks out, that's not going to help you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, it has a speaker in it.  So you could say the Wyze Cam 2 doesn't move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Say pee in the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they both have two way audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, buddy, drive your cat crazy.  Hey, buddy.  Oh, there's a raccoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, let me make sure the Wyze Cam 2 moves.  I don't understand how this could be so cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is that I need to move it to the deck because a raccoon took a huge dump on the  deck.  I hate it when that happens.  Raccoons are such fu animals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It missed the litter box too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I break this every show down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, you do have two way audio on Wyze Cam 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wyze Cam 2, 20 bucks?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What the heck?  It's 20 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  They're so cheap.  And they don't charge you a subscription fee.  You get two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You do have to buy your own SD card to stick in there if you don't want it going out to  the cloud.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you get free 14 day rolling cloud storage.  I'm just baffled by this.  How they get away with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's just on Wi-Fi, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't wait to get mine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You've solved the P problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe.  Or the mystery at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if you're going to actually see anything of value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tell you what, get your camera, bring his video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your number, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see.  I had three at the bottom, but I'm the one that fascinates me a little bit is a story  about Sundar Pichai's name.  It's up in the Google section.  So the number is one.  Sundar is just Sundar.  So a friend named Richard Hay said in a comment on somebody's, a friend of mine, so a friend  of mine, a colleague of mine was complaining that MacBook Pro had no USB port and she was  complaining.  So I said next time Chromebook because I'm obnoxious like that.  That's what I do, even with my friends.  And so anyway, this guy, Richard Hay came down and told a friend from a TGIF at Google.  That they were about to announce the Chromebook and Sergey had Google Glass on and he asked  for the name of a finance minister of India.  And the display came out and said it was P, additional P, somebody or other.  And he wanted to know what the P stood for and he asked and it didn't tell him.  He thought it was a failure, walks away.  Sundar then comes on stage and stopped to tell a story first.  He referenced an earlier incident with the finance minister's name and mentioned that  he was from Chennai where you're only given a single name at birth and no surname.  What?  The rest of the world refuses this cultural convention.  So folks from Chennai adopt initials to fill out, to fake other name to satisfy the cultural  norms of others.  He was born simply Sundar.  He adopted Sundar P, but when he was applying for U.S. citizenship, that wasn't good enough.  So he took his dad's name Pachai as his surname.  He said a friend came back home and asked him how it was working out.  And he said pretty well, he said my wife freaks out when someone calls her Mrs. Pachai.  Wow, that's interesting.  Richard, thank you for that story.  I found that really interesting.  I love cultural moments like that.  Make me feel like that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was your dad's first name, Jeff?  Darrell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you'd be Jeff Darrell.  Or you could be, you know, if you were in Iceland, you'd be Jeff Darlson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My dad's name was the same as mine.  So I'd be Leo Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo squared.  Leo squared.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was your dad's first name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or mom's.  Would it be my dad or would it be my mom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, if you're in Iceland to be your mom's.  No, you'd be dad's Dotyr, but you'd be Dotyr instead of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would be Lynn if it's my mom's, Don if it's my dad's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey Lynn.  Stacey Lynn.  Stacey Lynn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's my middle name.  Oh, oh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ta-da.  Ta-da.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So wine's a little one, but it's a good one.  And if you ever use Google Lens, they finally made a, you know, you had to launch the camera  and then go press the lens button, go to lens.  Now there's just a, it's just a shortcut really on Android, but download it and you install  it from the app store.  It's the Google Lens shortcut and now it launches lens directly, which is really much more useful  because you want to do it as fast as possible in some cases.  So here's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The lens still doesn't know what it's looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your lens.  Well, wait a minute.  Watch this.  See if the lens knows what it's looking at.  Let's see.  Let's see if it's looking at the look, see if it knows the look.  You got to look, you got to look.  Tap on objects.  Yeah.  It might be one of these.  It said amazon.com looking for results.  No, it just knows it's Amazon.  No, that's terrible.  It might be one of these and Amazon.  Well it is.  Oh, you know what?  I thought the word Amazon.  So I'm going to say thumbs down.  You got it wrong.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To be fair, that looks a lot like the canary flex.  It looks kind of like the lighthouse.  It looks like a lot of cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here, let's do this then.  This looks like nothing in that you ever saw.  This is a knob.  It won't get this.  This looks like a grace, a great, oh, it crashed.  Okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Enough.  Yeah.  I'm not, I'm not excited about this lens app just yet.  I got to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will show, I will just a little tease.  I'll be doing a review of this device, which is kind of an interesting device.  It's an Android phone.  It was an Indiegogo project from Planet Computers called the Gemini.  If you ever use a Scion or like the Scion 5, this is exactly like it.  It's an Android 7.1 phone, like 5.7 inch screen, just like a phone attached to actually a pretty  usable keyboard.  Type C charging on both ends.  It's got stereo sound and it can be used as a kind of big and ugly phone, but you can  talk into it like a phone.  It is, and it was not expensive compared to most other Android phones, about $699.  So I will give you my review of this.  I put a T-Mobile sim in it.  So it's just like a phone.  Oh, it kind of brings back memories.  Doesn't it?  And the thing is, it's really nice to type on.  It's like you could actually, I mean, I wouldn't want to write an article on it, but you can  definitely type away on it.  What's the brand?  Gemini from Planet Computers.  If you look for Gemini on Indiegogo, I think it's still up there.  And I still apparently have my bad habit of buying things on Indiegogo.  But this one I like.  This one I think I'm going to give a positive review to.  I mean, it can run Linux as well if you want to put Linux on it.  So that might end up being what happens.  We've raised $2.3 million as English company Planet Computers to make this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So is it just the keyboard or is it the phone?  It's the whole thing.  It's the whole thing.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  How much?  I think I bought, oh, $599.  $599 if you want Wi-Fi and 4G.  We'll compare that to a phone.  It's less than a pixel.  $499 if you just want the Wi-Fi version.  I don't think that that, does that feel expensive?  No, it's not.  Because it's a phone.  It could be your full-time phone if you don't mind.  It's not really slim, but it's not super huge either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here compare.  I just whined the other day about not having the Blackbird anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the Pixel 2 XL.  It's roughly the same size as that.  It's thicker obviously because it has a full-size keyboard.  It's not unfortunately Android 8.  It should be, but it's not.  It's Android 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh.  So people are talking about the price differential for the Wyze Cam.  All that is is shipping for the people wondering.  It's like eight bucks to ship it.  They don't give you free shipping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They shouldn't at that price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, because Amazon, yeah, it's $25 versus $22 for the smaller one on Amazon, $37.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see.  Right.  So my total out-of-pocket cost buying from Wyze was $37 or $38.  I think it was $37.95.  Okay, so it's $37.98 on Amazon.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With shipping.  With free shipping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but it's not free shipping because Wyze is still charging Amazon to get it out of  their house, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, Amazon says $37.98 and free shipping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, but it would be $30 plus shipping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wyze charges you $29.99.  Then they charge you $7.95 in shipping.  It's the same price.  In other words, it's the same price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the same price.  That's what I'm saying.  It equals out.  We agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying.  Yes.  That's because of the shipping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shipping, right.  Even though it's not really the shipping.  I was giving another data point.
