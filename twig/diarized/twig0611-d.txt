This week in Google, the show where we talk about everything but Google.  Stacey Higginbotham is here.  She's our IoT and chip expert.  She's also pretty good on bandwidth.  Stacey on IoT.com is the website.  Hello Stacey, we missed you.  Yes, we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry.  I was, I don't know what I was doing.  Oh, you were busy.  You were speaking.  Doctors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were speaking to Jeff's students.  No, that was not my fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was not my fault.  That was, yeah, that was the day before.  We can't blame Jeff for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, actually let me introduce Jeff then we can talk about Jeff Jarvis is also here.  Leonard Tao Professor for journalistic information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Journal licking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Journal licking, intubation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the  City University of New York.  Normally we would have Aunt Pruitt's Basso Profundo joining ours, Dulcet Tones, but he  is on vacation.  Good for Aunt.  Good for Aunt.  Yay, Aunt.  We have to make our employees take vacation.  Partly because of COVID.  There's nowhere really interesting to go.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm really glad that he finally, it's his first, both he and Mike are taking the  first vacation since they started here.  Wow.  I know.  Wow.  So Scooter X in the IRC has voted for our top story.  You didn't even know we were doing that, did you?  Project Chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought it wasn't a democracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not a democracy.  Scooter X, who put you in charge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He is a dictator.  That's why.  Project Chip gets a new name and so does the Zigbee Alliance.  Stacey on IoT has got the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This has Stacey written all over it.  It does.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was actually, yeah.  Man, this is all I've been doing all week long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is this just a rename or does this mean something more than just that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it is the same standard that we have been calling Project Chip for the last two years,  almost 18 months.  It is now called Matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Chip steps for something though, right?  Chip was an acronym.  Yes.  The connected home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Over IP.  Over IP.  Which technically should be Choip.  We're not going there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Obvious reasons.  I like that.  I like Choip.  They've been Choip almost.  It has a certain kind of yiddish.  Nobody wanted Project Choip.  Honestly, more interesting than Matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They got all this sugar to Choip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Choip.  Yeah.  What is Matter is a very generic, doesn't even tell you anything about what it is.  No, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'd love for you to do a couple things.  So one of this, okay, so let's finish up the story because there's two parts to this naming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Project Chip was part of the Zigbee Alliance.  So what happened two days ago was that both organizations got, or both entities got a new name.  So the Zigbee Alliance, because they're going to be in charge of this new standard for the smart home that was going to be such a big honking deal, realized they can no longer be called the Zigbee Alliance.  Oh, yeah.  Because this new standard is going to surpass Zigbee.  Well, and also because Zigbee sounds like a circus clown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's that.  Well, I mean it's a standard.  Yeah.  Okay.  So now this is better.  The new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's very generic.  You're going to not like it if you don't like matter.  It's the Connectivity Standards Alliance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know why I like this?  Because that's exactly what it is.  That's a name that says what it is.  It's a standard for connectivity, particularly IoT connectivity or home automation connectivity.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  So actually it will be, yes, home automation, but also smart buildings tied to mostly MDUs, so apartment complexes.  So that's the Connectivity Standards Alliance that used to be known as the Zigbee Alliance.  The Project Chip was a working group as part of that alliance.  And now Project Chip is called Matter.  So I had to sit through a 30-minute briefing that mostly focused on fonts because God knows when you develop a new standard and you rename your alliance, fonts are the most essential element.  So what font is this?  They are important.  I'm curious.  They created a font.  So they went to Inner Brands and the font is now called Assemble.  And it looks like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey has an example of Assemble.  Oh, yeah.  That's the same as on the web page.  Oh, yeah.  Is this Assemble?  It's the same as on the web page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's ugly.  And they're very excited about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a hideous font.  I got to tell you, it's ugly.  Ligatures.  Oh, well you learn.  Ligatures.  There are fonts with ligatures.  You know why you want ligatures?  Why do you want ligatures?  Ligatures, no one knows.  It's not ligaments.  It connects the things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it is like ligaments.  That was their art.  They were like, it's connecting things.  And if you want to know.  Oh, no, no, no.  Trying too hard.  Trying just too hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Please, please just let me tell you.  There are 127 different ligatures.  Oh, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And none of them follow any linguistic rules.  I sat there for like, I'm like, okay.  So the A and the N are the same thing.  I'm like, okay.  So the A and the N are the same thing.  I'm like, okay.  So the A and the N are the same thing.  I'm like, okay.  I just want you to know that it's completely random.  I sat there for like, I'm like, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the A and the N are ligatured.  There's no reason for the A and the N to be ligatured.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, I'm going to give you a couple options here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, ice cream, Oreos and toffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The R and the R now looks like it's got an F in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, these are awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So E and A, and this one C and T.  But if you go later and you look at things,  the E and the A are not always done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because you don't have to use a ligature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because some poor schmuck has to manually put it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm familiar with ligatures in fonts because it's not unusual to use ligatures in programming languages and terminals.  So for instance, in some languages double, you have two equal signs and the ligature would combine them into one long equal sign.  For people who are writers, you guys are writers, the M dash, when you type two regular hyphens, you get an M dash and the ligature turns it into a long M dash.  Things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, is that how that? Thank you. Okay, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there is a real good purpose Mr. Linotype knows for ligatures.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, an F and an F really look nice together as ligature.  Right.  But this is ugly.  What's the name of this font again, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Assemble and it was created by Interbrands.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How much money did they make off doing that horrible thing? Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know, but you know what? They're big. So they're okay.  Interbrand, we have another font story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You mean Interbrand IKEA? Interbrand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, Interbrand is a big branding company.  Oh, okay.  Interbrand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah. You know what? They do, among other things, they do fonts because they did a font for 1 Plus it looks like.  They do some other fonts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they do. I mean, it's literally what they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  It's Omnicom.  Oh God. They don't do naming.  Interbrand, a division of Omnicom.  That is like bad science fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, later on in the show, we have another font story. We'll come back to it. So it's font day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Font day on the...  Font day on Twig.  More to the point because nobody really cares about ligatures in this special font design.  That was fun though. That was a fun little...  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was nice for Stacey to have a detour for once. Usually it's our fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not complaining by any means.  No, it was nice. I like that.  But you said something that got me interested, Stacey. The standard is final.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The standard is now at the 0.7 version. It's basically final. They're going to run it.  Now they're starting testing of devices. So things will be tweaked a little bit in testing, but nothing substantial will change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could this be though that we finally reached the holy grail of home automation?  This is...  No.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll let you finish. I'm going to let you finish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Quickly, you shot him down.  This has plagued home automation since for at least a decade was this proliferation of standards that are incompatible.  You had to have a hub for one device and a hub for another device.  I mean, it's just always been a nightmare.  And we've been hoping that this, what was known as CHIP, the Connectivity Standards Alliance...  No, no, that's because it could be MATTER.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What was known as CHIP, it is now MATTER.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is now MATTER, would solve this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So here's what's going to happen.  Here's what it does today.  Well, not today.  Here's what it will do at the end of this year when products come out.  We will see a small section of devices that it will work with.  So lights, blinds, TVs, HVAC, security products, bridges, controllers.  And like controllers like smart displays and bridges are like things to bridge.  Like from like my Hue Bridge, for example.  So those devices will work on the standard.  A lot of other devices that we might use like any of our cameras will not be part of this.  Appliances, not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those devices generally use Wi-Fi.  So that's...  So CHIP, oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So MATTER uses Wi-Fi.  MATTER is an application layer protocol.  So it's at the software layer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it doesn't care what the carrying protocol is, whether it's Thread or Zigbee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Today it cares.  So today it's going to use Wi-Fi for high bandwidth and powered devices and Thread for sensors and low data.  Yeah.  So technically you could run MATTER over something like Bluetooth, but apparently nobody is.  And like the network topologies don't have that.  Bluetooth is only going to be part of this in the sense that you can use Bluetooth to provision for MATTER devices, but not any other parts of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say I was skeptical when Project CHIP was started because it was what was Amazon, Apple and Google, right?  I mean these big companies that have a lot of interest in not working together.  So I just thought I was very skeptical about it.  But it sounds like in fact they were able to figure this out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was going, so if we didn't talk about this, I didn't think everybody would care because, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this was our top story of the week.  This is you written all over it.  It's the top story.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I was going to say if you wanted me to, we could do one of our little Discord chat things if people wanted to ask questions.  But I don't know if you want to do that.  And I know it's not a democracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we can.  So I will tell the people in the stage.  We have a if you are in the Discord, we have a stage.  This is for the Club Twit members.  And we keep this stage open.  Jeff's there and Stacy can join.  And if you have a question, you want to talk about this, do raise your hand.  This particularly we'll talk about this time.  We'll talk about this CHIP thing.  So which is now matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I can also take things from the chat.  We just won't hear your lovely voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TDD has a hand up.  Yes, I see that.  So I'm going to put TDD invite TDD to join the stage.  And yes, of course, if you see something in IRC, feel free as well.  So TDD, welcome to Club Twit.  First of all, thank you so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where are you?  Where are you calling us?  Where are you joining us from?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Missouri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you skeptical of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He says, show me.  Will this work with the Nest Hub?  The Nest Hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, the Nest Hub.  We don't know yet, but Google.  I actually had Kevin Poe from Google.  He's going to be on tomorrow's podcast.  And he says at IO, we're going to see more from Google about this.  Oh, good.  Because they're part of the part of the Matter Alliance.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, that's and then how about Apple's HomeKit?  Will this work with HomeKit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I expect these.  So my hunch, and again, we won't know until fall how they're going to put it in their  devices, because the Nest Hub has Wi-Fi.  They could implement it as somewhat of controller.  HomeKit, the Nest, sorry, the HomeKit HomePod Mini is actually in a better position because  it has both Wi-Fi and thread in it.  So that means it could act as a bridge for the thread devices.  You're going to need something with matter to cross to thread to cross from Wi-Fi to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  thread.  TDD, do you do any home automation now?  You sounds like you have Nest devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just got my light bulbs put in and I'm trying to set it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whose light bulbs are you using?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who makes your light bulbs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sylvania.  OK.  Ah, Osram.  They actually deprecated their whole app, I think.  Are your light bulbs Bluetooth?  Or are they Zigbee?  Yes.  Yes, they're Bluetooth.  So those are probably not going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, they'll continue to work as Bluetooth, but they're not going to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the heartbreak of home automation that's been this way for so long.  And I think there's a lot of people, TDD, I've been through the same thing where I bought  this stuff and it didn't integrate.  I had a Nest thermostat and then I have a Hue lights and it's just, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Your Hue lights are going to keep working.  They will work.  So Hue has said the Philips Hue lights, they also own a brand called Wiz that will not  work, but, or the existing stuff won't.  But the existing Hue lights, and this is what you should be looking for and asking your  product manufacturers.  So the Hue light bulbs use Zigbee and there's a hub, the Philips Hue hub that translates  that Zigbee to Wi-Fi.  Philips Hue is going to update that hub so it will be matter compliant, which means all  of your existing light bulbs will still continue to talk to that hub, but they will also at  that point get converted to matter data models and then they will talk to everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great news actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's great for Philips Hue people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Not so good for Sylvain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Any of your brands that have like hubs or bridges, those, you're going to look for those  manufacturers to say, hey, we're going to flash an update to our hubs that allow your  device that hangs off that hub to be matter compliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it sounds like going forward, you should look for matter compliant on the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Can you show them the logo?  Do you see the matter logo?  If you go to my website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does it have a weird font?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's three little.  It is interesting.  I see it on this speaker or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, and if you scroll down to that light bulb, you'll see it on the light bulb and scroll  down to the lock actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks, it looks like, what it looks like is, I don't know, like three nails head to  head or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was going to say, make an arrow and then round your arrow.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Three arrows.  Three of them together.  Pointing at each other, rounded.  So it's a circular firing squad, which is a perfect logo for this company.  So are you, so let me ask our chatter.  Are you, is by the way, what's your name?  I don't want to keep calling you TDD.  Tommy.  Tommy.  What's, what do you think?  Is this encouraging or discouraging?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, very encouraging.  I like to, I'm doing it, wanted to do the bathroom and the kitchen.  So when I have those calls in the middle of the night, I could say turn the bathroom light  on or light on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's nice when you go to bed to say, you know, good night or turn the lights off  or whatever.  Yes.  Yes.  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I used to, in my lights, I actually, I used Phillips Hue lights and I used a motion  sensor and this will actually get easier now with the, the matter.  If you buy the matter compliant sensor or matter compliant bulb and I would actually  schedule it.  So my lights would, during a certain time of day, my lights in the bathroom would only  turn on like to 10%.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do the same thing.  Yeah.  It's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They don't blind you.  It was on the motion sensor.  So it would just like you walk in and they're like dim lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tommy, thank you.  I appreciate your joining the club.  It's great to have you.  Thank you very much.  Thanks, Tommy.  Great to listen to you.  We appreciate it.  I had some other requests, but I invited them up, but they didn't have anything they wanted  to say.  So that's okay.  Oh, it's always fun though.  If you want to do this, we could do more.  Just keep, I'll keep an eye out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if I see, I like, I like this, I like, you know, question mode, the, of course makes  a career of it on radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's really helpful because I, you know, we want to, I know that people have questions  about this.  Are you bullish overall on this Stacey?  Is this good news for IOT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am bullish.  I think it'll be good for a couple reasons.  I think it's going to be good for people who want to get into this and have been hanging  back because they're like, I don't know if I should, will this work with this?  Will that work with that kind of thing?  Yeah.  That solves that dilemma for people going forward.  I also think it's good because it makes it, you have to add something special to provide  value.  So it's going to commodify a lot of stuff.  It will commodify like who cares about like generic HVAC or generic locks, unless you're  doing something special because you no longer have to, you're no longer buying for like  an ecosystem.  You're buying for just like, is this the best door lock?  And if it's matter compliant, it'll be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How secure, oh, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry.  Well, the final point is if you're an apartment or a renter, this is great for you because  apartment owners are going to be putting matter compliant like switches and stuff in their  apartments and HVAC.  And when you come in, you'll be able, if you want to control it using a controller you  bring in and you could bring in your own devices and basically customize your apartment.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How's security?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, do we believe the department, are cheap bastard  landlords are really going to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not the cheap bastard, this isn't for slumlords.  This is going to be for people who are trying to like get, you know, higher end.  Yes.  These companies are already doing this because it has benefits to them too.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Home builders are doing it too, which is very interesting when you're selling a new home  to say this supports, you know, matter, probably matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The landlords are going to be, because if you think about it, you can revert control  back to them if like once the tenant leaves.  Yeah.  Remember what a problem it was when Stacey moved?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, what do you do with all this stuff you have in your house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Remember?  Oh, no, no, no, for the landlords themselves though, they can say like, okay, no one's in  this apartment.  I'm turning the AC down and you can monitor that.  And you also like with smart locks, many cities, you still have to have a key, right?  And so, you know, the landlord made it a requirement, but you don't have to rekey things as often.  You can just, it's all software based.  Now security, which is the next point because it is all software based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the biggest, I think it's going to be the biggest problem with IOT.  We just learned, for instance, that there are security flaws in basically all Wi-Fi routers  ever made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're doing my podcast for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Russ published a report that found 25 vulnerabilities in a wide range of IOT devices.  I mean, you know, all you have to do is look at the news and you can see that IOT is the next, you know, kind of frontier in security.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So for Matter specifically, what they're going to be doing is there's going to be encryption from device to device, device to bridge, device to cloud.  So it is 128 AES encryption.  So it's not like over the top, but it's, it's decent.  They're also implementing, I think we talked about this before, a blockchain based security thing where it's, it's not blockchain based.  I'm sorry.  Well, it is a blockchain, but it's not Bitcoin.  It's a distributed ledger that says these are the devices in my home.  Oh, interesting.  Each device is going to have its own unique ID that is sent to the ledger and tracked there.  And then what happens is when you have software updates, that also gets sent to the ledger.  So then you can programmatically look and see, Hey, these 18 devices in my home are all up to date.  And if a new vulnerability comes out, it becomes very easy to, again, programmatically look at that list and say, Oh shoot, this one has this vulnerability.  It needs to be patched.  Now that infrastructure is in place.  What needs to happen is companies like whoever is going to be like your hub, the brains of your smart home.  So like a Google and Amazon, maybe it's your home assistant.  Those companies have to build that in.  But the infrastructure is all there for that to happen.  And I'm really excited about that.  That's going to be really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the reason I mentioned the Wi-Fi, the frag attack, Wi-Fi attacks is because it could be used to get into your network.  And then the IOT devices could be used to perpetuate it.  It really could be a nightmare for people.  So security with IOT is really important and not really very well supported at this point.  And I think also really important you addressed it is the ability to update these.  So the frag attacks, you know, many Wi-Fi manufacturers will have updated firmware.  Many won't.  Many won't be able to.  Many people won't know that their device needs to be updated.  So all of that has to be handled with IOT.  It's really critical.  Good.  Well, I'm glad to hear that this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can I answer one question from the IRC?  And then I'll be done.  Sorry.  Because I get this a lot.  People asking about the I call them the CDA guys.  So the control for the Insteon, the Savant, all of those guys, are they participating, that sort of thing?  Some of them are.  I think for them, it's a really interesting conundrum because what's going to happen is their brains and programming, they can totally take advantage of matter.  What it does for the distributors, though, it's going to make it very difficult because it becomes harder to buy more of their proprietary gear.  Right.  So if if you're control for and you're control for distributor, you might be able to sell someone a control for brain and some cameras, because those are not on matter.  But you're not going to be able to sell them on kind of the lower value stuff.  So then your expertise becomes less on selling the hardware and more on the programming and making that easy for people.  So that's just a shift to look for.  I want to take a short break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But when we come back, the Stacey on IOT show continues.  I do want to talk about other stuff, which is a big story.  Apple announced and shipped their air tags, which I think gives Apple kind of a very strong position in this Bluetooth tracker arena because they've got a billion iPhones out there.  And so whenever your air tag goes by one of those billion iPhones, it phones home and that gives you really a lot of people helping you look for your lost keys.  This was something that bothered Tile a lot.  In fact, Tile testified in front of Congress, the CEO saying, you know, Apple's anti-monopolistic and is going to put us out of business, which may still be true.  But they've made a deal with Amazon.  And I know you talked about this on your website as well.  And on the podcast, they made a deal with Amazon to in a way kind of maybe meet the iPhone network using Amazon's sidewalk.  And so we've talked about sidewalk before.  This might actually be very good for both Amazon and for a Tile.  So I want to talk about that a little bit.  I have opinions.  I thought you might.  I thought you might.  But first, I want to talk about my shirt.  Actually, I'm not wearing an untuck it today.  I forgot I wore it yesterday, though.  I love my untuck it shirts.  In fact, we've just ordered a whole bunch more.  Untuck it shirts are exactly what you need to make that transition back from slopping around at home to the office.  You want to look good.  But you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can disguise the top of the not real pants.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe you don't want to put a suit and tie back on.  Maybe you're going to take this opportunity to still.  But T-shirts no more.  No, you can't do the T-shirt.  Untuck it shirts are awesome.  Yeah, it's a problem.  They're designed to not be tucked in.  They don't have those long tails.  In fact, they're just the right.  The untucked shirt is a tough style to get right.  The untuck it is just the right length.  It meets right.  Forgive me.  But right halfway down the zipper, halfway down the fly.  And that's exactly kind of.  So you don't look like you've got this, you know, moomoo on.  But you also don't look like you're wearing a T-shirt.  It's actually really great.  And I love the untuck it shirts.  They're really, really well made.  They also have like something like 50 different sizes fits for all shapes and sizes because they have sizes up to triple XL.  But they also have different fits, relaxed, slim, tall fits.  So you're going to find a shirt that fits well, looks well.  Their wrinkle free products are incredible.  I have a bunch of the wrinkle free cotton and I've worn, you know, the shirt I wore yesterday.  Or I guess I wore it on Sunday.  No, I wore it yesterday.  I had worn several times before and still looked fresh as a daisy.  Amazing.  They have performance shirts.  I wear those to the gym and it's been hot in California the last few days.  They wick the sweat off.  You feel cool.  You feel comfortable and you look good.  Short sleeve button downs, polos made to beat the heat.  Perfect for the summertime.  And now these new linens.  They've got tees as well.  They've got handlies.  They've got polos.  I'm a button down guy.  I love the quality.  The fabric is great.  It's heavy.  They're well made.  The buttons are well sewn on.  They've got tees?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't know that.  They've got a tees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at that.  An untucked tee.  Because you know what?  Nothing looks dumber than tucking in a t-shirt.  Can I just say, please don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing makes you look older.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's one of the reasons I love untuck it.  Because my son always comments on my wardrobe and is embarrassed.  I used to go visit him at his frat and he'd just say, stay in the basement if you don't mind.  But with the untucked shirts, he says, dad, you look kind of hip.  You look kind of cool.  Thank you very much.  Very high standards.  The highest standards in the industry.  Every shirt, every aspect of the shirt is checked five times.  They want to make sure they retain the shape, the color, the strength.  And if there's anything wrong, they have outstanding customer service too.  They even have stores.  So if you want to go and try them on, their stores are now open.  85 stores nationwide.  I just mail ordered it because I was really happy.  They have the wrinkle free collection.  I really want you to check out.  And they have, and this, I don't even know.  This is some sort of textile magic.  They have wrinkle free linen, which is seems a contradiction in terms.  Linen is famous for you look rumpled and wrinkle.  But no, apparently they've found a way to do this, which is really exciting.  As soon as I found that out, I would have at least I ordered it for me.  She chose them five wrinkle resistant.  I love linen in the summer.  So this is really nice.  Oh, I see.  They put a little 10 cell in there.  That's how they do it.  That's how they do it.  And look at the plaids, the checks, the solids, really good looking.  I can't wait to get my I'll wear them for you.  As soon as I get my my beautiful linen shirts from untuck it.  Look at these.  These are great.  So here's the deal.  I want you to go to untuck it right now.  Untuck it dot com.  You NT you see K I T use the offer code to it.  You'll get 20% off.  What?  That must be a typo.  Really?  That's a great deal.  Summers around the corner.  This would be a perfect time to try out an untuck it.  In fact, are you going back to work?  Show your colors with an untuck it shirt.  That's just right for you.  Again, the offer code T W I T 20% off.  That's a great deal.  That's for your first purchase at untuck it dot com.  I'm tempted to do a limerick here.  There once was a guy from untuck it, but I better stop.  Tuck it dot com.  Use the offer code to it.  Untuck it.  Our shirts designed to be worn untucked.  But you know, they really transcended that.  They're just really well made shirts that fit beautifully.  Look great.  They don't wrinkle.  I am thrilled.  I have a fairly large untuck it wardrobe now.  Untuck it dot com offer code.  Thank you so much for their supportive this weekend.  Google.  So this was a story.  Remember when we talked about Amazon, we kind of mocked sidewalk because their initial.  I did not want you did not market.  I did not.  OK, I mocked it.  Just so you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But y'all keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was you were all excited because it was low raw.  The long range network low raw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Even before then I was excited.  We'll get to that.  So the idea is not just because it's IOT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The idea was, I mean, again, if you're competing with Apple's air tags, you've got to find  a way to replace that billion phone network.  And so the idea is every Echo device by default has sidewalk turned on a low range network.  Long range, low powered, slow network.  But it can go half a mile.  And if so, if you have enough people within that half mile to kind of propagate it, you  could in theory blanket entire community.  They started selling a little sensor that you put in your rural route mailbox.  So, you know, when the mail's in, you know, the box has been open, things like that.  They talked a little bit about lost dogs.  But tile doing a deal with them is, I think, very interesting.  Do you what do you think, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's great.  I'm going to tell you project connected.  Oh, no matter.  Formerly known as project matter.  And Amazon sidewalk were the two most exciting things that are going to happen in IOT of  all of this year.  OK.  Wow.  Yeah.  And it's only me.  I said this at the beginning of the year.  So I knew.  OK.  The reason this is so exciting.  I'm just like, ah, this news is great because it tells us two things.  One, Amazon is going to not just use Laura for sidewalk.  So you can use Laura radios and it'll work with actually a won't.  We'll get to that.  You can use and run sidewalk over Bluetooth and you can use and run sidewalk over Laura.  So that means if you have a Laura device and you do the deal with Amazon, you will be able  to have your device work on their sidewalk network and become part of their sidewalk  network.  Same thing with Bluetooth devices now.  This is huge.  So tile is just the first thing.  And then the second part of that announcement was that level a lot company is going to be  part of this.  And I think they put level in there because they wanted to emphasize the security of  sidewalk.  And this is really important for everybody because everyone's like, oh, I'm not going to  let Amazon use my echo for their sidewalk network.  But the sidewalk network and the reason why Amazon has gone with a proprietary protocol  isn't just that Amazon's a giant jerk that likes proprietary protocols.  It's that sidewalk is designed to be secure.  It's designed to so Amazon doesn't know the packet that you're sending and the information  in that packet.  It doesn't actually know the device that's transmitting it.  So all of that lets us have this really big ad hoc IOT network that you don't have to  pay a lot of money to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And really important, you know, with whether it's the iPhone or the cellular network or  any other way you might propose to do this.  They're dumb.  They're intentionally dumb.  They you know, your phone knows everything about you and you have to trust that Apple  is not going to relay that information around, you know, because your air tag is tied to  your Apple account.  In theory, if somebody saw my air tag, they would know who I am.  And so it's really important that Apple have its own security.  But sidewalks just too dumb to do that.  It's really designed to be kind of much more limited.  And that I think is a good thing in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the second part that's cool about this deal and this announcement is that Amazon  showing that it's building a legit IOT network.  And I say this because if you look and everyone's comparing it to Apple air tags, and that's  great.  But air tags, you look at the naming, you look at how Apple's done it so far.  Apple is thinking about finding stuff.  They're thinking about location tracking and asset tracking.  Right.  Amazon is thinking, let's build a data network.  So, yeah, you can send location information on that network.  You can send sensor information about like mailboxes.  And just as a point of clarification, Leo, currently the ring mailbox sensor doesn't  use sidewalk.  They have to enable that.  Oh, that's hysterical.  I know.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought that was the whole point of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is the whole point, but it's not enabled yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and this tile thing doesn't happen on June 14th either.  So is there going to be a change?  No, it's June.  Well, let me check the story, but I thought it was, I thought they said June.  I thought it was July.  Okay.  Well, you would know better.  According to CNBC, I don't know who they are, but according to them, tile will start  working with Amazon's network beginning June 14th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  June 14th.  Okay.  Hold on.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  June 14th.  Okay.  I was like, let me go to the source.  Yes.  That's what Amazon told me to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Amazon product boss, who is the aptly or maybe in aptly named Dave Limp, told CNBC  sidewalk is all about the next billion things.  Interesting number.  Yes.  That are going to get on the network.  I think we made a big deal about this and we showed people how to turn it off, but you  know, nobody turned it off.  No, that was stupid.  Well, even if, okay, even if people, our audience who are, you know, don't like this idea, turn  it off, it's going to be on 99.9% of Echo devices.  It's on by default, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's on by default.  It's not, it's okay.  So only a gen four Echoes.  I can't remember how far down the Echo shows.  It goes pretty, it goes pretty far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ScooterX just pointed, pasted in all the devices and it's all the way down to the second  generation Echo show, the Echo Spot, the dot starting with the third generation.  Okay.  So it's everything sold in the last couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And they've been planning this.  So they announced it back again.  They announced it in September, 2019.  So, and it's not thread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's their own network.  It's something, it's something they're doing.  You need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So again, and this is, this is a trend.  God, my entire show.  I'm doing my whole show here.  But this is a trend we're seeing because you look at matter that runs over different wireless protocols.  It's an application layer.  So at the software layer, right?  Not at the radio layer.  And that's because in same with sidewalk, you can use different radios and what you're pulling on top of sidewalk is another application layer to, to add security in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Has Amazon said how, how, you know, like a coverage map, have they said anything about how widespread sidewalk is?  I mean, I got to figure everybody in Petaluma has, you know, within a half, I mean, it's half a mile, right?  So all you takes is a couple of people every half mile.  I would guarantee that Petaluma isn't completely covered with this.  I don't know about Bainbridge Island.  I think when you get to a rural area, maybe not.  Oh, dude, we're right outside Seattle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, half the people here work for Amazon.  We're fine.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So pretty much this is a universal network in at least.  Yes.  It's so exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you won't have like, this means if you're building some sort of like, let's say you want to build a garden sensor, you know, you could just build something to throw out in people's gardens on the sidewalk network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just assume it would work.  Just assume it would work.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, this is what we've been waiting for.  This, because I get a freaking ton of people asking me about helium and sidewalk and Amazon and Laura.  This is this is the trend that we're seeing.  But you understand.  Ad-hoc cheap networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  White people are not thrilled that it's Amazon doing it.  I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I really do.  But Amazon really tried to address this.  They've been very public with their white papers about the protocol.  Has Steve Gibson looked at the sidewalk protocol?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He has it, but I'll ask him to.  Yeah. Yeah, he should.  I'm looking at the white paper right now.  The white paper is very interesting.  So Laura is 900 megahertz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's 900.  It's so gigahertz.  900 megahertz.  That's good, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That means it goes a good long way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It depends, I guess, on how powerful the radios are.  But there's nothing that'll block it.  Let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  It goes through all kinds of stuff.  Well, your microwave might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they're doing something Apple does with their Mac addresses, which is smart.  They're doing a they do a 15 minute rolling ID so that you can't track.  You can't say, oh, let's watch as this person walks down the street because the ID transmission  IDs change every 15 minutes.  So this is good.  I think that, yeah, I mean, they're obviously they're aware of the fact that people are  going to be skeptical of anything Amazon does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They want to make this.  You know how they sell AWS?  They want to sell an IOS sidewalk is their AWS for IOT activity.  Very interesting.  I mean, that's that's what they're building.  Yeah.  And I think it's way smarter than what Apple's done.  Apple's created a vertical.  Yeah, you have to have an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's Apple.  Everything is going to be within their ecosystem.  There's never going to be anything open from Apple.  And they're and what they will say.  Yeah, right.  Well, what they'll say is, but that's because we control it and so we can control security  and privacy.  And that's our secret sauce.  And they also say trust Amazon.  We have a story.  They say about advertising.  I know.  And we have a story about that coming up in a little bit, because I finally found somebody  who articulated what I have inarticulately tried to say about this new Apple ID for advertising  in the app tracking framework that they've put out.  But we'll talk about that in a little bit.  So you think there are enough echoes and rings out there in the world to make this blanket?  Tiles now become part of this network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they don't just receive, they also extend the network?  Well, if you have tile, the if you have tiles on the phone running on your phone that  Oh, the tile software on your phone.  Yeah, the app should also get an update.  Oh, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because Amazon told me this was intensification.  Yeah, your phone may end up being a sidewalk device.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you use it to track your tiles and your existing tiles will work with it.  Well, sorry, the more recent generations of tiles will work with this.  Your ancient tiles will not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now I want to root for tile, even though I feel like Apple's just about to put it out of business completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, does this rescue them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's it's you know, it's interesting because Apple a week before they announced  air tags opened up the Find My network and invited people like tile to participate in tile.  Interestingly, declined Belkin, Chipolo, VanMoof bicycles all joined the network.  I imagine others do.  And I thought, why would tile who's so worried about Apple's ascendancy in this not at least take advantage of this?  Now we know why they had a better partner, Amazon sidewalk.  So that explains a lot.  Thank you, Stacey.  I'm glad I you know what?  I've been saving those stories for you.  Well, they just happened this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I didn't have to save them long.  They're pretty fresh, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  So now, Jeff, let's talk some more panic because, man, I just talked a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's talk about the Colonial Pipeline.  They, by the way, they just posted a job for security manager today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, maybe we ought to have somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Jeff, you're on the East Coast.  You know, Stacey and I aren't going to be impacted by this.  But Colonial Pipeline is it's a big is it a oil pipeline?  It's refined products, 100 million gallons of gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, jet fuel and other fuels go through the pipeline system.  Colonial transports 45 percent of all the fuel consumed on the East Coast.  You know, people don't realize this, but in the East Coast, they still often use heating oil to heat homes.  And, of course, gasoline is important.  Jet fuel is important.  All of this comes through the pipeline.  And Colonial was brought to its knees over the weekend by a ransomware attack and shut down.  And there's a considerable concern about how that's going to impact fuel costs and all sorts of things.  You know, fortunately, it didn't happen in the winter.  We talked on Tuesday with Steve Gibson about the ransomware gang that did this.  Darkside is something we call now Ransomware as a Service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I also like that they're ethical ransomware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have an ethics statement on their website.  Geez.  You know, they have a website.  They won't attack schools, hospitals or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they feel bad about this hack, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They feel bad about it, which doesn't mean they're not asking, you know, they're not saying, well, here's the code.  I'm sorry.  In fact, Colonial says they're not going to pay.  It's unknown how...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Colonial also says they've restarted their operations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've been able to restart.  OK, that's good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So can I make just a really quick point here?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They didn't...  The hack did not target the pipeline operations.  It targeted the IT operations.  And Colonial shut down the pipeline because they were like, oh, shoot, we don't know how deep this problem goes.  We're transmitting a natural gas that's highly explosive.  We got to be better safe than sorry.  I just want to clarify that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, go.  And then the problem here is...  Colonial's got a problem.  That's clear.  But the problem that affects people is media.  How so?  Because they created panic buying.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  And there was no need for...  You watched the picture.  People have eight jugs of gas in the back and lines of people and all that.  So that now, according to the Washington Post, 28 percent of North Carolina's fuel stations, otherwise known as gas stations in my day, but I guess that means I'm an old man, petrol stations,  are empty.  Seventeen percent of stations in Georgia and Virginia were dry Wednesday, according to Gas Buddy.  That's caused by media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they did shut down the pipeline.  It's not that they didn't shut down the pipeline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did, but it was so briefly.  So briefly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they shut it down for a couple of days.  But the government, the federal government actually got involved and told they changed the laws to allow fuel trucks to travel over the highway.  At night and for more hours.  And they did that because they recognized there could be a problem.  And I would say, Jeff, as a member of the media, that's the kind of story you want to report.  You want to know that there's way to respond.  Okay.  So actually, my child, I covered the 1970 oil embargo or 1974 oil embargo, 73 gas crisis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The gas crisis.  I was an intern on Chicago Today, the paper that had no tomorrow.  And I was the suddenly I became the energy correspondent.  Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're young.  You must know about gas.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I did all kinds of great features.  I became friends with Platts Oilgram, all kinds of stuff.  I was part of the problem then.  Because you spread the news.  There was more reason to then.  But one thing I learned is that the length of time for if there's an interruption in the supply chain in gasoline, it takes a long time for that pig to get down the pipe for the problem.  It's a very long lead type thing.  So there was no actual shortage anywhere.  There was no issue.  Setting the trucks is a good idea.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a little different than this from from because you were talking about the gas crisis was at the very beginning of the of the oil crisis.  Of the of the pipeline.  Even so, with crude oil.  Yeah.  But this pipeline was bringing refined but it's bringing refined fuel to the Northeast.  I know.  But it still takes time.  It's the end of the line.  To get to the depot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To get on the truck.  To get out.  There's plenty of supply and product in the gas stations unless you're Costco where they sell out all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nevertheless, there's legitimate concern that ransomware gangs that are attacking infrastructure and the very legitimate concern that our infrastructure is fragile.  That the Colonial Pipeline is now looking for a security person is evident.  Either it's possible that they fired the old security manager and they now need a new one.  But you know, it's just it's a little humorous.  The good news is, if there is good news, that and here's the ad.  This is from Krebs on security for Dark Side.  They they were very clear.  We're not political.  We didn't attack it.  We didn't even know it was infrastructure.  We just go where the money is.  This isn't Russia coming after our infrastructure.  They may be Russian.  There's a lot of evidence that they are in fact Russian, but they are not the government of Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, well, but what isn't the government in Russia?  Yeah.  Is the other way.  I think Biden is trying to soft pedal up to but but we shall see.  Yeah.  Gas is the new toilet paper.  You know, it's it's it's it's so we're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nevertheless, OK, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's one side of the story, which is that the media can exacerbate the panic.  There was no reason to panic.  But there's a problem.  There is definitely a problem that your infrastructure, our infrastructure is highly vulnerable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think Stacey's point is really important that that it wasn't the the working with the IT department.  Yeah, that was it was the IT department.  So because that makes kind of more sense to me.  What I don't understand now is that if you're in security in any company anywhere, what should you be doing to protect against?  A ransomware attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have answers.  Oh, good.  Let's hear from Stacey Higginbotham.  God, the show.  You're killing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there is. OK, so there is a new ransomware.  Oh, you're loving it.  There is a federal ransomware task force.  We've been talking about this on the security now.  There are. It's got to be a multipronged defense.  You can't. There's no one thing a company can do to fix this.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A lot of things companies are realizing all of a sudden, especially as ransomware has been increasing in the last, I would say, three to five years, is there are a lot of false positives or sorry.  There are a lot of hits on your systems, usually beforehand.  And if you go back to your log files, you'll see that people were trying to infiltrate.  But historically, those have been ignored.  So first up is more robust detection and action and actually taking the action when you see something, which that's easy.  The other challenge that's going to be way harder to solve is what companies are in the midst of doing is digital transformation, which is tying their I.T.  operations to their O.T.  And O.T. is operational technology so that the equipment and gear that's running your pipeline and or your refining or any sort of manufacturing all of the physical computing.  And I don't want to get into too much there, but those are coming together.  So you have to think about ways to both segment that reasonably and also have the infrastructure in place to detect when things go wrong.  And that's why you see Microsoft buying all of these O.T. security firms.  You see a lot of partnerships between like Nozomi and Cisco.  So you're seeing a lot of stuff happen on this.  And it's going to take kind of a mental shift for the I.T. guys and the O.T. guys to talk to each other and respect each other.  Because like with Colonial, one of the things that maybe is underappreciated is that they didn't actually know if their I.T. stuff would affect their O.T. stuff.  So they need to have that infrastructure in place.  Two is when you take something physical like that down, it takes a long time to get it back up.  It's not like restarting a server like with ransomware.  You pay it, you know, you get your fresh, you get your data back, you restart, you're good with something that's tied to physical infrastructure.  It can take days to restart like an oil plant.  They have huge processes in place for this stuff.  And so it's a much more laborious process and much less forgiving of errors.  And I.T. needs to respect to deal with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, so just in terms of in terms of dumber questions, my specialty.  OK, how does backup and redundancy effects this?  Can you put yourself in a position where they took down system A and find let them have it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got system B and I'm going to interject because this is actually a fairly high end conversation and none of us are security gurus.  So I will tell you what I've learned from security gurus.  That's what I want to hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. But you're going to talk about the Purdue model of security?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but I but the issue is, yes, it might be time consuming to get a pipeline back online.  And yes, you can always say, oh, if they only had good backups, they wouldn't have to worry about this.  But it's a much more complex problem.  And I.T. can take weeks to get back online because not only is it getting the data back, but you have to make you have to make sure your whole you have to get all the systems back up and running.  And all of them are the integrity and ensure the integrity of all the systems.  So, for instance, when North's Kyra was taken down, it was almost a month before they were back online.  It wasn't merely an operations issue. It was an I.T. issue as well.  So it's not, you know, it seems easy to say, well, all you need is a good backup that's preserved.  And I know we have an advertiser, for instance, who says that.  But it is it really in defense of I.T. people.  It is a very complicated thing to do.  And I will also say security is a very complicated thing to do.  We did it. I would recommend it to anybody who wants to know more.  We did a red team versus blue team special in I think it was last October.  And it's a great specials on our Twitter specials feed, which we had really, you know, we had Father Robert and Brian Chi as attackers.  And we have Bruce Schneier, who's legendary and the CTO from Log Me In as defenders.  And we really talked about how difficult it is.  And at one point, Schneier, who's absolute security guru, said it's almost impossible to defend.  You know, security is a matter of layers. You have to try to do a lot of things.  I'm sure infrastructure companies are sitting up now and taking notice as they ought to be.  And it's certainly the case that they haven't done a very good job in the past.  But it isn't as simple as flipping a switch or spending more money.  It's a very complicated, difficult thing to do, especially with determined attackers.  And there's so much money in this.  It's estimated that Dark Side has made what was it?  Something like 15 billion dollars or something like that.  It's some huge amount of money.  These things are incredibly lucrative.  And what does that mean?  Well, it means there is going to be a lot of people who want to do it.  And the problem with things like Dark Side is it's ransomware as a service.  You don't have to have any skills at all.  You just have to know how to get into it, you know?  And all you have to do is go to Dark Side.  And they actually advertise for affiliates saying,  when you want to run our ransomware, you got somebody you want to attack,  here's the software you can do it.  So it's become easier and easier for even script kiddies to do this kind of thing.  And so, yeah, you're absolutely right, Stacey,  that you can no longer ignore the attacks that are happening all the time.  But it's one thing to say, you know, hey, you're getting attacked.  It's another thing to know how to defend against it.  And there's so many venues for attack and stuff.  It's very, very, very difficult, especially because these are targeted attacks.  That's the other thing to understand is that we often talk about malware  and attacks on IoT and stuff.  But in almost every case, those are mass attacks.  These are targeted attacks.  They're going after Colonial Pipeline.  That's a lot harder to defend against.  You've got employees who might open emails that they think are from the boss.  It's really hard.  It's extremely challenging.  We had in here last year before COVID,  the guy who he works for the NSA,  I guess it was a Pentagon securing military networks,  he works out of West Point.  I said, that must be a challenging job.  He said, you have no idea.  And I can't tell you.  And I can't tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One of the things the OT folks do actually really well  is they teach their employees better about security and their vulnerabilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember that water company where the guy was sitting there  and somebody logged in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not talking about the water company.  I'm talking about the refineries.  But they literally have campaigns where they will tell people  not to pick up USB sticks and plug it into a light.  They have to.  Well, they have to, but we don't actually have that.  Think about when you're a new employee.  You don't get details on phishing scams and things to look at necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You start to and a lot of companies are doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now you do.  They offer training in this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody understands the employees is a vulnerable spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're the weakest link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're the weakest link.  It sounds like it's an easy thing to fix.  I think it's a hard thing to fix.  And protecting infrastructure is really hard.  But in a way, this is good.  Because all the attention that this is generating, I would hope,  is making people who run power plants and pipelines  and water facilities think a little harder about what they're doing  to protect themselves.  And that's why this is an industry task force.  But that's why this industry task force I think is pretty important as well.  Because they're also saying they're trying to get, for instance,  the federal government to treat this as a very serious national security issue  and things like that.  And all of that will help.  They're trying to disrupt ransomware payments.  In other words, this is a multifaceted defense that has to be implemented.  We have to take it very, very seriously.  And clearly, we're vulnerable right now.  But we've known that.  There have been books and articles for the last six years talking about how our...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but it doesn't matter to people until it hurts them where they live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why in a way this is a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's also...  So we just blame the media.  But I will also say it's a terrible story for the media to cover.  And again, there's no dead babies.  Until there's the dead babies, it's hard to do.  So now that's why we're getting so much coverage because we have so many people who are...  It's intelligible to normal people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Ransomware Task Force report, which we covered also on Security Now,  I think last week or the week before, says some of the recommendations are things like encouraging voluntary information sharing on ransomware attacks.  Right now companies generally cover it up.  They don't want to say it's embarrassing.  Public awareness campaigns on ransomware threats, exerting pressures on countries that operate as safe havens for ransomware operators,  incentivizing the adoption of security best practices through tax breaks.  There's a lot of things.  Limit legal liability for ISPs.  This is a really interesting one.  That act in good faith trying to help clients secure their systems.  So ISPs can block traffic on various ports.  There's lots of things they can do to mitigate a little bit.  Create a federal cyber response and recovery fund to help state and local governments or critical infrastructure companies respond to ransomware attacks.  One of the things that's happened, we saw last summer, we saw a huge number of attacks on city governments.  Remember that?  Texas, a couple of three city governments brought down because they have insurance.  They have ransomware insurance.  And in many cases, a number of cases, the ransom was paid by the insurance companies,  which just encourages more ransomware attacks and frankly encourages a little bit of laxness on the victims.  Well, we got insurance for that.  Anyway, there's some really good recommendations in this task force.  I hope that it's more than just lip service that they do some things about it.  Part of this is, you know, part of this is...  Do some things.  Do some things.  Well, part, there's a lot of things to do.  Do some of those.  Part of it is that cryptocurrency makes, you know, all of this goes through cryptocurrency.  In the early days of ransomware, they asked you to go down to 7-Eleven and buy some money orders.  They've gotten a lot better now thanks to cryptocurrency.  Well, progress.  Progress.  Well, but that makes it easier for people to do this, right?  And also, you know, so, you know, cryptocurrency exchanges could be required to, you know,  be a little bit more careful about who they do business with and so forth.  Anyway, yeah, I'm glad to know that the pipeline is back online.  It's going to be okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll be fine.  It's going to be fine.  It'll be the next crisis.  Until the next ransomware attack.  Yeah, really?  I'm having a senior moment.  Where was the nuclear meltdown in Russia?  Chernobyl.  Chernobyl?  Chernobyl.  Oh, yeah, there's some action there.  You know, it's just that they don't know 2020 is over.  There have been some reactions in part of the bad part of Chernobyl.  Don't know if they can get at it.  Don't know how bad it's going to be.  You know, yes, that's the next crisis.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you know, we've got nuclear waste leaking in the middle of Washington state.  So, you know, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's from Science Alert.  Chernobyl's molten guts are warming up and scientists don't know why.  That's putting it in language that people can understand.  And get scared about.  And get scared about.  It could be, they say, whoever wrote this, Mike McCray, two thumbs up.  Researchers at the Institute for Safety Problems of Nuclear Power Plants in Kyiv, Ukraine,  are yet to determine whether the noted rise in neutrons, noted rise in neutrons,  is a world's pending disaster or is more of a storm in a nuclear teacup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of your students, Jeff?  It could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's merely a storm in a nuclear teacup.  Let's see.  What more can we talk about?  Oh, lots more.  We got apples.  I got apples.  I got Googles.  Let me do one more Google story.  Remember with all the, we got fonts.  Remember with all the fuss about Google AI and the firings from the ethics team, Google has plans to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fuss is probably a light word.  I would say scandal.  Scandal.  I would say scandal fits, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The CEO is going to boost the operating budget of the AI ethics research staff and they're going to hire more people.  But meanwhile, one of the folks working on AI at Google, one of the big guys has moved over to Apple because of...  He had actually quit at Google.  He was an AI scientist, a distinguished Google scientist, Sammy Benjio.  He quit after the AI scandal and he will now go to Apple and lead a new AI research under another former Googler,  John Giandrea.  He was at Google eight years when he joined Apple in 2018.  So there is a consequence to more than just bad press to not handling these things well.  You're going to lose some of your best people.  He was, Benjio was one of the early leaders of the Google brain research team and an expert in deep learning.  Probably that generative adversarial network you're so fond of, Stacey.  Love your GANs.  I know you do.  I do love my GANs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You love your GANs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see.  What else is going on?  Hundred million dollar fine, a fund, not fine, fund.  It's good.  It's good to be a creator.  It's good to be a creator.  So, you know, there's TikTok, right?  So Google saying, what are we going to do?  We're going to beat TikTok.  So they created something called shorts, which are not, in fact, attractive pants that show your knees, but little short videos on Google.  And Google is going to create a one hundred million dollar fund for shorts makers.  Shorts are doing all right.  Six point five billion daily views, according to Sundar Pichai.  The shorts fund, they call it, is the first step in our journey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wouldn't have thought that was funny until you put the other image in my head.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they could have called them squirts, but no, the shorts fund is just the first step in our journey to build a long term monetization model for shorts on YouTube.  They're not going to tell you how to win it.  They're just going to award it.  If you create shorts that delight the YouTube community, you may you accompany spokesperson decide declined to share details about how much creators can earn or the metrics who will determine who gets paid and define delight.  Yeah, find a light.  They'll just you don't even have to be in the partner program.  They're just going to drop money from heaven.  So make those shorts, kids or sports one three to the line one thirty two.  Let's jump down to the very bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It led me to my rule that all social platforms do what all social platforms do.  Yes.  Now all of them are creator economy platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, look how look how well that's done for YouTube.  Right.  Yeah.  Instagram doing great.  Tick tock.  I have a story on YouTube.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff, you're going to love this one.  This was OK, Leo.  It's oh, it's line sixty nine.  I'm not going to grin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you a creator?  By the way, you're a creator.  I'm a creator.  We're all creators.  So it's a good children are creators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Finally, media recognize that they thought they were the only creators.  We're all creators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know who else is a creator?  Beethoven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Segway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a lead into your story, Stacey.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was like, what is happening here?  So this story is this is both a people suck and a content moderation is hard story and  also that YouTube needs better practices story.  So this is from Cory Doctorow.  He let me get the name of the lady right.  Sorry.  Let me let me open this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Marina Marina, a piano teacher who publishes free lessons.  I love Cory and I love his blog Pluralistic.net.  He she creates free piano lessons on her piano keys YouTube channel.  Celebrated her fifth anniversary.  Cory writes by announcing she was quitting YouTube because her meager wages were being  stolen by fraudsters.  She posted a video with a little bit of Moonlight Sonata, which you might remember.  Beethoven published.  No, actually, Beethoven did not publish this in 1801.  Beethoven wrote it in, I don't know what 1762, but it was published in 1801.  It's in public domain.  In other words, the copyright belongs to Marina.  She performed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nevertheless, you play or something you're going to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's for Elise.  That's for Elise, not the Moonlights.  I can't hum the Moonlight Sonata.  I'm sorry.  But it triggered and I might have just triggered it to YouTube's automated right now, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  then we're going to get taken down.  The Moonlight Sonata is very slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to.  It triggered YouTube's automated copyright filter.  I'm amazed you recognize for Elise, though, and you named that tune Four Notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In the 90s, I had a phone that played it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A corporate entity identified only by an alphabet soup of initialisms and cryptic LLC names had  claimed Moonlight Sonata as their own, calling it Wicca Moonlight.  The content ID flag Marina's track is an unauthorized performance of Wicca Moonlight.  She appealed the judgment.  The problem is you appeal.  We've had this happen to us.  Then they send a message to the copyright owners saying, do you agree that no infringement  took place?  But of course they said no, they infringed it.  So she can now let this shadowy company monetize her video, which steals all of the revenue  from her.  She can take her video down.  We are faced with this, by the way, frequently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I had no idea this was happening.  This is so infuriating.  It happens all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is exactly the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought the problem was just that it took your stuff down and you couldn't make money.  I didn't realize there was a group of organizations who...  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you want to fight this, and we've done this, you can fight it.  You have to provide them with your full name and address.  Then they go and you go back and forth.  Ultimately it'll end in court, but even prior to that.  I don't even want to go into it.  We've had people make the funniest things ever in their claims against us.  We had pictures of the NASA launch taken down by National Geographic who claimed, oh no,  we own the NASA video.  Of course, that was an error, they said.  Anyway, this is Content ID.  Cory hates Content ID.  I hate Content ID.  It just doesn't work very well.  Here is, and I love this, Cory published this from the EFF, navigating YouTube's Content  ID, a little flow chart to help you understand why.  Blame Hollywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Blame Hollywood, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, blame Hollywood, but also blame...  I blame the tech companies who thought we could solve this algorithmically.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The algorithm is the problem.  It's easily gamed.  The scale.  Yeah.  Bad guys.  Yeah.  I guess if you create something like YouTube where you get 100 million hours of content  every day, how else are you going to do it?  I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, if you're going to be a platform, one of the costs of being a platform is recognizing  that people are going to game it and you have to respond in a way that benefits the core  users.  Google does it already for search.  They're like, oh shoot, too many people are using weird SEO optimizations.  Now we're going to change things.  Yeah.  But what they're not doing is they'll do it for their core businesses, but then they  put out these creator platforms and they're not doing it for those businesses.  That's just not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a big chilling effect on everything we do.  I try to tell our staff, don't worry about it, don't worry about it, but it really does  create a chilling effect.  We have to constantly say, oh, we better not do that because they'll take us down.  Corey also points out that it's really an uneven process.  For instance, an Instagram takedown takes a few seconds to file, but 28 months to appeal.  And we've had that where they'll take down a video and maybe we can get it back in two  weeks, but by then nobody's going to watch the two week old news show.  So it's really a problem.  There's a Warner Chappelle, you know, Warner Music, demonetizes videos that include the  numbers 36 and 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why?  They should have bad effects for doing bad things.  And they should be penalized for overzealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's a Twitch streamer, Anne Munition, good name.  Her videos were demonetized over the use of the numbers 36 and 50.  To protect copyright holders, you can copyright the number, apparently.  The media company Fullscreen was simply, the claim was simply over the number 36.  And you can appeal and maybe she's probably back.  Fullscreen is a social content company for talent and brands.  They're owned by Otter Media, a subsidiary of Warner Media.  They claim the number 36.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't understand how you can copyright a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they also copyrighted 50.  And while the claims are active before the appeal is accepted, they take all monetization.  So, and you can also lose your account.  I mean, the long shot is you can get a strike and lose your account completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When they're knocked down, they should have to give back 10 times monetization.  There should be some sort of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, like treble damages for being bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They call it slap in the lawsuit world.  Exactly.  There should be some sort of slap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These are also the customers of the big companies and they are the ones who have the lobbyists  and the lawyers.  And so they would, you know, they'd go run into Capitol Hill and we'd have a sopa pipa  fight again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it was pretty easy.  Sopa pipa.  We don't want to go with sopa pipa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't want a sopa pipa again, man.  No.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, we fight them.  But, you know, the risk to us is that we would get a strike and too many strikes, we would  lose our channels.  And that would be a big deal.  I hate, I freaking hate YouTube.  I understand the value of it.  It's very impressive that anybody can create video, but it is also, it's kind of a mess.  And I don't like it affecting what we do as our content.  I mean, I can't even humph a lease without fearing that they're going to take it down.  Now I got to worry about 36 and Jeff, no numbers with 36 or 50.  I'm just telling you.  Okay.  All right.  Got it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Don't want to take that chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no line numbers.  Thirty six or fifty.  This, this, this is an article I thought crystallized my inarticulate problem with what Apple is  doing.  Everybody loves it.  Ninety six percent of people with iOS 14.5 have said, don't track me bro.  When they're offered that pop up that says, do you want to allow this app to track you?  The 96 percent say, absolutely not.  Of course.  But this article, and I think it was really well written from Eric Benjamin Sufert, Apple  robbed the mob's bank.  You know, you don't ever want to rob the mob's bank, right?  Because the mob will pay back, you know, the bank, maybe not, but the mob.  So what he's pointing out, and I think this is really an excellent point, is that what  Google has done by saying no third party cookies anymore, what Apple's doing by saying no tracking  is merely giving first parties the people who can collect information directly and sell  it like Google and Facebook and oh, incidentally, Apple as well.  Priority over everybody else.  So he wrote a blog post he called the Privacy Mirage.  Apple is using a strategy by artificially defining the word privacy as the distinction  between first and third party data usage.  But by doing so, they entrench their market position.  Google owns Search, right?  Google owns Chrome.  Apple owns the App Store.  They all have first party Facebook owns everything.  They all have first party data, which they can use to sell ads against.  First party data is so valuable that by saying, you know, you can't use third party data,  they're just making their data more valuable.  They're not protecting your privacy in any way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And look at the Ben Evans thread right below where Apple's playing all kinds of games.  We're not tracking you, but let us now spend three pages telling you how we're tracking you.  We just don't call it tracking.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it really comes down to that distinction between third party and first party.  Apple does, of course, but it's still tracking.  Track you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, none of which, by the way, is surveillance, which is an overused term that drives me up the wall almost as much as I nearly start going saying the MP word when that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And partly, I think there's some confusion like, oh, Facebook is giving information about you to other people or Google is doing that.  In fact, if they do, they do it by accident.  They desperately want to control that.  That's the secret sauce.  That's what they that's the data.  The knowledge they have of you is what is so valuable to them.  They don't want to give that to anybody.  They merely want to charge an advertiser to buy an ad to target you.  But they don't tell the advertiser who you are.  Well, they do end up.  Well, they leak it, unfortunately, as we learned.  They can, unfortunately, leak it.  But that's not intentional.  That's the last thing they really want to do.  They don't want anybody else to know this stuff because that's what they're selling.  Yeah, Ben makes a really good tweet.  Storm.  Thread.  Thread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's been gone so long.  What's the difference between a thread and a storm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, a thread, I think anything under five tweets is a thread.  Anything above 10 tweets is a storm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought it had to do with the emotions you convey.  Yeah, it's attitude, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like, I have really long threads.  How many?  They're pretty passionless.  So what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You write and then you get to 280 characters.  So you say next tweet and the next tweet and next tweet and next tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I don't know when you were last on Twitter, but now you can just add to them so you don't have to like.  Oh, they make it easy for you to do that.  They thread them for you.  So dopey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So dopey.  Write a blog post.  Just like podcasts aren't dopey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, at least it's all in one place.  You don't have to.  You don't have to.  We don't talk for half a paragraph and then say see next tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you don't say see next tweet.  It just goes to it.  It's a thought that expands.  Yeah.  And you should never write a blog post that's less than 300 words because Google doesn't like rank it right.  So if you know that you're going to go fewer than 300 words on something, then or you don't feel like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two tweets and that's hence my distinction between a thread and a stone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, 300 words could be like it depends on your words, man.  It could be 10 tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, why would you break it up artificially or you do?  You're not artificially.  You're just writing sentences.  So who breaks it up?  You know what?  You're Twitter.  Who decides it's another tweet now?  The writer does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The writer does.  I just said the thing you just read from Cory Doctorow, that started out as a tweet.  That's why those little paragraphs, those are tweets right there.  That's a thread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A blight on our modern discourse.  Oh, poor.  It is.  Twitter is not designed to write long blog posts.  It's designed for short things, bits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but no, the advantage is then unlike like essays, as the New York Times not calls them,  you can link.  I can have a progression of thought and someone can go to the fifth one and say, I want to argue with that point of yours.  And they can respond wherever they want to.  It is more conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then you can write the blog post based on the thread.  Yes, I've done all the time.  You're basically, it's like conversing about something with people.  And then you're like, all right, now I'm ready to actually put this into formal thought and write it out.  It's actually respectful of the process of writing, I think, and actually thinking as opposed to like blithering on a blog post and then being like, bloop.  I blither on Twitter.  I write on my blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know who really gets this right?  Yes.  Donald Trump.  Me.  Wrong.  He doesn't write.  DonaldJTrump.com.  Look at this.  Every blog post tweet length.  It's well, that one's two tweets.  Nice and short.  Sweet to the point.  I knew you were going to say that.

Transcript:  Stop it.  He's tweeting in a blog.  You're blogging in a tweet.  Never the twain shall meet.  I'm still tweeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My blogs are supposed to be more thoughtful.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love Twitter more every day.  I think Twitter is...  Every day you love Twitter more.  I love Twitter more.  I have my COVID list.  I have my book history walks list.  I did two hour talk today, followed a two hour talk today about book history and the history of the manufacturing of ink.  I mean, I couldn't have found that without Twitter.  I was in heaven.  Guy named Glenn Fleischman.  I follow on Twitter.  I see him in the comments.  He's there too asking questions.  I follow Glenn as well.  Glenn's great.  He lives in Seattle.  I find friends in Seattle.  In Seattle.  Exactly.  I, I, I, Glenn, watch the show.  Does he watch the show?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I find friends.  I find all kinds of interesting things.  I find books that I get.  I love Twitter.  I love Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I love on Twitter?  The Chinese army of fake tweeters that amplify...  Oh yes.  Let's shut it down.  ...amplify tweets from Chinese Communist Party leaders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say, what was the last time you saw a Chinese tweet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if they're in Chinese.  That's actually a good question.  Are they in Chinese or are they in English?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  I don't see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't care.  They're in English.  I see, I see them occasionally.  I see them mostly as retweets though from my journalist friends who are writing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they really from your journalist friends or are they perhaps from that army of Chinese  bots?  Millions of them, in fact.  A seven month investigation by the Associated Press and the Oxford Internet Institute from  Oxford University find that China's rise on Twitter has been powered by an army of fake  accounts that have retweeted Chinese diplomats and state media tens of thousands of times,  covertly amplifying propaganda that can reach hundreds of millions of people.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry.  We knew this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We knew it, but isn't that bad for Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We had the Russian bots.  Isn't Fox News bad for news?  I figure of my 555,000 Twitter followers, at least half of them are bots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it doesn't matter if the bots are following you.  It's who do you follow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't like bots following me.  I don't know about you.  No.  You're right.  It's who you follow, isn't it?  It's who you follow that makes Twitter so very valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love my followers.  Well, I don't know if I love all my followers.  Most of my followers are engaging, fabulous people who have good—

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel the same way about our Discord.  And I think that actually, in all seriousness, because I'm just being silly, but in all  seriousness, I think Discord is the next big thing in social networks because it's  what Facebook wanted to be, which is a group, it's a fairly tightly knit group of people,  whether it's family or friends or whatever, talking about stuff you're interested in  without Chinese bots or advertisements for political campaigns or anything.  Or the complications of Reddit's rules.  It's just simpler.  They'll come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, they'll come when it gets big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the Discord, Phoenix Warp says, I am propping up my Twitter is the Antichrist thesis.  They're not the Antichrist.  That's a lot.  You want an ad break?  You got an ad break.  Go ahead, Stacey.  Have some waffles.  I know what you're up to.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't know.  Getting cookies.  It's waffle time.  Not sharing them with the rest of the podcast.  You want to go get some cacio e pepe?  Go ahead.  I'm getting short on my water.  Go get some water.  You got a minute here because I want to tell everybody who's listening to this fine show  about Udacity.  The IRC people don't like me saying nice things about Discord.  They said Discord is just a colored up IRC.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Tart it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tart it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the way they say it.  Do I have colors?  Wait until you see the animated GIFs.  Our show today brought to you by Udacity.  I think Udacity is such a great thing.  Started by a Google engineer, Sebastian Thrun.  He saw a real opportunity because he's working at Google.  He's seeing that there's a real need for people with a certain skill set.  But these people coming to Google aren't learning those skills in school.  He knows that big companies like Microsoft and Amazon, Google, IBM need employees with  the right kinds of training, but they're just not getting it.  He started Udacity and very early on their nanodegree program.  We talked about it on this show.  In fact, I joined Udacity back in 2012 when that happened.  The idea is Udacity is the world's best way, the most efficient, the fastest way to master  the skills top employers are looking for.  It's all online.  You can do it part time.  You could do it on your own schedule.  It's designed to bridge the gap between what you might have learned in school and what  your career goals are.  For as little as five to 10 hours a week, for as long as just a few months, you can  learn a suite of employable skills.  Get that nanodegree, which tells your employers, this person knows his or her stuff.  And partly this is because Udacity partners with the biggest and the best in the industry,  Microsoft and Google and IBM and AWS.  You're going to learn the skills that are in demand in today's tough job market.  Of course, there's the videos.  It starts with that on demand videos.  Look at this blockchain developer.  That's in the School of Programming and Development.  Would you like to learn that?  So you watch the videos.  But I think one of the best parts about this, and I know it's one of the things companies  really appreciate, there's their C++ class in the School of Autonomous Systems.  How about that?  Is that you're going to not only watch the videos, but you're going to have to complete  a series of projects.  Now you're going to get a lot of support.  Projects are reviewed by qualified professionals.  You're going to have real human help, personalized code reviews, access to mentors 24-7.  So you're not on your own.  But you've got to get hands on.  You've got to demonstrate the ability to do this.  And that's really important.  There's also great free courses, support courses designed to help you get a job.  You can build a portfolio on GitHub or LinkedIn to show prospective employers.  You can learn to network.  You can get noticed.  You can land the job you want.  So what are the most sought after Udacity Nanodegrees for consumers and business clients alike?  Well, some of the top 10 include data engineering, data analyst.  We're seeing some right here.  Programming for data science with Python.  What a great class.  Product manager, C++, digital marketing.  Here's one for you, Stacey.  Deep learning in artificial intelligence.  Learn about deep learning, neural networks, use Jupyter Notebooks.  GANs, baby, GANs.  GANs.  You want to learn about that?  Oh, we should throw the Udacity course catalog at a GAN and see what comes up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I bet.  I bet somebody's done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe as a project.  Who knows?  14 million people have taken courses at Udacity in over 240 countries.  I think that's something to be really proud of because there's a lot of places you can't  get these skills, but you can online.  It's so exciting.  Through industry leading programs designed and recognized by top companies worldwide  in AI, cloud computing, data science, autonomous systems, programming.  I think it's just great.  Flexible payment options.  You can learn at your own pace on your own schedule because, of course, a lot of Udacity  students have day jobs, maybe jobs that don't completely fulfill them.  They want to get the skills to get an even better job.  Like Francisco Gutierrez.  He couldn't afford a four-year degree, but he participated in the Grow with Google  Udacity Challenge.  He got a full scholarship for the mobile web specialist nanodegree.  And the guy had some real abilities, some real skills.  He went through the program, got offered an internship at Google, and he got a full  scholarship.  He got offered an internship at Microsoft.  He's now working full time at Microsoft as a software engineer, all because of Udacity.  That's exactly what I'm talking about.  Start at the beginning, intro to programming.  That's a great course.  I've taken their Python courses.  I think they have great stuff.  Technology is disrupting enterprises across every industry.  So if you have a team, I want you to know about Udacity for Enterprise, which can upskill  your workforce.  It's a great thing to offer as an employer.  Be sure to check out the website for that today.  So bottom line, get the in-demand tech skills you need to advance your career, to get that  first job, to get a great job.  Udacity, go to udacity.com slash twit, U-D-A-C-I-T-Y, udacity.com slash twit.  You can get 30 days free access.  Pick a course.  It's worth $399.  It's a great way to get an introduction to Udacity and get a sense of how great these  courses are, how well designed they are.  Don't miss out.  You've got to do this before May 31st, 2021, so you only have about a week left.  Go to udacity.com slash twit, U-D-A-C-I-T-Y, dot com slash twit.  I think Udacity is a great, great idea.  And I think Stacey has had her waffles.  So.  It's not like she was cooking them.  Her pot's banging.  You need a thermomix.  Did I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I muted.  Did I not mute?  Oh, I heard somebody banging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it was, maybe it was me.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did not get waffles.  They take too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh.  What did you get?  I did get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just, I wanted water.  Oh, water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't.  I haven't.  Oh, how boring of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know.  It's busy water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this the.  I eat vicariously through you.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry.  I know.  Is this the font story you were talking about, corporate Memphis?  Why does every advertising.  I love this story.  This is from Josh, Gabbard, Doyan and Wired, but we'll get to the font story.  It actually comes from a website called Corporate Memphis, Claire Evans, a site where she collects  examples.  You've all, we've all seen that there's all these ads now with the bendy people and, you  know, the, the weirdly distorted people playing with, and it's all very flat.  It's, she calls it Corporate Memphis and you can, you can blame, I guess, the rise of Adobe  Illustrator because it's very easy to create these.  There's a lot of Jack Hurley, a leads based illustrator says, corporate Memphis.  It really boils my piss, to be honest.  You said I was familiar with the style from Facebook's login page, but I started to see  the illustrations with their sensible, slightly strange characters while walking around his  neighborhood as well.  I live in a student area and there are some real scumbag letting agencies and suddenly  they all got this marketing with the bendy arm people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Show me the bendy arm people.  Here's some examples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hinge designed to be deleted, the bendy arm people.  You've seen this everywhere.  You can't miss it.  Corporate Memphis.  Here's another one.  You see this all the time.  See, she's wearing sensible sneakers.  She's got bendy arms, no face, no features whatsoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.  I got you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm hmm.  Mm hmm.  Corporate Memphis allows these companies to offer the illusion of a world without hierarchies  where users are afforded the same access and privileges as those who control the platforms,  a playful world that values creativity.  But of course, illustrations done in the corporate Memphis style are rarely, if ever, credited  to the artist who produced them.  So don't ask for credit.  That's all.  Anyway, I just had to mention that.  So what's the font story you were?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It happens to be a story by Glenn Fleischman.  The Glenn Fleischman?  Just mentioned moments ago.  I've heard about him on Twitter.  Yeah.  I found he became friends with him on Twitter because Twitter is a wonderful place.  Bird, chirp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a senior contributor at Macworld.  Adobe, wow, wait a minute, is dropping Type 1 font support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This goes back, my friends, my children to the late 1980s, early 1990s, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'll start with the Mac because before the Mac, there were no such thing as fonts.  Well, there were such things.  No, there were, but not in the personal computer space.  I mean, people discovered fonts.  Everything started looking like ransom letters because they put 18 different fonts in their  newsletters and things like that.  It settled down.  But there was a brisk market in fonts, and these were originally those Type 1 fonts that  you would get.  It was made possible by Postscript.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Postscript was revolutionary in publishing because no longer was an A an A.  An A was a description of shapes.  So it could be that it could be nine points or a thousand points and it would look great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And any shape, any letter, anything at all you wanted to Postscript enabled.  And that's what you may encounter with a PDF.  But I encountered Postscript earlier with publishing entertainment weekly, which my wife set up  all the whole network on.  So we had to buy all these fonts for our Macs.  They were expensive.  They were expensive.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I remember because we would have the zip drives full of fonts when we built our magazine.  Oh, right.  Type 1 fonts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So then if you didn't have the font on that machine, it wouldn't render it quark and you  couldn't see what the pages were going to be like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh my God, you're bringing back my college years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  That's why I love this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's great.  So Apple, which had a little falling out with Adobe, there's a long story behind that.  But in 1991 said, screw that.  We're going to create our own font description called TrueType.  They actually licensed it to Microsoft.  So when you see a font file, it's TTF.  That's a TrueType font.  And they were licensed for free.  So it gave you all the benefits of a type one font, but you didn't have to pay Adobe.  By 2000, there was a new architecture, which you also see commonly called OpenType, OTF.  So now frequently when you see fonts, they'll be stored as OTF or TTF.  OTF and TTF, I think, are fine.  They will continue on.  But type one fonts are gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you have an old PDF that has type one fonts in it, it will not fall apart.  What will happen?  It will still render.  It will still render.  Because it's already been exploded into the PDF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Photoshop will stop displaying type one fonts in the fonts menu at some point this year,  which means you won't be able to continue to use them.  You'll be able to edit existing files that contain the fonts, but not introduce these fonts into new files.  And by January 2023, none of Adobe's products will let users author content with type one fonts.  So what do you do?  You just delete them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you have to delete them.  And you've got to find...  If you've built some old design around it, God knows what exists still.  You have to go find an equivalent font and install that and redesign around it.  Yeah. Type one fonts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you can, update them to OTF, OpenType, or TTF.  Yeah, you can probably do that.  In many cases, fonts were updated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a blast to the past.  I gave Stacey a headache out of the memory of it.  It was, oh my God, why won't this page look like anything?  Oh no, because they don't have the huge Zip Drive for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Those were...  Yeah, we built a magazine and we built it using Dreamweaver.  And God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Font Lab does sell a program called TransType 4, which will take type one fonts and turn them into OTF fonts.  So it's only a hundred bucks.  Or if you're in education, $48.  Mac and PC. Convert legacy postscript fonts.  So I guess they're going to make some money on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  When we started Entertainment Weekly, which again, my wife did the...  It was the first major All Mac set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What happened, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Y'all, I'm talking about the magazine that we started in college.  You totally could have finished your story.  I was just so excited.  It still exists.  I started something all the way back in 1998 and it still exists.  What's it called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it at UT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, it's called orangemag.co.  Oh my goodness.  My baby grew up.  Oh, okay.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  Well, come on, my baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have your baby too.  The dreamers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Beginning in the late 1990s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look how modern it looks now.  Isn't that cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, dude, I have an old version of it.  It looked modern then.  I don't know.  One day I'll show y'all and y'all will be impressed with our graphic design.  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They unfortunately are not keeping those old ones online.  Wait a minute.  They only go back to issue one, spring 2014.  Are you sure this is the same?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you go into FAQs, they stopped publishing for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So then they started up again.  They started issue one.  Cool.  Congratulations, Stacey.  You created something that lasts.  Handcrafted by UT students.  Nice.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm so proud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's actually pretty cool.  So I got crap from executives at Time Inc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they insisted that...  Who cares about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm much more interested in the Orange Magazine.  No, no, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get crap from executives at Time Inc too.  Did you know Professor Dave Garlock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you take his magazine management class in Moody College's School of Journalism?  Okay, yes.  Are you making fun of him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, this is the beginning.  These were all my teachers.  Are they still here?  Is there an about here?  No, this is in the about.  Dear Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were old then.  Beginning in the late 1990s.  In the old days.  Back when Entertainment Weekly still was on the thing called Newsstands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Originally a class project.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good job.  Wait a second, Stacey.  That's a link.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  So Stacey, did you click on the link there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my God.  What are you about?  What are you about?  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  Click on the link there.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which link?  Here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, yeah, but this is not the course catalog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What year was your...  Is this your logo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, our logo was...  If you wait, I will actually show it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the oldest one they've still got online, which is 2009.  Yeah, this is not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because ours, it came out in 1998, 99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God, you're old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know.  And we actually had a fight with the Daily Texan.  It was crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  I think it's a little bit influenced by something I think of as Entertainment Weekly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  Look at this layout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very Entertainment Weekly.  Yeah.  Wow, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, actually, our layout looks just like that.  Okay, now I want to go grab it because our layout looked a lot like that, believe it  or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know what?  All type one fonts, every one of them.  Yeah, because they're not rendering.  They're not rendering well at all.  The hinting is not there.  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, when we started, the web was still very young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now is this a woman's college?  Because there's no men on this at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Our founders, three of the four of us were women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see zero men on the master.  Oh wait, but there's a game.  Well, it's about time, Leo.  It's fine.  What kind of world would only allow one gender to dominate like that?  Not a world I want to live in, that's for sure.  What year is that issue?  2009, spring 2009.  That's as far back as it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a little fancier than ours.  Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  All right.  That was a little...  That's really cute.  I was really excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This has been the Higginbotham Show.  It sure is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so sorry.  It sure is.  The fine thing that is, you need to have a reunion, Stacey, of Orange veterans, Orgers,  Orges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can email Dave Garlock.  I have his phone number here too, if you want to call him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I could email Dave Garlock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It worries me a little bit that this article says the latest issue is the fall 2011 issue.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  What happened is there was a...  There was a hiatus.  That's why I was like, yeah, there was a break in publication.  But it's still the same magazine and look, this one still exists.  So cool.  I'm proud of it.  Were you the first editor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, the Dreamers issue was published December 11, 2020, Leo.  No, I know.  That's just the old version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the old, from the journalism.utext.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I declined to be the editor.  I wanted to do something different.  So I was actually, Jeff, you're going to love it.  I was our...  What do they call that person?  The person who handles prints and publications.  But then I also became the managing editor because that person flaked.  But whoever had...  I dealt with the printer and production.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, did you have...  And I think it would have been a nice section if you'd thought a bit.  Right in the middle of that magazine, something called the Google Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that would have been good.  Wouldn't that have been good?  With trumpets?  Yeah, you wouldn't like that.  The Google Change Log.  Everybody would have made fun of Stacey if she had done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why is there a Google Change Log in the middle of my magazine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, when you hear these stories, you'll wonder yourself.  Google Pay US users can now send money to users in India and Singapore.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yay!  Tory too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That saves people a lot of money.  Yeah, no, that's good.  This is expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because Western Union is gone.  What do you do?  You got Venmo.  I don't know.  You can't...  Can I ask you a question about Google Pay?  I had to send my daughter money in Mexico.  She had to go to a grocery store to pick it up.  I mean, it really is primitive.  It's not a good system, so Google Pay will make a big improvement.  Yes, ask your question.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you only answer questions, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't get to ask them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google Pay existed, exists, but there's now G Pay and I put my credit card on Google Pay,  but do I now have to do it for G Pay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a mess.  And G Pay, is that like Venmo plus my credit card?  What is it?  It's a pain in the...  Google!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Newman!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a pain.  I was hoping somebody here could tell me.  One doesn't work on the other.  It's a pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, here is from TechCrunch.  Is Google Pay the same as G Pay?  Well, sort of.  It's a redesigned Google Pay.  Sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it also pulls in all these weird data that I don't understand why it's...  G Pay pulls in like the Las Vegas monorail, which I hooked up using NFC like five CDS's  ago and I don't understand where that came from.  It's not even on this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all in there, baby.  It's because they keep track of everything.  Google, you're a piece of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except the credit card I put in there, that's not in there anymore and I can't use anymore.  So Google forgot that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The most important new feature, according to TechCrunch, Google is enabling with this  update is indeed the ability to connect your bank accounts and credit cards to Google Pay  so that it can pull in information about your spending.  It's basically...  It's basically mint light.  We're just trying to make a service that makes your life better.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What if I just want to pay with my phone?  Can I use...  Do they have that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On Monday, I'll show you how much you spend on the weekend.  Think of these almost as like stories in a way, says the product manager.  You can swipe through them so you can see your large transactions.  You can see how much you spent this week compared to a typical week.  So really, yeah, they're trying to create kind of a true bill or a mint...  True bill is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All I see is a ton of ads that are like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can pay people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get cash back for a bunch of people and things, but I don't care about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The rest of the core Google Pay features aren't changing.  You can still make your NFC payments at the supermarket with your phone just as before.  It's just Google Pay Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think it's worse.  If you go to Google Pay, it says, try the new Google Pay.  It's not Google Pay, it's cheap pay.  Jesus, can they hire somebody to do brands and sponsor things?  Oh, I'm telling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it Mike Elgin who said, Senator Pichari is actually a terrible CEO?  I'm starting to agree with him a little bit.  It's not a well-run company.  I'm sorry, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry to disrupt the change log.  I had such high hopes that I would understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that was good.  It was almost as important as this second story in the Google change log.  Google Fiber has a new logo.  Google Fiber has a new logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It doesn't even look like Fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the Google logo deconstructed is what it is or something.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to put it together to get a circle for the signal to come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, the big story is they actually restarted it back up and they've been putting two gigabit  internet in existing cities and they even have started some new fiber, which I thought  they weren't going to do anymore.  So maybe there is a larger story there, but at least they have a new logo.  Thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google brings...  I think that's the way to avoid the poroct curse.  You can't kill us.  We get at least six months with a new logo, right?  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google brings something your watch has needed for a long time, a keyboard to Wear OS.  It's actually the first major app launch on Wear OS in years.  It is the...

Transcript:  You can't kill us Ruth Poro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, let me tell you, this looks easy.  This looks easy because this watch is huge, but really in real life you can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No one wants a keyboard on their watch.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google?  How dorky can you look?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's just not effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As you type, as if it weren't small enough, as you type, they actually take a top row  to put predictions in, scrollable word suggestions.  A preview screen allows you to review and edit your message with suggestions and corrections  presented to you.  And you can swipe...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey Ruth, you might want to go visit the Wear team.  You know, you just might want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They actually had one before.  This is the old Wear keyboard.  Boy, it looks old too.  But it was using type one fonts, so they've moved to the new keyboard.  Oh man, there's got to be a big story to wrap up the Google changelog, right?  Google Assistant family broadcasts from smart displays can now appear on phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's useful.  Yeah.  Is it just a visual or is it audio?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me make you read the whole article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't ask questions, Stacey.  You just answer.  No, it's just text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's just text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I thought because, you know, Apple has that very cool feature where you do an announcement  on the HomePod.  I'm on my way home with a pizza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But no, okay.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Today's update expands the reach and makes it a tour system for quick voice messages  that matches intercom on the HomePod.  Meanwhile, family bells can now be configured to ring across multiple home devices instead  of just one.  And you can say, by the way, now we mentioned this a couple of weeks ago, stop instead of  saying, hey, you know who first to stop it.  And oh, hey, this is exciting.  Smart displays are adding more stories from Harry Potter's Wizarding World and the Who  Was series by Random House.  Kids will also enjoy a tree of new songs.  Try this one, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a family bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Please stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Never do that again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Try the brush your teeth song.  It's still doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's still going.  It now says help me wash my hands.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a new one.  You do.  There's a vaccine song.  You want to try the vaccine song?  Oh, sure.  Okay.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Sing the vaccine song is all you have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sing the vaccine song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's celebrate that we have the vaccine to help us bring a change to this whole routine.  It can help us build our immunities while taking care of our communities.  All true.  Okay.  I actually will groove on this.  I'm a sucker for radio singing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's all true.  Well, I don't want to shake hands.  I'm shaking hands again.  Stop with the shaking hands.  No, we don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Step towards opening up and shaking hands again and going somewhere we couldn't visit  for months protecting ourselves and the world at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Once was bad enough.  Yeah, that was true.  That's the main.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're vaccinated, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Happy vaccine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, when did you get your most your last one?  Two and a half, three weeks ago.  Oh, you're good.  You're golden.  Let's go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Anna has a shot scheduled for this weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Michael, our 18 year old is getting his second shot right now.  Yay.  I know the world.  Well, I shouldn't say the world.  America is coming back.  Unfortunately, a lot of the rest of the world is saying you stole all the vaccines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where's ours?  Meanwhile, I just tweeted this.  I found this vaguely offensive.  Ohio just announced, according to a tweet, let's hope it's not wrong, from a journalist,  it says that they're going to give away one million dollars to five randomly vaccinated  residents.  Governor DeWine announced.  Is that to encourage people to getting vaccinated?  Yeah, but it's just at a time when when people have to walk miles in India to not get  vaccinated and get oxygen.  It just seems just ugly.  America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is that there are a lot of people who won't get vaccinated.  Erie County, New York, neighbor the other night.  Yeah.  Erie County, New York.  They're they're giving you beer.  I actually think that's smart.  That's smart.  I'm fine with that.  Local microbrewery.  There was a line at the door to get vaccinated next to his towering metal fermentation tanks.  It was the first vaccine for beer pop up in the county's aptly named shot and chaser program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shot and chaser.  Get a shot.  Get your chaser.  That's good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jersey did the same thing.  It's a good thing.  It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny because it shows that even though people are resistant to vaccine, their resistance  is actually quite low.  Oh, you're going to give me a beer?  OK, I'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it is a lot of young white people, mostly men.  So this is a good program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's fine.  I'm fine with the beer.  But five million dollars, it could go to better purposes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That does seem like an awful lot.  It could.  Honestly, Mike, I'm talking about Mike DeWine.  A hundred bucks is all you need to give away.  People be thrilled.  They jump on that thing.  You don't need to give away five million.  Can you get more entries if you get more vaccines?  Like four?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just got hit with a paywall by the Columbus Dispatch.  Oh, please.  But it also said they were going to give away five full ride scholarships.  Ah, that's good.  Again, then you should be giving scholarships.  Anyway, it didn't subset me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Yeah, because everybody should just get the vaccine because it's the right thing to do  for the community.  You should just do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And a beer is a fine bribe.  You know what?  It's not a bribe.  It's a reward.  I am absolutely fine with the beer reward.  I think that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got cake after my vaccine.  Did you really?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From whom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, that counts.  That counts.  And that's the Google change.  I have to wrap that up.  Otherwise, poor John has to hover his finger over that button and it's just he gets tired.

Transcript:  That's a tick tock.  You're into the tick tocks, aren't you?  Are you like, you like, you like Google.  It's about Google.  So it counts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's in the Google.  Here it is.

Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What happened?  Google doesn't know you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Meanwhile, the Amazon, you know who has been revealed?  Amazon.  Oh, the actress?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She was actually revealed a while back, but yes.  Was she?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's been a big deal about how Brad Stone got it.  Oh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Never mind.  Well, Brad wrote that book about Amazon.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He wrote a second book about that Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, just came out, right?  Is it a brand new one?  Yeah.  Yep.  I liked his first one, the everything store.  So in the new book, he says Colorado based Nina Roll is the voice of a word.  He says it's never been revealed.  Roll is a voiceover artist who's worked for Honda, Jenny, Craig and Chase Bank.  She was selected after Amazon spent months assessing various candidates and it took Jeff  Bezos to sign off on Roll or Rollie.  Rollie could not talk about the role when Stone contacted her in February.  There is a woman on TikTok who imitates the A word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, this was OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She does a good job.  I thought it was revealed as well.  But you know what?  Siri's been revealed.  The lady who does Siri is well known.  Oh, maybe that's what I was thinking.  Maybe that's it.  So we just didn't know who A word was.  But as you can tell...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, actually Meet the Woman Behind Amazon's Madam A, NBC News, August 8th, 2018.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And is it Rollie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe they had to kill her and then they bring in Rollie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tony Reed to learn a little bit more about this pint size.  Oh, this is the person who created Madam A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not the voice.  Not the voice.  Just the woman who created it.  Have I mentioned that Google Fiber has a brand new logo?  Did I mention that?  Yes.  Yes, you did.  Trying to make something out of it, but just can't.  Just can't do it.  Let's see.  Did you see the Guardian article about people, mostly women, who don't want to take off the  mask?  They say it's an invisibility cloak.  And I kind of understand.  My wife doesn't want to take her mask off.  She likes wearing it.  Even though...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You only have to put makeup on half your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  Becca Marshall works at a bookstore outside Chicago.  She says, it's a common consensus among my coworkers.  We prefer not having customers see our faces.  Oftentimes when a customer is being rude or saying off-color political things, I'm not  allowed to grimace or make a face because that will set them off with a mask.  I don't have to smile at them or worry about keeping a neutral face.  I've had customers get very upset when I don't smile at them.  I deal with any maskers constantly at work.  They've threatened to hurt me, tried to get me fired, thrown things at me, yelled, F you  in my face.  If wearing a mask in the park separates me from them, I'm cool with it.  I think there's going to be kind of virtual signaling via masks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I keep my mask on outside even though I know it makes no difference.  And I do it simply just to make sure, one, people feel better about it and then also  to help encourage other people to do it.  Because if everyone's doing something, it's for the whole world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bob Hall, a 75-year-old retired researcher in New Jersey.  I think his real name was Jeff Jarvis.  With a self-described naturally grim countenance that tends to be off-putting to others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you're a woman, they call it resting bitch face.  That's right.  But for men, it's a naturally grim countenance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says, in the United States, there's an obligation to appear happy.  And I get told to smile and be happy a lot, which is very annoying.  The mask frees me from this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's been my whole life.  That's what I was thinking.  I was like, yeah, no one's telling these women to smile anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good for them.  I think that's a perfectly good reason to continue wearing a mask, honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got into a tiff with Glenn Greenwald on Twitter today because he went after Kamala  Harris for wearing a mask.  This was grisly.  And I said, you don't tell a woman what to do with her body.  Enough.  Stop.  There's another funny story.  Charlie Wartzel tweeted it from Vice.  I just put it at the bottom of the other.  Anti-maskers are ready to start masking to protect themselves from the vaccinated.  Oh, yeah, because we have the Bill Gates virus.  Bill Gates stuff on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  That's propaganda to make sure they don't die of the coronavirus when they don't have  a mask or a vaccine.  They're trying to save those people.  Good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a reprehensible story that I think you'll enjoy.  There is a power plant in upstate New York, the Greenage power plant that's been abandoned  long ago.  It has been purchased by a private equity firm, Atlas Holdings, and put back online  to provide power for Bitcoin mining.  By the end of the year, Greenage will be up and running, and Atlas will have installed  18,000 Bitcoin mining machines.  Actually, they got approval of their data center expansion plants, so they're going  to add 10,000 more.  Miners will be using 79% of the plant's capacity, 85 megawatts.  And the company actually is proud of it.  In the recent S4 filing with the SEC, they said, quote, no direct competitor currently  owns and operates its own power plant for the purpose of Bitcoin mining.  No other Bitcoin mining operation of this scale in the United States currently uses  power generated from its own plant.  Bully for us.  Say, of course, it's a fossil fuel powered plant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was like, is it a fossil fuel powered plant?  Or is it, I mean, because there's Bitcoin mining here.  It's actually even worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a coal fired power plant.  It's awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's awful.  The neighbors are complaining.  It's belching smoke again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the reasons they closed it down because it was so expensive to run.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It was converted to natural gas in 2014.  So I guess in 2017, it was restarted to test its Bitcoin mining strategy.  Less and less used on the grid, more and more for Bitcoin.  And you know what?  Elon Musk, who a very short time ago said we're going to accept Bitcoin in payment  for Tesla's says we're not going to do it anymore.  Citing environmental concerns.  They've suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin because of fossil fuels used for Bitcoin  mining, which kind of makes sense if you're trying to sell a green car.  Right.  Yeah.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of course, he might just be like screw the earth because we're going to Mars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's the funny thing because apparently he's got a plan to use Dogecoin to fund a  satellite or something.  So you know, Elon is confusing.  Skip over all this.  A trip to the moon.  That's right.  They want to go to the moon next year and they want to finance it with Dogecoin.  Did you watch them on SNL?  I tried to watch the clips and it wasn't funny.  So I just stopped.  Somebody said today thought it was the funniest SNL.  One of our one of our club members.  So there's a funniest SNL ever.  So SpaceX is going to launch a moon mush, mush and a moon mission mushroom mushroom

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  mushroom sized popcorn, which is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very confusing because he just stopped taking Bitcoin for cars.  But now he wants to fund a moon mission with Dogecoin by 2022.  Geometric Energy Corp has planned a rideshare mission of the moon aboard the SpaceX Falcon  9 rocket, which costs about 69, sorry, 62 million to book, which at its current value  is 129 million Dogecoin.  Elon and this is again why you Twitter so wonderful tweeted tweeted this saying to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  moon to the moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then apparently there's a you want to hear the Twitter Dogecoin song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is the only cryptocurrency that you should invest?  Dogecoin!  It's the people's currency.  You know it's the best.  Please no!  I hope Ali Brosh got money for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay Leo stop.  I'm probably going to get taken down.  That'll be the irony of that.  We'll get this whole show taken down and lose our YouTube license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is Dogecoin mined like others?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  It's they haven't figured out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well is it as energy intensive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  Should I look it up?  I think it's all pretty bad.  They're all still using proof of work.  I think Dogecoin uses proof of work.  Let me just check.  It's an open source decentralized peer to peer network that uses a proof of work consensus  algorithm which sounds just like Bitcoin.  I think really it's just Bitcoin.  But anyway okay.  Okay fine.  Okay fine.  Study finds no link.  Stacey no link between the time teens spent on tech devices and mental health issues.  No link.  Told you.  No link.  Okay.  This is a good study.  30 year study.  Four hundred thirty adolescents in the UK and the US used questionnaires dating back  to 1991 and they were unable to show any statistical correlation between mental health issues and  I pulled up the actual study.  It is a good one.  Yeah.  I mean okay.  Some flaws it's self-reported right.  So maybe they you know.  But still it's good.  eBay is going to start selling NFTs.  But this is an interesting twist.  You have to use dollars to buy them.  So somebody's figured that out.  Oh you know if we took dollars the whole thing could be just you know profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Well Webster's is also doing an NFT.  Webster's the dictionary.  The Twitter joke.  The Twitter joke because we finally understand what it is.  So we have one.  I don't know if they're selling the definition of NFT.  That's actually what they should do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should sell the definition of NFT as an NFT.  It would be like an inception.  It would be incredible.  All right.  Let's take a little break and we will come back with our picks of the week right.  You ready.  All right.  Yes.  So for the week time Stacey is ready because Waffles Awake.  Go ahead Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice.  All right.  She was waiting.  She was no farther away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She was waiting.  What's happening?  OK.  I saw this on Twitter.  Twitter and I got excited about it.  So I just bought.  I'm going to tell you what it is.  It is the M5 stack core 2 SB32 IoT dev kit for AWS IoT education.  You're like what just happened?  So here it is.  And I'm going to pop the link into the.  I am Jason hates me because I never put the links in the right spot.  Hold on.  I'm coming Jason.  Ah.  Boom.  There it is.  OK.  So this is a dev kit so I can actually start using AWS and build something to flash my  lights or something like that.  You know just oops just a play basically.  Most of y'all are probably like Stacey what?  But I don't code.  So Kevin's going to support me on this.  He doesn't know it yet.  And yeah.  So this is both a sensor.  It has a little LED.  It has ports.  It has a speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a Raspberry Pi.  It's obvious.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Shh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Raspberry Pi with with the link up to AWS IoT stuff.  So now it's got a radio to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  And what is the what is the it's not sidewalk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No no no it's Wi-Fi.  I'm assuming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the M5 stack core 2 ESP32 IOST development kit for AWS IoT.  Edu kit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So basically this is just Stacey's effort to like learn how to start playing with some  of the things I talk about because I talk about lots of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I love about it.  It has a lego on the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I can build like a little robot.  Oh that's so cool.  It's a it's Lego.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll show you the little Lego.  That's so logo.  That's so like it's Lego compatible.  That's so awesome.  Yeah.  Well that is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So yeah I just I don't know.  I wanted to play and I had time and it's almost summer.  So that's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what language do you have to use to control it.  What do you what do you do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know yet because I just got it.  So we're just going to you know it might be an art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says it supports Arduino development framework so it might be an Arduino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah I was like it's not a full computer.  Let's see.  That would make sense.  Python.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think there's a lot of programming here.  I think it's mostly about physical stuff.  Again this is part of Stacey buys stuff and then plays with it and is like oh here I'm  learning what I know and what I don't know.

Transcript:  Yeah it's built on the ESP 32 which is one of the most popular microcontroller.  So it isn't a Pi or an Arduino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an ESP 32 but that's Arduino compatible.  So that's cool.  Neat.  Oh they make a lot of ESP 32 stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

So we often talk about how the platforms don't pay enough taxes and I agree with that and  I scream that it's up to governments to decide what companies pay in taxes.  Well indeed the EU and EU court just decided to throw out a 303 million dollar EU tax bill  for Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow 330 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they had used the Luxembourg double hitch sandwiched al-kow defense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's actually a big deal because if the EU regulators can't get the courts to prosecute  that's going to be tough for them to continue on.  This is a bestseller case.  We just assume if a stagger says it it's going to happen but courts have to sign off.  That's interesting.  Tossed out.  Wow.  What did they say?  They said there was no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They said that they hadn't shown that there was an undue reduction to the tax burden of  Amazon's Luxembourg subsidiary.  That means I have no idea.  But as I say here it was a the verge says it was a significant blow for you politicians  and a big win for Amazon.  Now it can still be appealed to as an Apple case it was also a return in 2020 is being  to the European Court of Justice.  So we'll see.  But this goes back to a case in 2017 or 2000.  That's when the commission ruled.  It goes back to 2006.  So they've changed all the tricks have changed since then.  But it sets the precedent of saying no.  It's up to you to have the laws in place.  You can't just make it up as you go.  So we'll see what happens.  I mean I think I think that we need laws to tax them better.  I think we need diplomacy so that the countries that Ireland Luxembourg wherever the Dutch  sandwich a lot of stuff that's up to diplomats to get out so that we can tax them at an even  and fair rate across countries according to what they earn in each country.  It's not what happened now.
