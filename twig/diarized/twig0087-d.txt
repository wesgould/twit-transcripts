Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great to be here.  Great guests.  Excited for a good show.  Lots of words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got an email from Steve Martin who said he hates Backupify, but he's really happy  with ThinkUp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Awesome.  Love to hear that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you have a fan.  Awesome.  Yes.  Yeah, he's probably going to send you a plastic bunny ears or something as a thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would love that.  It's kind of surreal getting emails from Steve Martin.  I have to say it's kind of awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  More than awesome.  Yes.  Yes.  Also with this, actually another great guest in studio, Jeff Jarvis is here as usual, but  look at that guy to his right, Andy Carvin.  Hey everyone.  He's also here.  We keep promoting on the Twitter.  What's your title at NPR?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Senior Strategist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  That's how I react.  Are you a journalist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Middle East coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you a journalist by training?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm a writer and documentary maker by background, but have worked in online community organizing  going back to the mid 90s and also doing a lot of online disaster response.  So this is second nature for me.  It's just focusing on news and reporting instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've mentioned many times that if you follow a Carvin on Twitter, you will get an amazing  curated list of links and tweets and a very interesting material on, well, did it start  with Tunisia?  You've been doing it for a while, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I started in Tunisia just before Christmas and since then it's expanded to, let's see,  Egypt, Iran, Yemen, Bahrain, Libya, Morocco and a few others.  And Japan.  And Japan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Plus tsunami.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really, I mean, I couldn't be more sincere when I say that this is something everybody  who is interested in these breaking stories should follow.  But I think we talk about it a lot.  I know Jeff does because it's a totally new way to get information.  It's a new form of journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think the thing that's new about it is on the one hand, it's like I'm using Twitter  for doing live anchor coverage like a broadcast would.  But rather than relying on producers and editors and researchers to handle the information,  I just ask my Twitter crowd because I'm essentially a one-man band.  I don't know everything.  I don't even speak Arabic.  And so if I start hearing things from a particular place in Libya or Bahrain, I start asking  for assistance and people come out of the woodwork to help me figure out what's true  and what's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course, the crime of it is, is while Charlie Sheen has well over 2 million followers,  You've only got 37,000 followers and yet it is arguably one of the richest Twitter streams  out there for real content.  So thank you, Andy.  Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thanks.  I appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every time I've sworn to Andy on the show, I talk so fast that I get tweets the next  day saying, who is that guy again?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Who is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who is that guy?  Right.  A-C-A-R-V-I-N.  It's easy to remember.  Just think of a car driving into a French winery.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  A-C-A-R-V-I-N.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the groan comes from Factory Joe, Chris Messina himself.  Hey, Chris, thanks for joining us.  So great to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, welcome.  Glad to be back, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chris is an open web advocate at Google, but he for years has been taking the lead on open  standards across the web.  You've been out a couple of years at Google, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, actually, it's been just over a year.  It feels like longer.  I know.  I know, right?  It's the epic struggles that we have faced together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I commend Google for bringing in somebody like you and commend you for going into the  lion's den.  But where better to go to promote open standards on the web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, thanks.  It took a long hard thought to figure out what I wanted to do next about a year ago.  Part of it was just having a number of conversations with different folks, thinking about where  I can make the most impact and who is sort of actually most seemingly aligned with where  I thought the web needed to go, especially the social web.  And so after having those conversations, Google seemed like a natural fit.  I mean, they're obviously a big tech company, but they've also been really adamant about  ruining open standards and open technologies for quite a while.  So I'm hoping to do more of that here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you have to talk them into letting you on the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, actually.  So far they've been pretty good about that.  And PR has been very supportive of what I've done.  And in fact, the interesting thing for me that I've learned is that in the last year,  I've kind of gone underground in a lot of ways.  And that's because I've been doing a lot more evangelism inside of Google, helping Google  to sort of understand what's going on outside of the Mountain View campus in terms of the  social web and in terms of the different technologies that are out there.  And they've also been supportive of actually getting more folks in developer relations  and throughout the company blogging and using social media.  So I think that's actually been very positive.  In fact, it was about a week and a half ago, I was on an internal blogger panel, sort of  talking about the ways and hows and how to do it and how to make it work.  And I think stuff like that is very promising.  That's great.  Chris is one of the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chris, what's the biggest kind of message that you've wanted to get across at Google  or the Google most needed?  What's the cultural bridge you've built?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's ongoing.  I think part of it for me is it's not just about technologies all the time.  Of course, out in Silicon Valley and the open sort of standards world, we talk a lot about  tech and about formats and protocols.  But at the end of the day, it's really about creating great products and great product  experiences.  So a lot of the conversation that I've been having is like the struggle between, well,  we want to do the open thing, we want to do the right thing, but we also want to create  a great product and a great user experience.  So how can we achieve both?  And I think part of that is understanding what Google wants to do for the web and then  how can we work with others to build a better, more interesting ecosystem that enables apps  that currently aren't possible because we lack interoperability in those basic underlying  technologies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, as long as we've got Andy here, and I know Andy's not here forever, so why don't  we- I have little logistics here.  We've got, of course, a lot of news to cover, but I think it's an opportunity to get Andy  on briefly.  I take it that you've got to go back to tweeting or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I've actually been tweeting this whole time thanks to my phone, but I probably do  have to get running in about 15 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been tweeting the whole time.  So has it become-  I can't help myself.  No, but it must have become kind of a full- I'm looking at it right now and a lot of what  you're doing is retweeting, which makes it very easy because you don't have to type anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, most of what I've sent out in the last five, 10 minutes have been retweets from sources  that I've found to be reliable in the last couple of months.  There have been a couple of tweets that I chimed in on that I was either skeptical of  or wanted more information.  So it's the kind of thing you can type one-handed and get up pretty quickly.  But what I've really tried to do is identify who in each country has the right information  who's more reliable.  And for those that are somewhat questionable, how I can involve my Twitter community to  vet them.  So it's a combination of several things going on at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I was wondering, Andy.  What tool- do you use any tools to take notes and establishing reputation on some of these  sources?  What are you using to- besides just asking your Twitter followers about determining reputation,  what are you using to keep track of who are the people you feel like you can retweet safely  or are good sources and who you want to stay away from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's really just virtual shoe leather at this point.  I typically use TweetDeck, but there's nothing inherently about TweetDeck that makes it better  than other Twitter clients.  Essentially, what I do is I always start and try to figure out who I know in any given  country.  Fortunately, for both Tunisia and Egypt, I have at least a half a dozen trusted sources  already due to previous travels there.  And while watching them on Twitter, I could, after a while, figure out who they trusted,  who they retweeted or replied to the longest, how long that they had been following each  other on Twitter.  You can tell from the intimacy of some of these conversations how connected they are.  In some cases, I discovered these folks were brothers and sisters or husband and wives.  And after a while, you just start noticing these patterns in the way people talk to each  other.  It's been a lot harder in places like Libya, of course, because very few people are online  and everyone's using aliases.  And frankly, most of my contacts in Libya have either gone missing and one of them,  unfortunately, was killed this weekend.  So it's a lot tougher to vet things there.  Having said that, the vast majority of the user-generated content you see coming out  of Libya is real and comes from Libya.  It's just a matter of figuring out the appropriate context, the whens and wheres and whys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  I mean, I think that's a really big question for me, something I struggle with in building  ThinkUp, is figuring out, determining authority and expertise and figuring out those relationships  and how people talk to one another and how they're related and what makes them authorities  and what makes them good sources.  I was interested to know.  So it sounds like this is happening.  I mean, you're working your contacts like any journalist would, but also sort of using  information that you've gleaned just from watching people interact to figure out who's  a good source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that's an interesting question.  Can you automate this or does it have to be done by a human?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've been talking about various ways of automating some of it, but I think for it to really work,  you need to at least know one or two people that you can trust and rely on.  Once you know a couple of people, you can probably run some scripts to get a sense of  who they're closest to.  That's certainly conceivable.  But like in the case of Libya, the reason why I was able to find contacts there was  because I first tried identifying contacts in the Libyan expat community here in the  U.S. and getting on Skype with them and saying, who do you know that's actually there?  Which of these Twitter users are real?  Which ones are fake?  And they just talked me through as many of them as they could and helped connect me to  a number of people that have been tremendous sources.  So there's always actual journalism taking place in the background, even though what  you see on Twitter is a culmination of open news gathering and reporting and stud struggle  like oral history all happening at the same time.  It's kind of a bit of a jumbled mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One reason I'm here is to try to work on this out of CUNY and figure out new ways to develop  tools that will help this.  It's a new form of journalism, you're absolutely right.  And it breaks out of the idea that we're always just storytellers.  It instead says that the witnesses are to this and Andy is adding journalistic value  throughout.  One thing is I have this audience here.  One thing we're going to try to bring to CUNY is some analysis of Andy's experience on this.  And I want to look at the data and analyze and visualize the relationships that have  occurred here and see who follows whom and who retweets whom and so on and so forth.  So is anybody out there who is a real whiz of this kind of visualization and analysis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if there's Gina Trapani listening.  Because I'm pretty sure that's exactly what ThinkUp does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this is this is what we're working towards, right?  Is visualizing relationships and seeing who's who and establishing authority, I think, is  a really big, a big issue.  And I totally agree.  You know, someone's just got to get on the phone and you can't do this with a script.  I think there's got to be some human intervention involved.  But I think that that software like ThinkUp, I hope that software like ThinkUp can help  with that sort of thing.  But anyway, I didn't mean to turn this into a commercial.  I was I was genuinely interested just from a developer's point of view of like, you know,  how we could help help someone like you and you do what you do, because it's so it's so  important. It makes me feel less bad about following Lady Gaga on Twitter.  It makes it OK.  It makes it OK.  Charlie Sheen, though, just don't go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but it can't make it in all seriousness, it can be a little disorienting when Lady  Gaga is talking to her little monsters and all of a sudden you hear about a big monster  in Libya. It's just it's a little but that's what Twitter kind of unique to Twitter, where  it is all jumbled together and in interesting ways.  I don't mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's actually one of the things I hear the most from people is that they find it really  disconcerting that they're following their favorite fashionistas or whatever.  And at the same time, seeing me tweet photos of the latest batch of corpses coming out of  the city in Libya.  The other thing I get the most are people praying for my safety, because every single  day people think that I'm somewhere.  I just earlier today, someone was tweeting me asking me when the hell I'm going to get  out of get out of Benghazi like so many other reporters have.  So, you know, I wish I could do that.  But I was sitting on my couch with my cats and my kids at that particular moment.  And I was in Palm Springs last week.  So the only thing I had to worry about then was like a sunburn.  So it can be really strange.  But I guess it's also a sign of people thinking what I'm doing is effective if it seems  like I'm actually there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Gina, seriously, I you were my next call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, great. Yeah, let's yeah, let's do that.  Oh, I think it's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll definitely be in touch.  Yeah. Excellent.  I also enjoy it because.  It shows that while there is a lot of amusement factor and all of this stuff and there's  nothing wrong with amusement, there's also a lot of value.  It's all mixed together.  And I guess that's that was true of television.  The problem is television was linear.  This is aggressively nonlinear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we talked that you have you have a couple of Indiana scientists who found that  by tracking the words behind six moods and their opposite, they could track the up and  down in the Dow to like 90 percent accuracy.  And there's now a new hedge fund that started out of that.  And they should learn a different way to do things here.  Right. Yeah.  But I think that this idea that you're capturing the knowledge and psyche and news of  the people now, that's new.  And that's what that's what excites me so much.  But again, what Andy's doing is that he's adding the journalistic value to that because  it's too confusing. It's too much.  But there is you've got to be open to seeing the value that's there, which is what Andy's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  done. It's definitely what I'm trying to do.  I've heard people say, well, it definitely feels like you've got the pulse on your finger  on the pulse and what's going on in Libby.  And I think there's some truth to that, except in this particular case, the pulse talks back  to me. The pulse translates for me.  Wow.  Pulse volunteers to do all sorts of things that there's no way I could do on my own.  And so, honestly, I don't care if I have 100 followers or 100,000 followers on Twitter,  as long as a critical mass of them are subject matter experts and people with experience  on the ground and people who give a damn about these places, because they're the ones that  let me do my job well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's the trick?  If Leo keeps kids safe, tell me how the first search is when a big news story happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yes. So, for example, when the US Airways plane went down on the Hudson River, the very  first thing I did was try to do a proximity search on Manhattan, searching from a time  frame beginning before any of the wire, the wire stories went out and searching for phrases  like plane, river, holy shit.  It's really important that you do stuff like that for earthquakes.  I search for what the hell was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What the fuck was that?  The search is on Twitter, not on Google.  You're searching on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, on Twitter, because people use fleeting expletives on Twitter in the same way they  do in real life.  And so if you can guess how a person is responding to a situation, you can often find the  eyewitnesses that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because if you're an eyewitness, you say, holy crap, what was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's brilliant.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're giving away your secrets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep. So now I don't have to do this job anymore because you can all do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I wonder how viable this job is.  You know, the New York Times is putting up a paywall.  When we get an Andy Carvin paywall, you know, how do you make a living doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It wouldn't work.  It, you know, even if I could find enough people who wanted to pay for my Twitter feed,  the reality is my Twitter work is successful because I've got so many people to know what  I think about following me.  And so, like I said before, I'd rather have almost no one following me as long as the  people who are have experiences in the places I'm trying to cover.  And that's to me, that's much more valuable because I don't see this as trying to monetize  my Twitter account.  I see this as trying to improve the quality and diversity of NPR's journalism.  That's my primary goal here.  Oh, here, here.  Money's not bad, but you know, but I think we can make journalism a lot better and make  it viable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, kudos to NPR for paying you.  So there ain't a part of what they pay you to do is this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, part of my day job has always been to experiment with new tools.  This case has been somewhat strange because as things escalated in Tunisia and then in  Egypt, I started to ignore meeting requests and canceling meetings and just delegating  work to people that I had no responsibility or right to give it to them.  And as the weeks went by, people started to notice, but they were very positive about  it. In some ways, I equate it with the guy in the movie Office Space who starts spacing  out and goes to work and knocks down his cubicle wall and starts basically doing nothing  and gets a promotion for it.  So I'm kind of like not doing my job in an official capacity, but yet all the higher  ups here seem very pleased so far on how it's going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But watch out copy machine because there's absolutely.  Might lose it.  Everybody should follow Andy.  Do you are there? Do you know of other people like this, Jeff or Andy?  Are there other people doing this kind of work?  I think this is unique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there are certainly some people that are doing a very good job live tweeting the  revolutions. For example, there was a guy I believe in the UAE named Sultan Al Qasemi  who's been tremendous because not only does he keep in touch with everything going on,  he's a fluent native Arabic speaker.  So he's got one leg up above me in terms of being able to keep up on tweets that are  in Arabic. I'm somewhat different in the sense that I have NPR as a bully pulpit,  whereas he's doing this because he just loves doing this.  And also the fact that I'm able to I really focus on trying to get my followers on  Twitter to help me. And he does that to a certain extent.  But it's in some ways the primary way that I'm doing business on Twitter, because  I would never call myself a Mideast expert by any means.  But I feel like that I've got enough followers who are invested both in me and invested  in the situation in the Middle East that they're willing to volunteer the time to  make my reporting better.  Thank you for what you do, Andy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.  Thank you. I appreciate it.  And you've got a hundred new followers right now.  I hope you all speak Arabic.  A-C-A-R-V-I-N.  Just remember a car going into a vineyard.  A-C-A-R-V-I-N on Twitter.  Follow him. And thanks to your bosses at NPR for letting you do this.  And I hope others I mean, it really is a template for others to do this.  Of course, if you are in the middle of it, if you are if this is your personal story,  you're going to do this kind of thing.  But I think it's I think what we need is more meta-curators at a high level like you  are, Andy, covering more stories.  I think it's a really interesting form of journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you wouldn't mind, like, sure, I think it's interesting to see what Andy's doing.  I had the pleasure to meet Andy at South By, a rare snippet that I do recall.  And he remembers your hat, too.  So there you go.  Well, yeah. So there was something going on there.  But, you know, it's interesting because a friend of mine, Nate Ritter, sort of did  something very similar, though, perhaps on a smaller scale in 2007 with the  San Diego fires. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I remember that was the first time that really broke out on Twitter.  I do remember that. Yep. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so I think KPBS were very involved in doing that, too.  That's the local NPR PBS station in San Diego.  They basically said, we don't know what the hell is going on across the counties.  We need you on Twitter to help us figure it out.  And they did an amazing job.  So, you know, I would never pretend that what I'm doing is new.  You know, I remember folks doing this when Benazir Bhutto was assassinated several  years ago. Lots of people did similar things during the 2008 election.  I think what's different in my case is I've dropped all of my other job  responsibilities and I've made this more than a full time job.  Way more. Way more. Yeah, because I'm doing this.  Doing it now. Seven days a week.  And I haven't done in the last five minutes, so hopefully they don't think I'm  dead or stranded somewhere in Libya.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does that happen sometimes if you don't tweet in 10 minutes?  People go, Andy, are you there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I do. I get it all the time.  Half of the people say, Andy, stop apologizing for going offline.  And others say, thank you. You weren't run over by a bus.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And when Andy, there was a huge night, I don't know which one it was,  a huge news night, Egypt or something.  And Andy said, I'm going to go to sleep for six hours.  And I was in Europe. So I saw the moment six hours came later.  And I just tweeted, I'm your alarm clock, Andy.  Wake up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I got up a little bit after that.  And next thing you know, Mubarak resigned three hours later.  Wow. Wow. Thank you.  Actually, we need to write a script so you can DM me and have my phone  freak out. That would actually be really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, Andy, we'll let you go back to work.  But thank you very much for being here.  Thanks, Leo. Good seeing all of you.  Take care. Take care. Thanks, Andy.  Andy Carvin, NPR and prolific Twitterer.  You know, Chris, it strikes me that this is a really good example of how.  And of course, you were on Twitter very early, how you can design something  like Twitter and have no idea how it will be used or what it will be.  And I think this happens all the time in the net these days, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems to be the case of good emerging systems.  I mean, I think this is this is the whole premise of working on open,  you know, formats, essentially technologies that allow.  Well, I'm diving too deeply into the tech stuff already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But no, go, go, go. We want you to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just I'm sort of making this point because I think Twitter did this  in an amazing way very early on.  And in fact, I think Evan Biz have had a knack for doing this.  If you think about blogger early on, you know, when Evan Biz were working on that,  really, that was taking sort of a known medium,  you know, like like newspaper articles and moving into a digital domain.  So you had the titles and you had like this sort of long text body content  that you would read. And of course, there weren't a lot of people blogging  at that time in, you know, the mid 2000s.  And so you could subscribe to people and you could read their entire blog posts  as more and more people learned how to use computers and how to type  and how to be proficient at it in the subsequent years.  Obviously, it became harder and harder, at least it was for me,  to keep up with all those things going on.  And meanwhile, people were moving over to their mobile devices  for staying in touch and communicating.  Prices started to come down. It was more accessible.  Yeah, all these things happened.  And what I think is interesting is that Evan Biz, you know,  this is my, you know, sort of mental model for how this all worked,  kind of took the model of blogging and they chopped off the body  and just took the subjects of the post and allowed you to turn  what was previously a private communication channel, namely SMS,  into a public communication channel.  Yeah. And they did that right at the right moment.  They resisted change for a long time.  And that simple creation of a new communication channel  that was extremely limited and restrictive actually defined a new medium.  That was so much more accessible to so many more people,  because as it turns out, it seems most people can string together  at least 100 characters and form some sense of a thought.  Whereas stringing together 100 sentences is not something that all of us  can have the ability to do as I'm demonstrating right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're giving them a lot of credit for having understood  that they were up to something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whether they understood it or not, I think they knew well enough that,  you know, these communication mediums take a long time to evolve and to emerge.  I mean, you know, I mentioned Nate Ritter, not because it's like,  oh, look, he was the first person to do this, but because there's a role  and several roles that end up being really important in the evolution  of social media. And so if you're if the software, the technology  that you introduce or create is monolithic and doesn't allow for there to be  observers and curators and creators and subscribers and favoriters  and whatever the different sort of mechanisms are that people use to engage,  then your medium is very likely to to fail or to take  an extremely long time to actually take off.  And so, you know, you mentioned television and you mentioned,  well, I guess sort of sort of radio fits into that.  These are very like one way sort of broadcast mediums are very cheap  to sort of like produce once the infrastructure is there.  But it's very hard to replicate that infrastructure.  So on the flip side, blogging is very cheap to reproduce.  It's very cheap for lots of people to actually participate in,  whether from a readership perspective or from a publishing perspective.  And then there are the people, you know, which we've seen through Wikipedia  that show up and just want to sort of improve things.  They may not want to sort of be creating their own content  or writing their own stuff, but they'll notice every typo that you make or,  you know, we need them to do that. Yeah, that's my point.  So I think what Twitter did was they created these different roles  almost accidentally.  Again, like back with Nate Ritter, there was no retweet back then.  All of us that retweeted would type R.T.  the username and then the original post.  It was all manual.  And eventually Twitter was like, OK, that's interesting.  But it kind of like, you know, screws up your feed  when everyone's writing the same content because they're retweeting  somebodies witticism or something like that.  And so they adopted that.  And I said, you know, this is a behavior that seems like it could be useful  and valuable. And so we're going to create a new role,  which is the retweeter.  And there you go. Yeah, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think one of the keys here is true of all entrepreneurship,  is when you build something and don't know what it is  and you are able to hear well enough when your public tells you what it is.  And that was true of both for Ev Williams.  It was true of both blogger and Twitter, where, you know,  he knew there was something there and Lord knows, you know,  kept blogger alive by the dint of his determination.  But it took a while before you knew, oh, man, this really is something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's true for hashtags, too.  When you know, when I put those out there in the beginning,  you know, I was mostly like ridiculed.  People thought they were kind of stupid and like so nerdy that that, you know,  no one would ever use those only Christmas scene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would ever one hashtags.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I kind of believe that.  And I was like, that seems probably true.  But I'm going to do it anyways, because.  So you were the first person to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Wow. Thank you, Chris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, Chris, I want to ask you, by the way, it's it's we thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for the dick bar as well, because without hashtags.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I were getting paid by Twitter for all the hashtags  that they're getting sponsored, then you could thank me for the dick bar.  But I can't take credit for that.  But that's interesting, because I've heard of clients who I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was the first Twitter client to sort of to make a hashtag search  a clickable searchable thing?  Do you do you do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I'm pretty sure it was Tweety,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which is now the official Twitter client. Yeah. Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And so when I first saw that, because, you know, again, like  the both the success and the use and the proliferation of hashtags themselves,  first of all, were never guaranteed.  Secondly, it seemed completely crazy and outlandish that anybody  would really ever support them, even though, like, I hope that people  would understand that until Twitter supported groups in some capacity,  we needed some other way to, you know, bring ourselves together.  And once Tweety supported them, I started to see other clients do it, too.  And in fact, actually, you know what?  Maybe I'm a little mistaken.  So I think that was the first client.  But one of the first apps that actually supported hashtags  was the search engine that they acquired.  Oh, some eyes, right? Some eyes.  So some eyes saw the value in that because they're like,  oh, you search for the hashtag and now you can click it.  And that'll actually execute a new search.  So that, you know, and going all the way back, Twitter used to have a feature  when you could tweet via chat called track.  And, you know, Steve Gilmore loves the track.  I love the track. I miss the track.  Great. So it was like push notification based on that.  It was awesome.  Let's subscribe to. Yeah.  So when you did hashtags, it was a way of sort of saying,  hey, I'm interested in this thing.  So all my friends were at South by Southwest.  Let me track that content.  Then, of course, they decommissioned track and replaced it with trending topics.  And then it became very clear that hashtags would be the way to sort of game  that system.  And so it became the way that people actually form these ad hoc disposable  groups. And especially when you're in mobile, especially when you're in SMS,  you need something that doesn't require any overhead and is extremely,  you know, fast and cheap and dirty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chris, can I ask your advice?  I mean, I mentioned this on the show where the problem with for big news  of that, like the ones Andy covers, is the hashtag quickly becomes  fairly useless and finding original material.  Yeah. And it becomes discussion.  And then it becomes so gigantic, you can't even follow it.  And I suggested, made a suggestion that Leo brilliantly amended  to include another character, let's say an exclamation point at the end  of a hashtag to say, I'm actually a witness.  And yes, it'll get gamed. It'll be perfect.  But it's another signal.  Now, the first question is, does that make any damn sense?  But the second question is, if it does, how does one start to get people to  use it? How does the hashtag spread?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So then I actually I followed up on your blog post.  I left a comment sort of describing some of the other proposals  that people have had around similar things.  I think number one, the one of the reasons why the hashtag took off  is because it was solving or at the time it solved the problem, at least for me,  which was to provide additional context for what I was talking about.  So if I was at a conference and I said, oh, my God, that speaker was amazing.  My followers would be like, what the hell are you talking about?  And then I'd go back and forth and have to explain it.  If instead I was able to say, you know,  hash Web to Ocon or something like that, now you have context for at least  knowing sort of where I am, what my context is.  So that was sort of the generation of that idea.  As well, it allows people to sort of find each other in sort of a serendipitous way.  So whether it's through searching or seeing other people using the same hashtag,  you can kind of express your affinity for that idea just by using the hashtag  in in line in terms of introducing new formats or new  techniques. I think it's it's it's absolutely a challenge, but of course,  it's totally possible. But I think that the thing that I've discovered  and that I post on your blog post is that people will engage  in activities during emergency scenarios that make sense to their survival.  And they're not thinking about the journalists, they're not thinking about the newspaper,  they're not thinking about these other things when they're running around  trying to find their family.  So whatever it is that you want to have as a behavior that gets adopted  or widespread, either one needs to be practiced all the time, ducking cover,  call 911, all those things that need to be sort of grilled into the population,  because there are things that you do in such a seldom time frame  that you never know that you're going to need them, let alone should you be paying attention to them.  On the other hand, if there are activities that you engage in in your day to day life  and they just become part of, you know, this is what I do whenever I tweet,  I throw on a hashtag or whenever I tweet, I throw on a witness tag  or however you want it to be.  That could be a way of starting to help spread that information.  But it's got to start with a couple of people demonstrating that behavior,  getting some benefit from it, and then allowing other people to emulate that  in their own context or circumstances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I appreciate that advice.  I think it's important. I think you're right.  I think the main advantage is not getting journalists.  If I were in Japan with all this, I'd want to know other people who are here  so I can ask them, is there any gas station open?  You know, that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so I think, you know, I mean, I really support, like, the, you know,  the goals and the ambitions of what you're describing.  It just seems like it's a really hard thing to get people to sort of get in the mindset of doing.  It'd be impossible. Yeah, I agree. I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another thing has changed since you added hashtags, which was, you know,  at that time, the universe was small and a lot of people,  probably a large percentage of all tweeters followed you.  So you had a lot. I mean, now I think it'd have to be the company  that would introduce anything at this point.  There's just too many. The universe is too big now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think that's true.  But I think at the same time, if you if you started off in these small pools, right?  I mean, this is kind of where where  law cats came from and all sorts of Internet memes.  I mean, like Charlie Sheen didn't have two million or however many millions of followers  he had before two weeks ago.  And so it is possible, obviously, if you have your own notoriety,  you've been in many films with people,  then then you can sort of promote these things.  But I do think that Internet culture has a way of self-propagating  if there is a message or if there is a meme or if there is something that resonates.  So so I guess that's still possible.  It's entirely possible if you if you hit the right thing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if anybody if people know how to do that, please contact us because that's right.  There's a lot of money to be made.  Well, if you know, it's great.  It's so great having you on, Chris, and I appreciate it.  And a great conversation.  If you don't mind, we can take a look at some of the  hot news stories that are bubbling up.  There's quite a bit of news, actually.  I don't I almost don't know where to begin.  Perhaps we should start.  It's not exactly our our our beat,  but I think it's an important story with AT&T buying T-Mobile.  I'll tell you where it is our beat.  It is our beat, you bet, because I there's there's no Nexus S or Google  Nexus one without T-Mobile.  I don't know what they're going to do now.  And it gives as the single GSM carrier in the US, it gives AT&T extraordinarily clout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is true.  Unfortunately, I probably can't say too much about that.  I actually don't do a lot of work on Android,  not to mention the carrier stuff is extremely interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I suppose. Yeah, don't go.  Don't go there. Yeah.  Yeah. A little bit complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do think that, you know, one of the things that I thought was really interesting  also that's in the news is actually how all the sprint numbers now are enabled,  as Google Voice numbers.  So I didn't have anything to do with that.  But I think it's a pretty awesome feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is Sprint going to use Google Voice as its voicemail system?  Is that the idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd have to read into the details specifically.  But the idea, as far as I understand it, is that if you are a Sprint customer,  you now get all the great benefits and features of Google Voice,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  which is really it is pretty interesting that they announced that with the  the Nexus, the 4G Nexus S, right?  That Google Voice can't get built in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The next Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that, I mean, it really isn't an advantage to the carrier at all, right?  Because it gives you number portability.  You can you know, you can switch, you know, and you can switch phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's all the extras, right?  It's all the different features that that, you know, Sprint doesn't have to build.  Right. You know, you get visual voicemail for free, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Well, Sprint's trying to position themselves.  Their ad campaign is that they're the only ones who mean unlimited.  And at some point, if they're the smallest carrier by far, which they'll be,  you know, do they become the carrier of choice for geeks who understand this world?  They're not there now.  But these kind of steps give them a credibility that they didn't have before  that could be important for folks like us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  And, you know, I think there's there's a lot of great stuff happening  in the mobile space right now.  And, you know, I'm constantly trying to like stay abreast of like everything  that's going on.  This latest thing, I think, is just very, very interesting to watch and sort of  to imagine what it means when your phone and the services that it's tied to  provide you with all sorts of great, you know, experiences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was I mean, that's always the first thing I do with an Android phone  is I turn on Google Voice and use that as a messaging system.  I just like I like doing it better with a pure phone.  I'm glad to see that the first 4G Nexus will be the Nexus S on Sprint.  I'm not as excited about it as a CDMA phone, because it means it's not going to be  a world phone. But at least we're going to get 4G.  And at least somebody can still make and sell a pure Android phone.  So I'm happy about that.  Any other thoughts, Jeff, about the AT&T acquisition?  Thirty nine billion dollars might take as long as a year to close.  Of course, it's got to get regulatory approval.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it goes back to the Schmitternet discussion, which, by the way,  is not a joke on on Schmidt Schmidt.  No, no. And Schmitternet.  I think that especially with the FCC's proposed rules on net neutrality,  it becomes all the more troubling because it's an oligopoly and  less competition means more control there.  And same old boat, same leak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about those who say, including O'Malley, who was, I agree with you,  very unhappy about this, that it is at least as an opportunity for the FCC  to strong arm some concessions on net neutrality out of AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's hope they have the burritos to do so.  That's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because we haven't seen much evidence of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Kevin Purdy said my favorite, my favorite thing, which was he's  a T-Mobile customer as I as I am.  He said, oh, this is too bad.  I've been enjoying connectivity through obscurity for so long.  Yeah, connectivity through obscurity, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tethering free, unlimited bandwidth free, very affordable plans.  All of that's gone, although it is an opportunity.  And I'm interested to see Sprint immediately jump into the fray.  It's an opportunity for Sprint as now the really the small guy left.  And Verizon's already said, we're not going to buy Sprint to say, well, OK,  we'll take the mantle from T-Mobile as, you know, the alternative carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, how do we you know, is there a  Internet triumphalist, Twitter revolution guy that I am?  You know, shouldn't we T-Mobile customers and I am one too with my beloved  Samsung Galaxy S organize and scream and start Facebook groups to say  these are the things we demand of you, AT&T.  Yeah. Well, let's let's take the bull by the horns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. Right to the FCC.  This thing's going to take a year to close right right now to the FCC say,  you better make sure that AT&T gives you some concessions here.  And, you know, I kind of like that world where you've got Verizon and Google  saying, no, no, net neutrality on wireless.  If there's an alternative, this could be a big win for AT&T to say, well,  we'll protect your net neutrality.  This is a big opportunity.  And AT&T is not in insensate to the regulatory issues.  The press release, you know, already started spinning.  Whoa, you know, this is good for rural customers.  Forty five million more people get 4G.  Notice, by the way, they didn't mention phone coverage at all.  I can't remember. I think it was Joshua.  I knew I could tell on Twitter this week said, you know, that press  release didn't say anything about phones. It was all about 4G data.  You know, nobody cares about the phone anymore.  It was an article in The New York Times says that in four years,  text messages will exceed phone calls as the way people use to communicate  with one another.  It's all about the data, baby.  Let's see. What else? Android app store on Amazon.  That's disappointing.  Not very many apps. Three six hundred apps.  Did you did you want crazy roundabout process to install it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  which is the thing that I really was wondering, how are you going to install it?  Right. It's not going to come through the Android market. Right. Right.  So you have to enter your phone number or your email address and you get a link  to get you click on on your phone and then you have to uncheck install.  You know, don't install apps from unknown sources.  I mean, it's it's it's quite a thing to get it installed.  And, you know, and, you know, there was the promise of free angry birds.  Right. Like, that's why that's why you did it.  Which I got it, too.  But it doesn't work if you uninstall the app store, which is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And also, angry birds won't work if I install the Amazon app store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. If you if you got the Angry Birds Rio from the Amazon app store,  then you uninstall the app store app.  And apparently I haven't tried it.  But apparently if you try to play, it'll say, hey, it looks like the app stores  uninstalled. Please reinstall to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's I guess all the free apps then,  because they say they're going to do a free app every day as the incentive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And my app, I had I had submitted it.  It got approved and I've since updated it.  So then last week I submitted my latest version, but they never approved it.  So they're selling an old version four versions ago of my app, which is so frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what happens?  So I paid for it on the marketplace.  Is do they have a mechanism for somehow carrying your existing customers over?  Or do I would I have to pay for it again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I I think you'd have to pay for it again through.  I mean, you wouldn't write because you already have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, let me see, because I have it on here.  You can see to do that text, which I love.  I use religiously. Let's go to the Amazon app store.  The other thing is it's not very pretty.  I mean, it looks like Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And honestly, you don't want to buy it because it's the wrong version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Right.  And it's going to is it going to overwrite my old version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Right. Will it override the old one?  It's a good question. It was the same APK or the same, you know.  So let's see what's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although I guess I got to check every day to see what's free today.  World Series of Poker Texas Hold'em.  Well, I'm going to get that.  Because I got my problem is I have a Nexus one which has literally no.  I mean, not literally, but almost no room for apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm running up against.  I keep deleting apps because there's no there's no room in here.  Yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I love this phone.  I'm not knocking it, but I'll probably get one of them sprint phones.  So you're on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Leo, you're going to get every phone alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. It's just me.  It's just me.  By the way, just so you know, I'm going to launch a device, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Running Android with the market.  This this this seems pretty obvious. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that Apple says, hey, we own App Store.  All right. They're suing.  Now, we were talking about this on Security Now earlier, and it's fascinating.  And Steve Gibson was talking to his patent and trademark attorney who said,  this is a great story because Apple was turned down initially for the trademark  App Store because it was descriptive.  It wasn't it wasn't a specific trademark.  Apple reapplied saying, well, it's descriptive.  It's it's become a trademark now because of us.  It describes the Apple App Store.  So in use, it has become a trademark and it was given.  They were given the trademark.  So they do have a trademark.  They're defending for the word App Store.  But I think Amazon's attorneys probably said, you know,  this might be a little bit of a shaky Apple is actually risking losing this.  Here. Interesting.  Speaking of lawsuits, Microsoft suing  Barnes and Noble over Android in the nook.  Is this the beginning of a Microsoft campaign against Android?  And Microsoft asserts that Android violates its patents.  Maybe they go after Barnes and Noble first, slowly build up some some law.  Come March and after Google, Android infringes on Microsoft's patents

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on Microsoft suing Barnes and Noble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. You follow that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you're following me here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, OK. That's just how it works.  In fact, it's not unusual to see that where you would go after a licensee first.  I don't know. Partly, you know, sometimes it's to build up a war chest.  I don't think Microsoft needs a war chest.  The other reason you might do it is to is to kind of test the waters here  and see what the courts say. Right. Right.  What are your friends?  I know, Chris, when we have a Google employee on Christmas scene, it works for Google.  He does not speak for Google.  I'll give you that disclaimer.  And you don't work in the Android division.  But do you have an opinion on this Microsoft suit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Given given where I'm sitting right now? No, no, no.  Nothing to say.  I will let the attorneys handle it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know I just had to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I will say something entirely different, though,  about something sort of related, which is about the launch of Firefox four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, we should say Chris was an early evangelist for Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. Yeah, that's right.  That's how I got my start in open source, actually. Yeah.  And, you know, it is it is actually somewhat related.  And I think it's it's going to be interesting to see what Mozilla  and Firefox are able to do with their, you know, web app store.  They've talked a lot about it.  They, I guess, have some some designs and prototypes in mind.  I'm very curious to see what their user experience will be.  Since that seems to be something that they're going to need to,  you know, up the ante in the next five or six releases that they're doing this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, of course, Chrome already has its its own Web Store.  Oops, that's not a picture of it, but that would have been had I pushed the right button.  Chrome already has its own Web Store, but they don't call it an app store.  It's just a Web Store. Right. Right.  So avoiding that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's just it's a sort of different model.  I mean, it's similar.  You know, a lot of the Chrome apps are all HTML5 apps, which I think is great.  I'm still waiting for the other shoe to drop with a lot of Apple's apps.  That may not happen now since they've got such great native support.  But, you know, I sort of wrote about this a long time ago,  saying that Steve Jobs hates the app store because, you know, the iPhone.  Yeah. Right. The iPhone.  So when the iPhone first came out and I've only heard  sort of speculation about this after the fact.  But when it first came out, of course, there were no apps.  You could install apps.  It was like lockdown.  And the best that you could do that was close to an app  was you could install a bookmark on your home screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Web apps. And Steve put a hard sell on for web apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He did. Yeah, he did. Right.  And so for me, this was like, you know, as an open web advocate, I'm like, yes,  this is amazing. This is great. Right.  Like, finally, we're going to get a web platform that can compete with with native apps.  It can be portable.  You can, you know, access these apps in your browser, yada yada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nonproprietary. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, as long as you got a browser, you know, you're in the game.  And a lot of Mac developers didn't like that story so much.  They had their tools. They knew how to build stuff.  And eventually, you know, they came out with  well, what turned into, you know, iOS with the ability to build apps, native apps  and the whole App Store thing to sort of provide them.  And that had never been done before, really, in software.  The fact that there is now, you know, the Mac desktop App Store  is also this sort of strange fluke in history.  And it's going to be very interesting to see if it's possible for others  to sort of deal with that.  So it looks like I'm actually getting kicked out of this room.  So I'm going to have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, thank you, Chris.  Sign up for this conference room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We tell you, real estate is actually at a premium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Chris, it's been great having you on Chris's open web advocate for Google.  And you can find him on the web.  He's got he's got one of them dot me pages now.  It's Chris Messina.  Who are you using for this?  Is it you or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, actually, it's a verb, the IRB dot com.  Love those guys.  And they've got this great little like web app builder behind the scenes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So where it's at off to try them, because I get all the other dot me's.  I might as well get a verb.  Thank you, Chris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Next time, game us and put things on the whiteboard  that you will think are great secrets we've seen.  All right. A blank whiteboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my God. What are they planning?  They covered up the whiteboard.  All right, guys. I'm going to get to see you later.  Miss Messina is great.  Oh, he's great to talk to Chris.  He's he's one of the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It didn't just kick out you.  They kicked out the whole audience of twig.  Little do they know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's 50,000 people in this conference room.  Oh, too late.  It's probably probably Chris to Bona did it.  So I was supposed to be on this show.  Chris was supposed to be on this show.  He gracefully stepped aside for Chris Messina.  Chris to Bona will be on next week.  No, well, he couldn't get a conference room either.  I'm sorry. Two weeks from now.  Next week. Oh, next week, another Googler, Dan Russell will be joining us.  What does Dan do for Google?  He's like a search guy, right?  Yeah. It's cool.  Search Google, search, Google, Rue.  Let's take a break since we've we've lost our panel.  Half the panel's gone.  Was it something I said?  It's your fault, Jeff.  Let's take a break and regroup.  What do you say?  Think up, think up, think up.  OK, now there was a little subliminal ad, but I'll do a real ad right now  for Fresh Books.  No, I'm sorry. Yeah, freshbooks.com.  Fresh Books is a great way if you're in a business for yourself.  And I know a lot of you are because it's the middle of the day  and you're not working.  So you must be a.  Right, right.  That's who watches this show. Yeah, you're a consultant.  You're billing by the hour.  And instead, you're watching this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, PJs in your home office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Life is good, isn't it?  But there's one little thing in your life that sucks.  I know what it is, because for years I was in the same boat.  It's printing up those invoices, going up, firing up,  open Office or Microsoft Word and doing an invoice.  Nothing worse.  In fact, it's so bad that I would never send invoices.  I'd get around to it nine months later, and that does not endear you to clients.  Let me tell you, there's a better way.  I found it in 2004 thanks to Amber MacArthur.  And I encourage you to try it.  You can actually love invoicing with freshbooks.com.  It's easy online invoicing.  Once you upload your logo,  you can quickly create an invoice.  It does all the math for you.  If you do bill by hour,  there's an iPhone app and there's a web app that'll actually,  you know, let you record your time  and then automatically just import it right into the invoice.  It couldn't be easier.  The invoices are sent by email.  Now, there's a reason why you might want to do that.  But just to reassure you, for a very affordable fee,  you can also have freshbooks print and mail, stamp and mail your invoices  so you don't have to touch it.  No more licking of envelopes.  Now, the reason I liked the email invoice,  besides the fact that it really looked good,  is there's a button on it that says pay this invoice.  And I love that because you can automatically charge your clients  credit card, set up auto billing.  They can pay it from a credit card or 11 other electronic payment services,  including PayPal.  They don't have to print a check.  They don't even have to think about it.  And according to FreshBooks own customer survey,  FreshBooks users get paid on an average of two weeks faster  because of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This may save my marriage, Leo.  Do you do invoicing?  It's horrible.  I'm not supposed to be in my wife. It's awful. I hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Horrible.  Anybody does it.  You know, don't, you know, Microsoft Excel or, you know, that's crazy.  I guess you could use Google Docs, but no, this is first.  First of all, it's free for the first three clients.  For a lot of us, including myself, that's all I ever needed.  But if you need more, it's still very affordable.  Do sign up for three clients to see how it works.  If they ask you, say you heard it on this week in Google.  That's all I would ask.  So we get a little credit for it.  And by the way, every day this month, they're having a drawing  among their new customers for a birthday cake.  So even if it's not your birthday, you could get a cake from on FreshBooks.  FreshBooks.com.  Try it for free right now.  I think you're going to like it.  And you can even give yourself a secure login page with your own name.  I just I just loved this.  I was so happy.  FreshBooks.com.  I want to go back to it.  Now I pay people to do this.  That was easy.  I'll do my own invoicing, Lisa.  It's OK.  No, no, never again.  FreshBooks.com.  All right, we have regrouped Gina and Jeff.  Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.org.  Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com.  The author of What Would Google Do?  I wish Chris were still here because it turns out the young people,  the young people want to work at the Google.  A survey by Universum, a consulting firm that helps companies improve  their attractiveness to protect prospective employees.  Apparently that's a business.  We'll make you more attractive to the kids.  Say that 25% of their survey respondents said Google is the place they wanted to work.  More than half the next company down, which was Apple, then Walt Disney,  then the U.S. Department of State.  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was interesting and heartening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess they want to take over the world one way or another.  Government service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  The FBI is on there right after Amazon.  Microsoft, CIA, NASA and Teach for America.  So actually one, two, three, four, five of the top 10 are government jobs.  That's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love the idealist in Teach for America.  And they said that the top write-in candidate, because they were shown given a  list of companies, the type write-in candidate was Facebook, which isn't surprising, right?  You want to work at the places that make the things that you love.  And young people love the Facebook, right?  So that's Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little weird that they weren't given the Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, the Facebook didn't appear.  Whoops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Left that one out by accident.  I'm sure that was an oversight.  What makes Google so desirable to young people?  Is it the free food?  The segues in every lobby?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's probably all the press about how great it is to work there.  I mean, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're exactly right.  That's all Colleen ever wanted to do.  She even told me when I hired her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know it's so great.  I'm not going to stay here.  Dad said on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She said, I'm not going to stay here.  I'm going to get a job.  As soon as I get a job with Google, it's sayonara, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, kids, you don't want to work at a big, big company.  Work at a small company.  You start something new.  You don't want to get sucked into the big corporate machine.  Make a name for yourself at a small place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although, did you see that they, who was it?  Larry Page said that he wants to make it more like it was in the early days of Google.  I presume that means more entrepreneurial.  They've always tried to do that.  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Has any big company really succeeded?  Like Microsoft splits up, splits the company right into little separate campuses, kind  of create that startup feel.  But I wonder how much you can get that genuine startup feeling at a big company.  I don't know.  When we were there for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's why Facebook stole Zuckerberg brags about how small the teams are, the  way to build things is that reason.  I think in part he's trying, you know, trying to keep it down in size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I know what that was.  That was Steven Levy's.  That was an excerpt from his new book about Google that was in Wired magazine.  I presume.  I mean, he's got a new book about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it's coming out.  I just got the galley, so I'm eager to read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stevie's.  Steven's been working on Stevie, my buddy Stevie.  He's been working on that for a long time.  My homeboy.  Yeah, my homeboy.  I love it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hasn't he been embedded at headquarters for like five years?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He what else?  What else came out of there?  Some very interesting stuff in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's in the current issue of Wired with Liemann on the cover.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I didn't I didn't put it in the rundown.  I should have.  I apologize.  Interesting, interesting story.  Uh, let's see here.  More, more news.  We got the Georgia Tech story.  Georgia.  Is this your number?  I don't want to give your number away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't have a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good.  Well, here's a number.  I won't mention the story and you now have a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got to read the story then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're giving you an update on the Google Books deal.  Remember we talked about that a lot last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Siva, Siva, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Siva Vajanathan was a regular.  His book is out.  Speaking of Google Books, his book's out too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Googleization of everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, you've got some competition out there now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we said this is going to be go back to court and it's a battle.  It's going to go on.  Well, it's back from court.  The judge has now, according to the New York Times, rejected Google's deal to digitize  books.  Tuesday, a federal judge yesterday rejected that $125 million settlement that Google had  proposed and the publishers had accepted.  They were going to create a foundation and put a pool of money in it and give it a chance  for rights holders to get some money out of it.  Now that means, I guess, Google Books is back in limbo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Back in limbo.  But the judge did it without prejudice.  So he's basically saying is improve on this in ways that I don't fully know and come back.  So I think it's a process.  It's negotiation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess he's not far wrong.  He says this deal would, and a lot of people did criticize this deal, would give Google  a quote, de facto monopoly, end quote, and the right to profit from books without permission  of the copyright owners.  A lot of people said $125 million, come on.  You know, that's not enough.  And the judge did say that a universal library would be a great benefit to mankind.  That's the argument on the other side.  But he wants a better, he said, you're right.  I think that that's what he's saying.  He wants a more fair agreement.  But after all, didn't the publishers and authors agree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's where Steve can do a far better job.  Not entirely.  I mean, he wants an opt in versus opt out.  I think that's part of the issue here is that you were presumed to be in the deal and who's  to speak for every author.  Right.  So no, I mean, all the authors didn't agree with some, you know, Steve, I'm sure wouldn't.  Right.  Though it doesn't really matter because it's really more about the orphaned authors, which  we talked about last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  That's what the pool of money, I guess, was to benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you know, in the meantime, by the way, the book business is changing yet more.  You've had the borders bankruptcy and now you have HarperCollins, my former publisher,  trying to restrict reuse of a book, of an electronic book in libraries, which I think  is pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they want a limited what?  A limited number of lending?  Lends?  Come on.  Lones.  Come on.  It's a digital copy.  It's not even a print copy.  And nobody's ever done that with print, right?  Said, oh, you can only lend that book out 12 times and you got to buy another one.  That's crazy talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  You know, Gutenberg's Bible has been around for 500 years now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm sorry.  You can't borrow that.  The too many times it's been out.  Yep.  Crazy.  So let's I have hopes that this might not be dead.  The judge seemed to, as you say, leave the door open.  Google said they were clearly disappointed by the result.  They I didn't know this, though.  They've scanned already 15 million books.  20% of copyrighted titles have been licensed from publishers.  And so those 20% are actually there in full.  The rest are snippets.  The orphan works are snippets and they wanted to put the rest of those orphan works.  That's the real problem because those orphan works in most cases are orphan  because nobody wants or cares about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  It's so frustrating, though, to think that they have that data and could show it to you,  but they're just showing snippets because of this kind of legal battle.  You know, it really would be a benefit.  Valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the people and the people who are fighting this aren't really publishers and authors.  Like we said, they made the agreement.  It's it's Microsoft and other companies who say, well, no, we want this.  We want some business.  It's not people who are looking out for the author's interests, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Right.  It's Microsoft and Amazon saying that they don't want Google to have control over this  and making money from from this information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How dare Google do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's unfortunate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I watched last night.  I watched a great movie.  Came out a couple of years ago was Oscar nominated called The Last Station about  Leo Tolstoy's last year.  And one of the things his wife was so pissed off at him because Leo Tolstoy wanted to  sign over the rights to all of his books to the Russian people and not charge royalties.  And his wife said, what?  No, you can't do that.  He did do it. He snuck around and did it right before he died.  She had a fit, at least according to the movie.  And then anyway, the court reversed it and gave it and gave it back to gave the family  back the rights.  So this battle has been going on for 150, 150 years.  Sadly, while war and peace is in the public domain now, there's there are no books in  the public domain for the last, what is it, 65, 70 years now.  How you like the new chroma icon, Gina?  Pretty, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't like it.  I don't like it either.  No, I hate it.  I hate it.  I hate it.  It looks it looks like it just got run over by a truck and kind of flattened.  And you know, those penny machines where you like put the penny in and just like smushes  it. That's kind of what it feels like.  It flattened it.  I don't get it.  I mean, I understand the rationale.  I just I like the other one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A simple look like it looked like a game.  It looked like something you know, you think you're the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looked like a Simon.  That might be the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Which I liked a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A fresh take on an icon, says Google, quote, a simpler icon embodies the chrome spirit  to make the web quicker, lighter and easier for all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that your designer voice, Leo?  Yes.  It's just an icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want pink everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is not homophobic.  That's just designer talk.  I'm a straight designer that lisps.  No worry, I would check you if it was homophobic.  I just don't understand.  I mean, that's but obviously this is a designer who said, oh, no, 3D is out.  Flat is in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, apparently flat is in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, I don't think you're alone, Gina.  I don't think anybody likes this.  Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Somebody in our chat room, C.  Lindhartsson says, I kind of like it a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I kind of like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know why you change an icon.  But why you make a big deal of it and why you publish that?  Well, because you know what?  They know it would be a big deal.  If they if they by the way, here's a picture.  Here we are doing thanks to TechCrunch.  Here's a picture of a Simon.  It does look like that.  That's exactly what it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe that's maybe the man.  Maybe Mattel said, uh, uh, uh.  It is a little I think it's maybe a little bit old school to have like  Chrome, like 3D and have highlight, you know, specular highlights and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, now you're getting a little bit of the doubt.  Leo, now you're coming over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's three. It's it's it's so 2008.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just I feel like the new one is just like it's it's the Photoshop layer  that's missing like the other 10.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just the top layer.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chrome 11 is adding now we just got Chrome 10, but they're already they're  working on Chrome 11.  I think this is interesting.  This will be the first Chrome you can talk to.  It will have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you tried it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have tried it.  So I'm running you have to download the beta.  So I'm running the beta, which I didn't realize was running the beta.  I just I had subscribed to the beta channel a while ago and got 11.  But if you click on, uh, there's.  There's a link.  It's that HTML five rocks slideshow.  There's a speech to text page.  So if you click on the page, you tap on a button, which is the microphone.  It looks just like Android and you talk in your browser, which is what I was doing  earlier, and even though I felt silly, I was pretty impressed.  It does a pretty nice job and it's all HTML five.  No flash, no craziness.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have it on the Google page on the search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't believe they do.  That's what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want the search box to be it right?  Yeah, right.  It should be.  It should.  The browser itself should do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tell me, tell me what I'm doing next.  Google.  Then the Google would talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be cool if the Google search box, you know, detected whether or not you had  Chrome 11, uh, but yeah, it's, it's pretty, it's pretty neat.  I like it.  More than I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The address bar.  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Well, I tell you with Android, one of the things I, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it on Android.  You just press and hold that search button and you say exactly that  twit.tv and it goes right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, I think work at Homer's.  This is great.  No one in an office is actually going to talk to their computer unless they've already got  the headset on.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, can you imagine the cacophony in an open office?  Everybody's shouting at their computer.  No, I said alt dot porn.  Did I say that out loud?  Firefox four is out and, uh, so is IE nine.  So we, the browser wars are back, baby.  Chrome 10 came out a little ways ago.  Uh, Firefox four, 4.7.  Actually, I should go to the latest cause that's, let me see.  That wasn't the first day 4.7 million while IE nine only had 2.35 million.  Let me see.  Where do I find, let me see if I can find the Firefox current.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's glow dot Mozilla.org.  Oh, thank you.  It GLOW.  Go to glow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dot Mozilla.  Isn't it easier just to type it really seriously?  Isn't it?  No, not go glow to 10.4 million.  And look how fat, look at that.  That's cool.  Pretty cool.  I like this page.  What is, what is, what does this even do?  What does that do?  What does this do?  It's lights are going on when people are downloading.  Ooh.  And then there's a little, what is this at the bottom?  I don't understand.  Help me.  Am I doing something wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, click.  I guess these are just, these are downloads kind of going by.  Is this a lot?  It must be a lot of visualization.  There's a graph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a bunch of visualization.  I don't understand.  Wow.  That's cool though.  Even though I get, I have no idea what it is.  And then, and then there's a Facebook button.  I can Facebook this.  I like Mozilla Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And a Twitter party.  Twitter party.  They're having a party.  Apparently.  Whoa.  On Twitter.  The hashtag is FX4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you have to bring your own hors d'oeuvres?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's no fun.  Be part of team Firefox.  They've been very good at this.  I should have asked Chris Mazzina about this because I think he invented this whole thing.  Tweet about Firefox 4 with the hashtag.  Hash FX4 and your avatar will join.  Oh, I get it.  These are people's avatars.  Yeah.  Got it.  Oh golly.  You could be part of a giant Firefox avatar.

Transcript:  No, nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you guys downloaded it for?  Have you tried it out?  It's pretty nice.  I mean, it's much faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's what they're saying.  Which is really what they had to do, right?  Right.  Well, it was getting so bogged down by all the extensions.  So I have a feeling it's faster because none of the extensions work.  The extensions are up to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's amazing how fast it is.  I know I've got to update my extensions.  Oh, to-do list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Happy fifth birthday for Twitter.  And they have a little video.  I should find this video to celebrate.  It's their fifth birthday.  Oh, by the way, meanwhile, the New York Times is asking Twitter to help it block  paywall violators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you think that paywall is going so far?  Is it if they start it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's only in Canada.  It hasn't started.  It starts in 28, I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the opposite of the real world.  Yeah.  It started in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why would we be mean to Canadians for-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I mean everybody.  Let's just get that out of the front.  Okay.  Here's the Twitter celebration.  It's a Twitter party.  Five years old and they made a video and they put it on YouTube.  I use Twitter to learn about it and share what people-  Richard Branson.  ...to make the world a better place.  Entrepreneur.  ...interested in everything related to space.  Oh, an astronaut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But also scuba diving, piloting aircraft, anything electronics and photography.  We're interested in music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Vida bohem.  News and funny people.  I'd look for paint thinner if I were them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The best way of finding out what my guests are up to for the cover of my show is to follow them on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is exactly what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I follow Green Bay on Twitter because I always like to keep up with what they're doing.  They're my favorite band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alright, that's a win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's always good for us to know what people want and I use-  Julian Peretta.  I use Twitter as that, you know, as a way of learning what I should do.  Oh, I should do.  And they'll find more.  Scutted and buttered.  Because they're the best critics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can talk to the fans.  They can talk back to me.  Oh, nice.  Fights they want to see.  Things I'm doing wrong.  Ultimate fighting, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  Wow, Gina.  I know.  Gina never would have known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other zoos and aquariums-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? I wouldn't think UFC.  Full of surprises, Argentina.  Yeah.  So this is pretty good.  This is well done.  Back to the astronaut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the Venn diagram, pardon me, of Glee and Ultimate Fighting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, do you watch one right after the other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've had this conversation.  Glee and Ultimate Fighter are gay.  That's the two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ultimate? UFC?  Oh, really?  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A little bit, a little bit, you know?  Oh, wow.  No, I like UFC.  You've rocked my world, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had no idea.  No, I've watched UFC.  My son likes UFC.  Wait until I tell him it's gay.  He's going to really enjoy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I'm going to get email about this.  I've already gotten email about this.  I'm going to get more about it today.  I can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but this is the beauty of this.  This is the beauty of this.  It's just another thing.  It's like somebody has five fingers.  It's just another thing.  Exactly.  It no longer means it's just a thing.  New York Times paywall limit to extend beyond Google to all major search engines.  Now, this is different from what I thought.  So let's talk about the New York Times paywall.  They are going now with the Wall Street Journal.  Google link on Google News was to the full article,  which I always thought was a great loophole.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not going to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're going to allow in social links and you can go to the fronts of all the sections.  And so you can go through RSS and such.  But when you hit 20 stories, 40 things a month, it's going to put up a month.  A month.  Okay.  That's considered a frequent user, which I think is a rather sad commentary on the  newspaper business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because I mean, that's less than an article a day.  That's Monday through Friday.  I mean, I read far more than that.  I guess we all are more.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's a frequent user and then they're going to say pay up.  And they're going to the frequent users in the hopes that they keep on saying most people  will not hit it.  Well, okay, except that means most people are even less engaged with the New York Times.  So that's odd.  That's not good.  And then when you try to make people more engaged with the New York Times, your reward  for that is paying brick.  I think that they might pull it off because they are the New York Times.  People care about it.  It's the best in the country.  Yada yada.  Well, Chris started the yada yada tonight, didn't he?  But that's so Seinfeld.  It is.  By the way, a friend started a, somebody I know started a if Seinfeld had Twitter hashtag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And my contribution was I just took control of a mile of the information superhighway,  said Kramer.  If you know that episode.  Yes.  Nevermind.  Anyway.  So laughing inside.  I know it doesn't go anywhere.  All right.  Well, you can't repeat a tweet.  The danger to the industry, I think, is the Cleveland Plain dealer or the Dayton Daily  Disgrace will think, oh, if they can do it, so can we.  And they can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So the policy of you get so search engines get five free clicks a day.  Right.  So for the first five articles, you get through news.google.com.  Oh, wait a minute.  No, not Google.  Now it's really confusing.  May 20th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're taking advantage of the Google freebie and stuff.  And so that is, you're right, it's set at five.  It's set at 20 a month.  Social links usually work.  But it's complex.  And then if you buy the paper in print, then you get all the online stuff for free.  But I think not the iPad app.  The iPad app is extra.  If you buy the Weekender Plain, you get online for free.  If you buy online only, you get phone apps and web, but iPad is extra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, incidentally, we talked about this in security now.  It is about the flimsiest paywall you could imagine.  It's some JavaScript code.  And if you turn on no script, you go right through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And so there have already been scripts that actually all it is is a little bit of a few  divs that put something up on top of the page and disable scrolling.  And if you take those divs out, I think it's already an application to do that.  You know, part of this is if you want to go to this much trouble, you like the times but  much.  The moral argument is then pay for it.  That's the deal now.  It's the price.  The other argument is that if you go to this much trouble, they're still getting page views  and they're getting advertising revenue and that's fine.  They're just trying to find a new revenue stream.  You know.  Which I admire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I love the New York Times.  I want to support them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree with that.  One of the great things in the story is there's some woman in Canada who tried to send them  checks all the time saying, I should pay for this.  And they had to send it back.  The question really is the Coy-Van, who is the former digital design director, is a really  talented guy at the time.  He was down at Southwest.  He wrote a very good post talking about this as an opportunity cost.  And the Times spent a year and a half.  Right.  And in other words, missed revenue.  Well, not just that.  $30 million in terms of missed opportunities to innovate and do new things.  A different thing.  How could you have invested that money in other things?  The Times started out of their lab, news.me, which is now being run by Bitly and BetaWorks.  And that's the kind of thing that might be better for them.  Similarly, Murdoch spent $30 million starting the Daily, which was just a copy of the old  model.  So that's somewhat disturbing.  Coy said it was part of the reason he left the Times is because he's an innovator.  And they were concentrating all this time on just the paywall.  I'm rooting for the Times to succeed.  We need the Times.  I like the Times.  I love the Times.  I read the Times.  I just don't know if this was the best way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say they rolled it out in Canada first.  It's coming to the rest of the world in five days.  But they rolled it out to Canada first to get rid of the bugs.  And that's good because a Canadian hacker immediately created a bookmarklet that you  could just drag to your toolbar that just turns it off.  Goes right through it.  So that's probably the easiest way.  Just drag this to your toolbar and you'll get the New York Times without that silly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah, just pay for it.  Yeah, exactly.  Just pay for it.  Just pay for it.  The Times is worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As opposed to the Daily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know a lot of people who are saying what is forcing me to do, though, is audit my Times  expense.  And, you know, my wife has said this and somebody, a news executive I was just with  today earlier, said, you know, do I really want to pay all this for the print?  And I really never really look at the print.  So maybe it's time to cancel the print and go online only.  And that hurts the Times more because the print reader is still more valuable thanks  to stupid advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Times has also asked the folks at Twitter to turn off aggregators like free NY Times,  which aggregates New York Times stories, puts the links in, I presume puts the paywall  free links in.  So that has been updated to not New York Times.  Is it now not New York Times?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, no, it does appear to be still getting updated.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is why I don't like paywalls.  I understand that people want to make money.  I certainly support that.  We try to make money.  You know, you cost money to create content and New York Times has awesome content and  a huge staff and spends a lot of money to create that content.  So they deserve to get paid.  But it becomes whack-a-mole.  As soon as you put up artificial technological restraints, geeks just go, yeah, that's  interesting.  Let's see how we can get around that.  And we've already, there's a dozen ways to get around it already.  And so what does New York Times do?  They're going to do, I'll tell you the opportunity cost.  Now they've got to spend money and time fighting against these workarounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's an unknown cost to market this and to convince people to do this and to deal  with the churn of people who leave.  They did a hell of a lot of research.  I know a lot of people who got surveys, where do you be willing to pay this?  Where do you be willing to pay that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They opted for pretty expensive.  It's not cheap.  They did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they say that's what the market says they'll pay.  Though there is a problem there as people say, oh yeah, sure, I'll pay that.  And when it comes time to take the money out of their wallet, will they really?  Well, they'll find out soon enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we should pay in Bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  What a smooth transition, Leo.  That's why you are the pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google, we've talked about Bitcoin on Security Now quite a bit.  In fact, there was a whole episode on Bitcoin.  The idea is, I'm not completely clear.  It's a new form of currency.  You earn Bitcoins by solving problems.  In other words, dedicating computer cycles to the Bitcoin engine.  There is a market in cash for Bitcoin.  Yeah, actually greenbacks, hard American currency.  There is some thinking that that's actually just a money laundering effort.  I'm not sure exactly how that works.  But Google's now announced an open source Bitcoin client.  Do you think Google wants to have its own currency?  Facebook does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure I had a drunken conversation with someone about this at South by Southwest.  And it's all coming back to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds like the kind of thing you'd have at a drunken conversation.  It's just the strangest.  So actually, it's probably a 20% project or maybe it's not even official Google.  It is in the Google code, Apache to license.  It's a Java client for Bitcoin.  They call it Bitcoin J.  Interesting.  It's not an official Google project.  It is a 20% project.  By the way, Google says they're going to donate 20% time to Japan,  which I think is really great.  Google engineers in Japan.  That is great.  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does that mean?  What are they going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going to Google allow their engineers who are currently doing 20% projects to devote  those hours to helping Japan, whether it's volunteer work or...  So did you know that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish I wish I wish I don't want me to be a smart ass about this.  I really mean it.  I wish they could put the smarts of Google around finding solutions for the damned reactor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, maybe that's one of the things they'll do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe.  Maybe.  Stranger things could happen, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not stranger than this Lady Gaga and Marissa Meyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a great video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who is Lady Gaga?  Says the Google search.  This is pretty good.  For those of you listening, we're getting a dancing search query.  A billion views of Gaga on YouTube.  That's actually an old number.  I think it's far higher than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it keeps going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, 8 million followers on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of kids lip syncing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Do you Google the lyrics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To bad romance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this done by Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this was their kind of intro video to the interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Lady Gaga was at the Googleplex and was interviewed by Marissa Meyer, who was a fashion fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What a great pairing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No kidding.  How was the interview?  I didn't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I only got to watch the first few minutes.  I thought it was really cool that Marissa seemed pretty kind of nervous,  but Gaga was very comfortable and seemed to...  She mentioned it right away that all of her friends in high school wanted to work at Google,  and she sort of acknowledged there were some great minds in the room.  And she said she didn't want to work at Google.  She wanted to be the person at the top of the search results always,  which she obviously has done.  She's got it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's a good interview.  I plan to...  I'm going to watch it later on, the full thing, the full video.  It was neat to see the two of them on stage.  Great reception there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody loves Gaga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who doesn't love...  I confess, I just downloaded...  Or what do you do when it's audio?  It's not downloading.  I added Gaga to my collection.  Nice.  So gay.  All right.  I'm just joking, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're allowed, Leo.  I have called you.  You are allowed.  I'm just joking.  Being a gay, I can transfer that power onto you.  You are allowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, okay.  Because Obertunde says I can be black.  Now you say I can be gay.  I am so happy.  You're in.  I am in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I say you can be old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's too late.  It's already happened.  Sad to say.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to come back.  I'm going to watch that video.  I want to see that video now.  That really is very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She tweeted her favorite moment from it.  I forget what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Marissa did?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Obviously, something just Marissa just wanted to do, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My favorite moment of Lady Gaga talk.  35-minute mark.  Best piece of advice.  If you don't have any shadows, you aren't standing in the light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  That's heavy.  Let me think about that for a minute.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I brought the show down, didn't I?  Sorry about that, Leo.  Go to commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  You're not standing.  How far into the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  35 minutes.  35-minute mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  You watch.  I'll do an ad and we'll come back.  Then we're going to get our tool tip and number of the week.  Jeff, you can look.  But I left one for you.  I'll take this as a gift.  Time to mention our friends at Citrix.  I'll give you a number.  How much do you think it costs on the average business trip?  According to American Express, $1,000.  Many of us work with people around the country.  Around the world.  Those traveling expenses are not only expensive, it's time consuming.  Nobody wants to do it.  That's why I recommend and use GoToMeeting.  We got to go to meeting coming up right after the show with one of our suppliers.  It's just so wonderful to be able to meet with clients and colleagues on the internet.  GoToMeeting makes it so easy.  You can try it right now for free for 30 days.  Go to gotomeeting.com slash twig.  30 days free.  It'll give you an idea of what you can do with it.  Now one of the things I really like about GoToMeeting is that your clients,  your colleagues don't have to jump through hoops to have a meeting with you.  So you install it on your system.  It'll integrate with your email program.  You send out an invitation.  All of a sudden they've got the invitation.  They know what time.  It includes teleconferencing, VoIP or regular phone.  They've got a great iPad app so they can even meet with you on an iPad, which is fantastic.  30 seconds they'll install the software even if they don't have it already and then you're ready  to meet.  I just use it for all the voice conferences because if I want to fire up a screenshot,  I can or they can show me something.  It goes both ways.  Go to meeting.com slash twig.  I've been using it for years.  I want you to try it now free for the next 30 days.  I think you'll like it.  GoToMeeting.com slash twig.  Gina Tripani, your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Quick tip this week.  Google search getting a little smarter, making educated guesses about what the release date  is for movies and video games.  So like if you Google sucker punch release date, it'll say at the top of the results,  best guess for sucker punch release date is March 25th, just later on this week.  And it will cite what the sources are.  So it seems to only work for movies and video games, but it'd be interesting to see  if this kind of thing work for things like TV shows and other things as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really neat.  Again, trying to make you give you the information you're actually looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, without making you travel off to another site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Yep.  Very clever.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, thanks to you, Leo.  We can do Georgia Tech gets $1 million to build a benchmark for the open internet to see how open  it really is.  And all the more interesting since you know, the Google Verizon deal, does the internet  include the wired internet or does it include the mobile internet?  Right.  And what's really net neutral?  But I think having a benchmark to decide that is good.  The other thing I would like to put in a pitch for is I want to have a definition of high  speed for hotel rooms so we can go hit them over the head with our machines when they  do not work high speed in what definition?  I want a benchmark for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I have to say we need benchmarks or definitions for a lot of things, including  what the hell is 4G?  What is broadband?  I can think of a lot of things we don't have definitions for actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll give you one more number too since it's in honor of Andy and thank you for having  Andy on.  He's magnificent.  Most tweets he's done in one day, again, most of his retweets, but he's done 1,300.  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a full-time job.  Wow.  My tool of the week is a much improved Google Latitude for iOS.  They've been updating all the Google tools.  I mentioned Google search last week.  I was showing the old version, it turned out, but you get the idea.  The new Google Latitude actually has parity with Latitude on Android.  Latitude has just been lagging for a long time.  Latitude is Google's check-in service, kind of their version of Foursquare.  But it has some interesting features, one of which is automatic log in.  I use Foursquare all the time.  One of the problems with Foursquare is that you have to manually tell it to log in.  You can say if you're at a spot that you want to have automatic check-ins, here I am at  Twitter, I could say post it publicly, post it with friends, check in here.  And then can I also say, oh, I have to accept this, I can also say from now on when I get  to this place, just check me in automatically, which is kind of interesting.  So they've beefed this up and I have to wonder if this is the beginning of,  see I'm a regular by the way at my place of employment, I have to sign up on my Google account.  But this is really interesting.  I can see my other Latitude friends, I can see where they are.  If I zoom out, I can see where they are all over the world.  I actually liked this so much and I thought it was so useful, I deleted a lot of people  because I was just saying yes to everybody.  And so now these are actually people I know and I get the check-ins and I get the three  closest check-ins.  This is very much like the Android version but is now on iOS.  Do you think, I wonder if this is going to become, I by the way invited you and Jeff and Gina  to be my friends but you haven't said yes yet.  But I just wonder if they're really kind of eyeing what's happening with Foursquare and saying,  gosh, we're missing the boat on this.  Unlike a lot of the check-in services, this doesn't cross check you in at Foursquare.  It's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I still think Foursquare as a success is still small.  It's growing.  But I think it's still relatively small.  So there is an opportunity here.  Yeah, I think so.  I do think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're about to raise another round I saw somewhere online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they've got what, 4 million new users last year.  So they're growing and they've certainly changed a lot.  By the way, this integrates right into places.  That's what you're seeing here is the places entry for Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The value to Google is more signals.  I've argued this in the show before that the best signal generator from us that can then  target advertising and content is the winner.  So how can Google really push us to tell them where we are?  Carrying the phone is the best indication of all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Turn this on and yeah.  Yeah, I think this is really, really interesting.  It's actually quite useful too.  And I kind of like the auto login feature, but that's why I eliminated all the people  who I didn't know because I didn't want to automatically tell them where my house is  and things like that.  Come visit.  I'm home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Or come by.  I'm not home.  Yeah, come visit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not home is even worse, isn't it?  So if you have iOS, I've been using Latitude for a long time and I kind of polished it up  a little bit because I've got it now on Android and iOS.  I think it's an interesting alternative to say Foursquare or GoWalla or one of the other  check-in systems.  Gina Tripani is a blogger at our wonderful SmarterWear.org.  You must read this site regularly.  If you do not, you're missing out.  I'm sincere on that.  She also has a great app called ThinkUp used by movie stars and normal people everywhere  and by the White House.  So that's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That ain't bad.  Thanks, Leo.  All she needs now is Lady Gaga to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's what I need.  Seriously.  I can work that out.  I'm sure I'll work that out.  Yeah, Leo can work that out.  Leo's my he's my connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Me and Gaga, you know, we go way back.  I think why don't we let's get Lady Gaga on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, seriously.  Or Marissa Mayer, one or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm actually I'd be much more interested in Lady Gaga.  I have yet to see Marissa.  She's too.  She's too poised.  I've yet to see her slip and say she's not the Eric Schmidt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you need to watch this interview with Gaga because she was giggly and like,  I mean, really, like you could tell she was nervous and into it.  It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cute.  Thirty five in.  Huh?  What happens?  It's her line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what she likes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the line.  That's her favorite kind of line advice.  Even just for the introductions, you can tell she's she's really excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, my first question that I wanted to ask was, how are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  I don't know.  I've got two gaga's going.  Oh, my God.  It's terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've never really asked you.  And I shut up.  Where is that coming from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I wanted to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's too much Gaga.  All right.  I'll find that 35 minutes and we'll play it maybe next time.  Thank you, Jeff.  Jeff is at Buzz Machine.com and his book is What Would Google Do?  And we will talk to you next week.  We do the show live every Wednesday at 1 p.m. Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern, 4 p.m. Eastern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Highlight of our week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
