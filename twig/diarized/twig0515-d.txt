Transcript:  It's time for Twig. This week in Google, Jeff is here.  Stacy is here.  I am here with an apology.  It turns out Google's jigsaw wasn't all it's cracked up to be.  We'll also talk about why you shouldn't rely on Google Maps for all of your  navigation. There's a lot more to come.  This week at Google is coming up next.  Netcasts you love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From people you trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is Twig.  This week in Google, episode 515 recorded Wednesday, July 3rd, 2019.  A phone for every country.  It's time for Twig. This week in Google.  The show that's about nothing.  If it's not Google, Facebook, Twitter, the internet, media and more.  Stacy Higginbotham is here from a new world headquarters just south of the  Space Needle. Hello, Stacy.  Is it south?  I don't know. Where is the Space Needle from you?  I think it's west.  Can you see it?  No.  I think?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can see mountains.  Nice.  I can see the cascades and no, the Olympics and the cascades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, so the Space Needle is at least a little west of you.  It's somewhere around here.  It's either northwest, southwest or your west west.  Anyway, great to have you.  Stacy on iot.com is her website.  That's where you'll find the newsletter and of course her fabulous iot podcast.  That's the one she does with Kevin Toffle from aboutchromebooks.com.  And also with us, the Tao Knight, Leonard Tao professor for  Journalistic Innovation at the Craig Norbert School of Journalism at  the University of New York.  We'll be back in five minutes.  Is here.  Hello, Jeff Jarvis.  Hello.  Jeff is of course the blogger at buzz machine.com, the author of many great  books, including what would Google do?  That's how he got on the show in the first place.  Many moons ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I haven't let go since.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank God we haven't let go of you.  We would not let go of you.  So I interviewed a couple of weeks ago, the chief operating officer of a little  Google company called Jigsaw.  At the time struck me as a really cool thing.  And I, and I know some of the Jigsaw products, it's jigsaw.google.com.  It's one of their, is it a moonshot?  It's a, it's kind of.  No, it's a goody two shoes.  It's a goody two shoes.  It's something companies do there.  You know, how to, how does technology make the world safer?  And yeah, and I have to say, if you look at the projects that Jigsaw has done,  like project shield, we've talked about that before.  The VPN for journalists.  They've done some, you know, there's a password alert, Chrome plugin,  perspective as an API that they use machine learning to spot abuse  and harassment and online comments.  So they've done some really interesting things.  And then I read an article on motherboard.  Google's Jigsaw was supposed to save the internet behind the scenes.  It became a toxic mess.  I quickly sent a message to the producer of our show saying, did that  triangulation area yet?  And he said, yes.  I said, in a way, whew, because what I didn't want it to do is air after this  I have to have a choice.  Yeah.  Well, if it had aired after the article came out, I would have asked him if I'd,  but I didn't know when I interviewed him.  So mostly the criticism seems to be of the CEO, Jared Cohen, who I did not  interview.  He's the founder of Jigsaw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With Eric Schmidt.  He was, he's an Eric Schmidt's coauthor in a book.  He's Eric Schmidt's guy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the accuser, I have to say, now I read this now, maybe because I'm a  little biased because I was impressed with their, their COO and we had a great  conversation and I thought they're doing some really good work.  So maybe I was a little biased, but when I read this, it felt a little bit.  I don't know.  It didn't, it felt like a hit piece to be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It did a bit.  There was some, some stuff there, but, but yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, I mean, I think there's a there there.  I think the challenge is it's hard to, it's hard to show a culture of, of  disrespect or misogyny if it's not totally egregious.  And so I think what's what the issue that people are upset about here is.  That that's tough to show as this overall arching culture, amid the fact that these  guys keep getting put on pedestals and lauded for being saviors of the internet  when they're maybe not the most generous or nicest people to work with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or, and I'm not defending them.  Um, I think you're right, Stacey, but just to, just to play the other game is now,  um, these publications that used to, um, allionize everything about the internet,  find every opportunity they can to go after everything that might be at all bad  on any of the big internet companies.  So it's hard to judge these days.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wouldn't expect too much of, of, of motherboard because after all they are a  digital, they're a digital first company.  That's not like the New York times or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's exactly what I'm saying though, is that they used to be there to laud  technology and now they're saying, Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Motherboard has always been fairly skeptical.  So they have always been very consumer oriented on security, privacy, things  like net neutrality and  actually, no, I'm just, I'm just saying they haven't always lauded technology.  I think it's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, the article was by Lorenzo Franceschi Bicari and I should say just for full  disclosure that the interview was with Dan Keiserling triangulation 403 and, uh,  not knowing anything about these accusations, cause it was several weeks  ago, I didn't ask him about them.  Uh, and maybe I was too much of a cheerleader, but I thought it, well,  cause I had heard of project shield for sure.  We've even talked about it, I think on this show.  So there's, there's, I go two ways with this one.  I think on the one hand on the motherboard article, they're, they're  bait lambasting the CEO Cohen for things like going to Papua New Guinea and  joining in a ritual dance with the native tribe.  And that's one of the things Dan was saying we do, we try to understand  other cultures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what they were, what they were lambasting for was that he  protected, of a, no,  he partook of a, of a ritual that involved his body being painted black.  It's not like a college kids doing blackface.  Well, that's no, that's the problem.  Was he, was he aware of that enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that was, that was just at worst tone deaf.  The big issue was that Google was having this crisis around the  Daymor thing.  And his team apparently already was having some issues of its own around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Women engineers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  And he did not respond.  It, he did not respond to that with alacrity.  So they were like, eh, he doesn't really care.  And then he sends a tone deaf picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they also published this tweet from Cohen back from eight amazing days in  Pakistan, meeting with tribal elders.  I don't know.  Is it bad that he's wearing a turban?  I think this is exactly what you want to do.  You want to find out how, what other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He writes books about being out there in the world.  Yeah.  It's not a non story, but it's not a non non story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's what I will say.  I think there are illustrations, like the things that they're using to  illustrate the problem, not all of them.  They probably could have had an editor who was a little bit more judicious,  who questioned that a little bit more.  There are very.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Pat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would think it's powerful, but I imagine many other people would be like shrug.  So things like the comments they made to about their colleague, Yasmin  Green, um, in terms of that was bad.  That was bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If that's true, that was bad.  They said how she dressed inappropriately, but they didn't talk about any of the men,  but they talk about how she dressed or was underdressed, uh, when visiting.  I can't remember if it was a mosque or something somewhere where it had been  inappropriate.  They also report that, uh, in the, in the women's room at, uh, Jigsaw, there's a  basket with mascara and moisturizer in it, which they say is in case you cry at  work or, or maybe it's just maybe just moisturizer and mascara.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go to a bathroom and Google, they have an unbelievable array of supplies.  Mouthwash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  I'm always impressed actually.  By the, I expect them to get grilled cream.  Do all your grooming in a Google bathroom.  I'm honestly, I'm sure people do.  Yeah.  I bring it up.  I, I should point out the article.  Uh, I think that if there is a toxic culture, especially toxic culture for  women at Jigsaw, that's terrible.  They should fix that because after all Jigsaw is something that, that Google  set up to show how technology can help people.  So, uh, that is a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then I posted Cohen's letter to the staff right below.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, let me look at it.  Cause I haven't read that yet.  Breaking.  Breaking.  He's frustrated and disappointment, disappointed with his, uh, team's toxic  culture is how I hope he's not blaming them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The headline's a little weird.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A few hours after the story, here's the email, the details of the story.  They've hit me hard and I'm deeply disappointed for all of you to see our  culture characterized in this way.  We haven't always.  Passive, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We haven't always gotten everything right.  And as CEO, I take responsibility seriously.  I'm committed to ensuring we continue and improve in 2017.  Two years ago, he says Jigsaw identified a number of areas where we had room for  improvement, conducted an internal review and implemented nearly all of the  recommendations.  Um, okay.  I'm on the personal and I'm frustrated and disappointed to read about some  people's purple personal experience in our team that fell short of our commitment  to provide a positive workplace for everyone.  I'm sure there are people, ex employees of any company, including our own, who  would have a tale to tell, however, you know, lopsided it is.  Um, I, yeah.  Another form of  I think they got things to work on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no question about that.  They're saying it.  I don't, I mean, I don't  have any reason to apologize for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, I, I think apologies.  I think it's more like saying, Oh, hey, this is an issue.  How can I deal with it?  Yes.  You need to acknowledge something and move on.  But I also think it's good for, as a journalist reading this, or as anybody  who is reading something like this, I may look at Cohen and take him with a bit  more of a grain of salt and honestly, the way we treat founders in the media and  just in general in the tech press.  Good Lord.  We could probably do with more, more grains of salt because there is definitely  a, a tendency not to ask critical questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will say one thing, which is the reason we interviewed Dan Kieserling from  Jigsaw was that Google approached us.  They approached us early in June and said, we'd like to offer you our  COO for an interview.  And I said, yeah, let's set it up.  And, uh, we did.  And then interview aired or was conducted June 21st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does the story talks about them getting a whiff of the story?  What was the date of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was, I was wondering if I was just, I'm like, Oh, I think you were part of  their campaign to not be evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, cause I'm looking at the email he sent out today, as you've seen the  vice story, Dan briefed you on Dan is the guy I interviewed a week or so ago  was published.  So I feel a little manipulated that this was part of a media tour to set the  stage before this story came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really?  You talked to a PR person and you felt manipulated?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That never happens.  Well, and it's true that first of all, I have a natural aversion to PR people.  I avoid talking to them all the time, but when they are.  And so, but when they offered somebody from a, from a group within  alphabet, I thought was doing something very interesting.  I did jump at it.  Uh, and I didn't know any, this happened was probably orchestrated to happen  before the article came out.  So I had no idea there was any controversy at all.  And that's so it was a very positive interview.  So I apologize.  I feel like perhaps we were manipulated a little bit.  Um, I did, when I saw this story, I contacted the producer.  I said, if it hasn't run, do not run it.  Uh, but it already had run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, but then that's kind of odd too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I guess the best thing to do, the best thing to do, uh, if I had the  resources would be a column back and say, let's do a follow up to that's what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what you would do in that situation.  If it hadn't run, you'd say, uh, hi, let's address this.  And if they refuse to, then I would not run it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it had already run.  It had run a few weeks before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now you can.  So some things you can do a follow up.  You can try for a follow up.  You could even like, I know that if something happens in a situation like this, I  might even put an update at the end of the story, since they're so close in time.  And because I have a strong suspicion, I had been manipulated.  I might even put an update at the bottom of the story a week after this ran.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good idea.  Let's do that at least.  I put a link.  But then if you do that, here's the, if you have to follow up, I understand.  Yeah.  You have to give them a chance.  Well, in a way, this is the follow up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I should be a professor of journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You are a professor.  You're teaching me the craft because I never studied the craft.  I don't know anything about it.  So I thank you.  There's a craft.  Oh, there's a craft.  Oh, there's a craft.  Um, nobody really cares.  That's, that, uh, I just, I care because I, you know, what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think, I mean, I think that's part of being a credible  reporter and not just a show for companies and what they're after.  That's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and as Eric and our chat room points out, every, everybody who you're  interviewing is, has an agenda.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mostly just to push a book or a podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and when this happens, when stuff like this happens, I blame myself for  not doing more reporting, like whenever I've done an interview and then like,  you know, especially like a bigger interview, not like just random, um,  I'm like, dang it, if I had Googled this, like, or talk to some people  beforehand, okay, I Google everybody before I talk to them.  Oh, I did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't find any negative stuff at all.  So, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, so yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, but anyway, I think at least by doing this, uh, talking about it, uh, we've  kind of mentioned the issue and, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and there are now six, I think the latest study was six PR professionals to every

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  journalist out there and probably more judging by the amount of email I get, I  would say that's accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, we should talk about something that Google did.  Um, hold on one second.  Kevin Topol says hi.  Hi, Kevin.  Uh, okay.  Um, well, we'll get to it.  Maybe I had this horrifying Google experience.  No, let's do it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have, I don't have anything pressing on the agenda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So last month, Google on G suite changed some security features to  make things more secure.  And they, they brought this up in an email and they sent to people and they  said, Hey, we're now doing something.  I call it less secure accounts, which is really awkward phrasing.  Um, they're, they were less secure apps in your Google accounts.  So they, they introduced this because if the site does not meet their security  standards, Google is going to block anyone who's trying to sign in to use your account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is tied.  This is tied to their efforts on Gmail.  And you remember where this came from?  Yes.  Oh, go ahead.  Go ahead.  It was, it was a, uh, exploit in Google docs, uh, that came, I can't remember  if it was a malicious, uh, extension or I can't remember the exact details of  it, but Google said at that time, yeah, we're going to be, we're going to really  crack down on the kind of stuff.  So here's the page that, uh, they sent you to control access to less secure apps.  And it's in a way saying to you, look, we're going to turn some stuff off.  You should know ahead of time.  Right.  Is that what the intent of it was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, so that was the intent.  I looked at it and I said, okay.  But then starting after they rolled this out, I apparently, I have a  Gmail energy suite account and my Gmail account apparently did not know because  it has two factor authentication.  Yeah.  It was, it stopped pulling from my Gmail account, but it just told me there was an  error, but I was still getting emails.  So I was like, uh, Google, you're confused.  So I ignored it for a little while, which you should never do, but you know, this is  me, I was moving, life was crazy.  And then I dealt with it yesterday.  I was like, gosh, let's dig into this error.  What the heck is happening?  Apparently all of my email from my personal Gmail account that I sent to my  main email account was just stopped.  And so to fix it, I had to go back and run it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That G suite decided that Gmail was insecure.  One of your less secure apps, our own email product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think it was less secure.  I think something they changed made it what I had to do because it's got two  factor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It wasn't reestablished the connection using probably an app password or  something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is exactly what I had to do.  Yeah.  But figuring that out took forever.  Yeah.  Because, you know, I'm like Google's documentation is not made for humans.  I just, their original email not made for humans.  Well, no, it's very simple from the admin console homepage, you go to security

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  basic settings to see security on the homepage.  You might have to click more controls at the bottom.  Under less secure apps, go to settings for less secure apps on the left, select  an organizational unit where you want to manage access to less secure apps.  If you don't select an organizational unit, it'll apply to the entire top level  organization, et cetera, et cetera.  Disable access to less secure apps for all users recommended.  Allow users to manage access to less secure apps and force access to less  secure apps for all users not recommended.  On the bottom right, click save.  Well, that was easy.  How hard could that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was thinking more of the, Hey, by the way, this thing is going to break everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everything you've set up, you're going to have to go back through it.  Well, this reminds me a little bit of what happens at if this than that.  Remember where they changed their, their API and everything broke.  And this, I think this happens from time to time where you, if you've got, and  you see, you are smart and you do stuff.  And I bet you a lot of our audience does stuff like that, where you have one  account, go to another account and you have, you have set up systems, but they're  fragile because they rely on an ecosystem that's constantly changing, especially  with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, this is why I wrote about like API documentation and the importance of  APIs and API wars.  That's a fun topic.  Oh, what fun.  Yay.  Okay.  But that happened to me.  So if you guys have that problem and you're maybe wondering if you didn't spend  the 30 minutes to figure out what the heck was happening and why and how to fix it.  Now you sort of know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now it's time for our journalism segment, the Guardian.  Google accused of flipping the bird at New Zealand laws after a murder.  Um, apparently they, uh, broke suppression orders related to a murder  case of a British backpacker in Auckland.  The name of the defendant was suppressed, but Google sent it out in a email.  What's trending in New Zealand went out to thousands of people.  This is an example, I think exactly of what you just talked about, Stacey, even  Google has automated systems.  They don't know what the hell's going on.  Oh no.  Um, Google executives met with New Zealand's justice minister in Wellington to  discuss the, to discuss the breach and said it'll be dealt with.  She, they also talked to a prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, who is still waiting by  the way for Marianne Williamson's call.  However, when justice officials followed up with Google in March and again, last  week, the company said, ah, we're not going to change anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cause, cause you consider this it's New Zealand be not unlike China and Iran and  other places thinking you can build a wall around New Zealand and keep  information out.  And sorry, Kiwis, but you can't, this frigging sunlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, can't and, um, don't worry.  Nobody's watching.  It's everybody listens to our shows.  Poor Jeff agonizes over his lighting all the time.  Earlier, Jeff didn't get involved in the previous conversation because he was  setting up table lamps and floor lamps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  His horse was told me to do things when I was trying to do things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it doesn't matter.  Let Jeff be Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me look like crap.  And then people yell at me on Twitter.  No, can't you get a better camera?  And here's another thing.  Here's another thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Pay no attention to people yelling at Twitter on Twitter.  That is the default.  That's what Twitter is made for.  It turns out, Oh, by the way, for 500 different internet's now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Right.  And New Zealand thinks that they can block stuff out and they can think that  people aren't bright enough that they can go and go to, I don't know,  the guardian.com and find the name of the, uh, miscreant.  Right.  It's, it's, it's called an internet.  It's called living in the whole globe.  And I know that New Zealand is still tender about the horrible  crimes that happened there, but it's not the internet's fault.  And, and doing things like this is not going to fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are our own domestic.  These are our own domestic laws and we do have an expectation.  They'll be upheld.  So Google's response is disappointing.  Now we need to consider what the next steps will be for New Zealand.  It's not clear what New Zealand's options are.  Earlier this year, they announced they were exploring how it could make  Facebook and Google pay more tax on income made within the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's the other, that's the other agenda going on.  Everybody else.  The, here's the other thing we got to recognize the agendas  that people have in this.  It's not just,  admitting their agendas that they find Google and Facebook to be competitors.  And so they're, they're, they're going to government though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the government affairs manager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Talking about getting more tax revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. That's what he's interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's others, other agendas at work here.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stuff.  Yeah. It's hard.  I would say it's going to be very difficult to suppress information.  News in the, in news.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to be, it's going to be extremely difficult.  And I recognize that it's weird.  We in the U S are used to having what we call the perp walk.  Where if you are arrested, you are not guilty of anything yet.  It's the, you know, the night you're arrested, but the press is alerted.  And as you are walked from the precinct to the wagon to go to the jail,  the press is all there to take your picture.  That is shocking in Europe.  Shocking.  Well, they don't do that for every.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Profile.  Only high profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I'm saying is we believe here in an openness that says that we don't  believe in secret arrest or arrest without publication of the name,  because it's a way to protect you.  In Europe, they believe the opposite.  They believe that if you're arrested, uh, but you're not guilty yet,  then you have a right to not having your name out yet.  Um, the irony is that we're almost like going to be other way around cause  Europe having had its history,  you think that openness would be a virtue there and the U S,  um, not having had that kind of history, you think, well, let's try to let,  and we believe so strongly and innocent until proven guilty.  We think we reverse that, but we believe in free speech here and openness.  And so there are different cultures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The fundamental problem, which is that the global internet, uh,  local culture, and, uh, it's a difficult balancing act.  And it really doesn't,  the technology doesn't lend itself to saying, okay, we're going to fill it.  We're going to make sure that New Zealand isn't offended while serving cultural  norms in the rest of the world. That's almost impossible.  I don't know how you do that.  There's another case.  But neither does Google,  but at the same time I completely respect the desire for individual localities  to preserve their culture. That's of course, but that's, that's the,  but that goes back pre internet. It goes back to television.  That goes back to American hegemony and entertainment. You know,  the Hollywood and all the movies we've been putting out for the last hundred  years have clearly influenced culture all over the world.  When I was a kid and we went to Europe in the, in the mid sixties,  you couldn't get Coca-Cola. You had to get weird,  imitative drinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I was in East Germany, I call it, Kami Cola,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kami Cola, Afri-Cola. I remember having Afri-Cola,  had cinnamon in the bottom of it. And if you, and, and there,  and if you wanted to know what the baseball scores were in the United States,  you had to wait three days for the Herald Tribune to print them.  And that, so there, but the world has changed and we are now all connected.  I think that's probably for the better, but I understand, you know,  you know, one of the effects is accents are going away.  Regionalism is in the United States are going away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And nationalism is rising.  And nationalism is rising.  Because there's a fear that there's a, you know,  between the globalization and immigration,  the old powers in each country are fearing the challenge they're having.  And it's part, not just to the internet, it's also globalization, but it's,  it's both technology based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's another example, Facebook being fined in Germany for under  reporting the $2 million,  which is a pretty small fine for a company as big as Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, in all of our lives we have our.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stop it, Mark. You know, these things happen.  $2 million. It's not a big deal for,  apparently this I think has to do with Nazis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it's that's no, this is, well, yes, this is hate speech.  This is that's day gay. That's, that's,  it's too long a word even for me to say law. And there's two angles to this.  One is that they're required to report and YouTube you will see reported a huge  greater number than Facebook did. So that looks like a variance.  It looks like Facebook's scanning. But the other problem with this,  which I've talked about in the show before is that the order in which these  companies do things,  they tend to test something first against their community standards.  And if it fails their community standards, they take it down and they're done.  They move on. They're busy. They've got lots of things to have to check.  But if they then didn't go to the next test and say, well,  was this illegal and should we have reported it? In which case,  they're being asked to be the cop judge, the jury, and so on.  Well then wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're being asked to judge whether or not they should report it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The network. I'm not sure. Let me read this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was, I was not quite, it could be one more second, one more second. Right.  So the issue here is that they're told to take down things that are manifestly  illegal and, and, or obviously illegal. Let's call it.  In the case they're being asked to make two judgements, hate speech or fake news.  They're being asked to make two judgments, which is, is,  and I heard this from a Google attorney. It was really interesting. Is there one?  Yes. Is it illegal or not? The second is if it's minor illegal,  the government doesn't care if you report it because it's minor.  Illegal question is, is it obviously legal? Is it manifestly illegal?  So they also have to make a gradation judgment here, which again,  they're not a qualified to do it. This is why I'm pushing for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, Stacy, go ahead.  Let me stop both of you because I think you both got it wrong, but this is from  CNN. So maybe CNN has it wrong. I don't know. This is what they say.  The network enforcement act requires social media platforms to publish reports  every six months detailing the number of complaints of  illegal content they've received. So,  but do you know what the number of complaints is? That's a, that's a number.  Now then there's a second clause where they're required to remove hate speech and  fake news.  But what the German federal office of justice said is that Facebook's  report listed only a fraction of the complaints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me try to explain that one because the key phrase there is  illegal content. Again, you get, they got to, they didn't get a complaint.  You know, hair Schmidt didn't say, I believe this is a lawful hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Schmidt said, no, no, no, no, no, no, they're not asking Facebook to make a  determination for this particular fine. They do have the right to do that.  They're saying Facebook made it difficult for its users to find the form,  to flag illegal content.  And thus the number of complaints was lower than it should have been.  It distorted a public,  it had a distorted public image about the size of the illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's mixing two things here though. One is they have a bad UI and that's,  I think that's probably right. And that's a complaint.  Whether that results in an under reporting that is their fault is a different

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  question actually. And they're mixing.  That's what they're accusing them of. And that's what they find them for.  I should point out, yes,  there is also the requirement to remove hate speech and fake news within 24  hours of it being flagged.  And the penalties go up to $60 million.  So it strikes me that the $2 million fine does make it make sense that it's  more about though you got to make it easier to flag.  Then we'll talk about whether you're doing your job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey, I'm sorry. I wanted to finish my point before, so I want the world to know.  I wasn't interrupting Stacey in that case.  I do in other cases and I'm bad at that.  Twitter says you interrupt her all the time.  That case in that case,  I was just begging to continue a nuanced point Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I truly, I interrupt you too. Sometimes I'm just like, Oh,  I can't keep quiet. That's what we do. You're wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I just say that I encourage that people often hit me for that as well,  because the worst, in my opinion,  the worst kind of show like this is where everybody politely waits for the other  person to finish. It's really slows the pace down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So over talking is bad.  I will say sometimes, yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  sometimes you guys do over talk me a little bit,  but I'm becoming much more active about, I think it's less,  being the nice person that I am and assuming the best in people.  I think it's because y'all have this rapport that just get you going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you're fitting in the rapport now, baby.  I'm working, I'm working at it.  Baby, baby. Oh, shut up, sweetheart.  I was going to use a different word.  No, I actually, I want to split the,  split the baby and say, uh,  it's good for everybody to jump in and then not over talk.  Cause that is hard for somebody to listen to. You can't hear what's going on.  But, and then so pause if somebody has something and jumps in, but I,  I don't want people to hold back. I don't, that's not a good,  that's not a good talk show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, you were saying Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have totally forgot what I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My evil plan has worked. Anyway,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't have the coffee before this and now I'm like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and the main reason I brought it up is to just underscore this.  Now maybe it isn't that case of this cultural differences in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here's another one that I just put up on the, on the rundown.  The Polish court has came from Daphne Keller, who's a brilliant,  a legal mind about intermediate liability,  that a Polish court is forcing Facebook to keep content up.  Freedom of speech includes the ability of what not to say to be forced to speak  is not free to speech. Now we're going to get, you know,  get an argument here about well as a public square is the utility and all that.  Well, it is not yet, but they're being told to keep things up. And in this country,  you know, we have those who in,  in power in Congress and in the white house who are trying to say that Facebook  and Google should be forced to keep up certain speech at the same time they're  being told to take down other speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this problem is that there's so many stakeholders, there's, you know,  200 some countries, each one has different rules, regulations,  expectations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the problem is really honestly, it's, it's what we're bemoaning,  which is the fragmentation of the internet in some ways.  So you've got Facebook,  which is where a lot of people go to get their information and may even think of  that as the internet when in reality it's not,  or it shouldn't be. And we shouldn't, I mean, if you,  you can put up a website with any information you want, but the,  we've got to figure out how to think about,  I don't know if it's a monopoly, if it's network effects,  or how to think about  mitigating the power that platforms have to  to show people, to influence people, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But is that their role, right? Do we want them to  actively decide what we should know and not know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, no, I don't, I have a really hard time with this because the,  the crux of the matter is people do go to the platforms and trust for them to be  like the source of certain kinds of information, right?  So if you say to a restaurant, if Facebook's like, you know, I hate you,  I'm never putting your stuff on here.  Then that restaurant might be hosed because people go looking for that kind of  information on Facebook. I don't, but other people do. So I think there's,  there's both a,  the life is that we want it to be versus the life as it is.  And we have to build rules and think about the implications of life as it is.  But then we should also be trying to make life more like what we want it to be.  If we actually do want it to be this open place where anybody can find  information. And that's just tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry. Here's the case. Here's the case. I think that gets to,  gets to your points that,  and I've been talking to Claire Wardle at First Draft and others about this in  my, in my institution is go to the health of the vaccine stuff.  And the story on the rundown is this is a snippy version of this,  but Facebook is trying to figure out how to deal with anti-vax stuff.  They're trying to, how to deal with health stuff. And,  and is it their obligation to, well,  their choices they have is to down rank.  If they put up notices, does that make bad stuff more popular?  Do they kill things?  Do they actively put up contrary content from sources?  And those are their, there's their realm of choices.  And they're going to set precedents there that will get demanded in other areas  like politics and government. And so, but this is a matter of health and health.  You know, you heard me scream about health matters. So what do we think?  What do you think is the right beginning point for that discussion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think for something like health.  So think about a public good and I could screw myself thinking about this,  but just right now before I think this all the way through.  I'm just going to, I'm thinking out loud here for public good.  I think the benefits outweigh the risks of maybe  going too far in one direction.  So I think you should go too far in the direction of educating given we have  actual science at a public good at stake.  So I think things that down vote, down vote, downgrade vaccine,  anti-vaccine propaganda kind of stuff,  I think promoting things or making a really valid and forceful  insertion of, hey, here's what the CDC says, or here's what whatever government,  wherever your IP address is from, here's what your government says about this.  In the case of something else,  I don't know in like reading this Polish court thing, this was a drug.  This is really fascinating because it was a nonprofit that's advocate.  It's it's trying to prevent people from dying of drug abuse.  And they warned, I guess, about using certain drugs in hot climates is bad.  But maybe they didn't go so far as to say, don't do drugs.  Maybe they just said, hey, don't do these drugs when it's hot.  Maybe because they're realist and people were like, nope,  that violates community standards because you're advocating for drug use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In that, I think it's do you think maybe this is only a temporary problem that people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, no, this is what governments for.  This is like this is democracy in action.  I mean, we can't I mean, we have these arguments all the time, not just on platforms,  but we have them in public.  We have them like, think about your zoning laws.  Think about is it right to let somebody let a man walk down the street without a shirt on?  Can a woman walk down with this street without a shirt on in some communities?  Yes. And others know.  I mean, the problem is we're doing it in the digital world and the digital world  is accessible outside of our insular community standards.  And we're going to have to adapt to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's you know, it's about the lowest.  Well, no. Well, so so two things.  One, it's not a technology story.  It's not a technology problem. It is a human problem.  And Stacey's points are about society negotiating its norms and standards and laws  to be able to handle this. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the platform shouldn't do anything about it at all.  They should just let us work it out.  Well, they should let us leave. Right.  Oh, yeah. I mean, any vaxxers are not just on Facebook.  That's not the only place they exist. Amen.  Yeah.  Honestly, I feel like there is a little bit of a vestigial trust  of anything you see in print that I think in a generation will be gone completely.  Right. So may I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Yes.  When print came along, no one trusted print  because it was so ill managed, so uncontrolled.  All kinds of crap appeared in print, all kinds of conspiracy appeared in print.  It was less reliable than what was known then as rumor.  Right. Rumor, hearing things from your friends, people you trusted and relied upon,  was far more reliable than print.  And it shifted over time where print gained more credibility.  And right now we're trying to negotiate our our worldview  about where does expertise come from.  And we're not used to a notion of distributed expertise.  We're used to a notion of centralized expertise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. That's what I'm saying.  And I feel like that's vestigial. That will be that will wear off.  We've got that left over from.  It could take literally a century.  We might have taken Gutenberg a century.  I think we're moving a little faster than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's that's contemporary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It took way more than a century because I mean, what was it?  Fourteen something.  And then we didn't get to the Enlightenment until 17.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. 17.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it took a 30 years war or two, you know, so it could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's my issue. You can't fix stupid.  And that's not true.  Yes, you can. You can educate stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You educate. You educate people.  And yes, there are still going to be people who refuse to believe, quote,  I guess what I'm saying is you like you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't fix people who are going to post that crap,  but you can fix you can fix people who are going to read that crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. And it's not media literacy.  It's something different.  Media literacy is media centric.  It is critical to be enlightened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just yeah, it's just understanding that just because you read it  on a Facebook post doesn't make it true.  Seems to me kind of a fundamental thing.  You're not going to stop. I swear to God, I don't care what Facebook does.  You're not going to stop people from writing stupid stuff on Facebook.  It's just not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you don't have to advance it.  And you can also add for other people reading it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true. There is some culpability because Facebook  likes to advance that stuff because that stuff enhances engagement.  Both YouTube and Facebook have this problem  because people love reading this stuff and they read more of it.  And the algorithm says, oh, good, OK, we feed them more stuff like this.  And that is a problem. The algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've got well, this is quality is a very hard problem.  And full disclosure, as I raised money for my school from Facebook  to work on a project called News QA, News Quality Irrigator,  or even just for what you could identify as news sites,  which is a very small corpus, you know, 15 to 30000 sites in the U.S.  How do you how do you cope with mechanisms  to judge quality and credibility among that very small corpus,  not hard zillions of sites, but just that.  So you've got a problem of community standards varying across the globe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've got this problem of stupid, stupid posters, stupid readers.  This is we're going to be you're right.  This is not going to go away right away.  I have high hopes that a generation that grows up  Internet native will be a little smarter.  I think there's already evidence that the kids who grew up  with the Internet are smarter about what they read.  As you've said many times, it's people my age who keep posting  this stupid stuff on the Internet.  So maybe maybe there is some hope.  Did we talk last week about Twitter hiding posts?  I don't think we did.  So I think it happened the day after our show.  So what we did do is we showed the the the little snippet  from President Trump on Fox talking to Maria Bartiromo  about how Twitter that keeps my follower count artificially low.  Some sort of crazy thing.  And then Twitter, the very next day, kind of made it so.  Maybe they for tweets belonging to political figures,  verified users in accounts with more than 100000 followers.  If the tweet violates Twitter's rules and it.  And by the way, it won't be.  It's not obvious.  A team of people from across the company will decide  whether it's a matter of public interest.  If it's not, of course, they'll just take it down.  But if it is, a light gray blocks will appear before the tweet  notifying users it's in violation, but it's going to stay available  because it's part of the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think hide is the wrong verb.  No, in fact, highlight it.  I know it might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like before you see it, it's not going to click view.  This is the Twitter rules to about a base of behavior apply to this tweet.  However, Twitter has determined it may be the public's interest  for the tweet to remain available.  Click here to read it.  Now, of course, on the other hand, they will.  They say, you know, it won't be showing up in search results,  that kind of thing.  They're going to try to slow its spread down.  Nevertheless, if you're following, if you're following the president  and you see something like that in the president's tweet stream,  who's not going to click view?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me. When it happens 100 times.  Yeah, no, maybe I used to.  So I refuse to follow them.  I know you know what you got to call them in my tweet deck.  No, I said I have a column like that.  I don't bother anymore. No, I don't bother because I've heard it all.  As I said to Ari Melber, that is very subject.  OK, I hate people who repeat themselves.  I hate people who repeat themselves.  I hate people who repeat themselves. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I've heard it all.  Nevertheless, he's the most powerful person in the world.  I think it's important to know what he's saying, even if it's stupid  or rapid, repetitive.  What if he says, hey, just a word of warning.  I'm going to bomb Iran tomorrow.  I mean, you won't find that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Then we'll see that in the New York Times.  If my beat were to cover it, I would I would have to have it.  But it's not my beat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So your way to the news reports it. Yep.  But by the way, there needs to be a filter.  The news loves to report the president's tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know, but I can glance at it and say, oh, this is one of those.  Yeah. I'm like, OK, screw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  MSNBC has taken to underlining, highlighting with yellow  the part of the tweet they want you to read.  It's so long. They post something.  They highlight it. I'm saying, wait a minute, slow down.  I want to read the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But every now and then, sometimes I enjoy things like his Prince of Wales.  The W.A.L.P.S.  It's like presidents, they're just like us.  No, they're not. No, they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they're not.  Let's just all watch the parade tomorrow. We'll know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm hmm.  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually honestly,  there was an article in Vogue yesterday that says, how can you people  just pretend nothing horrible is happening on the border  and just go about your daily lives?  And I'm having a hard time. I'll be frank with you.  Yeah.  It's devastating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Having lived there and left, I'm like, oh, what do you do?  What do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I sent races a thousand dollars.  I keep sending them money.  I don't know what else to do. Right. I mean,  do you take to the streets?  I mean, like, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do I feel like a Germany, like maybe a German in Nazi Germany?  Yes, I kind of do.  And I don't I honestly don't know what to do.  And it's very distressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, one thing I would argue is this, if I may.  And I've made my  political views very clear, and I'm not going to push now,  but just full disclosure is that I'm a fan of Kamala Harris.  And and by the way, a lot of friends  become to be saying, oh, hey, you were now.  She's now she's the flavor of the month. Yeah.  But but what I say to people is I don't care who you're for.  I don't think you should wait and say, let's go.  There's one. I'll decide on that.  Now is the time in a democracy to be part of the discussion  and get out there. I tweeted about this today.  I had about a six tweet stream today saying, here's why I'm for her.  But go after your own person.  Don't wait till the end.  Get in there. Get involved. That's the Democratic.  And somebody came in and said, well, you know, on Twitter, good old Twitter  said Warren's my first choice.  But if if Harris wins, I'll be crazy about her being president.  And I'm all before her.  And somebody else came back and said the opposite.  And there was a group hug.  And that's what the discussion we need to have right now.  So part of this is just get involved.  Yeah. Push people to run for office in your in your districts and in your states.  Get involved.  And I don't mean that in the sense of, yeah, get out there and vote  and do the old things.  I mean, we need this national conversation and we need to be out there.  We can't get into a point of having  of being too tired.  It's pretty just disgusted by scourging.  It's very discouraging. Very.  They see if you do you do the journalist.  I don't politicize.  I don't write for.  Oh, no, no.  I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm I'm Elizabeth Warren fan.  100 percent.  I identify with her as a wonk.  I appreciate and respect her.  She is a Harvard professor, baby.  You could tell. I just I I like I mean, I have nothing against Kamala.  But, you know, at this moment in time, I'm like, boom, Warren.  I just feel like she is everything a woman has to be to be respected.  And, you know.  Thank you for putting in that effort in like, yeah, I'm anyway,  I'm inarticulate with like inspiration and joy and happiness  that I see a candidate that actually I feel like I really can respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a number of smart.  It's really unusual.  There are quite a number of smart, outspoken, well thought out candidates.  Maybe that's why there's a hard time.  Yeah, I love Mary Ann Williamson.  Do you think that's the last time we'll see her?  No, no, no, because everyone's so excited about her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What if people vote for this because it's novel  and we've just turned our elections into like a popularity contest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the right wing is telling people to give her money  so she makes the next debates.  Yang has already made the next two debates.  No, really? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah, Yang is the basic income guy.  But, you know, even when he says it, I want to give everybody in the country  a thousand dollars a month.  It's like, what, really?  Does that what? I know.  That's it. That's your platform. Yeah.  Everything will be better because the robots are coming.  That's about as crazy as Mary Ann Williamson, who's, by the way,  when they asked her, what's the first thing you're going to do  when you go in the White House, she said, I'm going to call  the prime minister of New Zealand and say, what, something you go girl.  What was she? She said some.  I forget. Yeah, it was crazy.  If only Saturday at Live, we're still on.  Well, did you see? Oh, did you see? Oh, you're on summer break.  I know. I saw her. No, no, no, no, no.  I saw her. Yeah. Yeah.  But it's not perfect.  I would love to see this skit. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But did you see the somebody brought up, you know, her old tweets?  They're amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, she's exactly what you'd expect a motivational guru.  What did what did McKinnon say?  She said, I'm going to have I'm going to burn sage all over the country.  Yeah.  She did. She was somebody  that I'm saying she was well spoken.  She was very good expressing her ideas.  That's that's true.  The ideas were bonkers. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, that's that's America.  We like bonkers things. We love bonkers.  Plus, we have like what is it?  The Great Awakening every every couple decades, we have some sort of weird  bonkers moment as a country.  So maybe we're maybe we're due for bonkers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do we survive? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, how do we get so far off track?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speaking of bonkers, Samsung says, oh, we finished the Galaxy Fold.  Get ready. It's about to launch.  That was a transition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is bonkers from Marianne Williamson to a Galaxy Fold.  Who's more bonkers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Samsung phone or yeah, Samsung says.  So one of the things they're going to do is so remember,  part of the problem was the number of journalists pulled the  what looked like a screen protector off the screen and broke immediately.  So Samsung is now stretching that protective film to wrap around  the entire screen and flow into the outer bezel so you can't peel it off.  There's fix number one.  Fix number two.  This is just I mean, bonkers.  It's re-engineered the hinge.  Pushing it slightly upward from the screen.  So the film, the hinge will now push the film,  stretch it when the phone opens.  This will make the film feel harder and more a natural part of the device  rather than a detachable accessory.  And it may reduce the chance of a crease developing in the middle of the screen  over time and may reduce.  And it's one thousand nine hundred eighty dollars.  Show of hands. How many of you are can't wait to buy this thing  that is clearly the worst clue you ever know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I kind of really want a folding phone.  I want them to like succeed at this somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and while we had one, but we're not going to see that one.  Yeah, we're not going there.  I have been playing and I really like with the OnePlus 7T Pro.  This just came out and.  This is the funniest thing.  So what I like about this screen is an OLED screen with no notch  and no hole punch, because then you might say, well, that's a problem,  because first of all, fingerprint.  Well, they have a very good I think.  I can never remember. Is it sonic or or I think it's ultrasonic, right?  Because it's the Samsung fingerprint reader that is optical.  So the Samsung's a little slow.  This one, watch this. This is super good.  It really works 100 percent of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What happens when your hands are cold or?  A buffed like nail filed or.  I don't know. I haven't tried it that way.  I did pass it around the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there are muscle our editorial meeting to see if other people could.  I think it works pretty well.  And then the other issue is, of course, well, where's the selfie cam?  This is my favorite favorite part.  Watch, watch the top of the screen here.  I'm going to take a picture of myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's. Oh, well, it's like those fancy TVs from the 80s.  Yes. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. There's a sealed little  I could, you know, when I first got the phone, I forgot that it did this.  I said, what's that? Is that the SIM port?  No, that's where the camera comes up.  Is it waterproof?  I don't think so.  It also doesn't have wireless charging, but it is easily  beaten any other screen I've used because it's got no it's great.  No, no notches. No, nothing. It's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So are there cases made for that?  Yes. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I've ordered one because I don't have one right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm like, oh, it's so shiny.  I know it looks so hard to hold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So slippery and glassy.  I know I'm going to break it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is the one plus eighty seven.  What is this one plus seven pro seven pro or seven pro?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't remember. It's a new one.  And very nice. Yeah.  And now they do their own version of Android.  They call one, which is a very clean, simple version of Android.  I like it a lot. So it's not, you know, Googley pure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're pretty impressive. They've stuck around.  I remember we, you know, we went I went to events with them  and, you know, we all talked about it in the beginning  and there was a there was a scarcity.  They've stuck it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I might point out it's a Chinese company.  So I don't know what the future holds for one plus, but they make.  Well, Huawei is in better shape.  Well, is it though?  Tell me. Explain this to me.  Is it though? So remember that.  And this is why you want to read the tweets.  The president after meeting with President Xi at the G20,  right before he stepped into North Korea,  apparently they had a nice lunch.  Maybe they took a selfie. I don't know.  The president said, you know what?  Huawei, go ahead.  He's going to allow US companies to sell stuff to Huawei,  which means all of a sudden, I mean, this is this is hundreds of millions,  maybe billions of dollars.  Qualcomm can sell chips to them.  Google can offer can give them Android, all this stuff.  But now today,  a senior US official told the Commerce Department's  enforcement staff this week Huawei should still be treated as blacklisted.  So this is another case of a unilateral announcement from the president that,  in fact, his own government seems to disbelieve.  And wait a minute, wasn't it a security problem, not a trade problem?  John Sonderman, deputy director of the Office of Export Enforcement  in the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, said,  all such applications by US firms to sell to Huawei should be considered  a merit flagged with language noting this party is on the entity list.  See, you didn't take them off the entity list.  Evaluate the associated license review policy under part seven seven for  presumption of denial.  So the president did say if, you know,  I mean, I guess you could parse his tweet,  which is what we've come to, as saying you can sell to Huawei as long as it's not  a it's not that security stuff problem thing.  So this is a very unclear guidance from the president.  This is not surprising.  Huawei is also willing to continue to buy products.  Huawei said we are willing to continue to buy products from American companies,  but we don't see much impact.  We're currently doing.  We'll still just focus on doing our job right.  I don't blame them.  I don't blame them.  They're going to design their own chips, their own OS.  Yeah, the person familiar with the matter said the letter was the only guidance  officials enforcement officials had received after Trump's surprise  announcement on Saturday.  A presumption of denial implies strict review and most licenses reviewed under  it are not approved.  So I guess it's kind of.  So I guess it's kind of.  It kind of matches what the president said, kind of.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're back to politics.  Why is this happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, moving right along.  I got to the fold and I mentioned the Huawei fold and then I mentioned I should.  I was going to say this anyway.  Huawei is back on maybe sort of Samsung.  The note. Are you ready for a new Galaxy Note 9?  Samsung will hold 10.  Did I say 910?  The Note 10 launch?  Will it fold or explode?  No, no folding.  One hopes no exploding.  It will.  It'll explode when you fold it.  August 7th.  Now, I have to actually tell you guys something.  That's a Wednesday.  It will be at 1 p.m.  Pacific time in Brooklyn.  I mean, our time, but it'll be in Brooklyn.  So I think what we're going to do is do Windows Weekly at our normal hour.  Go to the Samsung event at 1 p.m.  Usually Samsung's pretty quick, like they're over an hour.  What I would love you to do.  Once they got rid of their dancing numbers.  Yeah, no more Broadway shows.  I would love you guys, both of you, to join me for our coverage of the Samsung event.  We'll do that as a separate special.  Put that out and then we'll start Twig right after.  So in what day is this?  This is August 7th.  OK, just put that make a note of that as they say.  Put it on the calendar.  Save the date.  The note nine was seven hundred sixteen dollars on Amazon, a thousand dollars everywhere else.  We don't know how much the note ten will be.  We don't know much about the note ten.  Actually, one rumor said that the pen could have its own camera.  That might be. Yeah.  Look at this. Look at this invitation.  It might kind of imply that there's a camera on the pen.  I don't know. That would be cool.  Right.  Well, the another rumor said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what do you do?  You use that to shoot inside your ear?  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or check your drains.  My consoles.  The note ten could also have four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I bought one of those Lappers hop it cameras.  Those are so much fun. I have one, too.  They're so great.  I've got like a twenty nine dollar one.  Yeah, they're awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You plug them into your phone or your computer and it puts it up on the screen  and you can put it right in your ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or like we used it to check for leaks in the ceiling.  I've used it like playing with my kids.  The kids love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let's look up your nose, mommy.  Let's see your tonsils, mommy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sure these things have happened.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, Sam, I love the register.  They're so snarky.  They they're talking about a new feature of Samsung.  Samsung tears rap off Bixby marketplace.  Tens of people go wild.  One at the back whispers, Siri, what's Bixby?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess they British, don't you have to do in a British attitude?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that is definitely they are British snark.  This is Kieran McCarthy, who's in San Francisco, but he's you retain some of that  British snark, because that's snarky.  The boffins. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I.  And apparently at this August thing, they're they're talking about releasing.  Remember the fondue pot, the Samsung Bixby  thing, you know what I'm talking about, the digital speaker that looked like a fondue  pot. Oh, yeah. That's that's apparently coming out.  It looks like a kettle. Yeah. Like a witch's kettle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So the cauldron, the cauldron, the ga here it is.  The galaxy home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what it's called. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got tripod legs.  And it really very much looks like you might be brewing a potion in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or it's a blast off from the moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Turn your home into a smart home.  It's a smart things hub.  Now you're the expert, Stacey.  I mean, SmartThings is a pretty good hub, right?  It supports all the protocols.  It supports all. Yeah.  Samsung bottom Samsung bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They are linking all of their appliances and everything else into SmartThings.  Yeah. But SmartThings works with Samsung stuff, right?  It does. It's a little hard for it to.  It's not the first choice for newbies.  Like it can be kind of complex to like get things working.  But you know what?  There's not like there's a whole lot of easier options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  SmartThings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the only open choice, really, there is until Wink comes back  and says that they're actually to will.  Well, I am. Let's us know what he's doing with Wink.  He owns Wink.  His company does.  I don't know if he individually does, but his investment fund does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We had we had on Security Now.  A story Steve was talking about.  Let me see if I can find it about a Chinese made kind of a funny name camera  that isn't exactly the most private thing I've ever heard of.  Let me see if I can. Or Rebe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Are you a. Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah.  So that was that was not smart.  So this is why it's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the story?  Fill us in. Let me see if I can find it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A company called VPN Mentor discovered that they could find on the Arriba  database all of these.  They can find your password location or Vivo.  Thank you. Sorry.  Vivo or Vivo.  And they make they make like their outlet.  You can buy on Amazon for like seven bucks.  So it shares your name.  Location, Wi-Fi location or sorry, Wi-Fi address, Wi-Fi password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A redacted record from that's publicly available, by the way,  posted from the camera, including your longitude and Lattotide.  Lattotide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But also even city and state.  Yeah. So all of this is shared.  They basically left their database open.  So I look for companies, if you're super security conscious,  you don't store this if you don't need it.  So there's plenty of companies that don't store your like Wi-Fi password  and information.  But to, you know, at a minimum, you should put this behind a password.  And yeah, so that's that's the issue there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hold on. Or Vivo smart home devices.  Noam Rotem and Rand Locart discovered an open database  with two billion logs in it, user names, email addresses, passwords,  precise locations.  Or Vivo claims to have a million users,  private users, hotels and other offerings.  They contacted or Vivo June 16th.  No response after several days, they tweeted them.  No response.  And the database is still online.  It's a Chinese company in Shenzhen,  manufactures a hundred different smart home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As of July 2nd, it's it's not online anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They finally got it down. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They did as of today, July 2nd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. No, it's the third yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yesterday. So as of yesterday, it is offline.  But before then, online.  Hmm. Yeah, this is guys buy from a reputable vendor.  Yeah. Always look to see how those vendors Google their names  so you can see how they handle security issues.  And honestly, you should.  Well, we could actually talk about this.  It's we talked about it on our show, but the FTC also.  Did you see that the FTC settled with dealing over its security practices?  And I bring that up because I think we should have a baseline of security  practices, because right now it's not like most people know  how a smart home device is going to handle their information.  But they really should have a baseline set of expectations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there is there I wonder maybe we need a standard,  maybe the NSA or somebody  should set a standard, the NSA.  Well, yeah, believe it or not, the NSA actually has some very good  documents on how to secure yourself with a variety of operating systems  because their their national mission is to preserve our security,  which includes protecting us from bad guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, so there are NIST standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  NIST would be another good one, the National Institutes of Standards  and Technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the so with so with the is it a rebate?  I keep that or Vibo or Vibo or Vibo.  Thank you, Karsten, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or Vibo, or Vibo, or Vibo, or Vibo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So with this, I would say don't just buy the cheapest device,  look up the vendor, see how they respond to security things,  see if they do have standards already in place and make sure that they patch  if there are problems.  So that's one.  And then switching over to this idea of creating a standard,  the FTC this week settled a two year old  suit with D-Link.  So the makers of routers and cameras, the FTC came after them in 2017 saying,  hey, you have hard coded passwords, you have some really bad stuff in here  and you're telling people that these are safe and secure.  And originally, the FTC suit was thrown out  for not bringing enough proof.  But then they came back, I guess, with more proof.  And now they settled as part of the settlement.  The FTC is making well,  put some rules forth for D-Link, but also they will have to  for the next 10 years, I think it's once a year undergo a security audit.  And the things that they said in the settlement  could become really good precedent for, again, a baseline security standard  for connected devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So as you probably know, there's an epidemic of ransomware  sweeping Florida cities.  And in at least a couple of cases, I think Kibiskeen and Riviera Beach  and now Lake City, Florida, they paid out.  Riviera Beach paid six hundred thousand dollars in Bitcoin to the bad guys,  got their data back that day.  Lake City, Florida, four hundred sixty thousand dollars.  These are small towns, I think, you know, just tens of thousands of people.  But what's interesting is that the there's a league of Florida cities  that has an insurance program for ransomware.  So in all these cases, there's insurance.  So it doesn't cost the city all that much money.  I am very happy to say to report, though, the IT manager at Lake City, Florida,  who whose initial response to this.  I wish I could find the quote was, well, as far as we know,  nobody's data was stolen, has now been fired.  Thank you.  Because after all, if a city is forced to pay hundreds of thousand dollars  in ransomware, it's because they don't have proper security measures in place  and they don't have proper backups in place.  The Georgia court is the most recent victim of the same ransomware  as the Ryuk ransomware.  I haven't heard that happened yesterday.  I haven't heard yet.  If they if they're going to pay.  But it is it's the nasty out there.  The Georgia court system.  The Georgia Administrative Office of the Courts discovered the hack.  Saturday morning, hackers used the Ryuk ransomware,  ransomware holding several state court systems hostage.  Many court documents filed online have been inaccessible.  No word yet whether they plan to pay.  It's just a nonstop mess.  And the reason they go after we talked about yesterday on security.  Now, the reason they go after cities, there's several reasons.  One is everything.  The whole layout of the city is public knowledge.  It's on the website.  Who's who's the boss?  Who's the city manager?  Who's the controller?  Who's the so it's very easy to figure out the email  chain to send the spearfishing to send.  They don't generally have the budget to have decent IT.  And I think this reason you're seeing in Florida so many times now  is because they do have insurance, which encourages them to pay.  So it's been very lucrative.  I expect to see more of those.  Speaking of malware, the Chinese border patrol.  If you cross into the border near the Xinjiang region, which is  I think it's in the western area where the local Muslim population,  the Weeders are being repressed.  If you cross in, you will be forced to install  malware on your phone that downloads your text messages,  calendar entries and phone logs, scans the device looking for  70,000 different apps and stays on the device.  Motherboard got a copy of the malware.  And in fact, I guess this is a German newspaper, Suddeutsche Zeitung.  They send a reporter who crossed the border, had the same  malware installed on their phone.  In fact, if you want, you can download the malware from Motherboard.  So why don't you install on your phone and get back to us?  The border crossing is from Kyrgyzstan into China.  And I guess the theory is, well, what are you doing over here?  What are you doing here?  What? I think, though, it's just I'm really worried.  I'm going to be going in the fall to the Middle East, to both Israel  and Jordan and Oman and the United Arab Emirates.  I'm actually trying to figure out what my strategy is going to be,  both for going into those countries, going from Israel into Dubai  and then to top it all off coming home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just buy six burners.  I think I have to have a burner for every country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not to mention two passports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get one for the US, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, jeez. Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  Well, when I went to Israel not too long ago, instead of instead of stamps,  they put two little they just give you two little very not pasted cards,  an entry card and exit card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you have to have it when you go out so they can take it.  But then you can throw it away. Right.  Yeah. Russia. I was over there. I know nothing.  Russia does that, too.  Oh, so that there's no evidence that you were in Israel.  That's the point. Clever.  Could be a big social media summit next week at the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, oh, oh.  And then you tell the story first, then I'm going to go on Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook, Google and Twitter writes the Power Post from the Washington Post  have long struggled to back allegations in Washington.  They censor conservatives online, but  get ready because here comes the White House Social Media Summit.  They the July 11th event aims to assemble digital leaders  to discuss the opportunities and challenges of today's online environment.  But really, who they're inviting is tech's top conservative critics  in politics and media,  including PragerU.  We love PragerU, right?  Google actually has limited the reach of some of their videos  about Islam and guns, so they can't be viewed by those who have enabled  restrictive mode so schools and parents can at least keep their kids from looking at it.  That apparently is evidence, proof positive that conservatives  are being blocked on the big wide Internet.  Heritage Foundation, the Media Research Center,  Charlie Kirk, executive director of Turning Point USA.  Were you invited, Jeff?  Yeah, no, neither was I.  So some say some say that Ron Wyden said there's zero evidence social media  companies are biased against conservatives.  I think they probably are in a great majority of them run by liberals, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. I had journalism professors who were very conservative, believe it or not.  Do you think they have the entire Twitter or Facebook is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a. I mean, this is just absurd.  People, individuals have opinions and they're allowed to.  We still for now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And all the evidence I've seen so far is anecdotal.  Including President Trump saying tweaker Twitter secretly reduced his follower count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But here's the here's the rant. Here's the rant.  Yeah, it's fun for everybody who used to love technology to go after it.  Yeah, it's fun for the left to complain about the big old companies.  But the where what you play into, no kidding,  because this far right is coming after and they're going to take advantage of every bit of this.  And they're going to try to force these companies to take down things that you like,  to put up things that you hate, to go after them for the sake of going after them  because they think they're being put upon at the same time that you're screaming,  take down the fake news every time you do that.  Then the people who put up the fake news or in power  are using that as an opportunity to go after the technology companies.  And at the end, your Internet.  So where what you play into, folks beware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I don't.  This is very much a strategy, and it's been a strategy that's been talked about  for at least a decade of the I don't know if it's Republicans or if it's the far right.  But, you know, and then there's very frustrating Berkeley, California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The city wants to require people who sell cell phones in the city to warn.  Consumers about a radiation risk of carrying the phone in your pocket  or apparently your bra.  Berkeley's right to know ordinance came into effect in 2016 and the court  right to know what? Right to know nothing.  But anyway, the day that Berkeley has been enforcing this.  And of course, the CTIA,  which is the industry association for cell cell phones, has sued and lost in court.  So they sued in 2015, they sued in 2017.  In 2018, the Supreme Court said they'd send it back.  Once again, the city has won in court.  The city has the right to warn consumers about cell phone radiation,  even though as far as we know, there's no evidence.  Oh, science evidence.  Let's go for fear.  Well, let me read this to you.  You see, so the radiation warning message required by the city from phone retailers is,  quote, to assure safety, the federal government requires cell phones  meet radio frequency exposure guidelines.  So far, so good.  If you carry or use your phone in a pants or shirt pocket or tucked into a bra  when the phone is on and connected to a wireless network.  And why would you carry a phone that's off in your bra?  I ask you. You may exceed the federal guideline for exposure to RF radiation.  Refer to the instructions in your phone or user manual  for information about how to use it. Why does it specify a bra?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could put it in your jock strap.  Rest cancer. No. Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's yeah. And it's close to it's just close to your body.  So your pocket and your bra.  Well, but yeah, they should just say close to your body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be sufficient to why specify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I stick my phone sometimes in my bra.  If I'm going out jogging and I don't have any pockets in my.  Yeah, of course. That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it is these are actually somewhat mutually contradictory sentences  because the FCC does, in fact.  Require the cell phones meet the RF exposure guidelines  that they're not dangerous.  And then the very next sentence is, well, just maybe they maybe  if you carry it there to exceed the guidelines,  which I don't think there's any evidence that it does.  But anyway, I don't know.  I'm of the opinion that there is no danger.  In fact, for a while, people were saying,  oh, you're going to get brain cancer if you hold the phone.  And in fact, the rates of brain cancer have fallen in the last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mind you, this is in the state of California, where if you don't know,  folks, you go into almost any building anywhere.  There is a sign up warning you the built the building is built on property  that contains carcinogens and that you're warned  and you don't have to go in because it could kill you to be there.  And it's devalued any warning whatsoever.  Every single every building you go into is dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Every single building you go into as a prop 65 warning,  which means nobody pays any attention to the prop 65 warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like going to the Internet in the EU and having to click on on cookies.  Cookies. Yeah. Cookies.  Cookies, cancer, cookies, cancer, cookies, cancer.  OK, OK, OK, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, this is a good example, though, because I mean,  who would vote against that proposition?  California voters were presented with a proposition that said,  well, if if there's chemicals known to cause cancer in an area,  shouldn't there be a warning sign?  Well, of course there should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is the problem with the verb could. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. There's a lot of chemicals cause cancer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually sunlight causes cancer outside.  Yeah. It should tell you not to go outside because  it causes cancer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, we do a change log here.  Let's do a change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we need something. Do we have stuff for the change log?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We didn't last week.  We do. We do now, as the trumpeters have indicated.  Google has quietly launched a developer website for Fuchsia.  Oh, yes.  Sooner than you expected, you'll be able to develop its Fuchsia dot dev.  And it's it's it's a lot of white space.  OK, but here's the start here button.  Let's here we go. Code of conduct, glossary, getting started.  Everything you need to get started with Fuchsia pseudo app.  Get installed. Build essential. Got it.  Curl. Got it. Get got it. Python got it.  Unzip got it. Well, what else?  What else do I need? Oh, then you have to go and get the source code.  And download and build it.  And then boot it.  Or run it in QEMU, the emulator.  And then you can explore Fuchsia.  Apparently has a has a couple of commands you can use Fortune  to get your fortune cookie and shut down.  Fortune, help and shut down are the three commands they've documented.  Oh, and roll dice. You can roll dice.  So anyway, that's a big deal, right?  We've been talking about this new operating system from Google  for some time.  Still not clear. I'm not sure what it's for.  Is it a phone operating system? Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an everything operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought it was for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's a phone? What's a laptop? What's the it's all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's all computing everywhere, everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Pixel C, this is now you still use your Pixel C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't use it, but I have it and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I like it at night and would like it to be back.  I loved the Pixel C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I gave it away.  Oh, my Nexus 7 is what I want.  I miss that too. Mine is really good.  Oh, I miss my Nexus 7. Superannuated.  I still have it, but it's hard to keep it charged.  Remember, last week, we talked about the fact that the evidence was strong.  Google was not going to do tablets now, according to nine to five Google.  The Pixel C did not receive a July patch security patch  with other Pixel devices did.  Actually, it was Android police that noticed this.  And according to the update schedule help page,  there is no guarantee Pixel phones and tablets will get security updates  after 18 months.  And of course, the Pixel C came out in 2015, hasn't been sold in two years.  So if you have a Pixel C.  You're on secure.  You can still use it. Just be careful.  You look careful.  There is a July security patches coming out, among other things.  Actually, I'm excited because apparently the Samsung version of it  and the S10 is adding night mode to the Samsung camera.  The preliminary shots I've seen look really good,  but also an improved OK, Google detection.  That's if you have a Pixel 3, 3A or even a Pixel 2.  Who bootloader bugs in the Pixel 3 will be patched.  Better music detection.  Do you guys ever use that where it puts on the front of the phone?  Oh, yeah, I use it all the time.  I think it's so cool.  You know, there's a log of all the songs that phones heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they do.  Most of it's no, most of it's actually from a database that runs locally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the phone. Yeah, it's like a hundred thousand song database.  However, they don't say anything about whether that log  of all the things you've heard is sent back to Google.  We don't know if that's the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could have really embarrassing taste, you know.  No, it's not my fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I would just start you. It was playing in the restaurant. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Lens, if you come to San Francisco, besides wearing flowers in your hair,  you might want to bring your Google phone and your Google Lens  because West Cover, which is a San Francisco based startup,  has built a catalog of local artists and it's teaming up with Lens  so that when you point your camera at an artwork in San Francisco,  it'll recognize it and it'll tell you all about it.  Apparently, 50,000 images of unique art and design from 6,000 local brands  and independent artists are in the database.  So. Pretty cool.  Who paid for that?  Yeah, I don't know. West Cover, maybe. I don't know.  They curated it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I guess, I guess.  So here's the tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you love the chair at the Ace Hotel,  you just point Google Lens at it, it'll tell you where you can get one.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Not much use if you're not in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google has patented a foldable phone.  Patents don't always tell you  much because, you know, maybe they're just making it,  but it looks kind of like a book.  It's got a round binding. It's got  one, two, three, four, five pages.  It's a foldable smartphone with multiple pages.  So it's a book.  Yeah, it's a book, but each page is a display.  Which means you could go back and forth a little bit.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're held together by a book-like spine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The back where the spine is, that's where the battery processor and camera are.  I don't think they're going to make this, but they patented it.  That's the problem with patents.  Companies these days patent whatever they can.  The new Google Maps will have transit updates.  I really like this.  I hope this is going to be rolled out all over the world  so you'll know when the train is on its way  or even the bus, live traffic delays and so forth.  Now, this data is funny because this data is...  You know, many cities and municipalities gather this data,  but also many cities in Minnesota gather this data.  But also many cities and municipalities want to keep it to themselves  even though it's the taxpayers' data  because they've got their app they want.  And so sometimes it's hard for Google and others to get this kind of information.  In this case, they're going to use...  They're going to crowdsource it.  So if you're in Tokyo, you'll be able to see how many people are in the Shibuya station.  By the way, there's a little warning at 9.40 a.m.  The trains are usually standing remotely.  If you're going to Shibuya to Shinjuku,  I've been on that train.  That's a fun, fun little subway.  Boy, I love it.  Down in the...  In my numbers,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  related is the most crowded subway line, such Google now knows.  Oh, Google knows.  And of course, 4th of July, Independence Day is tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you search for fireworks, I want you to do this tomorrow.  I want you to do this tomorrow on your phone, on your map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can do it right now.  Can you do it right now?  You can do it right now on the computer you're looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Baby, you're a firework.  Let's do it.  I'm going to go to Google.com.  You've heard of that, right?  It's this new site where you can find stuff.  Fireworks.  That's it.  Do I have to say near me?  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anything with fireworks in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, look.  There's fireworks in the search results.  That's good.  That's fun.  I like that.  By the way, I can buy phantom fireworks, TNT fireworks right here in Petalumet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please don't.  Did you see the annual Washington demonstration of what fireworks can blow up if you do them  wrong?  No.  On my Twitter feed, I retweeted a great post from...  It just said winner from the Washington Post.  It's worth going to if you can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to your Twitter stream.  This is you, right?  Yeah.  That is the real Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, but it's...  You know, it's night mode.  You know how I hate night mode.  What are you doing with night mode on my Twitter feed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter now has night mode.  Sorry, Jeff.  I don't want night mode.  I use night mode.  Sorry, Jeff.  I like it dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's wrong with night mode?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like it like my coffee.  I hate night mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it dark.  This is like 85 years old.  What are you wearing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where is your tweet, my friend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it under retweets and tweets and replies or something?  Hold on, let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.  Tweets and replies, what's that?  I don't understand.  Oh, that's hurting me.  I don't understand how Twitter works.  Tweets and replies, here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go to Twitter search and look under my name and look for winner, that'll be Twitter.  Twitter search.  This is not going to be worth it now, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  First, I'll look for your name and then what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think my one word retweet was winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Winner, winner, chicken dinner.  Does Twitter search work like that?  If you go to advanced search.  Oh, you didn't tell me that.  You can find the word winner from the account.  The winner in local mobile would be the one who knows what's right around here.  Jeff Jarvis.  This is a 2010 tweet.  It came up with a tweet from 2010.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm excited because I am going to a 4th of July party.  I found it.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not in dark mode because Carson's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Carson.  Good work.  This video is worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  Go full screen and play the sound.  This is from the Washington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every year the government demonstrates what you shouldn't do with fireworks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do not set your friend's dress on fire.  Do not put it in your hand.  Oh my God.  Do not put it on your head.  Do not look into the firework.  This is great.  They do this more than once.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a watermelon being blown up.  It's always good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many people are going to go and try to blow up watermelon now?  Oh, come on.  Me?  Me?  I'm like, oh, that looks like awesome.  To blow up good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they take a bunch of dummies, mannequins, five firework deaths in 2018.  Five doesn't seem like that big a number.  Oh, he said his sister on fire.  He said his sister on fire.  And of course, because she's made of plastic, she's melting.  She melts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I will say two things.  One, this year, my Fourth of July party I am going to will have a hand surge in there,  which I think is awesome.  In case of any finger loss.  Just have it.  I mean, that's kind of a sucky job to have on the Fourth of July.  But okay.  And then two, when I was growing up in Houston, where we did fun things like actually tip  cows, I had a friend who decided to put a firework on his head and launch it at another  friend.  Oh Lord.  And these were people who were 16 or 17.  So never underestimate the stupidity of, I'm going to go with boys, teenage boys in particular.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm not going to complain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're right.  It doesn't end.  It's possible.  It never occurred to me to like put a firecracker, a Roman candle on my head and you know.  Jesus.  Yeah.  I'm surprised that that person's still alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, if you do go to Google.com right now, you will get a chance to play the best  baseball game ever with a featuring mustard condiments and picnic items.  And I'm now leading five runs to nothing because apparently I cannot fail.  I just hit an eight hundred and thirty three foot home run.  This is, this is how games should be that no matter how bad you are.  Oh, strike, strike.  First strike.  Now that you're watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yes.  Pickles are really bad at baseball.  We do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it a pickle?  Oh, no.  Who would have?  Oh, the curve ball got me out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry.  Curve.  Why would you eat celery on a holiday?  Oh, it's delicious.  It makes it lovely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I eat a lot of celery.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Celery got its revenge with an eight hundred forty five foot arm.  Solo Homer.  Here popcorn.  Let's see how popcorn is going to do.  Another home run.  This is like the home run Derby.  Six hundred feet.  I had a bases loaded home run when you weren't looking.  Unfortunately, corn dog or dog.  Another home run.  This is the best game ever.  This is all lefty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, lemonade.  Lemonade.  Lefty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was able to swing twice at one curve ball and hit it the second time.  Timing is important to the curve ball.  Lemonade.  Lefty.  Now here's our great paid great paid.  See, even if you hit it right to the first baseman, you get a hit.  What the what?  Green apple.  I'm sorry.  Why am I doing this?  You might ask.  I don't know, but it's mesmerizing.  Because that's the Google changelog.  How refreshing was that?  How about this?  The Pentagon has a laser.  This is according to MIT technology review.  They can identify people from a distance.  It turns out your heartbeat is unique.  It's just like your fingerprint.  So even as far as 200 feet away, this laser can identify you not from your face, but from  your heartbeat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if you're wearing a thick sweater, it won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, thank God.  It works.  It works through a jacket, but not a sweater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it works through, I think, certain types of like thicker clothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't work unless you have your phone in your pocket and it blocks it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is why you wear it in your bra, actually.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  Actually, I just read an article.  It was a little bit nerve wracking.  This is also for people who are planning to travel more and more.  We are seeing face recognition.  And it looks like face recognition is going to be coming to the airport near you soon.  American and Delta and others.  And it was an article about face recognition.  And from Wired, I opted out of face recognition at the airport.  It wasn't easy.  And this is to me, this picture is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I wonder is how do they know?  Oh, that.  Yeah, I've done that.  It's not face recognition, it's face recording.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  So when you get on the plane, Delta Airlines, you have the choice and you're told you have  the choice.  Delta says only 2% of customers opt out of face recognition.  What happens is you walk up instead of having to pull out a passport or any identification,  they match your face to an existing customs and border patrol database of visas and passports.  And he said, in the article, is it a he?  Ali Funk, I don't know.  He or she said, probably she, right?  You could just say they.  They.  Maybe a they.  I don't know what your pronoun is, Ali.  That's why I was just saying default to they.  They is good, even though it's completely ungrammatical.  So in order to get, first of all, he or she, they had to know.  Sorry, I'm just old.  You can't expect me to change a lifetime of habits in a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We can, Leo.  We can ask you to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, they said I'm going to pretend Ali is three people.  They said that first of all, you had to know that you could turn it down and then you have  to go over to the desk and then you have to say, I don't want to use that.  And then, of course, they're going to double scrutinize you, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It wasn't clear to me because if you have to go to the desk or if you can just turn  it down.  So this person had to go to the desk because they didn't know if they could opt out or  how to opt out.  So I wasn't sure if she or they just had to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know they said they said their recent experience suggests that they're incentivizing travelers  to have their face scanned and disincentivizing them to sidestep the tech by not clearly  communicating the alternative options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  But that still leaves it up in the air.  It's like if I now that I know that someone is able to do this just by saying, hey, scan  my passport, is it possible for me to go through and just be like, I'm going to opt out of  facial recognition?  Please scan my passport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, the problem is not so much that they're using face recognition, although that there  are problems associated with that.  But that are they collecting images as well and storing them in a database?  And this is a real problem because the real issue or another issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm not going to say which is real.  That is a valid question you're asking is that the database is made up of government  data that has now been shared with the airlines and nobody opted into that.  Yeah.  So your data, your and remember, this is also a database operated by the Customs and Border  Control or Border Protection Agency, which was hacked recently from one of their third  parties.  So all their biometric data.  So there's a lot of things where you're kind of like, and y'all, is this the best idea?  Is this the best way to implement something like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  I signed up for clear and they do fingerprint and or iris and I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  But that you you signed up for that.  That's totally voluntary.  That is also at the TSA security points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that's right.  So I'm going to be.  It's not boarding the plane.  No, that's right.  Anyway, OK.  Well, I think the issue really is this is going to become universal.  You're going to be everywhere you go.  You're going to be scanned except in Oakland and San Francisco.  It's illegal in San Francisco and another another municipality recently like Somerville  Master, somewhere recently.  I think Oakland did some facial recognition.  Good.  Intel's getting out of the 5G smartphone market and as a result, they are auctioning off their  massive collection of patents, eighty five hundred in all.  This seems rather final.  Yeah, that's it.  We're done.  They are so happy to get this phone thing.  It's over.  They were so happy.  It was you know what?  They were waiting.  They were watching to see what Apple and Qualcomm did.  And as soon as Apple dropped their lawsuit against Qualcomm, meaning they could use Qualcomm's  chips because they had been pressuring Intel, they said, Intel, you've got to develop 5G  radios.  Oh, as soon as Apple said they have a five year deal with Qualcomm, Intel said, we're  out of it.  We're done.  We're done.  And just in case Apple might try to come back to them, they're selling off the patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what did Intel put on Infinion way back in 2009?  Oh, they have a lot.  That's a lot of patents.  Well, no, I'm just thinking they spent money trying to get here and man, Intel just really  sucks at mobile.  Who buys them from Huawei?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, there's lots of people.  But the sad thing is, it could just well be a patent troll.  I mean, Qualcomm, some have even said Qualcomm has two businesses.  One is making chips and radios.  The other one is collecting intellectual property and suing people.  I'm not sure I agree with that, but that is certainly one point of view.  And certainly anybody who bought these patents might be buying them perhaps because they  just want to license them or perhaps because it's an opportunity to go after Apple and  everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  Apple could buy them and use them as some sort of leverage against Qualcomm in patent  negotiations or in licensing negotiations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Google in the past has done this, which is buy the patents and then say, we're not  going to, this is defensive.  We're pursuing them.  We're not going to pursue them.  Go ahead and use them.  And that I think that's right on.  That's a good strategy.  Should we declare our digital independence on the fourth and fifth hashtag social media  strike Larry Sanger blog post?  We the strikers urge the global developer community to perfect a new system of decentralized  social media.  This strike will raise show the world typo big tech corporations, governments, developers  and social media users is a massive demand for a system in which each of us individually  owns our own data.  Social media services stop backing as silos.  I agree with all this compete to create the best user experience and have a standard set  of protocols and standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love all.  I almost left a comment on this, but I decided not to be snarky.  Just saying I'll miss the five of you.  See you on the Saturday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm in man.  You're not going to see me on social media.  You pretty much don't anyway, but I don't have Facebook.  I don't have Instagram.  I have a Twitter account, but it's just more like.  Because I didn't want to delete it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's because that's where you talk to Jeff and I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have I ever tweeted you?  Yes, once.  Really?  I think so.  Must have been drawn.  Oh, it's so memorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like we've had and I know Jeff and I tweet every now and then at each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sometimes I'll see something and I'll go.  I'll retweet it or I'll say, yeah, just to show that I'm not, you know, complete curmudgeon.  Maybe some punishment for Equifax, except it's not the punishment I would like to see.  The Equifax CIO knew about the Equifax breach.  Of course, he's the chief information officer long before the public did.  Decided he was going to dump his stock and as a result avoided, I think, 17 million dollars  in losses.  No, I'm sorry, not even that much.  $117,000 in losses and gained $480,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But he wasn't the only one.  There was a CFO did the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There might be more.  I'm not saying this is the last.  Jun Ying got four months.  He's going to jail.  He got four months and he has to pay back all the money he made.  Insider trading, four months in prison, year of supervised release, $55,000 fine in order  to pay $117,000 and $117,000.  No, $117,000 and $117,000, which is a very strange fine.  I guess because he, I don't know.  Maybe that's how much he made or saved or didn't lose.  Actually, I think that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mike.  Good on that.  There are other executives did the exact same thing, so it better not just be the CIO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope they all get it, baby.  Still, I think there should be punishment for just losing that data.  Yes.  That we're not going to see.  That's the point.  That we're not going to see.  Insider trading, you can't do that in this country.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stuart went to jail for it.  She got more time than he got.  Well, if the storage was in a lot longer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How about that?  Anything else you want to talk about before I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did you think?  What is your role as a royal feathers that Microsoft is going to kill books?  Yeah, we've been talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They mean they're doing it in the best possible way.  They're paying.  First of all, not many people took advantage of Microsoft bookstore.  You used Edge, their browser.  I mean, that wasn't the best way to read a book for anybody.  However, and they've decided as of the second of yesterday, I think, to turn the server off,  which means because it's copy protected, those ebooks will no longer work.  They're refunding every penny.  Here's the bigger issue.  If you have annotations, those will be lost.  But they said they're going to pay an extra 25 bucks if you had an annotation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're a researcher, a professor, a student.  Potentially bad.  Yeah.  Is there a reason I raised it?  Would there have been a technical alternative?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Thank you.  Not for Microsoft, but for you, the user.  And it might prompt people to think about all of the content they have that's copy protected.  The TV shows, the movies, the books that they bought from various vendors.  It's copy protected.  If the vendor decides no longer to support it, those will disappear from your library.  Your library is gone.  So maybe now's the time to download those and take the copy protection out,  in which case they'll continue to work.  We had a long conversation on Twitter on Sunday about whether that was legal.  And one panelist said it was.  One said it wasn't.  It's not clear.  You're making a copy for archival purposes.  That's legal, sort of.  The DMCA says you can't reverse engineer copy protection.  That's illegal, sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's legal to make a copy, but it's illegal to break the DMCA.  You can't read it.  Yes.  You can copy it, but you can't.  Yeah, you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then from a purely pragmatic point of view, they're not going to throw you in jail for doing that,  especially if you bought the book and they turned off the server.  I think you could find a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, we talked about Twitter and Trump's tweets.  And now there is breaking news happening this morning.  Yes.  So this was only sort of breaking.  It's just in.  Oh, no.  This was just in, just updated.  The Justice Department is now looking at one of Trump's tweets and based on the fact that Trump is saying that it is fake news that the Commerce Department will stop printing the census without the citizenship question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So he can't make up his mind.  So two days ago he said, no, we're going to go forward.  He lost in the Supreme Court.  Right.  Two days ago he said, no, we're going to pursue this.  Yesterday he said, no, we're not going to.  Today he tweeted, yes, we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And now the.  And this is why you have to read the tweets.  And now they're like, okay, we're trying to figure out how to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you find me a tank to go stand in front of, please?  Yes, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there would be tanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're moving through the streets of D.C.  Go right now.  Okay.  What?  Something is happening.  Oh, I see.  Okay.  Is it time to talk about?  Yeah, we're going to do our things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But just one little question.  I think it's going to be now every president from now on will be making pronouncements on Twitter.  Yes.  Is that is that a good thing or a bad thing?  Is that the future of direct communication?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think it's I don't think it's that I don't think it's a bad thing to have a direct line of communication on Twitter.  I think most presidents, hopefully going forward after this, will be more measured in less.  Obama tweeted.  Yeah, he did.  And I but no one was ever when Obama tweeted.  You felt like Obama probably spent 20 seconds thinking about that tweet, if not a lot more time before he actually hit the button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And so I think personality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never got the impression that those were really Obama's tweets, though.  That seemed only the ones that were signed by him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. In fact, they had a protocol.  Right. Yeah.  Where you had to sign them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because they thought ahead about like, what does it mean to have a tweet that says it's from POTUS?  Is it really from POTUS?  If so, we should probably tell people that this is an actual POTUS tweet.  So they viewed it less as a they viewed it as a way to reach out to constituents or people, just the citizenry, which I don't think is a negative way to use something like Twitter or Instagram or Facebook.  I think the issue comes when you don't use it judiciously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So apparently the fake news is now making fakes of Donald Trump saying we're not going to pursue it because I saw it clearly on video.  And now he's saying, no, that's fake.  So they're going to move forward.  I can't even read his tweets because they're so offensive.  For instance, many of these illegal aliens are living far better now than where they were is so incredibly offensive to me.  I don't even know where to start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I would love for Twitter to say, you know, make the great box and then also put a fact check of the photos that we currently have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, fact check.  And by the way, they're not illegal.  They're seeking asylum, which is legal.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, things not darkness.  Yeah.

Transcript:  I say this at the end of every show.  Subscriptions doesn't make us money, but it does help us by getting more consistent downloads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Subscribe. Huh?  Yeah. Subscribe. Thank you.  Take my ad out and leave that one in.  That's good.  F and subscribe.  Stacey, do you have a pick this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I sort of do.  I know you wanted me to make boomerangs my pick, but I was going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Before the show, Stacey was talking about these frozen fake Australian pies.  They're made in Austin, Raleigh, called boomerangs, which she loves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're delicious.  And it's hard to find delicious frozen food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hand pies.  Do you micro them or do you put them in your fine June oven?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can do either or you can do a hybrid.  I just microwave them because I've got things to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the June says this is below me.  I'm a $15,000 oven.  I don't do this.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now it's oh, you guys, though, the June with the tariffs.  Yes.  They now have a $5.99 version.  But I just got an email saying as of, oh, July 1st, that because of tariff concerns, they are raising the price by $100.  So that is that is that happening in action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But which doesn't make me feel better because I paid $1500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what? I love my June so much.  I don't even care that I paid double the price that is or triple the price it is now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Such impressive cognitive dissonance.  That is really that's I think you call it maturity, don't you, Leo?  That's really impressive.  Yeah, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's nothing else I can do with it.  And it still makes me happy.  So I'm like, yeah, yeah, I think more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's an Android based toaster oven, convection oven.  And it's actually quite good.  I love it.  I pay a little too much for it, but I think it's worth 500 or 600 bucks.  Absolutely. Easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, so today's toy, I haven't put in my car yet, but one of my awesome people and he may even be listening.  Thank you, John.  That looks like a face.  It doesn't it?  It is.  It is the Android.  Upside down.  I want that.  I want it too.  And so they haven't invited me yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They didn't invite me either.  So this is the Android.  I keep saying Android.  I'm sorry.  It's the Echo Auto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They teased this a year ago.  A year ago.  So they finally it's out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So auto add, you know, who to your car?  Take you know who on the road.  It's twenty four ninety nine.  So it's not expensive.  Have you set it up yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, this is so I got it.  I actually got it on Friday and I didn't set it up yet, but I'm showing it to you now.  Next week I'll tell you how it works, but I can tell you it's going to let me play my music.  Yay.  It doesn't work with certain cars.  So if you go to the website, I'm going to put it in my Tesla.  So that's fine.  It does work on Teslas.  It does work on Teslas.  It gives me local search, local traffic, news, podcasts, podcasts.  I see two wires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So one is obviously power.  Do you then have to connect it to the aux jack on your car?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, here's my auxiliary auxiliary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But your Tesla doesn't have an aux jack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, then I just tie it into this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?  It's not Bluetooth.  Oh, but you could use a USB cable.  USB cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I get it.  USB cable.  And it's USB to micro USB.  So that's what you need to know there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will the Tesla be smart enough to recognize that that's a source of audio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're going to see.  We'll find out.  And there was something else I was going to tell you about it, but now I've forgotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you can ask for maps and if the car is smart enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It won't work.  So it doesn't work well.  It doesn't play nicely with Android Auto or with Apple CarPlay.  That's the other thing you need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, you don't really need it if you've got Android Auto, right?  Right.  Or you've got Siri or Google Assistant in there.  You don't really need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And I don't have that.  So I'm like very excited to see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's funny because Tesla, as high tech as it is, has its own, you know, entertainment  navigation system, which is fine.  I think it's fine.  I'm used to it.  But it would be nice to have a little bit better voice assistant.  It's not a very good voice assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I just constantly have questions that I'm used to just asking either Google  or Amazon in my house.  And yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Interesting.  Interesting.  You know, I don't my Tesla is going back to the company in about two weeks.  Oh, yeah.  So what do you mean?  The lease is out on the 22nd.  Nothing.  What?  You saw we had no ads.  I can't afford a car.  I'm bicycling from now on.  Scootering.  Scootering in.  We already have a Chevy Bolt, which is Chevy's all electric.  And it's quite nice.  It was a lot less expensive than a Tesla.  So I'll be driving Lisa's internal combustion car.  Ice, ice, ice car for the next year and a half till that lease runs out.  And then at some point after that, I'm going to figure out what I'm going to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was hoping Carson would also become your chauffeur with a nice cap on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He I have a cap for him.  He refused to wear it.  I don't understand.  It's because they went to Harvard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just take your Segway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to Segway in.  I do have a Segway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many miles from the office are you?  Only two.  You could Segway in.  You could Segway in.  I could walk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem is it's not an attractive walk.  There's a lot of traffic and there's no sidewalk.  It's one of those things.  Freeway between, right?  It's sad.  Yeah, it's really sad that they don't like communities don't have require sidewalks for crying out loud everywhere.  Because I would love to walk.  But I don't want to walk in traffic.  So thank you.  That's a good pick.  I'm glad to hear it's here.  You haven't gotten yours yet though, Carson.  You applied for an invite, but no word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I applied for an invite like the first day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's been so long.  I don't even remember if I did or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They still a bunch of people are getting them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do they let you know, Stacey?  Was it an email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's an email invite.  But again, it wasn't to me.  It was to one of my listeners and they got it for me.  Oh, wasn't that nice of them.  That's why I said, thanks, John.  I get it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When was the last time we had this kind of, sorry, Stacey.  Oh, that's okay.  When was the last time we had this kind of scarcity rollout?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Amazon's always done it.  They did it with the Echo.  They did it with the Look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, but it's kind of over, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they're doing it to test how people use it and also to test audience before they  make a bunch of them.  It's not a dumb idea.  I think it's a gimmick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like OnePlus, we were talking about OnePlus earlier.  That was their whole shtick in the beginning.  It's a marketing gimmick, yeah.  Right, it's a marketing gimmick.  Apple and no phones.  Amazon, get past it.  People want your thing, sell them your thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe they've got us all in a blacklist where they're not giving us it until later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, do you have a numero?  Well, kind of, because my real number this week is 15, which is the age of Coco Goff,  because I was mesmerized watching her in her second round win in Wimbledon.  She's a tennis player.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Absolutely unbelievable.  She was 15 years old, beat Venus Williams in the first round after Wildcard and then  beat Ravikrova.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was kind of neat because she grew up idolizing Venus.  Exactly.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that was cool.  I mean, really incredibly poised, incredibly graceful.  And after beating Venus, came over and said, I'm only here because of you.  Yeah.  You're my hero.  Thank you.  Isn't that great?  And she'd met Venus before because they both work in Delray, Florida, but said, I never  had the courage to say it before.  Just a sweetheart.  Smart in her play, brilliant.  And I'm not a good, you know, strategic in tennis, but even I can see how smart her play  is.  Powerful.  Just amazing to watch.  It's really exciting to watch a new star who keeps going on the rise and maybe witnessing  the next Venus and Serena or the next Roger, I'm going to say Fiedler.  The next conductor of the Boston Pops Orchestra is there.  Roger Fiedler.  Anyway.  Federer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Federer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're big Fed fans in this house.  Nice.  So anyway, it was just great.  So that's what I did.  I didn't go looking for my number, but I have one which I mentioned already, which is a  Google now knows the most crowded subway lines.  I think every subway rider will think that theirs is the most crowded subway line.  What is the most crowded?  Buenos Aires, the York Hiza line.  Doesn't have any numbers.  Sao Paulo line 11, the coral.  Buenos Aires line a Sao Paulo gets in another one line eight Paris line 13.  Buenos Aires line C Tokyo, which I think everybody would have presumed because they have the  shovels.  Yeah, they have the shovels.  They're pushing the line.  Sao Paulo again.  Line nine Tokyo again.  And then New York coming in at number 10 with the L line.  And the L line is the one that goes to Google's headquarters in New York that they all get  pissed off about.  Oh, I could have led this entire thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chelsea market, which is by the way where Jigsaw is.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Come full circle.  My my pick of the week is not a pick, but a warning.  Do not blindly follow Google Maps.  Dozens of drivers did on the way to the Denver airport.  They were rerouted through a muddy field where they got stuck.  A crash on Pena Boulevard in Denver choked off access to DIA on Sunday.  Google Maps suggested a detour.  CNN talked to one Connie Monsi.  She said, I thought maybe there's a detour.  Pulled it up on Google Maps.  It gave me a detour that was half the time.  So I took the exit down to where they told me to.  She probably missed this sign, the shotgun and fallen over sign that said road closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She said I sign felled episode for the modern age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was given confidence because there were all these about 100 other cars in front of me.  Unfortunately, a couple of the cars in front got stuck in the mud.  And since only one car at a time could pass through, everybody else was stuck behind those.  The question is, why did Google send us out there to begin with?  There was no turning back once you got out there.  She did have a four wheel drive and was able to get through.  And in fact, picked up she has a Santa Fe.  She picked up a number of people, even the passenger of an Uber that was also stuck in the mud on the way to DIA.  But was it faster?  Well, look at these people.  They're all taking pictures of themselves.  That's the best shot I ever saw.  This is just the best.  Google took us through this field.  So just a word of warning.  As Google says, use your common sense when following directions from a computer.  Nice.  Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this episode of This Week in Google.
