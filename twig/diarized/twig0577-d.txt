It's okay  So there's a lot to talk about this week a lot to talk about Google  Sent out invites for their event. It's September 30th. We'll be covering it streaming it live  They say the pixel 5 a new chromecast and a new smart speaker  Will be an  I think you can pretty much count count that it was out. It's they're done with that stuff  That's a Wednesday so it's gonna actually be perfect we'll  We'll do Windows weekly earlier because it's 11 a.m. Pacific. Normally that's when Windows weekly is so we'll do that  Earlier and then we'll do the pixel event then we'll follow it up with this week in Google so we can comment it  Launch night in get it your couch is the best seat in the house all about they even said Google no longer  Tries to be cagey at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. We know you know like someone's gonna leak this we're gonna stick it up on our product page  let's just tell them what it is in fact there was a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Teaser video of the Google smart speaker some months ago  let me see if I can find that where  They showed this thing which looks like kind of a lozenge and  So I gather it's that's an interesting descriptor sir, yeah looks like a giant  What was that gum that would squirt in your mouth? It looks like that right? Yeah. Yeah  and then so they actually last summer  Let me see if I could find the video there was a teaser video  And the guys got this speaker he's obviously a Google employee and or no  Okay, he's sitting and working at his desk and his daughter comes in says dad. What's this here? I'll show you  I think I could show you that I will I get in trouble for showing the video only with Karsten, right?  So so if you look people are dancing and hearing music, but you don't you don't  You think the speaker is it's it's so subtle and notice there's stereo pairs so that's good. Yeah  Did you get that what is this for she says dad what is this for then she's holding the speaker

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's not a big tank

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like the previous well and there were rumors that Apple's gonna announce a smaller version of the home pod as well  I think maybe people are realizing I actually love my Google home max, which is their big Google home speaker  And I think it sounds great. It sounds really good  But I think they're realizing people don't have room or don't want giant speakers  So maybe these little but can we make these little speakers sound good is the question? Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm in the market for so I'm eagerly awaiting this because I'm in the market for a speaker  because I have this huge open plan area that covers a  lot of the downstairs area and so I'm like echo studio or do I put these guys and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't know y'all. I don't know. What about your already have a price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speakers no more Sonos. That's it. It's over for me and so no more Sonos. I'm breaking on with Sonos's I actually  It's just a nightmare. They've sent me email saying could we can we help I don't want special a treatment  They they what happened is they have a new series of Sonos stuff the move some anything in the last couple of years to play  The new play five, but those are not compatible with the old play fives, which I have a lot  So I finally gave up because I was using two apps. It was two different Sonos networks. It's no good  Yeah, it's not cool. It's not cool. I took all the play fives out  I'm gonna give them to my son. He can be all play old school and I'll be new new cool  and but then I thought about it and I said I don't really need to buy any more Sonos because  The one thing that made Sonos so great was the multi-room play everything does that now?  Mm-hmm, right. I don't really need it. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was looking at a is it the play bar? Yes. I have a play bar

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have the old one and the new one and those by the way work on your network. Yeah, well we have  I'm not gonna justify my fancy lifestyle to anyone. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't know why you know the job is for the job

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's it  Actually the we do this the studio is wired with Sonos speakers  I think at one point we moved into the old studio. They gave us did they get how many they give us John a few  seven  seven play fives Oh Wow  One play three and six play fives seven play fives and one play three why did they give us one play three?  And they bought a brick and everything so they were they're obviously fans and I I'm sorry Sonos, but  Time has marched past you right IOT Stacy, right it happens  Yeah, Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So wistful

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I love so I was a fan that's too yeah  But now you could do it with oh well  Yeah, in fact, I looked at because I thought well, I also took out two of the Sonos connects. Those are old-school  That's what I would connect Sonos to my stereo, right? So I have a nice stereo. I want to use those speakers  They're better than the Sonos speakers. So you get a little box. I priced the new box. It's like three or four hundred bucks  It's like no  Gonna buy that I already have an Apple TV  I just I can that play through that I could play through the Google an echo dot all of these will play fine  And they'll do multi room sync. So I think the time it's time to move on it is good though  I we've talked about this before separate the speaker from the smarts  That's what happened with Sonos is they couldn't keep up the old old stuff didn't have enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I will say this people are like, oh you've got to separate the speaker from the smarts because speakers are expensive as  As I discovered with the hue updates, you know, you still have to buy like a $60  Right you hub for example, right and so people are it's not like people are like, oh  Yeah, I don't have to replace all my light bulbs. No, they're like, oh crap  Now I got to spend 60 bucks on a new hub just so my light bulbs work. Uh, we should mention this whole smart things

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey right now is on a hamster run internet service

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't know why it's so bad. Well, it's not so you still glow she's getting municipal

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Internet fiber in the next couple of weeks, which is kind of cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it'll be super cool. But until then  Stuck with my Barbara Walters, you know pass filter

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's more Max Hedron the Barbara Walters, but okay, we'll take

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good with with Google not necessarily talking about pixel books it our Chromebooks all together just  Going bye. Bye. I mean, I know this is your mouth out young man

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What your books are bigger than ever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Such a thought Chromebooks are bigger than average Google's just for some reason not not making them anymore. Why not?  The problem is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think they think the markets taken over or whoever was the person there, you know who loved them doesn't love them as much  I don't know my problem is that every time that one comes out and I read Kevin Toffle religiously on this  And I'll see a machine and think oh maybe and then it says fan. It says fan and I say, uh, oh you don't want to  Say I'm not doing the fan. I don't want a fan. No, I do not. Nope

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just seems like this is  Offer a device that's affordable especially with a lot of people that have to do  Education at home. That's right. I may not have a device you Google could easily put out something really inexpensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's just good enough for you know, and and you're you're you're not getting my drift here  You see I'm it's like Leo and the lifestyle. This is my lifestyle  expensive I want the expensive Chromebooks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you would only person to buy that  Expensive pixel books you and like four other people. Well, that makes it quite exclusive, sir

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I might have right. That's one way to look at it. I might have one too. I like them  I actually have owned all of Google's pixel books except the most recent the go  The one the nubbies the nubbies on the bottom  So one of the issues with Chromebooks that is being about to be solved is kind of interesting  Chromebooks really this is true of any computer have a life cycle at the end of the life. You stop getting  Updates now. I have to say if you get a Chromebook these days, it's usually an eight-year  Cycle that's not bad  I mean eight years for a Chromebook that you paid five hundred four hundred three hundred dollars for it's not bad at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there is no explain lacrosse to me. Yes, that's what we're about to talk about  That's why I put that in there. I need you to explain this. Yeah, I don't get it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  la cros  And this is a  Solution that decouples the browser from Chrome OS so Chrome OS won't get updated  But why not make sure that Chrome continues because Chrome is going to continue to get updated  Why not keep Chrome updated?  so  Google apparently is developing something that's Linux and Chrome OS lacrosse  It's an architecture project  To decouple the Chrome browser from the Chrome OS window manager and system UI the UI won't get updated  But why why can't Chrome so there's a document?  I  Gather it's kind of part of the chromium project, so it's more it. Yes, it's Googlers working on it  But it's more an open source project than it is a Google sponsored  project  La cros can be imagined they say and this will  Resonate for some Linux users as Linux Chrome with more Wayland support Wayland is the  Graphics compositor  underneath the  Windows manager  So a parent positor like a compiler no it's what it's basically  The graphics primitives the software that draws the screen  Oh  For the sorry I was for the GUI  so  So Wayland is a more modern. You know you remember X windows right? It's it's a more word  Yeah, the last thing I remember right it's a more modern X window or X org  So it's gonna support Wayland  Chrome OS has a Wayland server implementation called exosphere  It's used to run Android apps, and it's used by crostini  I wish Kevin were here because he'd probably be able to explain this better than I can get him on the horn, but  Next exosphere will be the Wayland server and so in other words it basically it's decoupling  The browser from the UI and the operating system and in every Chromebook or an old Chromebook  Well you wouldn't want to do this in every Chromebook  Probably the idea is if your Chromebook goes out of lot out of service  then  You can extend the life of it although Kevin got it Kevin writes  I don't think it's to extend the life of older Chromebooks as others have suggested. I was disagreeing with yeah  He says I'm not sure I agree with him  He says I'd like to be wrong in that believe me it doesn't make sense now since all Chromebooks get  Approximately eight years of software update support, but a lot of older a lot of older Chromebooks are almost almost gone  You know it wasn't that long for a while  It makes even less sense when you think about older Chromebooks currently out of their software support window  How would they get the required update to break out of the Chrome browser from Chrome OS?  I think it's mainly to help Google better manage work on the Chrome browser and  Get browser updates faster to Chromebooks by making the platform more modular and that certainly would be a benefit  If you don't because right now with Chrome OS you update the whole thing right Jeff  Yeah, you know to get a new browser you have to update the whole thing. Yeah, yeah, because it's so simple  It's well Kevin says that's why Chrome OS updates are lagging two or three weeks behind  Chroma updates because they they update the browser and then they have to you know get all the platform updated  So that makes sense. It's kind of what Google did with Android remember that by decoupling updates  You you make it possible to do incremental updates, so he might he might and thank you for he might know more  I  Gather this why else would you do it?  It's right. No those are two well. Let's put it this way both reasons are reasonable  Maybe they are both. Yeah, you know why they're doing it. Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so enough of that. Thank you for that. I needed that was my request like Ross well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like Ross yeah, I was I was I saw that I was like her rubber  So well, let's see do we want to talk about the new meeting stuff which sure by the way  You know what I think my issue is what Skype has been just suck and win for me  But like meet zoom all the other platforms are great, so I think part of it might just be a Skype issue Microsoft sabotaging you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In their own back. Why is it? I don't know because everybody else everybody else we work with  Look at this beautiful picture of ant Pruitt. Well, that's cuz you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pruitt if you were if you were Skype, would you mess with ant?  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dacey's right I get I get the best picture on zoom I get the next best on  Skype and I get the worst on meat oddly other people have no problem with me. I don't know why it works that way. Yeah  John

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not against it  Karsten says let's get let's do it. So we could try zoom. Well, of course, and says then that's it  Can we get an individual?  picture is the  Trikaster right that's the problem. I think no, no, no, cuz the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Skype well, actually you can cuz you could you could you can embed it in I was on I was I did a conference in  Buenos Aires this morning and  They embedded it differently. Yeah, you can do stuff with it. So zoom

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would run just like a Skype does on our machines on separate. They run on a little separate  Machines and then those are patched into the Trikaster as an input. So the Trikaster doesn't care or no  So any software could run or or for Stacy for that matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I always found it diddle to be more reliable when I was in bad circumstances and we tried it diddle

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We didn't like it diddle one. I think we yeah, we tried that once and that was not as much fun. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't I work fine for me. I just wasn't as complaining

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll we'll see when we have fiber and frankly, you know, I think I look better with my pandemic hair and  You just can't see my cool earrings, which I never wear. So me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is offering now a special meat package, but this is for business. This is expensive. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's neat and I'm in part of this is what the heck is Google doing with their hardware strategy around enterprises and  It just because they had remember their big whiteboard expensive things  and  So I'm looking at this I'm looking at and I'm like, what is what is Google doing?  So I was just curious

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They want to do, you know what Microsoft's doing with teams they want to do they want to be part of the enterprise  Yeah, so and the other thing is secure right?  That's the first word in the description this secure video meetings for teams and businesses  So that's an issue and I think it's always been a concern but not for teams. Oh  Yeah lowercase t in teams  But zoom everybody's you remember there's the security issues that now I think zooms probably solve most of those but there's still

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll stay most on the case. Yeah. Yeah, there's still a lingering

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  doubt about it  so  By the way  You can use Skype  With me, but that's another matter  There's a way to get those two together. So yeah, but this is really aimed. This is really aimed at  At a business because you have to buy a considerable amount of hardware for this  This is like you heard anything Webex conference room or something like that the Cisco conference room the people people

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're like your old polycom polycom exactly. Yeah. Yeah, right. What's the kit that the TV?  Networks are giving to home correspondence and home

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I see a lot of web but I think that's just because Cisco's paying for that, right?  Because there's a little ad on the a little bug. Yeah, you see some kind of hardware you think I remember Oprah had a  Skype kit that she because Oprah was one of the first  on mainstream to do Skype calls and I remember seeing it was a it was a  Kind of a Pelican case one of those hard shell cases and here it is  This is but this is ten years ago. Yeah, the Oprah Skype kit arrives  This is so it's a big old Pelican case. It's got a special microphone. It's got the camera  I don't know why frankly CNN isn't doing this  I know they're not because I still see terrible cameras. I see people using their iPhone headphones  I mean, I know  Crazy is they lose audio from somebody there all the time have a phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Backup. Yeah all the time. They lose audio just to have the phone line open and have them call and that would be easy. Yeah  So this is so when I got there's this is the Oprah kit

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is somebody who is gonna be on Oprah they have picture instructions. You see there's an Ethernet cable  hint hint  David's a thinkpad. Look at that. That's a thinkpad  They even say no bad look at that thinkpad that's a thinkpad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They send I just got one of these to do a pre-recorded  Speech for an event and my Pelican case had a MacBook Pro. It had actually the Logitech  The camera actually currently have the see whatever and then it had  Yeah, and then it had two  the  Key lights so the Elgato. Oh nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Shotgun microphone looks like a road. So what's interesting about I  Don't know why they ever and you had to send it back right after you were done. Yeah. Yeah, so they're not losing any money  There's some maybe some wear and tear and some risk to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think that's I don't understand why the net there's some contributors who were on constantly and and and and and I'm dreading the day  When they think that they have to pull everybody back into the studio  It's great to get more voices. Yeah on the on the spur of the moment in their habitat  It's easier for them. It's more variety of people  And you did something  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey's a girl. I was just got because they used to ask for us like  Well, no when I was at Giga Ohm, they used to ask for us to come on shows and I'm like, are you kidding me?  I've got to write like two thousand words a day just to keep up with my I can't take your car service to you know  Yeah, Austin waste four hours getting you know, two hours of traffic getting there  but people could always do it like  Certain people like Matthew Ingram could always do it because he only had to write two stories a day

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Salty I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do think in the networks interests to fix this and make it work because you're right. They should do this from now on  This is the new normal. I don't think people mind it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, there must be something like right now MSVC is on my TV Eddie Glaude jr  Who's brilliant and Princeton is on his picture quality is much better than it used to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They must have said only helping people. Yeah. Yeah, I think they're catching up with us. It's so funny

I it was early on and I was scrambling to get enough bandwidth to serve the podcast  It's not an easy thing to do. It was on a website, but that was slow and we tried BitTorrent and that was weird and  We had to beg people to seed our content stuff  Matt Levine of cash fly came to me said Leo let me help and he did and we've been doing it ever since about more  than a decade  Cashfly is the best way to get your content whether it's a podcast a game an app a website  To your end users faster like, you know  The way it works and the name kind of tells you is your content is cashed on servers all over the world  In fact, they've been expanding look at all those dots on the map. They've been expanding their points of presence  They just had six new points of presence in South America  They're serving now ten times the amount of traffic in Latin America over the last year  They've not only maintained but drastically improved their performance in that region while taking on a much higher traffic load  So it doesn't matter where your end users are North America Latin America the Caribbean Europe the Middle East Asia Pacific  Cash flies there and your customers will get their content directly from the server nearest them  Even and hard to reach regions that gives you consistency and performance not just in the Americas  But everywhere in fact because of the reliable throughput and scalability  They're up to five times faster than other CDNs now  They've solved another problem because of course you create the content  You've got to get it to cash fly and anytime you get a cash miss somebody goes to a server where the content isn't there  The server has to go to the your origin  Downloaded that can add up to a lot of money if you're on Amazon s3 or some other source work. We're on s3  So cash flies created something called SOS  Yes, wave the white flag because there is a solution cash flies storage  Optimization system what it is. It's actually dedicated storage space just for you on cash fly on  Cash-fly so you'll save thousands a month by shielding your origin  They can guarantee no cash misses your download speeds will be dramatically  Improved data transfer out fees will be significantly reduced  Pretty much you load it on a cash fly once and that's that with cash flies SOS you get a 100%  Cache-it ratio that means happy customers that means happy accounting and you decide how much you  Storage you need and they will help you and take care of the rest  SOS is backed by cash flies 100%  100% uptime SLA guarantee and it's industry-leading global performance. We could not be happier  We are so glad with cash fly cash light is also a great corporate  Citizen we met the team are just fantastic. They they're partnering with world central kitchen  They've donated over fifty thousand dollars with a goal of serving over three hundred thousand warm meals to those who are struggling during this tough time  Cash flies the best  With standard powerful throughput low latency high cash-it ratio and a hundred percent uptime SLA cash fly has got to be your perfect  CDN and with cash flies SOS you'll even save just for twit listeners cash flies giving away a  Complimentary detailed analysis of your current CDN bill and usage trends see if you're overpaying 20% or more  For CDNs that aren't nearly as good  Cash fly go to twit.cash fly.com and thank you cash fly for keeping our our  podcast going twit that cash fly  Dot com so well, let's start with the Nvidia and arm because that was an interesting story now  Remember that soft bank bought arm for 32 billion dollars  what was it four years ago not too long ago 16 and  It was we mentioned before soft bank running into a little fiscal difficulty  Their investment fund while they invested in uber and we work need I say more so  Trying to raise a scarab a little cash  Now I had I was way out of line. I predicted all they're gonna get 60 billion dollars  for for arm  40 billion they got  That's a nice 8 billion dollar turnaround in four years  Give them where they are now. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  25% over six years  Annualized rate of return on that's only like 25 so that's pretty good. I'd like to get that in my

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Portfolio these days. Yeah, I'd sell twig in a heartbeat  Considering we were after we work anything  Good so but the real concern in question is of course for all of us. I mean arm is a very important  Architecture as you all know arm is a chip designer. They don't make chips  They license their architecture to a lot of people Qualcomm Apple Samsung and on and on and on  So their designs are really important to the mobile world increasingly  important to server world and desktop world thanks to Apple  And and I guess Microsoft Windows on our

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Soft you see this as a way of Nvidia saying you know what Apple we're still going to get your coin. Oh, no, no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, I think it's the server play that's more interesting than video, but I should let our chip expert weigh on that  Why why would Nvidia want arm for 40 billion dollars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So really focused I wrote about this. I really focused on the data center because anytime in video  Think about it anytime Nvidia a GPU  There's got to be an x86 or an arm computer attached to it. And so what happens is  You know, I'm stuck next to Intel everywhere in the data center. There's increasing focus on  You know price performance  Machine learning those kind of workloads  So having their own having access to the arm instruction set is going to be increasingly important to them in the data center  But and no one's really focused on this and even I wasn't too much attention to it until I started looking at the numbers  But Nvidia this deal also gets them into the car in  Oh, yeah got kicked out of Tesla remember but Nvidia is in the cars have lots of arm computers and there lots of sensors  You know, you need an operating system to manage your car and it can't all to be dependent on the cloud  So this puts Nvidia really in an excellent spot there. So I'm gonna just  Put that in there because I wasn't really paying attention to it  So  And for those of y'all who may not realize it arm is the the application processor inside  Pretty much every single phone out there. There may be one or two like old-school like Intel beta crappy  Intel wanted to get in that mobile market. They made these scale chips and they were a flop  They eventually sold it off. So yeah arm owns

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  mobile really  So arm is a very popular phone  So, yeah arm owns mobile really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so arm owns mobile and  Go on. No, I was just gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Reinforce your point if you can own mobile and you can own the data centers  You're gonna sell the lion's share of chips. You don't even care about desktop computing. That's a that's a small  fraction of the overall computing market

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and arm is making headroads there now I will say  Okay  The day still belongs to Intel 86 I don't see that I mean arm has been working on this 10 years  first arm based server came out in like  2011 so and we're only now like in  2018 maybe maybe it's 2019 that Amazon introduced the computing at the Graviton computing instance based on arm  So that's been like a 10-year journey to get it to there  but  Nvidia recognized that they have to own an instruction set going forward and  You see this think about think about in the last  Ten it maybe even 12 years. You saw Amazon Google  Apple all of them license take an architecture license and start developing their own chips  Nvidia looks at that and that's a real problem for a it's a problem for Intel  It's a problem for Nvidia. So owning arm really keeps the same  Arm really keeps them in the loop there  Okay, that's it. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now there's some antitrust issues  Regulators have to approve it. There's some real concern in the UK because arm is a UK company  Nvidia has said we're not gonna move arm out of the UK and  for people like Apple  We are going to of course honor all of arms existing licenses and continue those. Of course they will that's why they bought it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what they don't want less business. I don't so I think the question becomes I don't think arm is going to shut down  licenses like the big  Instruction set CPU licenses, right?  So you'll always be able to get that from arm even if it's owned by Nvidia  What I am curious about is are they going to continue?  Building the software that runs around that so things like getting it, you know bus from the compute to memory  They make actually lots of software to make it easier to slot your arm  Processor into your existing SOC, right?  so they may not they may be like we don't really care so much about that and so then companies that  Rely on that most company or the more advanced you are the less likely your go rely on that  Yeah, so and then the other thing because I'm IOT person I have to do it arm has spent like a billion dollars  Buying an IOT services business with like treasure data with Pellion with some other acquisitions in the last few years. I  Don't know what happens with that. They were gonna spin that out to soft bank and they're like no  We're not gonna spin it out. Now. It looks like what will Nvidia do with that?  Yeah, so the regulatory question the what are you gonna do with the billion dollars?  You spend on building an IT services business. That's kind of just so so and then  What are you gonna do with?  At it because my Skype is beeping is that y'all you're on actually on zoom right now. I know that's why I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Froze now. Oh my god, it's like hurting cats. So by the way, I just want to report  I didn't realize this but they quickly switched you our engineering team is top-notch  And they switch you over to zoom and the picture is much better the audio is better  The audio is terrible don't you hear all the hesitation and the freezing don't you see all the freezing and it's thinner  So well, then we can swap me back. No, no, it's I just I feel like the audience what he cares about  Yeah, all I care about really is the audio 90% of our audience listens and well, that's what I'm saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So do you want me to go back to Skype? No, we can you know, it's not that much different

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't care. The picture is better. It sure is way what's happening is zoom is favoring the image  Over the audio and that makes sense if you're doing I guess it makes sense if you're doing a business  Meeting, but it doesn't make sense at all for his podcast  We keep you know, I want to look at I've wanted to switch off Skype for ten years  We try everything that comes out for some reason. There's just something about Skype and Skype audio  You know, we have we're having more and more problems than we've ever had with Skype. So I don't know what the solution is  Is there a setting anywhere where you can say I want better audio, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on. I don't think so. I don't think so. Yeah, I can know I don't have automatically adjust microphone volume  Turn off any automatic stuff for sure it did it turned off automatic

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's lots of settings oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a whole advanced thing suppress persistent background noise that's on I could turn that no, no, don't mess with that yet disable all that  Yeah. Oh wait, you want it on disabled? No processing whatsoever

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We do  So do not say press background noise. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay  Pleasure is either auto or aggressive. So I'm just gonna have it on auto

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny. I was listening to older  Audio from old from you know  10 15 years ago and we put up with terrible audio Skype's audio was not that good  maybe it was also because bandwidth was high bandwidth wasn't that prevalent but the audio quality has gotten better and better but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't know. Oh now there's a if I can click to show it says show in meeting option to enable original sound for microphone  So what is that? I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Never seen that. I don't want derivative sound

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, somebody said original sound. Oh, it says turn off original sound though. No, leave that and tell me well  Go turn off. I don't know what you're gonna get now  Now what do I sound like better porky pig sound one  Sound two. No, that's fine. Leave that one

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, sounds good to me original sound we do we want it or not  One was better. John has perfect eyesight

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Happening when you when you get a stutter hesitation like that, it's because packets are being dropped and it can't it can't reassemble them  The video don't know why I crash. I don't know why you crash. You got lots of bandwidth  I wish we could get Google fiber here. Did you see this Google fiber is now going to offer two  gigabit service I  Don't I wonder if two gigabit really is worth it two gig down one gig up. That's awesome  That'll be $100 a month by the way with that  You will also get hardware Wi-Fi 6 router and mesh extender to make take advantage of the new speeds  I presume it'll be a Google device  so the problem is  Who can get Google fiber? Well, it'll kick off in Nashville, Tennessee and Huntsville, Alabama  With full rollout in the two cities planted for later this year. It's 19 cities in the US

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not here. Alas, so in other words we can forget about this after the show is over, right? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, don't don't have any dreams about it. It's kind of honestly it's amazing  That for 15 years we've been able to do a podcast network in the middle of nowhere. Yeah, California  And get great hosts from all over the country all over the world to be on the show. Thanks to Skype  That's amazing technology and you know, it's being it's as you pointed out now because of kovat  We're seeing every news network use it every TV show a lot of TV shows are doing their shows on zoom now  Yeah, it's amazing. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I kind of find out what year was when I did this but I upstairs in this house  Looking like something on a chair with books on it. I'm SMBC in a snowstorm  Did it years and years and years ago and and there was the opportunity to do this for a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Only covid did they realize oh, they're always gonna opt for that what they consider a higher quality  God, I remember exactly what they told me. Yeah exactly what they told me  I remember going into flash cam sets time to drive down in San Francisco to do CNN on a flash cam set  Yeah, and those are satellite uplinks and they don't have this hesitation  They don't have dropout audio. They don't have weird audio  So I understand that they consider themselves mission critical and they also say money is not an object because it's a satellite times expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a lot and they can control the they control what you look like to write the lighting the don't under  Yeah, the value of the make  Bends 30 minutes on your face. Oh, they never gave me a makeup artist. Oh  God I always had a makeup person

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? Sometimes they know when it's a lost cause mr. Laporte. Oh, is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He took one look at me and said I'm taking the day off

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well I bought this I always found that I found it confusing cuz they'd spend 30 minutes on makeup and I'd walk away  Looking I mean yes better still almost exactly the same. I figured like I'd come king like fancy, but I never did

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they don't want to do you run about zoom you run about zoom. You see the hesitation and all that. Yeah  Okay, I'll go back to Skype go back to Skype no, it's not about you it's about the it's about the interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're already there. Just leave it. Just leave it. Why up because Skype had other issues the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Low-res picture most important part, but audio is the most important part who cares? All right, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the dropout is making me kind of it was very impressive. Yeah, John made the switch like that. I know he's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was very good. Isn't he good?  Yeah, yeah, it's been coming in to pick up some tips from John and  I think he looks so easy doing some of the engineering on if I ever asked what's the can I ask?  What's the derivation of Jammer B? What is their story derivation of Jammer B? That's his chat room handle. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will tell okay a  Long time ago. I was in a band. I was the engineer road manager for a band and the keyboard player  Came up with a t-shirt one day that said jam or be slammed  The next week I came with a t-shirt that said jam or be slamina

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jam or be slanina

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every time I talk to you the B stands for bacon

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right slanina slanina what it what language is that bacon check check? It's bacon and check

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  While we got you on the mic there John did you do the cacio e pepe? I have I have I did it before

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had it at home before we brought it. He said it's just spaghetti. It's just capris  You know it wasn't as exciting to me as it was for you. It was good, but nothing to write home

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the only thing I have look forward to on Wednesdays  Oh, I suffer through the show I get my my couch away pepe. Oh, that's wait. Don't you have heart problems?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should not be eating that once a week man, I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We maybe we should try this Google AI powered meeting hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just buy $3,000 rig buckets. Is that how much it is? Yeah. Yeah one was up one was over 3,000 depending on the packaging  Yeah, what does that include? And do you remember does it include like the additional microphone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, is that what this box is is an array mic?  and high-end camera and then  oh  That's the array mic the puck and then you get a I guess they figured out what to do with their nexus 7 tablets

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know I looked at when we was looking at this early it made me wonder why would an enterprise go this route versus  The likes of say a Cisco. Yeah, you're just gonna you're gonna go with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because it's integrated into your G suite

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, okay, and so and actually there it is I did want to ask Stacey this because  What's the AI for they're using the coral m.2 accelerator modules with the company's edge TPUs?  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe background noise reduction. Oh or or picture

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Improved or following you or where you move or or knowing who's speaking in the room that may be it. Yeah speakers in the room

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or maybe they'll do something cool like Microsoft off two years ago and is still have yet to introduce which is like being able to  Recognize the speakers create generate notes and generate action items teams actually I think oh no, it's not teams  It's another software program. So  Eventually, that's gonna happen, but I don't know if that's happening today  Because that would be bad. Oh, I can't say that word. It would be awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want this is why I asked before about the kit that's being sent to right the CNN and MSBC  That's what I'm saying this is the somebody's gonna productize that because it's not just for offices every time you're doing  Pete Dominic podcaster who I like a lot  He  Has to do an award show for somebody he's the MC of an award show of a virtual award show, right?  So he needs he needs a stick and people gonna hire people like that. They're gonna hire comedians. They're gonna do all kinds of stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think we should use Microsoft Teams and then you guys could be sitting in the audience  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Only use teams under the greatest duress because every time I have to interact with it Microsoft screws up my login and password again  I hate it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One great thing about zoom I've done a couple conferences lately where because I'm an idiot and only speak one point one languages  Being translated the translate function with the translator is amazing. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you is it translating your audio  Human is human being oh they have humans. Oh, they have simultaneous human check. Yeah, they just changed the channels

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's neat. Nice. Oh, that's neat  You hear the original just down barely or you can turn it all the way off  The translator knows and comes back in and out. It's well done. So today Facebook had an oculus event and they announced

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're gonna be the first mover when it comes to smart glasses. Well, if you don't consider Google Glass  These look about as dorky as Google Glass. They'll come out next year. They'll be Ray Bans. They're doing the deal with Luxottica  Wait a minute that doesn't look because that's the only glasses venue ever. There's really no choice. Yeah, it's that or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That looks like the Amazon frames echo frames  You're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, well that's because all frames that do this are gonna have to have big temples for battery and speakers  Now this one unlike the Amazon has a camera see their camera  I'm getting PTSD looking at this. It really does kind of feel like Google Glass a little bit. I'm sure it'll have the same issues  Here's a here's a close-up of it it's very nerdy big black rimmed  Glasses very heavy, you know, they may have done this with Ray Bann  But it has this is no Jack Nicholson glasses here. These are not we're getting closer and closer to Daniel Suarez and I like it  Yes, that was the vision in his book demon and freedom. I love that idea and Amy Webbs talked about that a lot of people  I think quite reasonably think that this is the future of wearables

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I'd be all in for it I would get an HUD the way he described in the books  Yeah, I'd be all for it. I would too

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They also announced oculus quests to now. Here's the drawback  Both of these products come from Facebook and they've announced you will have to have a Facebook account  In order to use  I am NOT me. No, no, I want one. I'm not doing it. I don't I wouldn't do it either

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, Leo Luxottica does own Oliver people's crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Damnit I thought that was the last good glasses company or be Parker. They don't war be Parker

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They bought a ball. No, no, no, those are the only independent. Yeah were bees independent. Why otherwise they bought a wall

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do they own? Oh, man, how about I see?  exclamation mark in Berlin  That's not owned by Luxottica. That's who makes my glasses. I  See Berlin I know  No, they're not owned by Luxottica. That's why I buy them  Today yeah today  That is well, no, but if I did I wear these I  Do wear glasses I just don't wear them on the air when you're being vain my I see  glasses which I really like are made out of  Stainless steel spring steel sheet metal  And the hinges are weird they  They don't have any screws in them because the screws always fall out of my glasses. They're just like some sort of weird spring steel  Metal, I just love these I've never broken them  They're really good and  They're from Germany  So, you know, they're made beautifully  engineering  engineered and they are not owned by  Luxottica which is a shameful story by the way  They basically that's why glasses frames suddenly cost so much money. Yeah  They're just pieces of plastic unless there's spring steel  Facebook this quest to yeah the quest to let's talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, that's a mr. Howell he's the VR guy I like it to assert to a certain extent  It's gotten so much better the last couple years far as to track it and so because I used to I suffer from  Vertigo really really bad play that that'll make you but is this is way better now now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I now I like it the nice thing about the quest and I have the quest one  But I guess I won't get the quest to because I don't have a Facebook account  Is it's inexpensive and it's not wired. So it's all it's all done in the  visor  These run by the way Qualcomm Snapdragon's Stacy's another place arm is arm is dominant  So these are less expensive 299  They for the 64 gig version if you want a lot more storage is 399 for 256  They have a Snapdragon XR to 6 gigs of RAM that's a 50% increase  the main thing though, I think is the  as exactly as you said is the  This the refresh rate on the screens and the resolution. They're  1832 by 1920  Per eye and there's 72 Hertz fast switching LCD. So I think these would be even better for you. Yeah  But I'm not you know, honestly if I if I were all in on VR I'd get them anyway, but I'm not so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other news though is the fact that they're saying you know what we're done with the wired version altogether

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, see that yeah, you know, it kind of irks me cuz I put in that was a Kickstarter  The original oculus rift which I put in for I got my Kickstarter edition  And then they sold a Facebook which really made me mad I did get the new version  For free because I had done the Kickstarter. Mm-hmm, but the wire is definitely an on-starter  we we have a vibe which is also wired, but we've got the  the  Wireless attachment which makes you look like an alien  For so then you can get it on more the one I gave you is the old is the oculus rift  That's still wired and that's it. That's kind of not great. Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have a problem with it, but I'm a lot easier to please

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Snapped it up at my biannual Leo's garage sale  Quickly good. I'm glad you got it in which I  Take everything. I don't want anymore  You know what's gonna be in the garage sale next week or next night? I don't know if it be next week next time  This surface duo I'll be there  Actually, let me take a break and then we'll talk about it because it is an Android device  So I guess it's appropriate. I I've been talking about it all about Android and on Windows weekly because it's Microsoft's first product  Based on something other than a Microsoft operating system. This is Android and you know what the hardware is gorgeous  You know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't have an issue with the split screen the way you did  I think it's gonna have some good uses down the road  You know before I send it back because I think I'm you have 60 days to return it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So before I send it back, I'll let you borrow it. Okay, Roger that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was gonna say Kevin actually he wrote about one kid, but he got one too. And he actually really enjoys it  He's been calling me on it playing on it. There's a lot to say for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, I said doing the ad I'll do it as long as we got started. The hardware is amazing  It's beautiful super thin. This is five millimeters. So even together. It's ten millimeters. It's thinner than most phones  The battery life spectacular goes all day. No problem  It's got a fingerprint reader on the side that works quite well, and it does some really cool things  So the idea is and they don't call it a phone. I think they're right not to it's really a dual screen small or pocket computer  That's really what it is  With some capabilities to do phone calls you can make phone calls you can put a sim in it and  Because it has a very poor  Camera and I think a lot of people today buy a smartphone because they want the camera  This is a not only a bad it's a bad camera experience because when you there's only one lens. It's right here  It's right here on the on the phone when you turn on the camera  It starts in selfie mode and then they get it in camera mode  Oops press the wrong button  Look clunky UI, huh? Well, no, it's actually it's just I'm not used to the form factor, right? All right you you close it  It worked and then it turns into a camera  It's just not a great nice. Yeah, it's not a great camera  We did  Me and I meet Kevin and I were on meet and the camera actually looks perfect for that good. No, no, it's perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so what they should what they should they they don't even want to say it's a phone. It's not a camera phone camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's almost it's a meat camera or a or a Skype camera duo camera  It's fine good enough to do that job great and because the form factor  I'm sure Kevin did this and it's a great camera  Good enough to do that job great and because the form factor I'm sure Kevin did this it's lit  You know, it's a little little laptop and yeah, you can do this. You can watch TV that way  It has a really interesting feature which is to take advantage of the dual screens. You can  Dedicate you can create folders of two apps that have worked side by side. So this this one is my chess group  So when I launch that I get my chess book and running in Kindle on one side and I get my chess little chess program  On the other side to do the moves and that is actually a really nice combination  Kindle is  It's a great book reader. I'm sure Kevin noted this because it let me see if I can it's the suffers a little  I'd say it's not great. It's a little bit clunky. So to get this to a two screen I have to  Drag it up drag it to the middle then like this but now  It's not working, right?  Well, that's no but it's supposed to be like a two-page book but now right for some reason it's spread over  I guess it must be a setting that I have to fix in the Kindle book  And it's like a little book that you might read on the you know, here's my little chap book

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and and I will say what Kevin said that I thought was pretty smart. He was like, I don't think you should think of it  As a phone, right? Yes. It makes calls. He's like  Yeah, and  If it is a small tablet and he's really loving it because they can get side-by-side apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and see I agree with that that that perspective of being a smaller tablet because the only thing that I thought about was  opening up Lightroom on it and  looking at my assets and things like that or opening up Premiere Rush and  Going through and editing content that way the last thing that crossed my mind was answering a phone call on them

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who uses their phone that much for phones anymore? I'll tell you why you're not gonna want to do that and  Let me open the photos app just to and if I move it to  two screens  So I have a photo can you do the over-the-shoulder do you have that John or no?  Yeah, so I have a photo now I can make it two screens any app can be this can be done with but this hinge  Hides part of the picture. Yeah. Yeah, so you don't see the whole picture now  It's nice, but it's not as like I think what doesn't have to because it's two screens  The software could say well this ends here and starts there  Oh, I see but for some reason it treats it as a single screen  Which means it occludes whatever is under the hinge which is a little otherwise it would look well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm gonna justify otherwise it would look wacky because it would look like the  The if you had a human being they might get six inches taller if they're lying down I guess I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but look at a map for instance and Google has by the way just  Updated their maps to work with this phone and part of it is gonna be Microsoft  Polishing the software in Android, but part of it's also gonna be third parties  Getting their stuff to work a little bit better. So Google apparently they say well  No, we've made the but the map still hide stuff. See let me hide la gonita. See you can't see it  See says to him. No, I mean  Right, so that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's nothing there. So of course that's not gonna show it but there is something there I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is something there. There's there's it's hiding what's under the hinge  So what it so I'm just saying what it could do is what we would do here divided. It's divided  It's two screens. So if we if if I put you half of you and in  That screen and half of you in this screen  Your head would be divided in half, but it would end there and start here. It wouldn't be hidden by the gap  There's a difference. So I don't understand why they chose to do that. But you're right, Stacy  Maybe they had some good reason for it and I just thought Kevin it I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just have to tell you Kevin loves it  Well, no Kevin is been is sharing things apparently he popped online  So he said his article tells you how to make the camera mode switch work  He's also saying that yes app developers have to optimize their apps to use the dual screens  But this isn't a Microsoft's problem. The way to do that is gonna be part of Android 11. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well dual screens are built into Android. They have been since Android 10 since fold. Yeah, but  The this isn't exactly you know, this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But those folds had a continuous contiguous squirt screen though, right? Yeah, that's what that's the big difference, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know I and let me be clear that that gap is not that it's not a showstopper by any means the things that are

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Awkward were fixed. Do you get the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Concept of using yeah, there's some advantage to using a big screen that folds up  I think the fold might be a better I don't know  So here's but the place a tablet no because of that gap and because the software isn't so here's the thing you close it  And now you have a very funny shaped phone. You have a 3x2 phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's that we can get around get around I think a lot of the objections to it were from people who said well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not like any other phone, you know  They were used to how it worked on other things and so that is part of it. The software is a little janky  I have to say the software

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First run the first product and these aren't this isn't like Apple where and even Apple didn't have I mean  It had a lot of software, but you know, it took them a whole year to get that straight out after the first iPhone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say the hardware spectacular the hardware is except for the camera. The hardware is really beautiful. It's elegantly done

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just gorgeous great screens. Go ahead. What does this replace in your bag? So I'm traveling that's the problem with the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A Kindle in a computer kind of a book places the Kindle this replaces your Kindle. You can't get rid of your phone for instance  When it's closed if I get a notification, I have no idea. There's no indicator at all on it  That does not bother me at all. Yeah, some people that doesn't bother some people. Yeah  The finger printer reader works quite well  I think it's a little it's a little book like computer is what it really is and it's really good for the Kindle  That's great. If you want you what you want to do is read books. I think you'd be very happy with it  There's some little there's I mean there's glitches

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's hesitation and I want to hear what you because I whenever I look at the I'm like  Is this additive to my bag? Oh gadgets because I really don't need anymore. I think you still need a phone is what I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that's kind of the part of the problem is I don't think it's a phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is also just want to see how it fits in my hands too. Well, you have big hands. It's a little awkward

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's not comfortable to hold this this way all the time  Uh-huh. If I were on an airplane and I had on the seat, that'd be great. Look how the books look though  This is great. Can you do the old viewers show? This is really nice. This is really like yeah, this is like  You're reading a book. It's just like it and  The screen is very crisp

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you say phone are you talking about like texting and talking cuz like if I  Ever had Bluetooth headsets in it. Yeah, if you have a Bluetooth headset

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've made phone calls on this and just use it with a speaker, which is fine. You can hold it to your head. It's not awful

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not bad. I don't ever hold my phone to my right anymore, right? Like ever that so you have earbuds

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no headphone jacks. So you'd have to use Bluetooth earbuds  I think the camera is the is the biggest downfall. There's no NFC so you can't use touch-to-pay  There's no wireless charging. I could live with that. It's not waterproof  It's an older it's the 855 Snapdragon last year's Snapdragon  I think some of the issues the hesitation and stuff and the freezing might be because it's an older  Snapdragon, but I bet you like that's right. Yeah, I bet you Microsoft can optimize it  You know, this is they have this is they haven't you know, they've only they  It's just come out. So they'll be you need your gloves. You need your glove. This is a glob. This is the glob

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's not a glob. You glob would be that'd be whatever screen you want a glob would be  a  Unseen would be whatever you it's like a Chromebook on a you where that pops up a screen or a chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Account everywhere. I do like the dual screen  So I can I can you know, here's my this is a TV dual screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I have in one screen I have YouTube TV and the other screen  I have a browser and if I turn it I can watch the TV. This doesn't accelerometer is a little sticky  Let's see now now I want to accept the challenge of trying out that camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I had the one plus Nord from mr  Howell and played around with it and I had the one plus Nord from mr  Howell and played around with it and I was able to  Pull out some decent shots with it. It's not the best camera, but it's it was still quite  Serviceable and so I like to see if this would be the same thing even you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me take a picture of  Let's see. Here's a picture of the set and I'll do a quick picture. Let's see. It's got portrait mode. It's got slow-mo  It's got video. It's got panorama. I  Don't know. This isn't a very well lit  I just feel like even you are gonna have a hard time getting  No, I'll put it on the big screen as soon as the as soon as photos sinks because you're gonna want to see  More detail now. I'm getting error loading message. I don't know what's going on and it's not responding. See this happens a lot  There's just these moments when it just goes. I don't know. What do you want processor? Just like you say

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing's hard nothing is launching  See that nothing's happened. This does this works

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, when you when you keep punching when it's trying to lunch, that's that's not gonna help. Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like should just let it go. I always find like  Give it a minute. Oh there. Yeah now something's launching  This is cool. So if you have a Microsoft program and you go dual screen with it  Some of the mic not all but some of the Microsoft programs. This is one note  Will be smart about the screen and that's what everything should do. So you see here's the car. Here's the note  Index over here same thing with email. I'll show the list of emails and then the content over there. That's kind of nice, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep, and how long have you had it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come back in like a couple weeks until it cuz like that's using it. This is so new. I like yeah  I think you should use it for a long. I'm sorry  Or give it to aunt to use it I just I feel like with new form factors, it's really rough to but you nailed it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the hardest thing cuz you you have expectations and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not you don't know what you're gonna do it with yet, right? You know a lot of times

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but you kind of know what you want a phone to do, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm gonna  Told me when the iPhone launched that I would want my phone to be my own camera. I would've been like crazy man, right?  So things also here is an example of the hinge

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't think they ever plan for you to do things across the screen. No as one image you never watch a show that way  But I think that's the decision ever look at a photo that way. That's also a decision in the hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because it's wrong couldn't the hardware just say the screen ends there and starts there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see you're just you're trying to make it do something that it wasn't doesn't shouldn't do  It's I'm gonna confess something here which will shock some people remember what on the show I did the reboxing of the iPad

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cuz my complaint was that  It wasn't a good creation tool at the time  It wasn't it was only a consumption tool right but Apple caught up to the desire to turn it into a creation tool  That's a point is is right that that when a new form factor comes out even the company that makes it may not know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's always the case, right? Yeah. Yeah, it's true with the other with software to look at Twitter  That's more quite a bit. They thought I was gonna be a analog for text messaging. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey everybody, I'm in the bar. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those bros  They know what they want  Let me let's take a little teeny-wee  Break arena and we will continue on in just a bit Jeff Jarvis the City University New York buzz machine calm  I feel like you should be a a judge like an appeals court justice. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was gonna go to law school that was my original plan when I went to Claremont  Oh, and I decided pretty quickly and that saying yes, your honor was not something that was built to do  No, but see if you're the judge they say yes, your honor to you. Yeah, but you got it. Yeah  Yeah, I also might say a few to the people I don't like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what judges get to do they are they are gods in their own courtroom  Judge Jeff Jarvis, that's what I call them from now on judge Jeff  Stacey Higginbotham is also here from Stacey on iot.com get that newsletter  It's free and it's fabulous. And of course she and Kevin do a great podcast Kevin Toffle the iot show and  Mr.  Ant Pruitt from hands-on photography hands-on wellness our beloved  Ant Pruitt so good to see all three of you our show today brought to you by zip recruiters  There's a lot to think about these days if you're an employer  Tell me about it hiring can be challenging  Especially when you have to think about enforcing social distancing supplying masks  But you know when you need to fill a post you need to fill a post  Monica Starks could relate she needed a hire for a pivotal role at her construction company the GS group  She's having a hard time finding the right person  in during quarantine  So she's switched switch to zip recruiter and honestly, I have to say we've used it for years  I have to say we've used it for years. It really does make hiring easier  the one of the keys is zip recruiters technology will actually identify people with the right experience for your job and  actively invite them to apply  You really should try zip recruiter. It's free right now zip recruiter comm slash  twig  They also make it easy because when you post on zip recruiter the job listing goes out to a hundred plus sites  Including social networks all of the applicants roll into the zip recruiter interface where it's easy to rank them  You could screen them with questions and pick the right person fast. That's how Monica found Lamont Jenkins  She said zip recruiter sent Lamont's profile to her five minutes  Five minutes after she posted the job because he was a perfect match for the role  See zip recruiter has hundreds of thousands of active resumes people go there to apply so they look through them  Obviously with AI and find the right person for the job then invite them to apply and that's how Lamont  Started working for GS group zip recruiter is does this so well by the way that four out of five employers  Who post on zip recruiter get a quality candidate with them in the first day last time we used it  We posted at breakfast. We got a like a slew of great candidates before lunch  zip recruiter is  The way to hire they make the whole process more efficient and more effective  I think you're gonna love it  But the best way to find out is to try it for yourself is the minute you need to fill a post  And by the way, thank you because God knows we need more jobs out there  If you're if you're one of those golden people who's hiring go to zip recruiter comm slash twig and try it for free  zip recruiter comm slash  TWI  Gee zip recruiter is the smartest way to hire and I will vouch for that zip recruiter comm slash twig  So we're doing tick-tock now because it got funnier it gets funnier by the minute that's even funnier brother  So Sunday Microsoft started the avalanche of news saying yeah, we lost the bid and  Then Oracle at first refused to comment and then they said well  It's not that we won the bid there were only two companies as far as we know bidding Microsoft Walmart Oracle  When Microsoft said tick-tock has informed us. They don't want us  Oracle said yeah, they don't want us either, but we're going to be their technology partner their hope was the president would accept it if  The I guess if the database was run by Oracle a US company, but tick-tock would still be a Chinese company  But they wanted to create a US subsidiary with tech be the majority shareholder

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bike dance was still on the majority. They're not selling it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they'd but Oracle and by the way Walmart said why might switch tables  So we'll be in on this bid too because I think they want the e-commerce side. So the question now is  Will the White House accept it they made the deadline they announced it. Well, that's that's the next punchline. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the next punchline, oh  so the first thing that happened was made in the senators went after Trump and said led by Cruz and  Said they were against the deal because China is still involved in China apparently has cooties

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they don't like this deal this includes Marco review like this Tom Tillis Roger wicker Rick Scott Dan Sullivan John Cornyn your favorite Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay  So that's that was that was the next chapter and then and then a few minutes ago Trump was at the podium  Saying that he's gonna get  Updated on the deal tomorrow and decide whether he signs it like he's like I have to sign it like it's a bill

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  His ego

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It knows nobody's he may not he may he may still scotch the deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ultimately ultimately who really does weigh in on this is Cepheus, right the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  They get they are the as far as I know the only governmental body was I guess Congress could scotch it they could say no  This is a good deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that only if other companies want to acquire these or is it when US companies want to acquire foreign companies?  Does Cepheus work both ways? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right. It doesn't  But if Oracle is a partner and it's China. Yeah, you're right. It's a fork if China wanted to fight Oracle

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Makes bite dance even richer Oracle invests in the company, right really was happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On Oracle's imaginary cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, right. He's a well said the other thing is that I can't find  The quote but he apparently said something like oh I found out that I we can't make money in the Treasury from this  He just discovered that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Incidentally Alex Stamos weighed in he's the former Yahoo and Facebook security guy well respected the security community. He's been helping zoom  He said a deal where Oracle takes over hosting without source code and significant operational changes  would not address any of the legitimate concerns about tick-tock and  Then he had to throw in a little a little elbow shot the White House accepting such a deal would demonstrate that this exercise  was pure grift  and  So here he even posted a beautiful  Is that a Venn diagram, okay, that's still a I think event diagram yeah, yeah still a van so  tick-tock and other PRC owned apps  That's a little bit of an overstatement PRC doesn't own it  But well another PRC owned apps poses serious risk to the United States. That's one  Circle the US needs a federal data protection framework that is both more effective and less disruptive than GDPR  That's another point of view it is racist to conflate the actions of the  People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party with the Chinese people students immigrants or Chinese  Americans that's another point of view the current president's obvious anger at First Amendment protected speech on tick-tock makes this situation more  Complicated that's another point of view  That's fine the president unilaterally banning an app without due process is un-american and echoes the great firewall  And then in the middle you can be here all of the above. How do we how do we get that?  How do we get that?  to all  reconcile  Now what will happen any prediction from the ant you're in the dark and blurry  Sorry  Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it a little hot over there? It was for a second trying to get the focus focus focus

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's alright. This is the I think somebody put Vaseline on it  And you're the one doesn't need a pretty because aunt was too pretty that's the problem. This is the glitch show I guess  That's alright you could talk with that wait I like the book

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, well I was I was gonna attend you're in the shower and a little bit  Sort of a little bit off of the subject  But I'm looking at this story and I want to ask you all personally like if you if you have some  Conservatives in your own personal circle with all of this stuff going on about the tick-tock acquisition and the threats and so forth  What are the the conservatives in your circle saying about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tick-tock no

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree no, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so we'll watch with interest as the as the world as it's a real soap opera as the world turns  These are the days of our lives  Is that still on no, I think all of them nothing's on now. Yeah, all the soap operas are over  There no, wait a minute one. No one of them started started taping. Really? Yeah in a socially, you know what they're doing  When one of the actors has to make out with another actor for the show  They quickly swap out the other actor for the original actors significant other  You serious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amazon opening up planning to open up 1,000 neighborhood delivery hubs  Closer and closer pretty soon. They're gonna have a store on everybody's front yard

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that gains you nothing because you still have to drive a truck from delivery hub to delivery hub. I know I don't get it either  It's just speed. It's about speed. Well, you have fewer hubs and you have places

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you can also use machine learning there's not a pandemic swapping out demand suddenly to like  What people locally need and want more often and stock those things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yes. Yes, you can offer more things for me delivery when I go on to order and it knows where I am  You can say you could have this now working with newspapers in getting them to do commerce  One thing we found very clearly is that prime  Markedly increases the click through to a commerce offer. Oh really? Yeah. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but I also I have to say any convenience does so on Apple with I have because if I have Apple Pay button  Or if I see a Google Pay button or an Amazon anything that makes it so I don't have to fill out a form and put  In a credit card number. I'm gonna  Completely reduces the friction  Those are those are gonna be dominant players. I could see now why Apple created Apple Play  Apple Pay and a sort of you know  Covids been very very good to Apple because of course the Apple Watch was a touchless payment everything is touchless  Apple just announced fitness plus which is going to be touchless fitness  This is going to be part of their new Apple one bundle.

Transcript:  Well, you couldn't do the twitch luxury version, which is what Amazon is. Oh, what's the Amazon gonna do?  Amazon is opening up luxury stores where you have to be invited. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fortune I can't wait for me. I am so excited. So how much do I have to spend on Amazon to get an invite? I  Think you need to buy luxury goods  It's designed for like luxury brands to meet people who would buy their stuff  Although if I'm gonna buy something from a luxury brand

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think I'll meet Kim Kardashian if I go?  Mm-hmm. She's not luxury. Well Paris Hilton be there. She's luxury

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you kidding? I was in this business leave it or not. I was in this business when I was a con day the luxury business  I'll calm. Yes, we started style calm and the idea was we said we  Create demand now. We need to be able to fulfill it  We want that piece of the business because we were condéed ash we could get designers that even Neiman Marcus couldn't get  So we did a deal with Neiman Marcus where they gave us a ready to buy  Opened by I mean and that was a budget and then and then our people would go to the designers and pick few  Items and then Neiman Marcus would stock them and even Marcus would fulfill it  And this was a idea where we were gonna be suddenly as a magazine  We're gonna be a retailer at a very high end because we were gonna give the design comfort to be there. What happened crash  So then Neiman Marcus said, uh, we don't really want to share revenue with anybody because we barely have enough  So  But what they did was the site stayed exactly the same the consumer wouldn't know a difference the business model changed  No, it was just now advertising. We sent them a customer and and they paid for the space basically  And that's how it works. So it reverted to the to the mean  But there's been efforts. I remember when when Sephora opened the cosmetics brands  Way against it because they had all their special things in a special counters a special this and that  Until they find out it sells and they were way against online sales  They have to have Connie Nash come in to make them comfortable  Well now Neiman Marcus and Lord and Taylor are bankrupt, right?  And people aren't going to stores, right? So Amazon stepping in at just the right moment here  And to give them an exclusivity to make them comfy  So it will be a physical brick-and-mortar store though

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, oh, it's not. Oh, the actual

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, oh it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Amazon's been playing with this invite thing they they did do this with the they did with the dash buttons  They do it with now with the halo band. You have to different request  This is different the mission to buy from the great Amazon, you know, you and I aren't getting in on this

But if you're moving to somewhere, you know in idaho or somewhere  uh, you'll save money on rent, but  They're going to take 10 off your salary. What do you think of that? That feels I wouldn't do

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Probably in the long run you're going to be given the cost of living in san francisco

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Make money you're going to make money ahead. You're better off. I just feel like a company pays you for the work you do  It doesn't matter where you do it. What do you think stacy? No you you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So having not worked having worked four places not in high-cost cities for a really long time. I will say that  they  I never was paid  less

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry at a certain point it becomes what you're worth and you're worth what you're worth no matter where you are  And for those companies it was worth it now. I will say  If a company is gaining an advantage from having a virtual work  Virtual workforce then they shouldn't be cutting  People's cost of living. Yeah, they shouldn't be cutting people's salaries  But I also so I will say though a couple things when I left new york when I wasn't there I  My company subsidized our mta our metro cards  Do they still have metro cards? I don't even know  Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now you can use your iphone right your apple watch. Yeah, so advantage, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I lost some advantages by not being in the place. So there there were things  but if they had tried to cut my salary  that would have been insulting because  I mean they paid crap anyway, even though I was living in new york because I was in journalism. So I don't know. I mean  Maybe they should structure it better like you get a move it like a bonus when you  If you have to move to san francisco to like buy your house or whatnot and maybe you don't get that if you  Yeah, that's move to idaho

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you have but if you're renting  It goes on forever. You're in san francisco. It's wildly expensive  Um, yeah, i'm not sure what to do. I mean, I think you're right  But then there are costs there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are things you pay for like, you know  There are advantages that aren't part of your salary if you live in the place like you get your free lunch  You get you know free dry cleaning you get  You know subsidized transit that other people in other places don't get I pay for my air conditioning bills  you know, even though it's a lower cost of living because they don't have to  You know heat a space heat and cool the space for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Colleague of mine at my school the craig dumark graduate school of journalism  Um is is moving to new york when she came she's in canada and she said the other day that she's got a  I think there's a room. She would have rented out but now she has to use it as the place where she teaches class  And if she moves when she moves to new york if we're virtual  Then she has to get a bigger apartment in new york, which is really expensive  So this virtual thing does cut both ways  Since you've been right, can I give a plug here? Yes caitlee who was my my wonderful agent to shell up business is  Is in charge of publishing there. They do really neat books  This one just came out of interest the making and maintenance of open source software by nadia eggball  And it's and the this books they do are very very cool. Very good  So I just want to give a quick plug for that. Thanks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been on on the side of the the hiring part for looking at salaries where company I worked for  We had to we were trying to beef up the development team  But we also had the the option of having people local to the facility or working remote  And now these people were doing the same  Task they're on the same project or whatever. So the pay scale was pretty much even  except it changed depending upon where those people were residing because you know, say  Like alexandria virginia the cost of living there is going to be way more expensive than  I don't know say portland, maine something like that. So that had to be part of the negotiation even though  They're still going to be doing the same job. But the pitch to them was like we got to try to you know  Keep up with your cost of living in your area too. So I get it from  sort of both sides of the spectrum, but at the same time if the company is  Is going to somehow still make money off of you. I don't like the idea of pay cuts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you you should never cut someone's pay unless you have to as a business because it's otherwise untenable  I mean they're gonna free up real estate  Those costs are gonna go down to their employees and you know, that's I just i'm like you shouldn't you shouldn't cut  So put it another way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then there's also the other end of the spectrum where maybe these people have not people these companies have leases that have some  Tremendous buyout clauses that's going to cost them a lot of money, you know, even though they're not there  um  Shut down because of covet or whatever  They're still having to having that extra expense of trying to get out of that lease or keep the lease going. Who who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's that's what you do when you're a business if you're not struggling you don't  You don't optimize your operational costs at the expense of your employee base unless you have to  Where it should be the way we work, but that's not the way we work

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But stacy does a different model here if you're government employee  And you're working for the state department and they move you to paris  You're given a cost of living expense to be in paris versus being in nairobi, right?  And when you leave paris and go to nairobi, you know, you're gonna lose that money because that was earmarked for the cost of living there  Right, right, which is a better way to do it conceptually. The problem is oh we're gonna hire in san francisco  Here's the rate we pay in san francisco. Oh, we're moving you to chicago  Well, now you're gonna get a pay cut is the way it seems versus here's the rate  We pay for everybody for doing this work no matter what but if we require you to live in certain markets  We give you a an adjustment while we were there would be a better way to have set it up long ago  But they didn't so now they're trying to change into something that doesn't make any sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they make people pissed off and they should yeah and they should they really should eat those costs because it's not like people  Stay at these companies forever  So and you know being a tech company when these people are like 45 they'll just lay them off anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd like to say that I am not people  Prior prior to coming to twit. I worked at a company where I was there for a little over  A year. It was almost two years. I think but prior to that. I was at the company for 16 years  So i'm not people. I like to stay i'm loyal good man

Transcript:  Now it's not clear is tech republic one of the companies didn't see them listed in that acquisition  Yeah, it's one of the properties but it's funny because I had ed bot who works for zd net  And bill detweiler who's your former boss at tech republic on twit on sunday?  And I said, you know, I hear cnets for sale and red ventures might buy them  Zip, yep, not a word  So they might have known  But I I would actually like to ask bill if tech republic went but but everything else did this was part of  Cbs viacom they acquired a bunch of stuff.

They own a bunch of other consumer blogs and stuff  This will be their first tech venture. So I think this is a good thing  I of course have worked for both cnet and cd net  back in the day  and uh when I worked for zd tv we went through four owners in about  Five years  So mary joe said this is the fourth company to own  Her or zd net.
