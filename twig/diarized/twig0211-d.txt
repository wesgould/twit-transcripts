Joining us, Jeff Jarvis, as always,  Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York,  author of What Would Google Do and His Latest Public Parts.  Look, he's zooming in.  I'm not.  Maybe we are.  What are you building in there?  Looks like you've got scaffolding holding up the wall over your left shoulder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's my Ikea thing for holding whiteboards.  Which I now have on my windows trying to block the light so I don't look so incredibly white.  Nice to have you.  I look very pink, now I look very white. I can't win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The whitest man in journalism.  Thanks for joining us.  Pinkest, really.  Gina has the day off today, but we've got some great replacements.  Matt Cutts from Google is here via audio.  We'll get his video in a sec.  Oh, there he is. Hey, Matt.  I like it because Matt's always sitting in a comfy chair when he joins.  He's always leaning back.  He's always relaxed.  Also with us is Kevin Marks of Salesforce.com, formerly of Google, Apple and the BBC.  Hey, Kevin.  So, Jeff, you have booked somebody I've been trying to get on Twitter for 7 or 8 years now.  One of the premier guys in security.  Frankly, if Bruce Schneier says it, I believe it.  He, among other claims to fame.  You helped Neil Stevenson with the crypto in Cryptonomicon.  His card deck crypto.  This is the only time I know anything about Cryptonomicon.  But I'm going to do a video about it.  I'll do a video about it.  I'm going to go through a couple of the links in the description.  And I'll put the link in the description, as well.  The link is in the description.  So if you want to know more about it, you can click on the link in the description.  If you want to get to it, check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I built a playing card cipher that he used in the plot.  And the neat thing was I got to write it afterward in the book.  The extra neat thing is I got to accompany him on some book signings.  And learn that cipherpunk writers get way better groupies than photographers ever do.  Bruce, it is such an honor to talk to you.  Really, you are a legend in the business.  And especially now more than ever.  Now more than ever.  We need Bruce Schneier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you want to read his blog, Schneier on Security.  There is really nobody who is more trenchant or accurate.  Entertaining even on the subject.  So, Jeff, since you were the guy who got us this great bookin'  I'll let you take the lead on this one.  So the first one is a bookin'.  And I'll let you take the lead.  And then the next one is a bookin'.  And you'll see we're not going to touch anything on that one.  You're going to pay attention to it.  So you'll see that we're going to talk about it in the book.  And I'll let you take the lead on that one.  I'll let you take the lead.  So, do you have any other questions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So much, we have so little time.  We have Bruce to the top of the hour.  But start here, Bruce.  You wrote a great piece for the Atlantic.  And about a topic that I was trying to tackle too,  but you, frankly, did it far better than I did.  Is the fear that the NSA is commandeering the net.  I was thinking about it in terms of what they're doing  maybe to individual companies  where there are people with security clearance  and their bosses don't have it.  They don't know what they're doing inside the company.  I couldn't figure out how to express that.  And you just came up with a very clear view  that they're just plain commandeering the internet.  And then you're also arguing  that what technology companies, it's time for them to fight back.  Why don't you talk about that for a second?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it's really part of this very broad trend  of surveillance being everywhere.  I mean, if you think about it,  surveillance is the business model of the internet.  I mean, that's how Google makes its money.  It surveils us and serves us personalized ads.  That's how Facebook makes its money.  That's how everyone's making their money.  By mining us for our data  and then buying, selling, and using it.  And it turns out that the government wants access to it too.  And stuff they can't get for legal reasons  or technical reasons,  they're learning to get from these corporations.  Either they're asking nicely,  we've seen example after example of  companies willingly subverting their security  or willingly handing the NSA copies of everything.  They'll do it through national security letters.  They'll force companies to do it.  Kalea is something that's going through Congress  and they're going to have to do it.  And they're going to have to do it.  And they're going to have to do it.  Kalea is something that's going through Congress  with the FBI.  Has gotten phone companies  to make their networks eavesdropping ready.  So I mean, I think of this as a  public-private surveillance partnership.  So yes,  the NSA is coming during the internet  for its own purposes.  But also, companies  are surveilling us for  their own purposes  and using law to protect them.  So it kind of goes both ways, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bruce, I've always been much more worried though  about a government surveilling us  than about private corporations  trying to sell us.  Doesn't that seem a little bit more nefarious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, sell us is just  the beginning of it.  It's being used to deny people  loans, to deny people banking privileges.  Redlining, digital redlining.  Redlining, not just even denying people  access to banking.  There's an article recently about  people being judged by computer algorithms  and being denied bank accounts.  So now they're forced to use these more expensive  un-banks and check-cashing services.  These corporations are not just  selling us consumer products.  They're very much controlling our lives.  If you can't get a cell phone,  you can't live the same life.  You can't get a credit card.  So looking at corporate power,  it's different than government power.  But corporate power is pretty much  extreme.  Go ahead, sorry.  I just really see both types of power

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  working together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's this weird libertarian fantasy  that if the government does something,  it's bad, and if a corporation does it,  it magically becomes good.  I usually tend to look at the thing  and not who writes the paycheck  of the people in power that are doing it.  I'm more afraid of guns, though,  than I am of redlining.  I'm afraid of the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm more afraid of guns, though,  than I am of redlining.  But I'll acknowledge that both are problems.  How do you fight it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  The rock-paper-scissors in Egypt  is the army always wins over the internet.  Let me continue on with Leo's question, Bruce.  When I talked to Vince Cerf about this  at Guardian Activate in London,  someone asked him whether the solution  to this is technological or institutional,  that is to say laws and policy  and principles. How far does the technological  solution take us here,  and what are its limitations, and how do we  solve it institutionally?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think technology takes us very far at all.  Here's a great example. I'm asked an email  all the time. I want to use a secure  email service. Who should I use?  The truth is I don't know.  I don't know what companies  have been subverted by the government,  what claims are true, what claims are lying.  Last week we saw two  small secure email services,  LavaBit and  Blakie.  Silence Circle.  Bill Zimmerman's company.  They shut themselves down  one after they received national security letters,  one before.  These independents  are going away.  What's left of the big corporations  that really have no choice but to cooperate.  The technology  only takes you so far, but you can't trust  the technology because you can't trust anybody's claims.  These are very much  political problems  and the solutions are going to be political.  Once we have the correct politics in place,  there's a lot technology can do  because there are a lot of tech problems.  But they are subservient to the  political problems.  It goes to your point

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  of trying to get the tech  companies to fight now. If they want to prove  whose side they're on, are they on our side  or are they collaborators with the government  or are they victims of its overreach?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it a meaningless question?  I think Bruce is probably right.  They are collaborators, but  even if they weren't, they don't have...  I know Matt Cutts works at Google, so he's going to  chime in there.  Even if they weren't,  I think it's moot because even if they weren't,  the law requires them to participate.  Because they're public companies, they can't do as LavaBit and Silence Circle did.  Shut down.  They have to keep cooperating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have to cooperate.  Just as they had to cooperate in China.  They don't have to cooperate willingly.  They don't have to do more than the law allows.  They don't have to go silently.  Both Yahoo and Google  have been great  at fighting back.  They mostly lose.  Sometimes we win.  Bruce Tickell, the Internet Archive,  fought a national security letter and won.  His story was in the New Yorker  I think last year, earlier this year.  Our only  way to beat this back  is to fight back.  Even if you lose,  you're going to lose on the narrow  of the narrowness of the letter.  You're not going to cooperate more.  There's a lot of articles now of companies that are cooperating  because they're afraid if they get the letter,  it'll be more annoying and more expensive.  It turns out not to be true.  You fight. You keep the moral high ground.  When this is all exposed,  like what happened to Yahoo, what's happened to Google,  we're all thinking,  these companies are fighting for us.  I'm going to lose.  I'm going to trust them more than I will  a company that isn't fighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I also consider that we don't know what's going on  because of the  silence  requirements of many NSL.  It may mean much more  than we even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It probably is.  A lot of these silence requirements  are being fought, sometimes successfully.  That the master letter doesn't go away,  but the gag order does.  I look at Lavabit's founder, who

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  apparently got something, but is  so constrained about what he can talk about,  he has to sit there with a lawyer  next to him saying,  whispering back and forth, what can you say, what can't you say?  He risks prison by saying anything.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And this will change.  They can stand up and say what ought to be.  If they get away with the specifics of the cases  against them, the companies need to stand  up on the basis of principle and say,  this is what we'll fight.  This is what will stand up for you.  You can be assured that we will do this or that.  Because if they don't even say that, right now they're being silent.  The companies are not coming out and saying much of anything  and that doesn't lead to trust.  Plus, we, the users, have to give  them cover. We have to demand that they  fight so they can say to the government, hey, man,  we're caught in the middle here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bruce's most recent book was about  trust. It couldn't have been more timely.  It came out last year, but you couldn't be more timely.  I don't know if we can trust anybody  at this point.  When you see, for instance,  the FISA court itself two years ago  trying to put out a report  saying that the government is overreaching  and then that being quashed by the  Department of Justice,  it is all being suppressed  at this point, as much as the government can.  There is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It really amazes me  that the NSA had no contingency  plans for our secret programs  to get on the front page of the newspaper.  You'd think,  with the major budget  and security mindset,  they'd have some plan B.  Here it is, what, a couple of months after  General Alexander was  at Black Hat, and the  best he could do was explain how the  FISA court works, talk about this  Iranian cab driver  who was sent $5,000 back home.  This is his defense.  It just amazes me  how flat-footed they were caught  and how even now  they're just making  it up as they go along, hoping for the best.  They have to believe  that these thousands of documents are going to become  public, all of them, sometime soon.  It's just not going to stay  undercover much longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, could I  take a little bit of the  worry that we're painting with a little bit  of a broad brush? Matt cuts from  Google. Go ahead, Matt. Yeah, and I don't know  whether my video can come through or not. If my video  does come through, I'm actually holding up a copy  of Bruce's book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Liars and outliers. Good.  You're reading it. That's excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This one's actually... Oh, the other one,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Shara Security, which is the classic.  Yeah, I have that too. I am a fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I very  much enjoy and agree with Bruce's discussion about  security theater.  But I do think we don't want to  paint with too broad of a brush, like talking about  collaborators and talking about  private-public partnership on some of this stuff.  Because, you know, from a lot  of the coverage, you get the idea,  the sense that a lot of this is more like a shotgun  wedding where companies are compelled to.  And I think you can look at the  history of companies and get  a sense for which ones are fighting for you  versus which ones are like, hey, please  give us a government request so we can hand  over all the phone calling records  of various Americans. So, for example,  you know, Google was one of the first  to really double down on encryption, both  of Gmail and on Search.  Whenever we got a 2005  Department of Justice  subpoena that wanted to turn  over two months of users' queries for  a lawsuit related to  pornography, we fought that and we won  and 33 other companies didn't fight that.  We've been very big on two-factor authentication.  You know, there's an article in Wired that talks about  a little device that lets you do  two-factor authentication a little bit better.  So, you know, I think  to say that all these companies are  just falling over themselves  on this topic to help out  the government is not a correct characterization.  I think a lot of engineers in Silicon  Valley are thinking about different ways that  they can try to protect users' rights and  protect security and privacy  as best they can.  You know, it was really wild to watch the events around  LavaBit and I think hopefully  that will give a lot of people in the government pause  and make them think a little bit  about just what they're doing. You know, they're  really removing a lot of trust in  the internet and in the cloud.  Yes, that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, CDT just came out with a blog post  and they have been fighting  the extension of Kalea.  Kalea is the law that required  phone companies to make their phone switches  eavesdropping friendly.  And the FBI's are trying to extend that law to  the things like Gmail.  And it's being fought  and the law hasn't passed.  But CDT is pointing out that these  attacks against the smaller  companies that are really forcing them to close  or collaborate, the inability  for the larger companies to close  so they have to basically hand over  NSA data and then lie to their customers  about it, is  effectively getting this  Kalea extension passed  without the trouble of going through  Congress. That effectively  all we have left are the large companies.  And it's sort of  impossible. You can't imagine Mark Zuckerberg  saying, well we're just not going to comply.  We're going to shut Facebook down. That's what we have to do.  He can't do that.  It's a large public company. He'd be fired.  They'd find a less moral CEO.  And it would continue.  So we're now  entering a world where you only  have the big companies that collaborate  and they're forced to and  some fight and some don't and maybe we  win around the edges but largely we lose.  And no small companies  left.  And that scares me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  The next good question though since you're the technologist here.  In my field in journalism  we yammer on a lot about professional  ethics and I have threatened to quit  jobs over matters of ethics  and I know lots of people who have.  And I know that  Yonatan  Zolotarov, right? No, Yonatan Zunger.  The architect of Google Plus.  Wrote a great post saying,  listen, the thing you have to trust here is that if  this stuff were going on and I knew about it, I'd  leave the company. How much  discussion is there among technologists?  Is there enough, do you think, about  the ethics of a technologist?  And how much can we trust those  individuals? Is that where the well-spring of  reaction is going to come up and say, no, I refuse  to do that or I'll, I have to quit  or whatever. Where does  it get down to the individual or the individual  within the company who has security clearance, who's treated  differently from everybody else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, thank goodness for the Edward Snowdens and  the Lidaar Levisons of  LavaBit of the world.  Who have put their, in a way, put their  life on the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Is there discussion of these  ethical principles among  developers, technologists, security people and  so on? Yeah, certainly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  within Google, I think it's safe to say this is  hotly debated, you know, and every  week we have weekly discussions where we can  ask Larry and Sergey questions.  And it's  entirely safe to say that even though  we might not say that much externally  because, you know, there's discipline  about external communications, you  can believe any hot topic outside  of Google gets a firestorm of debate  inside of Google. And so that's  an entirely safe assumption. I assume  that happens at a lot of companies as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, so the president gave a press conference  last Friday  and he talked about, he did a couple of things  which I applaud him for.  One is acknowledged  while, he said, while our  national law enforcement agencies  are patriots and trying to protect our country,  he also said, and I hope he believes  this, that those who are fighting for  privacy  are also patriots and  fighting for very fundamental  constitutional  tenants in this country. He  also said, and I thought this was really telling,  we have an unprecedented ability to  gather this information.  And, you know, I think perhaps  what happened is that unprecedented  ability to gather the information  snuck up on  us and we got this ability  and of course somebody whose job is to protect the  country is going to embrace anything  and the problem  is the controls and the oversight have not  been there, have not kept up.  Is it enough to say to Congress  let's get this under control?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, you  can say it, it has to get done.  So Obama... Well, what else  should we do? I mean, I  agree that's probably the mechanism,  at least one of the mechanisms. You know, the mechanisms,  there are court cases going through.  Obama said you do four things.  And of course the proof is in the pudding.  Talk about reforming section 215 of the  Patriot Act, that's the section that  has to deal with national security letters.  So what does that mean? We don't know.  To increase transparency  of the FISA court, I mean, it's again a good idea  but the devil's in the details.  The third is to make more information public  as can be made public.  Again, good idea.  And fourth is to appoint some kind of  independent review board, which is  either a good idea or a way to make the problem  go away and put in a document.  So these are  four generalizations.  The details  matter. I mean, yes, Congress  could do a lot. We saw  a few weeks ago the  House tried to unfund  one particular NSA surveillance program,  the one that collects phone metadata  of every American. That failed  but failed very narrowly.  There are things the courts could do. EFF,  ACLU, EPIC are all  filing  lawsuits trying to challenge  the constitutionality of this aspect  of that aspect. Those are ways.  There's a lot of public pressure  now. I mean, congressmen are  feeling this. The president is feeling  this. And views are  changing.  Even  some of the congressmen and senators  who are pretty much on the  side of  security at all costs and don't  really care about this are starting  to change.  There's a lot we can do. You have to just push  on all fronts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are those four things enough?  Presuming they're done properly?  Or is there more that you would like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think fundamentally  our privacy laws are  outdated. It's what you said. Technology  continues to advance.  The FBI, the NSA are  continually grabbing this new technology  because it's a gray area  and not really covered under the law.  They assume the most broad, expansive  powers they can think of.  And because the law  was written in the 80s  or sometimes even  the early 90s. Sometimes the 1880s.  It's not that bad.  But it's still pretty bad. It's still pre-internet.  So we really need  the entire  body of laws to catch up  to technology. And if we're really  good to write them  technologically invariant so we don't  go through the same problem again in 20  years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's where I'll disagree a little bit, Bruce. I think what we have to do is write  the laws at a level of principle where  then I agree they're invariant to  the technology. The principle is  that you don't suck up  all the communication that occurs. Here's a better  example. Our  first class letters  and  packages only are  secured so that they can't be opened without a warrant.  The metadata can be taken but  the package cannot be opened. Anything else can be  opened. Our email does  not have that security. Our private  chats of course don't have that security. Well the principle  at work here should be the private communication  is private and is secure  unless with a lawful  warrant. That should be the principle that should exist  against any technology whether that's a  letter or a phone call or a chat  or an email. So what we have to do  is actually I think raise this discussion  high to the level of principle so  that we can then know what's being protected  as citizens. And then  the problem now is that you don't blame  the spies say  in the words of Alexander, gather it all. The more  they can gather, the more they've got their job, they're going to go as far as  they can. And if the law  is too specific to the technology, it  doesn't catch up, they're going to walk through that  loophole. Whereas if the principle is set up  that says you cannot listen  to or in any way  spy on private communication at an  individual level until you have a warrant.  That to me is pretty darn clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right and  it's resistant to  whatever the next thing is.  Our problems have been, we had this  with videotape rentals  versus DVDs versus streaming video.  We have it right, letters versus  email, phone calls  versus Skype calls.  If you write the laws to the technology,  the technology changes and your laws  no longer apply or no longer work well.  We have dropped the laws

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  to the idea that technology is going to  constantly change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But this stuff is hard.  Fundamentally it's very hard  for members of Congress, and I applaud the ones who manage  to do it, to say to  law enforcement, no you can't  have this. No, we're going to  stand up for what's right and we're not  going to give you what you want. It's very  easy just to come to fear.  I feel  their pain. I have  sympathy even though I don't want them to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the judiciary  also is going to be a big part of this.  Interpreting the laws to  support the Fourth Amendment  is going to be a big part of it.  Bruce, we have promised to let you go at this time  and I thank you so much for being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's have you back but I can stay longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would love to have you back. Liars and Outliers  is the latest book enabling the trust  that society needs to thrive.  Schneier.com is the website.  Really a  hero of mine, Bruce, so thank you  for being here. We really appreciate it.  We'll bring Matt Cutts  now into the screen. Matt's thumbnail.  He can come to full size.  No, it's not that. Unfortunately we're having  some weird problem with hangouts and the best  we can do is a thumbnail.  We can't get him to join.  It's 20 pixels by 20 pixels.  It's technology. I don't understand it.  Oh no, wait a minute.  Look, you're big.  Was it just the wrong machine or something?  We fixed it.  We unshrunk the mat.  So, Bruce is gone  but we can continue this conversation  or if either of you or any of you have thoughts  that you want to make about what we just said,  Kevin, you're not even from here,  from around here, but you can  I'm going to be careful what I say.  You're actually from a surveillance state  yourself. I mean, Britain

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We're talking to a foreigner. Everything we say  can be snooped upon. Oh God,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't even think of that.  Britain is no laggard in using  technologies to surveil its citizens.  GCHQ has been doing that for a very long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It goes back to Balsingham in the 1500s,  opening letters and looking for plots against Elizabeth.  So, yep, there's a long tradition.  That was the perfect Kevin Marks comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I try hard not to get depressed.  I guess the best thing that we can encourage people to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's going to have to go through congress.  At least that's where we can exercise our influence  is to support people like the EFF,  the Center for Democracy and Technology,  CDT.org. Epic.  We also have to give cover to  those congresspeople.  We have to give cover to the technology companies.  We have to give cover to the people who are  in the country and who are in the country.  I think that's the way we can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I think that's the way we can do that.  We have to give cover to the technology companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish I could vote for Ron Wyden.  I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can send him a contribution.  I've sent Ron Wyden money to say  thanks for representing our interests.  Don't be afraid to call up Dianne Feinstein  as chairman of the committee  if this is how you feel about the subject  and say, look, if you really feel that this  surveillance is a good idea,  then I respectfully disagree with you  and I'll support other candidates.  You've got to let congress know how you feel  about these issues or they won't  have anything to go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really, it is geeks who unfortunately  tend to want to turn our backs  on politics  because it's messy.  It's not binary.  It involves compromise, which we're not so good at.  But we are the ones who best understand  what the issues and risks are here.  So it is us,  geeks, who have to step forward  and be heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I want to go back to what Matt was talking about  because I think this is highly important.  And Matt's right to say let's not paint the broad brush  that every technology company is evil.  We hear that kind of stuff too often.  But we also need, you know, I wrote a piece  for The Guardian before Bruce  did for The Atlantic, trying to tackle  the same way he did a better job.  But I see three tiers of companies  that are ensnared in this. At the highest level  of the broadband companies that are letting the  NSA and the GCHQ  apparently listen into the entire damned internet.  Yeah, they're the worst.  And then there's telcos who hate us anyway  and we hate them anyway.  But then there's the companies with whom we have  a personal relationship.  Google, Facebook, Twitter, and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And perhaps your ISP as well. Throw them in the mix.  Hey, you know what? If you don't have a good ISP,  get one. There are good ones.  Locally here, SonicNet  historically has fought the best  for our rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And when we're imprisoned by an oligopoly  or monopoly, we don't. But what we do have is  my argument here is that  Google's and Twitter's and Facebook's  at all are our best hope.  Because  they're the ones who lose the most if  we lose trust in them. Whether that's  individual consumers or whether that's companies  canceling contracts with American cloud  providers because they don't trust us anymore.  They have the most to lose. They have the  most aligned interest. They have an actual relationship  with us. And they're also  ensnared in this. This is why this collaborator  versus victim  is still important, I think, because sometimes  you can do this stuff very willingly or you can  say, I'm only doing what I have to do.  And the more that we can give cover to  those technology companies too, as Bruce says,  fight, but also to  make clear these principles  on our behalf, I think they're  our best hope. Congress is going to be mixed.  Courts are going to be slow. Diplomacy  is going to take forever.  Executive branch is  FOS on this.  Telcos and bandwidth companies don't care about us  and never will. So to me, and I know I got  accused of being a Google love boy  and apologist, I need  we need these companies to stand up and speak  and we need to give them the cover and the demand  to do so. End of sermon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure I agree that you're going to ever  get these companies as an entity  to do any of this because they  are, for the most part, publicly held.  They have a fiduciary responsibility to stakeholders  to maximize profits. They don't  corporations are

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  amorous. They've got to fight for the cloud.  You've got cloud companies right before you.  I agree that Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we've lost Matt because I would love to get his  comment on this, but I would agree that I'm sure  that Google, I would hope that Google understands  that this is bad for Google.  However, they also  they are sort of tied by the law  from doing as much as  they might want to to fight it. I like  what you said.  Companies are made of individuals  and if this goes against  an individual's deepest  values, walk.  I don't hold  hope for the board of directors  of any big company to do  anything, but the individuals who run that  company, especially an engineering driven company like

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Google. I've got hope  for Larry Page and Sergey Brin.  I'm Mark Zuckerberg.  I do and I think  that Mark Benioff, not to  put now Kevin on the rare hot spot  because usually it's Matt who's there, but  Mark Benioff has  helped make the cloud what it is  and it's in his interest to  defend that cloud against  forced lack of trust from  companies and governments. Is he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think  corporate politics is a complicated  mix. Larry Page does not have free  hand to do whatever he wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but  I honestly believe that Google has  been intuited for a long time that if we do the right  thing for our users, then  the right things will happen in terms of  engendering long term loyalty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You feel that's still the core  value of the company. I want to hear that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's good. Yes, I do believe that  and I completely agree. Google is  composed of individuals who each have to make  their own ethical decision.  I can't  speak for other companies and other  companies have different cultures, but at least  at Google, Jeff is  exactly right. We have set  ourselves a motto of don't be evil and so  people should call us on that when they think  that we're being evil and when that resonates  with individuals within the company,  then we get the chance to bang the drum  and make noise about that.  I think giving  the company's cover by criticizing  us, calling us out when you think we're not doing the right thing,  is exactly the best way  to lobby the companies to  take the action that you think they should be doing.  Certainly at Google,  I feel like we have a bent towards  protecting our users and  their security. Looking for ways  to make the defaults encrypted,  for example, I think  is something we have a long history of doing and  we'll probably keep thinking about ways to  keep making Gmail secure

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and all those sorts of things. This is a good  time for me then to bring in this filing  in the class action  data mining lawsuit of filing  from Google's attorneys  in which they say  quote, this is Google  talking about Gmail.  Just as a sender of a letter  to a business colleague cannot  be surprised that the recipient's assistant  opens the letter. People  who used web-based email today  cannot be surprised if their  emails are processed  by the recipient's email provider in the  course of delivery. Indeed,  a person has no  legitimate expectation of privacy  and information he voluntarily  turns over to third parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's been misquoted  and misinterpreted like  mad and headline writers have gone berserk.  But that's the quote.  There's actually quotes within that.  It's quoting previous cases.  Read the next web piece. No, I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's quoting Smith v. Maryland as Supreme Court  decision. Right. And what it's saying is  But he's quoting it to say this is what the Supreme  Court said.  And this is in our argument and in our favor.  Doesn't that  say we embrace that statement as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, no. It's a specific  case of, and I'm not  fully well versed, but if you go to the next web story  it's a far better expression of this.  That it's specific to a case  involving whether or not  Google, you know, the  point is, what is the  expectation of privacy? Or your  ISP sees the metadata  go back and forth. They know that that's there.  Your secretary can open your mail.  And so on and so on. And that  was relevant in a limited discussion  of a larger case. And it's  been blown way out of proportion.  And I know that I'm Google apologist often here  though I'm also pushing them hard on NSA.  But in this case, this  thing has been blown way, way out.  It's beyond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think if you consider the source  a lot of this was coming from consumer watchdog  which, if you're a Google connoisseur  I know, they hate you guys.  I don't know exactly why  but they show up in a tracksuit  and say Google is tracking you.  They love to do stunts like  they try to recreate the Google wifi and spy  on members of Congress. Like show up  outside the members of Congress' homes to spy  on them and say Google could have done this  with their wifi. So consumer  watchdog is not what I would call an impartial source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what is wrong?  I'm still reading that quote in that brief  and maybe Google didn't say it, their lawyers  did. But what's wrong with what they said? It is true.  You have, you cannot have  expectation of privacy in a web-based  email. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Far be it for me to  speculate as an engineer  on a legal question.  So hey Google, don't fire me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean there is a privacy policy.  Google has a privacy policy  and they are bound legally and morally  to that privacy policy.  But I think that they're making an argument  that is not wrong.  I've always said this.  You put it on the internet, you cannot have an  expectation that it is guaranteed

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  private. Let me read this from  the next web. The case that Google  is currently defending itself  in is a class action lawsuit arguing  the Gmail's feature for scanning emails to target  ads goes against wiretap laws.  It's technically accurate that Google used  the quote in its legal defense  but using that fact to claim that Google has  completely given up on user privacy is both  sensational and disingenuous.  The company is after all bound by its own  privacy policy. Google's  use of the quote does make me uncomfortable  says the writer, especially in the current Snowden  climate but most of us already had this debate when  Gmail first arrived in 2004.  Google was open about using email  content to serve ads at the time.  They're being accused of that  act being against wiretap and  they're saying that whoa, that doesn't  work because in that case there was not  that ironclad expectation  of privacy and people understood what they  were doing with that. That's what this  is about.  Okay. Well that sure was a conversation stopper.  Well, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  when the brief says  indeed quote and  then quotes that the Supreme Court  decision a person has no legitimate expectation  of privacy and information  he turns over to third parties. Indeed  is coming from Google. It's saying  yes indeed.  Emphatically that's correct. Now they're  defending a case and lawyers  are going to use every fact to defend the case.  I don't think what they're saying is wrong.  If you think that when you're using email  you have privacy, you're  nuts.  When you turn your information over  to third parties, you're turning it over  to third parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. The sentence before that says people  who use web based email today can't  be surprised if their emails are processed  by the recipient's email provider in the course  of delivery. It's not all Gmail. It's every

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  step along the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in fact it's especially ironic  because Gmail has been quite good about  trying to encrypt email  between email providers  more so than anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's SMTP support as we talked about  unsecured email supports encryption.  Whereas many SMTP providers do not.  Which is why  it isn't encrypted because in order to send  an email to most people it's unencrypted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So if you were to  actually snoop on those connections you could  see unencrypted emails going by.  Whereas Gmail does better than anybody else  that I know of off the top of my head and actually  trying to transmit those emails in an  encrypted fashion. So it's especially ironic  to get skewered for privacy  given those kinds of facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is actually a guy who says  I signed up. I mean it's a BS lawsuit.  I signed up when I was a minor and I didn't know  any better and here you are scanning  my email. We talked about this  before. If you have anti-spam  somebody's scanning your email  because that's the only way you can prevent spam  as Matt Cutswell knows. You can't imagine  what's inside and say hmm I think  it might be spam. You have to look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Which is also part of my argument with Bruce  that there is a gradation and a difference  here. I enter into a transaction  with a company knowingly saying this is what's  going on and I have the ability to leave it.  In government that's not the case. Right.  Right. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although at this point if you're using the internet  you're using so many interlocking  companies that are  you should assume  your choice is not to not use Gmail.  Your choice is not to use the internet.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Your choice is also not to talk to people.  At the end of the day  what's going to get violated is when somebody  sees your email. Yeah don't go outside. There might be cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A question I always end up at is  what the hell do we do about it? Do you go  with Scott McNeely and say just give up? Privacy's  dead? No. No. No.  I don't have a huge hope that we can  convince our congress to  you know somehow judiciously  change the  it's such a fine  parsing to say well we want some security  but we also want some privacy  and you guys figure it out.  It's not I don't know if  A. They have the capability or the  motivation to do that. So I don't have  a lot of hope that we can do anything about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But my biggest  fear then is that if we lose trust  in the net if people  if individuals lose trust and if  companies lose trust in the net  and in this whole notion of the cloud  then that's going to  affect our jobs all of us  but it also affects the economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what I would say.  I think you're a fool then this is what I'm saying  about this Gmail story. You're  foolish if you think it's private. It's not.  So it's far better to  be a realist about what it is  and isn't. The internet is a  public sphere. It's like  you're in a mall. You're in  public. And the only way it's  going to work is if we're realists about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's on you.  Where do you put your company accounts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On the internet we use  QuickBooks online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well and I think you have  to look at every company's track record  and make your choices. And  one of the good things that's going to come out of  the whole Snowden situation is  people will be a lot more aware  and maybe maybe privacy will be more  of a factor in people's equations.  And I think that's an entirely good thing.  I mean in some sense  it feels like some of the tech companies  got thrown under the bus because you know  there were claims that then people  had to back off of. But if that ends up  galvanizing Silicon Valley  or galvanizing a large fraction of the populace  to be aware of these issues, ultimately  that's a really good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh I think these conversations  need to be had.  I don't have a hold out a lot of hope that  there'll be a positive outcome.  How about this though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you remember with SOPA  we managed to turn back  what would have been a really bad  law with about a month or two  of the net starting to self-organize.  It's kind of like 300 Spartans

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  turning back  part of the Persian army.  There's a whole other army coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is but we have reinforcements too.  So my argument would be way back in the SOPA.  You're trying to be like Kevin Marks, be historical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well I saw the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But in the SOPA days we said

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  look within 20 years  the people who are in congress  will have a much better idea about how the internet works  and they'll be much less likely  to make legislative mistakes  and bad laws and bad regulations  about the internet because anyone with a Facebook  account who's been using the internet  since they were born, they have a much  different conception of how the internet works.  So we kind of have to defend the net  for another 10 or 15 years and then you won't have  people who have their email printed out  by secretaries on paper and bring it to them  and don't understand how laws really work.  If we can just get to there  I think we'll be mostly safe.  Well I think we're already

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  at least partly there.  But a big chunk of this is  changing the cultural expectations  about what things are and how they behave.  And that is the bigger  or trickier part.  And people like Jeff and Bruce  who talk about this in public all the time  are a key part of that in terms of  making it clear and coming up with different  narratives other than  there are scary people out there  and we need to track everything on them  and reconstruct these  in different ways.  We've seen that happen with the  patent staff. With patents  there was this historic narrative of  little inventor against the big company  and the big company will always lose.  And that has been exploited  by the patent trolls for  a couple of decades. But we're actually  seeing a change in mindset now  in the public narrative around that because  people are starting to see the damage that's been done there.  I think  definitely what we've seen with  Snowden and Manning is that that  narrative has got a  bigger hold on the public.  There's still a lot of  genius surveillance  narrative out there.  There are TV programs  like Spooks and  Person of Interest.  Person of Interest.  That basically glorify  spying on everyone as a force  for good.  That's a problematic  structural narrative  that's out there.  And it's also one that is taken advantage of  by the security  services, the NSA  types, the GCHQ types as well  to say, well if you knew what we knew then  you'd trust us. Look we convinced  Obama, when he came into office  he didn't believe this.  There's a lot of self-regarding  there's this  sort of weird psychological effect that if you're told  something came from secret information  you're more likely to believe it than  if you actually got  public information to back it up.  Oh isn't that cool? I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that too, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I also like the cultural  piece of this.  The cultural piece of this is interesting.  I joked on Google Plus that I  expect on this season of Homeland Kerry is going to use  X key score and read all our emails  and then go off and find Snowden and  shtupem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey that show I'd watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.  But they did that in the first series, the first  or second episode she illegally  planted cameras in his house so she could

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  save him. That's right. And we  rooted for her as she's watching him make love  to his wife. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  There's more than one reason there Leo  but yeah. No but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  seriously that  Hollywood has some complicity in this  too don't they? Well it's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to see how many movies we've seen  with dystopian futures recently. You know you  start with Enemy of the State 10 years ago  and you get more and more dystopian  and I think that's partly  reflecting popular culture  and partly that might shape popular culture.  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  let's get some movies and TV  shows celebrating privacy. Privacy is  boring. Somebody already in the chowroom said  I know this is important but this is the least entertaining  episode of Twig ever.  Oh dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So  one book you might try reading is  Cory Doctorow's Little Brother. Oh it's such a  good one. And that's entertaining.  It's entertaining and it makes you realize  the web should be encrypted and that would  solve a lot of problems. And how long does it

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  go on? You know but that, the problem with  that then is, and I've  said this before on the show but there are services  that Google gives me because it can read  my email, it can give me that boarding pass, it can  remind me of the meeting. It  knows that I want that. Most of my life  is banal. It's fine.  So I don't want us all to  become hermits  in cottages like the Unabomber  away from all the world. I like that  we can connect. That's why I wrote a book called Public  Parts on sale now. Because it connects  us, right? And if we  But you can have a private

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  connection with Google and  keep the government out of it.  I think what Matt's saying.  No, I don't think you can.  Well for instance, I'll give you an example.  I like what you said, encrypt everything. And in fact  Google does use HTTPS.  They use SSL encryption.  But then there's the issue  of the NSA  stores everything encrypted or not.  I think that we know that X Key  Score told us that.  And then the NSA coming to Google and saying  you know those expired SSL keys, the ones  you don't use anymore, let's get those.  And Google, we don't know, but  Google we believe has been asked for those.  And of course if it's an  NSL cannot say.  And may be handed over. So  maybe they don't know exactly what I'm saying today.  But even if I've encrypted it, they might know what I said  six months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that was one of the main reasons why Google  was one of the first to adopt perfect forward  secrecy. Yay!  Yeah, sets up different keys  such that if you can record  a conversation and then decrypt it  six years later, that might  still have an impact. But if  the keys change every single session  then, you know, and those  keys go away, then there's nothing that you can do about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, if anybody has any doubts  that Google wants to protect you going forward,  perfect forward secrecy, implementing that  is proof, right?  Because there's no business argument for that.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's the interesting story that I'd love to have  Matt can't tell us or else we'd have to kill him.  Is  those changes that Google did make  recently about encrypting  and about going HTTPS and doing  those things, how much those were motivated  by what the government was doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why else would they do it, right?  We actually started doing  encrypted.google.com in 2008  and the guy, one of the guys  who did a lot of heavy lifting on that, his name is Evan,  he actually reports to me and we  started that after I read Little Brother and we  said, oh, that's awesome, Matt.  Does Cory know that?  I haven't talked to him about it.  You should send him a note.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  He would love that.  Take that chat room, that's how entertaining this could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, that underscoring we just  said about Hollywood, which is  that fiction, which  Little Brother is, whether it's  books or movies or TV show, can influence  where we go going forward.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that.  And I think it really, so  five years before all this controversy erupted  and I think the other,  to be fair, the other thing that made a big  difference was the idea  of the Chinese hackers back  in 2009. So you put those  two together and suddenly I think Google  got a little bit of a head start on realizing  you really need to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We may never know what Matt Cutts

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  was going to say. We didn't know that the NSA  has a kill switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At 2.24.52 Pacific  daylight time, Matt was  frozen and never  appeared again.  We'll fix Matt Cutts while we're doing that.  Let's take a break. I just think  Cory's got to know that because that's a great story.  For those who don't know what  Perfect Forward Secrecy is, it's  complicated. I don't fully understand it, but  the gist of it is what you just heard, which is  it prevents this ability of the  government to go back and ask for keys  to prior conversations.  And they have done that, we know.  That is to me very encouraging.  It means at the very least that the  Google understands what you've been saying, Jeff,  that it's good business  to protect your users' privacy.  I think they're just as likely doing it  because people like Evan and Matt go,  you know, nobody should be able to read that.  Just because it's right. It's the right thing  to do. And that's why I love  engineers.  Heaven help us if a company  ever becomes such a big business that the people  who do the stuff, the engineers on the  floor, don't get to express  their ethical standards. Because I trust  engineers. Not all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's the essence of Don't Be Evil.  But that is the true

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  insidious thing about the national security letters, which is  that you are then forbidden for not  only talking about the letter, but  saying that you've received a letter or  what's underway.  The thing with  the guy who shut his  email service down, I forgot his name.  The Lava Big Guy, yeah.  Ladaar, yeah.  Having to say,  I'm not sure I can talk about that.  I can't tell my lawyer about that.  That was the very  Kafkaesque

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  part of it. Watch the Ladaar  Levinson interview on Democracy  Now, and he's sitting there with his lawyer next to  him. And the fine line  that they have to, narrow line they have to walk.  What's great though, and Google's done this too,  is you can, because now  we know enough about Prism and so forth,  you can say  just enough to not break  the law, but to give people who are  paying attention the information  they need to know. And I think it's pretty clear  what they asked him for.  The way that  Lava Bit worked, we were talking about this with Steve  Gibson, it was an encrypted  store and you set, you  used your own key, but of course, in order  for email to work, has to be decrypted  on transport since most SMTP  does not support encryption.  And so Lava Bit had to have  your key to the store.  And Steve speculated,  I think he's probably right based on what Ladaar said,  that the government was saying, okay, well,  just give us the keys.  And he said, I don't want to do this,  because I don't, so I, instead of,  I'm not going to fight it, but what I'm going to do is shut the whole thing down  and erase the hard drives, then give them the keys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But then I wonder if he's going to be,  is he going to be accused of  thus knowingly erasing  evidence, destroying evidence?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure that he's walking a very  tightrope. And what I do applaud  is that instead of leaving the country,  he's staying it out  and he's giving interviews and he's doing the best he can  to give us information.  Let's take a break, we're going to get Matt Cutts back.  Wait a minute, I see a little Matt Cutts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I'm back, I'm sorry, you know, somebody's  just like flipping the switch on the network or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no, no, no, it's, we know who's in charge here,  it's the NSA, so it's okay.  Let me do an ad  anyway, we can get that all in. New York Times.  Yeah, is the New York Times back?  Yes, it is.  Yeah, I just checked it. So what, all morning,  HTTP 1.1,  nobody home,  what the hell was  that all about? Were they being hacked?  I wonder if they have a story up, I don't know.  Or did somebody  just flip a switch?  Oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I had a guy, I hired  a CTO,  this is my worst hire ever.  Because he seemed like he was  bald, he was old, he had  maturity, I was doing a lot of hiring kids and  they were causing problems with my bosses, so I hired this guy.  And the server room got  too hot, and so  he started turning off servers.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had to fire him very

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  soon.  But he was comfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What were you going to  say, Kevin, about the Times?  Did they say what was going on?  There was a thing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  they said they applied a  service, like an  upgrade patch, and then their system  Yeah, that's the usual. It was a failure during

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  regular maintenance of NYTimes.com, and not  the result of a cyber attack.  Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for the New York  Times company, gave this interview to the New York  Times reporter, Noam  Cohen. The outage occurred  within seconds of a scheduled maintenance update being  pushed out, we believe that was the cause. It went down  1110 AM Eastern,  sporadically returned around  1.15 PM. Boy, two hours outage  for the New York Times. That's a long

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  time. So this is, I just got this  headline from the Washington Post,  Compost, which is obvious there, a joke  blog, but nonetheless, New York Times  website goes down, panic mobs  stream into street, demanding  to know trends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where's my bits blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The site had 7.1 million visits on  Monday.  So that's, you know, millions  who were turned away.  Although the Times has been,  and to mention this, in January,  the Times reported  that hackers, Chinese hackers, had  repeatedly attacked the website.  And it had in fact broken in.  Yeah, it must be hard.  Must be hard. It makes, it's probably  making Arthur Salzberger think, do we really want to stop  printing?  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like Kevin Mark's backyard.  Yeah, Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  always does it from his garden. I'm going to say  garden because he's British.  It's beautiful out there.  It's pretty nice out there. Kevin Mark's at  Salesforce, but he's been everywhere,  including the Google itself,  as well as...  Are you sad to see Chris Messina move on?  In some ways,

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm not as much glad to see him move on because he's going to  be able to talk a bit more because one of the challenges  he had there was he didn't get to speak as much.  Chris, like you, an advocate for open standards,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for APIs,  for making the world a better  place, and that's kind of what he was doing at  Google.  Quite famously, the guy who  created the first hashtags on Twitter.  Yes.  An advocate for open web. He was on the board  of OpenID and the Open Web  Foundation. Founded BarCamp.  Great. He's not dead. It sounds like I'm  eulogizing him.  He's still alive, folks.  He's just leaving the Google.  And he's going to a startup now.  Is that right?  Yes.  An art startup, right?  Oh, that's cool. Good for him.  I really, I always liked Chris a lot.  And I think the work he did at Mozilla  and at Google was really valuable.  Promoting the open web, which is  kind of what you're all about, Kevin. That's why I bring it up.  Also here, Jeff Jarvis. He's a  professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  And his blog is BuzzMachine.com.  If you're just tuning in, Gina has the day off.  She'll be back, I hope, next week.  She's fine.  Do you want to look inside  the TARDIS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Did you see this?  That's the geekiest thing ever.  You guys at Google...  It's Comic-Con  every day there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Comic-Con every day. So you have to go  to a specific place in Google Maps, right?  Walk me through this, because I've  not done this before. So I click the link.  And I am at...  Wait a minute. No, that's where I am right now.  So that can't be where the TARDIS is. Let me click that link again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh, it could be. We thought  you were the next Doctor Who.  Try opening up in your browsers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Incognito...  There, you got it.  So when you do Street View in this location,  which looks like it's London, right?  You'll see a pretty traditional blue  call box. Do they still have those  in London?  Very few.  They did it when  a Doctor Who started in the 60s,  because they were very common at the time.  And of course, it made a perfect place for a Time Lord's...  A perfect disguise for a Time Lord's  spaceship. Now, you've got to click  the double... See the double Chevron?  You might have to do up arrow if you have the new maps.  Oh my God!  It's bigger on the inside.  If you're not a  Whovian, this will make no sense or  be of any interest. But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Have they got the whole TARDIS?  Just the control room?  There's more?  There's a swimming pool, there's a library,  there's the bedrooms that they had.  I'm not sure they've actually got them here, but  they're the actual...  Well, go down those steps. See if we can go

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  through the door there.  Oh my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh no.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is this like a 20%?  Would this count as a 20% project, Matt?  Yeah, I suspect so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a nice Easter egg, and  I think that...  The model number  on the Chromecast was the other Easter egg  I liked about the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  We loved that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a...  What was the model number?  H2G2 and  42 or something like that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, 42.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love that.  By the way, thank you for the... I don't know why I'm thanking you, Matt,  but nice job on the Chromecast. I just love  that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a really nice device.  The whole idea that you can fit a little tiny computer  in $35 worth of  plastic is pretty great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, pretty much sold out everywhere.  Unless you go to eBay and spend $100

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  on it.  So what are my spare ones?  I bought five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You probably got  at least five TVs, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. No, I have three  of my TVs and I got two for Lisa because she's got two.  I didn't put on every TV,  but most of them. It's cool.  I use it because I play Google Play Music,  and when I bought Breaking Bad,  this is why it's just brilliant.  Instead of buying it on Amazon or iTunes,  I bought it on Google Play  because now I can go over to  her house and we can play it  off my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very easy and just makes it  really convenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pretty neat stuff.  Where is this?  Is this the telephone box?  Is this in London?  Looks like it's England. Yeah, there's an underground  station next to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What's the station? Can you read it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. Can you read it, Chad?  On the Earl's Court?  So it's London.  That's cool. Okay. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that accurate, Kevin?  Is that where it normally is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there actually a police box there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I would assume there actually is a police box there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that is like a phone booth  for a bobby to use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's actually originally holding cells, I think.  What?  You could lock someone in them briefly  while you...  There was also a phone  in them you could call for resistance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's so funny. Excuse me, sir. Would you mind  stepping in here?  Goodbye.  You've now been transported to the 28th century.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Google Play revenue is  going well, up 67% over the last  six months. A lot of it, by the way,  in Asia.  What's your experience with the Play Store? I don't find  that everything I want is in there.  HBO so far has  only tapped Amazon  and Apple, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I've been using it for the music.  I love the music.  Though it needs better metadata for Classical.  It's actually quite hard  to find  Beethoven's symphonies and things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree. I type Mozart and I keep getting those damn operas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But also,  you'll have...  There's lots of variations on there, but they're all like  a hundred best Mozart tracks.  It's like, no, just give me the Deutsche  Chronophon catalog, please, so I can  find the ones I want. But also, when it's even  playing on the screen,  they're truncating the movements and things. So you can't actually  read which one it is. Nothing worse than a truncated

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  movement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The problem with Classical is you need  to play more metadata.  You need the composer.  I think there's actually literally something wrong with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's awesome. Truncated movement.  There's really

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  something wrong with my brain.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Top five

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  revenue generating apps on Google Play.  Candy Crush Saga No. 1.  Now that's...  Oh, you like that. Oh, thumbs up.  One of our studio audience members apparently captured by the Candy Crush.  Then something from Gung Ho Online Entertainment that looks like it's in...  No, that's Japanese.  Puzzles and Dragons No. 3, a Korean title.  That I can't read.  And No. 4, Line, which I think is Line. Is that Line 2?  Line Corporation.  No. 5, another one from Kakao.  A Korean company.  Top five revenue generating apps  Candy Crush Saga,  Clash of Clans, Hay Day, Puzzles and Dragons,  all games.  The Hobbit Kingdoms of Middle Earth.  So yeah,  and this is the App Store.  But the revenue on the App Store  is  not caught up with Apple.  But it's growing.  Apple is up 15%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, that's the argument I always get when I yell  at media companies for building  iOS first instead of Android.  I say, how snotty can you be?  What are you doing here?  And they say, well, the revenue is bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Not much longer.  They're not normally charging for their apps, are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's part of it.  A lot of the apps are free.  I don't...  I think it's still  mostly that the developers really like  developing for iOS.  And I think that that's going to change.  Even Fred Wilson,  just today I think in a blog post,  said that Apple's got to be  a little bit worried. Now, we know that Carl Icahn's  bullish on Apple.  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what to do.  Who is it? Oh!  I love the headline that was like, 77-year-old  knows how to use Twitter pretty well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, just  unbelievable.  And then the stock market goes crazy  because Carl Icahn says, yeah, I'm bullish on  Apple. And it goes up like  10% or something.  And it's up again today.  Well, if you listen to the stock market,  clearly that's not the place to get your technology  information. But Fred Wilson,  who is an Android fan,  makes a very good point. He says,  I don't want a one-horse race.  And at this point, Android  and Google is about to run  the table.  And that Apple  better sit up and do  something here.  Some say a cheap iPhone, I don't know  if that's the key. It might be worldwide  where they don't have iPhone subsidies.  Fred says,  I sure hope Apple does announce and ship a cheap  iPhone that prepaid users can purchase for  less than 200 bucks. I don't think that's  going to happen. I hope Apple takes  the steps it must take to maintain its market share  and grow it outside the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  As of Friday, you can  buy a Firefox phone on eBay for  $85. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yes, I'm looking forward to getting one of those. Did you order it?  It goes on sale.  Coming soon.  A few people have got them already, but  my friends at Mozilla have had them for a while,  but they've got new ones coming. But they'll be shipping  them abroad first. The goal is not for  this to be a massive  high-end phone. They're competing with  the feature phones primarily. So it's not designed  to be as high-end as iOS  or the higher end of Android.  It's designed to be the feature phone  and web-based. It's democratic.  And the idea  is that you should be able to run the web-based apps on your  Android or iOS as well.  That's the principle behind it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think  for HTML5 now, it might be mature enough that you  really could see a credible  web app store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's a trade-off. It depends what you're trying to do.  Somebody wrote  this long article about why  mobile will always need to be native,  which came down to JavaScript performance  and garbage collection stuff.  What that one said to me was,  we need to put more high-level abstractions  into the HTML standard  so that you're not trying to write this stuff in Java,  JavaScript.  If you've got WebGL abstractions,  you're not trying to do 3D modeling  in JavaScript.  So what we're seeing  in the web platform is that's actually what's happening. We've now got  a good set of rich abstractions doing lots of things  that you can then wire together with a little bit of  script. And that's  what enables it.  You need to write a native app for certain  kinds of things.  But the set of what you can do  with the HTML platform has been growing  and growing over time.  That's a very encouraging trend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're using your Pixel still, right, Jeff Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yes, I am indeed.  It has done...  It got wonky  and it does slow down some pages  like you were expressing in the beginning. I don't know what's going on.  I've rebuilt it. I'm trying to switch to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the stable channel. You have to be on the developer  channel right now because you're used to...  Or you were using Skype. You've stopped, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I was, but I went ahead and went off that and I went to the  beta channel. I even got someone to go to stable.  But I also saw the developer channel  just, I guess, today came out with a new version  that lets you very easily go back  and forth between versions. It was impossible to go back.  Now you can go back and forth  between versions. You have to wipe the machine when you do it.  But that's the great thing about it. I thought, oh, it's getting wonky.  Ninety seconds, it's rebuilt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is one of four new features  on the developer channel. Actually, I think I'm going to...  I've been staying in stable,  but I think I'm going to maybe try  doing this because I love this idea.  So you can bypass the image recovery process.  A power wash will allow you to change the channel  from stable to beta to developer unstable.  You'll have to power wash.  But that just means  fully refreshing it.  But how long does that take?  Thirty seconds? Forty-five seconds? Not very long.  Ninety seconds.  All that you lose, lose, is if you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  capture a screenshot and capture it to local memory.  I don't know.  I feel guilty every time I save something to the pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like I'm going to run out of it.  Like, oh, I'm going to run out.  I feel like I shouldn't be saving it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Matt, are you using the pixel?  Who, me? I'm really enjoying my pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Matt. Yeah.  Are you on a pixel? I'm still using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am. And I did a 30-day challenge  in May, and I never stopped  using my pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh, you did that one.  Oh, that's right. That's right. I forgot that.  Yes. Yes. You didn't stop then.  Same here. I did it as kind of a challenge.  One week. I don't have as much patience as you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it went on longer.  So there's a new... Are you on  developer, Matt? You probably are, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm actually on beta, because I use it  for my day-to-day work, so I figure I'll go stay pretty soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm tempted to go to developer  just for these new features. See all open tabs  in Windows with one button click. I love that.  That's like Expose on the Macintosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  There's a Chrome plugin that does that.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, all right.  Touch-based drag and drop.  That's kind of really  cool. Is that within a page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's only for the pixel,  obviously, because the pixel's the only one that has...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you gotta have touch. It's not gonna be on the other Chrome OS.  That's pretty sweet.  Mine has been

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  getting wonkier, crashing more,  and I don't know if it's the latest build, so I  changed... That's why I changed the channel.  There's nothing that can get  cruft up in the machine, right?  Yeah! What could possibly go wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not really, but  I do love the idea that you could  completely rebuild the machine, just  log into Chrome sync and you're good to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To me, that's the single reason to  even look at a  Chrome OS device, frankly.  You give up so much from  the pixels the same as a MacBook  here. You give up all  of that stuff, but what you gain is this kind  of rock-solid stability  and the ability to just power wash it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and so my dad  actually visited for a week, and  he had a  five-year-old Mac laptop, so we were gonna get him  a new Mac laptop, and  so I gave him a Chromebook to kind of tie him  over in the meantime, and he logged in, and he  had all his bookmarks. Yeah, isn't that nice?  Yeah, by the time we got to the Apple Store,  he was like, well, son,  this computer is ten times as much  than this $250 computer,  so why don't I use  the $250 computer one and I can  buy five of them, you know? Good!  Yeah, make an argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, there's the use  case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  My son's moved to using the Chromebook  full-time. Really? Really?  His school stuff, yeah.  It was partly because he had a  PC that he dropped in Smash, and I gave him the  Chromebook, and then  got the older  Mac out and  set that up for him, but he switched to that  and he finds it pretty useful for  him. He does all his work.  Most of his stuff is web-based.  He uses Google Docs for his writing.  He's been doing a lot of Coursera and things,  so he's been impressed with that.  I tell you, when you add last... Go ahead.  His school has now required  that they all get an iPad  so they can use digital  textbooks, which is interesting.  And actually, the iPad 4  screen is  actually good enough to reproduce a  physics textbook. Oh yeah, it looks good.  So that's a step in the right direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in fact, Google Play is just...  This was promised at the  breakfast with Sundar, and now is  out. Textbook support and  book rental capabilities  into the Play Store. And I have to say, if you have  a... To me, the school would be better off buying  a Nexus 7. I guess it depends  what textbooks are available and so forth,  but a Nexus 7 also  more than enough  resolution.  You can use

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Google Play and Amazon  and Apple Book, iBooks, all on the  iPad. That's right. There's an advantage

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Every day...  I'm sad, but every day  I sign on and I go to Play and I click  on the Nexus 7, hoping the LTE is  going to be there. And every day I'm disappointed.  Which they just tell me when.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I did try to...  In the future, you will be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the future, we'll all be  happy. That's the nature  of the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Matt, what phone are you using?  Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can neither  confirm nor deny that I have a Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know exactly what phone he's using.  He's doing a little twist,  twist, twist, twist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's so nice whenever I run my  my pocket casts to listen to  this week in Google.  I have to say, the Moto X, I've always been  a Nexus kind of guy,  but the extra stuff that the Moto X  does is actually really good.  So I'm very conflicted right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I went out and bought a Nexus 4 just so I could  compare the two.  What do you think, Leo?  How do you compare them?  I prefer the Moto X.  It's a little smaller in the hand.  It's funny, the Moto X,  the reason people go crazy about this  and they hate it that I like it,  is because, you know, wait a minute, the stats,  the specs, what are you, crazy?  But it's really more of a gestalt,  the feeling in the hand.  It's smaller than the Nexus 4  with roughly the same resolution screen.  And it feels lighter in the hand.  I admit that the OK Google Now  and the dictation are hit and miss  enough that you're not going to rely on it.  But there's little subtle things.  The camera flip is bigger than one might think.  The fact that you can have  authenticated Bluetooth  locales that the phone is unlocked  and that's a  surprisingly useful thing.  It really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hopefully some of this will get folded  into the main part of, you know,  the main chunk of Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I do feel that people who want a pure Google experience  will be pretty happy with the Moto X.  Aside from the camera app and a few  of these additional features,  it is Google experience.  It's very Google-y. In fact, I decided  to run my Moto X with it. I usually put a  Nova launcher on all my Android devices.  But I decided to just try it with plain old Android 4.3.  And it's great.  It's buttery.  And battery life. What are you getting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.  I was going to say the one thing that has been  crazy about the battery life is it  sips it like you wouldn't believe.  In a very good way.  There was a close sale where we were doing Square  and I had the phone on all day to run credit cards  to help people out for this close swap.  And at the end of the day I was at 50% battery life.  It's kind of mind boggling when that happens.  Yeah.  The fact that you can have the OK Google Now  work and still have the battery life  kind of blows my mind.  I'm really impressed by it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know better than predicting what  consumers are going to do. Because you can't.  And I don't know, you know, people don't buy  the best phone in anybody's mind.  They buy whatever phone they buy.  But I think  from a point of view of users  if they get a chance  to hold and  try the Google  Motorola  Moto X  it is probably the most consumer  friendly phone there is out there.  It is the one to get. Now I'm very curious  what Apple is going to do with the iPhone,  next iPhone. September 10th, right?  We'll find out. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's great to have all of those questions.  I've got a quick question.  I need to replace this one because  I smashed it.  What is that one?  This is the Galaxy Nexus

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Galaxy. Yes. OK. That's what I was just using  until today. A classic. A classic!

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But it's got like a  shadowed screen actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like a 1959 Cadillac  El Dorado. Exactly. Suicide doors

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  baby. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  one of the things I want is I want to be able to  I want it to take a full sized SIM so I  can take it to the UK and plug around the SIMs into it easily.  Which I think  rules out the Moto.  It's a Nano SIM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a Nano SIM. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So that  leaves me with, do I go for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I saw a story recently about  a SIM vending machine  I think in Heathrow where you got both Nano  and Micro on the same package.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we're moving towards Nano. I really do.  Maybe it'll get there. And I have a cutter.  By the way, you can cut a  Those don't work very well, right?  No, they do.  If you have the right cutter.  And there are cutters that cut down to Nano and they still work  which I don't understand because you're cutting off  metal contacts. I don't understand  how it works at all. But I'm not  saying, you should keep that in  mind. And I think the Galaxy S4 Google  Edition would be a good choice  with the HTC One. Right.  I was missing between those. Yeah.  I carry them all  and I just can't decide. It's one of those things  where there is no perfect phone.  But I'm starting to think  that there is this kind of Zen  state you go into with the Moto X where it's  just, it's just  it's not a lot of phone. It's just  enough phone. That there's something appealing  about it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been a press. So here's my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Go ahead. I got a question.  So I want to buy the, I want  it, right? I will  not go on contract. Good.  I also want a locked phone. Yep.  So if I buy it on AT&T, I can buy  it full price.  AT&T policy, I think,  is if you have no contractual obligation, they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  will unlock it. If you're in good standing, even  if you do have a contractual obligation, they say  they will unlock it. They're not required. Oh really? Okay.  But that's  still going to have AT&T cruft. You know  there will be a Google  Play Edition. You will not be

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, you were quoted. Yeah, yeah.  You were quoted. Okay. So here's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  guy, here's what guy Kawasaki, I have it  in writing.  They're not going to do a Google Edition  because then it wouldn't be a Moto X  because what makes the Moto X a Moto  X is those three or four things.  But it's so close to pure Google  that they're still going to sell it on the  Google Play Store, just not a Google Edition.  You see what I'm saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Right, but there will be added  AT&T cruft on the AT&T version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not much. It's two

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  programs. Yeah, I think it's like two apps  and then you can disable them and then you won't see them.  Yeah, I never really, it's not like you got

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's taken up a lot of space or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Because the reason I could buy the AT&T one is I could do the  customized, ooh I have a purple phone  and I could get more memory. That is a big

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  issue, yeah. Because I think basically I'm not  going to buy a Moto X until I can get a wooden back.  That's going to be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So,  that means later this year.  I mean maybe December, I don't know.  They said end of Q4.  So, I don't think, I think that's when  Motorola's exclusivity ends.  I don't think it lasts.  I mean I have no knowledge of this. You know, I think  I keep getting quoted as if I know something. I don't know  nothing. You know, Guy  Kawasaki said, why did you say it cost $350  to make? I said, I didn't say it. Goldman Sachs said it.  I'm just quoting Goldman Sachs. But unfortunately  all these stupid blogs quote  me as if I'm saying it. I'm quoting  an analyst who said that. I don't know.  How would I know how much it cost?  They think Guy told me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sucks to be the president of the internet in these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am, I am, I am  I'm like Obama. I know  nothing. They don't  tell me anything. He's the sergeant  Schultz of the internet. I know nothing.  However,  I do like the Moto X. I  kind of still think it's a, it's a  it's a world beater.  You never know what consumers are going to go for.  It's subtle. That's part of the problem.  It kind of is a subtle appeal.  Like you don't know that the battery life  is so great until you use it for a couple of weeks and you realize  this is just keeps going.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm an Exis fanatic. I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  always go vanilla. Right.  The add-ons have actually impressed me quite a bit.  So that takes a lot for me to leave the  Nexus. It's pretty pure, right Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, very pure. That's why  I got the Nexus 4. I wanted to compare 4.3  to, you know, it's only 4.2.2  although I wouldn't be surprised if they got  4.3 before. You know, it hasn't come out yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Right. So Kevin, what are you going to  get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm going to kind of look.  But I'm leaning towards the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HTC One. It's a beautiful  phone. Play Edition. Battery  life is very challenging on that thing. You've  got to nurse it. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And it's not exchangeable batteries, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's the advantage of the GS4.  Okay.  Exchangeable batteries. I would not get the  Sam's, you know, the cruftware  version. I would get the Google Play Edition.  Right. Of all the phones,  you know, it has no memory. You know,  it's only 16 gigs and 12  of them are used by, you know, watch your  eyes go like this. I mean, who cares?  Wave your hand.  It's got so  much junk on it. I've never seen a worse  junked up phone in my life.  And it's not the carriers. It's Samsung.  What do you think?  I think Samsung is about to abandon Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's  certainly stories that talk about them  wanting to do Tizen and stuff. But, you know, that  they have three OS's. They have three

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OS's. They've got Tizen, which is  a Linux. They've got  Windows Phone. They've got  Teev series. They've got Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Somebody's going to buy Blackberry too.  And then they'll probably do a Firefox  OS one as well. I think their point  is they want to do all the things. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's how Samsung's thing works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They're not a focus company. They make everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll do whatever you want. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to visit Korea a couple  years ago and I got to ride in a Samsung car.  I didn't realize they made cars.  So that's  the full scale stack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a kuretsu. They do everything.  They make bulldozers. They make washing machines,  refrigerators, 1800  different versions of the Galaxy phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So I'm waiting for the Google bulldozer  or the Google washing machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Samsung's having a developer  conference, which is very, to me, intriguing  in the fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They had one last year  in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. This doesn't say Tizen specifically.  Speaking of

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  developer conferences, there's also one announced  for Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's fun. I'd go to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's on the Chrome  Dev Summit in November.  Is that a Google event? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Who else?  On the run down under Google.  I guess the Chromium folks could be doing it.  No, it's a Google event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  The more development we get on Chrome  apps and stuff, the better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People are reporting numerous  problems with the Nexus 7.  Some say the multi-touch  is buggy. Some say their GPS is not  locking. Others say it's  flashing on and off, rebooting.  I haven't had any trouble with  mine, but that's anecdotal.  So I don't know how...

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Google's acknowledged the problem with the multi-touch  and is looking into the problem with the GPS,  I think, is what they've said. I use it all

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the time.  What's the story? Maybe you can  help us, Matt, on this one. I know it's not  your division, but the  fight over the factory images  and...  Jean, the Baptiste  Claireux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, JBQ is an awesome  guy. He's basically the  main engineering lead maintainer of  the Android open source project.  And so as part  of that, you're always dealing with  OEMs and various manufacturers trying to get  as much of the source code and firmware  open as possible.  And that can be a challenge because sometimes  an OEM might consider firmware  or binaries to be proprietary.  And so I think he  got a little bit frustrated trying  to make sure that you can have  a phone that booted all the way up and had as much  hardware functional as possible.  And so I think he's  maybe taken a break from  the Android open source project.  So we'll see how that goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But meanwhile, the  version did come out for the Nexus 7,  I think. It did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't... you know, I'm not  privy to what the negotiations were and  that sort of thing. It's always a challenge  because you're picking months in  advance and you're trying to figure out how to get  things open source, but you also have to get  the device out. And so there's  a lot of different factors you have to balance

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there. Do you think it's Qualcomm?  I mean, the blame has fallen on Qualcomm. I don't know.  Is that fair? That's what the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  reports have been. That's what the  external, like Android  police and the people who have studied  the levels of frustration  which you can graph of  JBQ seem to point in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  direction. You know what I love about this though? This  shows what you were saying, Jeff, is that  even a corporation as big as Google,  individuals still can stand up  for doing what they believe in.  And you kind of have to... that's  great. And have a big impact.  Yeah, have a big impact.  Nevertheless, I think the Nexus 7 is  fabulous. I'm glad they got the images out. That's  really cool.  And I hope Qualcomm just  chill, man. Take a chill pill.  It's going to be OK.  I want my LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I want my LTE.  And get the LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Please, Jeff's  waiting. I will pass that feedback  on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I always expect you to do, Matt. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Esther Dyson is going to be our guest in  Triangulation. That's going to be a lot of  fun. What a legend  she is.  And any questions you want to give me,  Jeff, or anybody else for Esther, I'll  be glad to pass along. That's coming  up in just a few minutes. Ask her if she's cleaned up her desk.  I've seen pictures  of her office. Esther  ran ICANN for a while, so we  could talk a lot about internet governance,  absent government  influence. Of course,  her adventures,  one of the early tech investors.  I mean, she's big into  genetic  genome research, one of the first ten people  to donate her genome publicly  to the Public Genome Project.  Lots of interesting things we're going to talk  about with Esther Dyson in just a little  bit.  Just looking if there's anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  There's an amazing, have you seen the Kids Guide  to the Internet, Leo? No, I  haven't. Oh, you've watched it. It's  under Other.  Here's where all the best stuff is.  This was made,  I thought this had to be  a joke. Lauren Weinstein  said no, it's not, because he looked at all  the stuff. It's pretty amazing. It's old, though,  right? It's old. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  90s. Adjust the VCR tracking  for a clearer picture. That might  be a giveaway. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I thought it was a hack. That's a bad sign.  If it is, man, it just took a lot  of work.  Hometown Television presents. Well, I just want to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the beginning. I always like to, I wonder, I  might have worked on this. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  when we installed Internet access  on our computer, I got the whole family involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true. Everybody had their own tasks

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  to do. It was a lot of work, but it was really  worth it. Now that I've gotten

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  on the Internet, I'd rather be on my computer  than doing just about anything.  It's really true. Well, the Internet  gave us a whole world of fun. You know, there's naked

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ladies on it. So I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  this is a story of how it changed our  lives. Maybe it will yours, too.  With the kids guide to the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Take a stand, now you're in  with the techno set, you're going surfing  on the Internet. Who is this aimed at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As Rich told you,  we installed the Internet on our computer just a short time ago.  I wonder how do you install the Internet?  We installed the Internet on our computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  just a short time ago.  Oh, man.  And already is laden with viruses,  spyware, and malware.  And Dad's getting the Viagra Spam every minute.  I don't want to play the typical computer games  that all the kids enjoy, but their

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  curiosity for learning has skyrocketed.  Oh, yeah.  Dad, I'd like to go into the room,  my bedroom now and learn some more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you don't mind.  And that is my favorite subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Not to mention the improvement in Peter's grades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And Dasha's, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Having the Internet in our home has had a great  impact on our lives.  Rich keeps up with the stock market and our  investments. And I'm able to pay the bills and have  the time to use it.  Hey, he has a few secret cyber affairs on the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Dad's been very busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says he has an Internet  nickname, Carlos Danger.  And he's been a big fan of the Internet.  Carlos Danger.  Look at the Netscape browser. I love the navigator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The next thing you'll type will be specific.  Directing you to a particular

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  website. MTV, a co-producer of  this, by the way. Or you can just surf the net

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  using a search engine to help you locate information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What search engine? Online MTV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For instance, I have the World Wide  Web to search the archives of the Smithsonian  Museum a few weeks ago.  I also had to do a homework assignment  about the Wright brothers for a history assignment.  Can you show us what you found?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whoa! That Smithsonian  really does the state of the art, huh?  The sad thing is we all  remember exactly when the Internet  looked just like that.  Street View.  By the way, I do believe you had to set up windows to do  that waving window cursor. That wasn't  the default.  That's the worst.  It was an hourglass, right? You had to turn it  into the waving, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, boy.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We just figured it out. Look, I'll show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  seriously, I worked on shows, the show  is very much like this. We did a show,  a PBS show  called The Internet.  And it was pretty much

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  this. Does it exist, Leo? Have you  shown it? God, I hope not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, please. Oh, please. I hope it's long gone.  Bounty. I don't have it. I certainly  don't have a copy, but I bet you somebody in  the chat room will find it and humiliate me in public.  Oh, Lord. I remember Gina Smith  did one where she was driving  in a convertible down  the information superhighway.  I don't know if there was singing  involved.  There's Al Gore over there.  Look, there's my  imaginary family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I think we have to refinely found our  replacement theme song for this week in Google.  Hey, maybe, you know, let's listen to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, can we use that, you think, with impunity?  Do you think  hometown productions would buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're riding on the  Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Cyberspace sets free.  Hello, virtual reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cyberspace, it says what we wanted to say.  Cyberspace sets us free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  ...appetite, searching for a website.  A window to the world, got to get online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Take a spin now, and with the techno set,  you're going surfing on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I, uh, can we, uh,  can we just steal that and, uh...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, you'll find out who owns the rights  when you post this on YouTube, won't you?  Perfect. Perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They'll let us know if there's a problem.  It's a tribute

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  to their wonderful work that we want to do this.  It's, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the, of course, the YouTube comments are  even more fun.  I'm not even gonna show these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not even gonna show these.  I'm not even gonna show these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then they made 4chan.  Oh, new drinking game.  Take a shot every time they say Internet.  Uh, alright.  Alright.  I think it's time for us to get, uh, our picks  and tools and numbers and all of that stuff.  Maybe, maybe I can get Matt  to throw in a little something.  We just love you, Matt.  You are so, you're so sensible.  Uh, you're so normal.  But in a great way.  I appreciate that.  I mean, and I think in a lot of ways  you also reassure. One of the reasons Jeff and I love Google  is because we think of Google  as made of people.  Like Soylent Green.  And you're,  we think of you when we think of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and there's so many  engineers who, like, feel exactly  the same way. Like you wouldn't, I was  in a meeting yesterday and I said,  I'm going to be on a web radio show.  And they're like, is it this week in Google?  I love this week in Google. So there's a ton of people  who listen. That's why the feedback that Jeff  gives often gets addressed pretty quickly.  Good, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, I never get invited to,  uh, what's that neat conference?  Zeitgeist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's for sales. You're not  buying ads. I never get invited

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  either. I've never been to a single Zeitgeist. So that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I need to send that podcast  into cash over in sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we do send a tip of the hat to all the  Googlers who listen.  I always feel, when I ever, and I  do occasionally go down to Google whenever I'm there,  it's always a great feeling. Because of  all the companies that we visit, I really  feel that Google is still  engineering driven and still doing some  really, really exciting stuff.  And if Sergei  ever wants to have a cookout with his fake meat,  we got a barbecue.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have no idea how good it tastes, but it sounds  like, you know, it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  intriguing stuff. I have smoking  chips. I have cedar  planks. I can make anything  taste good. With enough  barbecue sauce. Exactly.  Cheese. It just needs cheese.  Put a little cheese on top, some barbecue sauce,  chopped onions.  What more do you need?  It doesn't matter what it tastes like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You can have the first kosher cheeseburger too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So where does that stand?  Do they have that in the cafeteria yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, although they're  pretty good about vegan and tofu  and all that sort of stuff. I think they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  need brin beef in there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Brin beef.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's for...  Chipped brin beef. Brin burger.  Brin burger.  So anything you'd like to share...  I've got one burger. It took them six months to  grow that burger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, the first one's  always the hardest, right? Yes.  Who knows how much they can speed it up after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Kevin, how long  does it take to make a cow?  Well, exactly.  Good point.  You're being internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  impatient. That wasn't beef, that was veal.  I, for one, would be glad to give up beef if  I could have synthetic bacon  that tastes every bit as good as the real thing.  That's all I ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  By the way, Matt, what's  your one month challenge this month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am doing at least 30 minutes  of exercise a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good. You can do those M100s,  you know, the burpees and then the jumps  and the running man.  More just running and biking.  30 minutes of exercise a day is a  great one. That's a good one.  Let me know if that becomes a habit  because I've done that and it never became a habit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might not stick, but at least

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll get 30 days of exercise.  For the last year I did an hour a day,  every day of Pilates, every day.  And the minute I could stop, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The best one for me was when I was actually commuting on my  bike to Google every day. That's the way to do it.  I was doing a huge amount of cycling a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  What was the distance  for that, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm not sure exactly, but  it was in two phases. Don't tell me kilometers.  Here's the station and then  the other station there.  It was about  90 minutes of cycling a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh wow, that's a lot. That's good.  That's good.  Any tip you want to share with us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, actually I do have a tip.  It's a post that we just did  in the last week to the Google's Webmaster blog.  And it's actually a feature we've been wanting  to launch for a long time.  So if you think about how the ideal  search engine would work, you would ask  yourself, well, why is my website  ranking or not ranking? And one of the  big questions that people have, since I'm  head of the web spam team, they ask me,  well, has the web spam team taken any action  on my website? So we've now  rolled out a new feature in Google.com  slash webmasters. It's a feature called  Webmaster Tools. It's totally free.  And basically, you just go to it and  once you've proven that you own a site,  you can click and you can see  whether the web spam team has taken any  manual action on your site. So for example,  if you're hacked,  you know, cloaking,  hidden text, all sorts  of different stuff. We've got like 10 or 11 categories.  We've got brand new documentation  and web pages to explain if you  do have problems. And we actually give you  example URLs or sections  of your site that we think might be  infected or hacked or have problems  with spam. So it's a lot more transparent  than we've ever been in the past. I'm really  excited that we're able to do this now.  Really? Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Big launch for us. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really cool. I'm playing.  I'm going to play with it. See if you've ever touched  me. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should have checked Twitter.TV before I came online.  I can do that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's good touch and there's bad touch, Matt.  I just want you to know the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all I'm saying.  The NSA has touched  1.6% of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's going to hit my numbers in a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let's get a number for Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, a series of numbers since we didn't do it earlier.  I'll do it now. So I wrote a little piece  for the blog and the Guardian looking at when the NSA  said they touched only 1.6%  of daily internet traffic. What does that  mean? Well, they say that the net  carries 1,826  petabytes of information per day.  And the NSA touches  29 petabytes  a day, if that proportion is right. Right? So what  touch means, we don't know. It could be to ingest or  analyze, we don't know. Alright. So 29 petabytes  a day. 1.6%.  Google in 2010,  before they shut up about this, said that they indexed  of data on the net. That would make  the NSA 400 Googles.  7 petabytes of photos are added to Facebook  each month. That's 0.23 petabytes per day.  That would mean that the NSA is 126  Facebooks. Wow. Now,  mind you, most of the data passing  through the net is not email or web pages.  It's media. Sandvine  data says that the US fixed net,  of course, that's only a portion of it. In 2013,  real-time entertainment  accounted for 62% of net traffic,  P2P file sharing for 10.5%.  Now, HTTP, the web,  accounts for only 11.8%  of aggregated up and down.  Even though maybe you'll only have to look at half of that. Right?  Here's the puncher.  Punchline. Communications,  the part of the net that the NSA really cares about,  accounts for 2.9%  in the US.  So by very rough, beer-soaked,  napkin calculation,  the NSA says 1.6% of net  traffic would be about half of all the communication  on the net. Wow.  Which is a hell of a lot of touching, good and bad. And by  the way, let's keep in mind that about 3  quarters of email is spam.  So, when the NSA  says it touches only 1.6%  of traffic on the net,  don't be  too assured.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because there's so much that is  the dark net that nobody  sees or can touch, including Google.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, I think even just the very  high level point you made that a  large fraction of the web is Netflix or  YouTube, and that's not as interesting.  And that's 30, 40, 50,  whatever percent of the web it is,  that changes the baseline of what you  should look at. And I think that's  a really important point. I got to make that point  to someone else earlier today. So thank you  for that blog post that you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Numbers.  Lies.  Damn lies. NSA statistics.  Kevin, Mark,  do you have anything you'd like a tip, a tool,  a number, anything you'd like to pass along?

Transcript:  Well, it's slightly oblique,  but it's...  Wired did an  article this week about  IndieWebCamp, which is an event that I've been  involved with.  Which is trying to rebuild  the  independent web, trying to get  back to the idea of hosting  our own sites  and connecting to each other  and that. So it's a...  I mean, it's just as Neil  wrote the thing of like, we need to go back to the web we  used to have. It's that kind of thinking.  But not saying,  oh, yes, everyone should have their own website and that's  the only thing they should be, but working out how you can do that  and coexist with the large  institutions and things.  And one project from that is  something called IndieAuth,  which is an interesting project  that's  written by Aaron Parecki.  And the idea is,  if you want to do authorization  logging in, that's actually quite annoying and a painful  thing to implement yourself when you have to deal with a lot of security  and things like that. And so  the way it works is you log in with  your own site, it looks for links on  your site to big auth providers  and uses them to log in and verify  that the connection  works both ways. So you can log  in with your own site using  Twitter, using Google, using  GitHub, using many different auth providers.  But what  the login is keeping is your own site. So  there's an interesting twist on  authentication and a way to think  about that, because what it's saying is instead  of you're relying on  the giant provider like Facebook, Google  or Twitter, you're still keeping your own  identity with this  and you can rely on any one of these  independently. So if one of them  shuts you down, you don't lose  everything. So there's a lot of interesting  thinking going on in this group.  There was a workshop  last week with W3C where  several of the IndieWeb people presented  and that was, I  learned a lot of that and it was a very interesting  thing to go to. So Indie  auth, if you're thinking about developers  and authorization, it's an interesting different perspective.  Very cool.

Transcript:  I guess my tip is  we talked about what you can  do about the NSA and privacy  and you  should write your members of Congress and join EFF  and give them money and do all that. But you know what  else you should do? You should learn to code.  And everybody should learn to code and you should get  your kids to learn to code because  ultimately the people who are going to be doing the freedom  fighting are the people who are going to be able to write code.  And that should be you.  And it's never too late. And there's  so many ways to do it on the web. The web is loaded  with great resources. We know we've talked about  many of them before. CodeAcademy.com  is a great one. It makes it very simple.  Online courses. I've  mentioned how to design programs. This is the old MIT  Press and Duke University  text for an introduction  to programming. It will teach you  the best way to code. And of course for kids  Randy Pausch's  Alice Project, which is  still going on, even though  we've lost Randy at Carnegie Mellon,  is a great way for kids  who love video games to learn  how to program and they don't even know it.  If you've got  a proven way to teach and retain CS majors,  Alice.org  is a great one to download.  Get your kids  programming. You can learn to code  too. Not only is it a fun hobby, but I think  in the long run, it's our  last best hope. Thanks for joining  us. I love Kevin Marks. I love  Matt Cutts. I love you too,  Mr. Jeff Jarvis. Gina, we'll be back next  week. We do this show. We love you for being here  every Wednesday, 1 p.m. Pacific,  4 p.m. Eastern time.  That's  2000UTC on  twit.tv.
