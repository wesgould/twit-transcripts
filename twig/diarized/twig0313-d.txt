Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's nice to have you. You brought some dopey chrome thing. It's just plain large. Just plain very large. This is an Acer Chromebase Touch. $430.  And it's just it's just enormous. Price is right, though. It's great. You know, it's a big screen. It's a touch screen.  Ten points of touch. And it's cheap. And it's a Chromebook, basically. And you're reviewing it for before you buy. I did.  I did do and gave it a buy because because the price is so good. And the fact that how are these speakers or is that grill at the bottom?  Just those are speakers and they sound terrible. Oh, too bad. So that was a that was a con. It's kind of a showoffy thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. That grill down there. Like maybe you have stereo speakers. They look like great speakers if that's worth anything. Right.  Right. Also with us from the lake. I'm so jealous. Matthew Ingram, formerly of Giga Ohm now Fortune.com and celebrating his anniversary.  There was lovely wife. You two were so young. Yeah, we got married in elementary school. You were.  Is that on Facebook or Instagram? I'm seeing that. I can't remember. But probably both. Yeah. Just great pictures. Congratulations.  And I'm jealous. We're all jealous of your lake house there. So pleasant. I'll take a paddle for you. Yeah. Have the black flies started yet?  No, no, they're gone. Yeah. Trying to find some negative something. Yeah. Something wrong with it. It's so beautiful. Too hot. Oh, shut up. Way too bad.  There's no lake. Yeah, it's a shame. There's no body of water in which to cool yourself. And Jeff Jarvis is here. We're so thrilled.  Jeff has been champing at the bit for when was the alphabet announcement? We have our new theme song. We do?  Record that. Print it. We're done. We're done. Jeff is, of course, probably a rights issue. Copyright.  You know, it was his 65th birthday was yesterday and we're waiting for a major court decision that will finally free Happy Birthday because Warner Chappelle Music has been charging people rights, thousands of dollars in some cases for the right to play the song Happy Birthday.  What a racket. But there's a smoking gun they had somewhere in the back office there at Warner Chappelle, a printed version of Happy Birthday without a copyright announcement. I guess in the 30s, if you did that, you seeded seems like a real loophole. You seeded copyright. It made the thing not copyrighted, public domain.  And we're waiting for the court to rule on that. But I'm hoping that will happen during the new screensavers on Saturday. We're going to be discussing it and we could maybe sing Happy Birthday finally to was unencumbered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If that's your birthday, you want to be here. Yeah, because everybody will sing to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there any like three million dollars a year from that? That's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was a song written in the 1800s. But then the the two kindergarten teachers who wrote the lyrics, I think they changed it post 1927. And of course, anything that's copyright post 1927 is copyright forever. Thanks to do it. Mickey Mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it originally was something for kids. And they just wrote the lyrics. They didn't write the music. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The music already existed. There were a bunch of different lyrics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they anyway. So Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, let's kick it off. We're going to have to talk about alphabet at some point. Let's start the show.  Yeah, ABC, X, Y, Z. That's the page because Google forgot to get alphabet dot com.  Or they didn't care.  Well, I guess that's one question. Will anybody ever go to alphabet dot com because it isn't really a destination. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My question, my related question is, will there be alphabet swag? Because I want it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we'll let you kick things off, Jeff, because you wrote a good piece at Buzz Machine dot com. I know you've been thinking hard about this.  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the second day we've seen lots of people trying to find some cynical motive, which I find ridiculous because I'm Larry Pages, I think the least cynical CEO I can imagine. I think it is what they say it is.  This allows Larry Page and Sergey Brin to rise up to the strategic stratosphere.  It allows them to do crazy things without affecting directly the business of Google apart from taking Google's revenue to pay for it.  It provides more transparency to Wall Street about what's being spent on one. We'll see how exactly that plays itself out.  It allows them to put Sundar Pichai, who's done brilliant work in full charge of the business and the many Sundar Pichais.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are many people that can be more easily retained through this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at NASK, look at other places. And, you know, the thing about it is, you know, but the anecdote I told is, and I don't know if I told this on the show before, but when I think I did, when I met Larry at I.O. by way of introduction, I said, I'm the guy who wrote the book.  What would Google do? And he said, Oh, yes, I remember. And then he said, What would Google do? I want to know. Tell me what.  And, you know, so it makes a punch line to this story. But I think that the point is, is that Larry Page doesn't know what Google will do.  That's exactly the point is that is that even he will be surprised. They're looking for big problems and big solutions and moonshots and all that kind of stuff.  And there's been efforts also to make analogs here to call this Berkshire Hathaway.  But that's not it's not even close. It's brilliant as well. It is. He doesn't invent things.  I've I'll be don't call it close to the old AT&T Bell Labs, but it's not that either.  That was pure science, pure research. Amazing things happened because there was that freedom to do that and the monopoly to support it.  But I think that in this case, this is about invention and entrepreneurship and its purest form and the ability to to go and try big things.  And that's why I'm delighted with this. The final point to make is the question about what impact this will have on dear old Europe and its regulators from the from the old world.  And one argument says that this will make it better because part of the problem Google gets into is when it shares stuff across divisions.  But the truth is that everything we've gotten in trouble for sharing across is still in Google, Inc.  And I'm afraid that what I guarantee you will see just saw the cover of their spiegel a few months ago about the world government of Silicon Valley.  This will probably I guarantee you it'll get it'll get cited as see Larry Page wants to take over the world and do all these huge things.  Yeah, he does. And damn good for it. That's what we should be supporting.  That's what capitalism is for. So I don't think Europe's problems will go away at all for this.  I don't think there's some gigantic secret agenda to this. I think it's what it appears to be, which is freedom to innovate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You take the post that Larry put at ABC.XYZ at face value. It's exactly as he said it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't see because because why else do this? Right.  You know, there's a lot of efforts to say it's funny how many posts if you look, I just wrote I just started a new column minutes ago for the Observer in New York on media.  And I wrote about all how we all write the same story over and over and over again and how I hate that.  Yeah. How many blue moon stories we have. Well, in this case, how many times do I see the headline?  Why Google did this as if everybody knows exactly why Google did this.  Well, Google said why Google did this. And you can believe them or not.  But yeah, I think, you know, if listen, if Comcast did something like this, Verizon did something like this, if companies like that did something, would I be cynical or at least skeptical?  Better put of their motives. Yeah. But I don't think we've had the cause to be skeptical and cynical about Larry Page.  I think that he's trying to do good things and make good products and make a lot of money along the way.  And so far, that's what he's done. And the crazy stuff that mean who else would have the audacity to say let's save thousands of lives on the roads by inventing self-driving cars and the entrepreneurial vision and technological vision to make it into a business.  That's the kind of audacity that made this country great.  Not Donald Trump's hat. And and that's what we want to encourage.  You agree, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, sure. I mean, I don't see any ulterior motive.  I don't see the you know, I don't see it being some vast evil plan.  But I'll submit, I do wonder whether there are a bunch of different motives.  I mean, obviously, freeing Larry and Sergey up to do whatever they want is one of those motives to get them away from the sort of humdrum day to day Google, which which turns out all the cash.  But but it has become quite boring.  But I wonder if some of it isn't a little bit of not slight of hand, but a little bit of a shell game to try and keep the regulators eyes off what, you know, is happening with Google or to keep Google part of this.  How does that happen, Matthew?  You have to be pretty dumb to be fooled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it's alphabet now.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matthew, you're talking about EU regulators.  Play it through for me about how this puts fences around things in a way that I'm not asking this in a hostile way.  I'm curious to try to figure out that obviously that's a factor in what Google does right now is to try to have that.  So they don't want anything that's going to make it worse.  How do you think it could make it better for the regulation question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it necessarily puts fences around things.  But when you think about the public entity, you know, the traded one, the one that has to report its results is going to be alphabet now, not Google.  So to some extent, I'm not saying they're going to confuse things deliberately or in an illegal way.  Or I'm just saying it takes the focus off Google to some extent and puts it on this other thing called alphabet, which is going to have multiple different things doing multiple different, you know, businesses and markets and business models.  And there's going to be things flowing back and forth, none of which alphabet will have to talk about it if it doesn't want to.  It won't have to report anything that those underlying operating subsidiaries do if it doesn't want to.  Right. Including Google. So Google was the reporting entity before.  Do you see what I mean? Whereas now Alphabet's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, but when it comes to the activities of, let's say, privacy, you know, my contention is that Google is a personal services company.  And as a result, it needs to know me as a person and serve me across all divisions.  So it serves me still across the browser and Android and Gmail and Docs and so on and so forth and maps and ways and so on and so forth.  So all that's where they've gotten in trouble lately in the one sense.  The other way they've gotten in trouble, let's say, the privacy.  The other way they've gotten in trouble in Europe in the current antitrust is they promote their own products.  Well, they're still going to promote maps within Chrome and within search.  And it doesn't matter whether they promote self-driving cars and say that or not.  Fine. They'll buy ads for that, whatever that'll make a corporate exchange.  So I think the areas where they've gotten in trouble in Europe, and let's be clear that's mainly in Europe,  is still the case within Google and it's not about financial reporting.  It's about behavior is what they'd say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I am. But I'm also thinking they're probably thinking about the future.  They're not just thinking about the things they've gotten into trouble for already.  In fact, many of those things are have become irrelevant or are becoming irrelevant.  I think they're thinking about what they may do in the future, which includes acquiring other companies, Twitter, whatever else, you know.  And they will become presumably operating units of Alphabet.  And then they can do whatever they want within those operating units.  You know what I mean? They can they can not not I'm not just talking about the sort of public facing promotional aspect that they've gotten into trouble for.  I'm talking about the actual structural aspect of the company itself and the things it owns and the things that those businesses do between each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, I was on Bloomberg about this yesterday and the other guy who was on the show said that the price jump that came from this announcement itself was just enough to buy Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was. Yeah.  The market loves it. Yeah.  It went up five percent in an hour. That's enough to buy Twitter.  That's twenty billion dollars. Yeah.  And which is odd in a way because, you know, Wall Street typically hates holding companies.  It hates giant things that you can't make sense of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the truth of it is there'll be more transparency here because they'll have to report results for these other divisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Will there? Yeah. They won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you're saying it's the same. They'll be expected to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they've said they will. They don't have to.  In fact, they could say, hey, Alphabet's doing great. Here's all our operating units. Google made this much. Thanks for stopping by.  Yeah, they could. They don't have to provide anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really? Is that the case? I mean, isn't it? Isn't the so the Google stock is being transferred to Alphabet stock.  So if you're a stockholder, don't they have the same responsibility now to report Alphabet results that they had for Google results?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, the point Matthew's point is exactly right.  They don't have to say just as Google never had to say exactly what YouTube was making or not.  They could say Alphabet as a whole. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all they have to report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the arguments I've heard all around is there'll be more transparency rather than less. That there will indeed be transparency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There could be. And it also I mean, one of the benefits I can see is this structure makes it a lot easier to say in the future,  spin off or spin out part of YouTube, for example, spin off or spin out part of Nest.  Take that. Which is a danger, don't you think, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If Europe starts to think about about saying, let's break up Google because it's too big, which we hear all the time.  Then then then does this beg that question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mike Elgin, you haven't had a chance to weigh in. Let's let Mike tell us what he thinks.  And then I'm going to tell you how you're all wrong. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, first of all, first of all, this is a groundbreaking move because I think I believe that Alphabet right now has three employees and their valuation is Larry, Sergei and and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Dave Drummond. Maybe it's five or six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even if it's ten billion dollars, but they have all the valuation of all the companies.  And so from a valuation per employee or an employee, it's very high.  It's very high. So and that's a completely irrelevant point, but interesting nonetheless.  I think there are other reasons that make that I agree with both of you, actually.  I think that this makes a ton of sense. I don't think there's reason for cynicism.  And there are reasons they didn't mention.  I think one of these, for example, is, for example, when they bought Nest, they told Tony Fidel we would keep it independent like a completely separate company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's been a little bit of a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a challenge because you have a CEO under a CEO.  And also there are other divisions within Google who would like that status.  But just because they weren't acquired under the same circumstances.  And so this sort of normalizes all this.  But I think one of the least appreciated benefits of this is the timeline issue.  If you compare like two extreme examples like Nest and Calico, OK, Nest is selling products right now.  They have two point three point products right now.  They are actively shipping and developing new products. It's a going concern.  Calico is like in the year 3000, we will alleviate death.  And so the timelines of those two enterprises are so out of whack with each other that each of these organizations seems to be based on timeline for the to a very large extent.  What is the timeline that these initiatives and projects and products are going to come online and be developed?  And so I think that's a very liberating fact.  And we talked about Google's gigantism.  Jeff mentioned it.  But this is a company that not only doesn't know how big things are going to be, they want things to be as big as they can possibly be.  And every container I've been farm sitting this week, I've been taking care of somebody's farm.  Imagine a farm then.  So let's say you have chickens and you have cows and you have goats and pigs and everything and they're all in the same cage.  That's one thing.  If you right size all the cages, then you have a much healthier ecosystem.  All the animals can be free to do what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sunder Pichai was about to pick Ruth Porat's eyes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I am.  And it was really getting bad.  We're going to have to slaughter one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But at your point, but I think you like your point about the CEOs, but those operating units having CEOs is a big one that a bunch of people have made that it makes it easier to retain people.  It makes it easier to offer people things because they're going to be a CEO of an actual operating subsidiary, not just a part of Google, you know, the thing that makes all the money.  And I think that's a bigger problem that people appreciate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not just CEOs.  It's CFOs.  It's it's all right now.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But eventually, I presume the all the divisional habits on sea levels.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's and they have been bleeding employees over the last year or so.  Google has been losing.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wouldn't you rather be the CFO of Calico than a low level employee at Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're they're basically saying, you know, they're, you know, they're implying that if you want to do a startup, don't leave Google and start a startup, start a new company under alphabet and and will retain the talent.  So and I think it's brilliant all the way around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what?  One thing I wondered about, which I which I wrote about, I'd like to get your guys thoughts.  Why didn't why didn't YouTube become a separate subsidiary like Nes?  I mean, it's because they don't want to report you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  YouTube from from a business perspective, YouTube very much belongs with Google because absolutely because it's an algorithmically based advertising business.  Exactly.  The signals are harvested and from YouTube and signals from search and other places are used in YouTube to provide relevant results and stuff.  It's all about the algorithms and the advertising.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I absolutely agree.  But I think you could make I think you could make just as strong an argument that it should be its own thing.  I mean, it wants to become much more than just the search engine.  It wants to become much more, I think, than just that.  Well, it's free to do that within.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, isn't the regulatory issue that Google faces most strongly the issue of promoting its own properties in search?  One of the issues, I mean, from my point of view, I'd love to see Google get I've said this many times, get out of the content business.  Why not spin off YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I have this argument regularly.  It's not really in the content businesses in the content serving business.  It doesn't own the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It wants to be in the content business, though, doesn't it?  It wants to be in the content business.  It knows what the conflict is.  It wants to be in any business can be generated with algorithms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the reason people are concerned, you know, it's not crazy to think that YouTube would have been spun out as a separate company because it was already a subsidiary.  It already has a CEO.  Right.  You know, so it is surprising in that sense.  I think I think you guys are overthinking this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's what I think this is all about.  We're professionals, Leo.  This is what we usually under think.  This is something new.  Here's here's what I think this is all about.  And I do believe them when they say this has been something.  The story is that Salman Kamengar came to the board years ago, like several years ago, and said, you know, you guys should think about this.  And then they've been chewing on it.  And something like this doesn't happen overnight.  It's probably been in the works for a year or so.  But here's what I really think is happening.  I think what really happened is that Larry wants to give wants to step down once Sundar Pichai to be CEO.  And because I think Larry's tired and he even kind of implies is tired of taking meetings about search and ads.  Yeah, he didn't want to go to those meetings anymore.  But he knows it would be a big hit if he said, I am I'm going to become executive chair.  And because truthfully, then this is my question.  Couldn't you do everything they've done without this?  This compartment, this is just what is a reord.  Many, many companies have done this.  Google themselves have done this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Larry is too big for the normal route.  The normal route is you become a VC.  I think this is hand waving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think this is all saying, pay no attention to the fact that I'm going to step down and Sundar is going to be the CEO.  I think you're right.  You're right in the tactical view, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But in the strategic view, I think they're also trying to build a company for the ages.  And if Larry gets a great proverbial cause.  I'm not saying that there aren't subsidiary benefits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  They're absolutely subsidiary benefits.  They're also subsidiary negatives.  Risks.  Risks because they've said specifically they're going to provide Q4 reports for every segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this makes Larry, as somebody said, a capital allocator.  That's really his job.  And that's what he says his job will be.  So to your point, he is a VC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We will rigorously.  This is the salient paragraph.  Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence.  In general, our model is to have a strong CEO who runs each business with Sergey and me in service to them as needed.  That means not running it.  I mean, service means, oh, you got to you.  You need some money.  Let me get the checkbook out.  He will rigorously handle capital allocation, rigorously handle capital allocation.  That term rigorously is interesting.  Sounds painful.  And work to make sure each business is executing well.  We'll also make sure we have a great CEO for each business and we'll determine their compensation.  In addition, with this new structure, and this is interesting that you pointed out, this doesn't have to be done, but they've said with this new structure, we plan to implement segment reporting for our Q4 results.  Google financials will be provided separately than those for the rest of the alphabet businesses as a whole.  They don't have to do that.  Sounds to me like there may be this will facilitate spin outs by doing spin offs by doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you say risks, Leo, when you say risks, think about this.  So now you have Larry and Sergey sitting there with a big pile of money that Google has produced on the jet.  That's still the growth engine.  And they've got all these CEOs.  They're no longer VPs of such and such a unit.  They're now CEOs of operating subsidiaries who have to come and say, I want X percent of Google's money to do this.  And then Larry and Sergey have to slice up the dough and hand it out to those CEOs.  It could actually create a lot more problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right, but here's the real risk is that I think we will be past the idea that Larry is a one hit wonder.  But let's just say that his hits are behind him.  Just for the sake of argument here.  Then you're right.  I don't know.  I'm just saying he has no great ideas.  If you were in the NBA, maybe.  OK, go ahead.  I believe fully that Larry Page doesn't matter.  He's going to live forever.  It's let me be clear.  He has many more huge incentive.  I'm just trying to say structurally.  But then then Matthew's point is right.  Then all you're doing is divvying up Google's money for the future.  But the other pressure on Google, which has been tremendous, is to diversify.  And that's a key part of this is 96 to 98 percent of their revenue is advertising.  So by taking Alphabet and by getting into new businesses, which may take a while to grow, but new businesses that are not ad supported purely.  Then that diversifies the corporation as a whole.  And that's been another huge pressure on them.  But it only works if they create new businesses.  And that's highly risky, like all entrepreneurial ventures are.  And that's where they really are.  So they're going to allocate capital.  But unlike just a Warren Buffett, they're not going to just buy things.  They're going to build new things and build entirely new industries.  High risk.  I return.  I growth.  So I think that's the audacious goal.  Then the divvying up of Google's money shouldn't be an issue because there should be lots more money to be made by all these other divisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the meantime, in the meantime, instead of having operating VPs of this and that, they have a bunch of CEOs who are all now who all now think I'm the CEO of this damn thing.  I don't have to, you know, I should be running X company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My guess is that if they're going to get good CEOs, they're going to let them do what they want.  They're going to give them total autonomy.  Right.  And if they make money, then they'll have to be known as it's it's serfdom.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a feudal system.  It's a feudal system.  And he's the lord of the manner.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's listen.  That's guys.  That's I've worked in many companies where newspaper chains where you had 20 newspapers each had a CEO.  But you know what they did every month?  They give a bag of money to HQ.  Right.  HQ decided what to do with that.  That's quite normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, good.  That's what's going to happen.  And will Larry have to go to meetings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Only if he wants to.  No, only if it's on the jet.  Oh, Leo meetings come to Larry.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So my point, do you do you do not think that this is retirement for Larry Page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because I think that I think retirement from the day to day from Google.  I think it's I think it's Larry returning to his youth to build the new Google.  Yeah.  It's a promotion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Retirement means you get to do what you want.  If you want to putter in the garden, you get to putter in the garden.  Yeah, but he's going to have higher goals than that.  He's going to build.  Of course he is.  But it's to me it was it was.  I mean, if I'm Larry Page, I'm sitting here, I'm going, God, I have to take another meeting  on what color the home page banner should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or your regulators up our ass.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sundar, could you take this call for me?  He doesn't want to run it day to day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But who's going to referee between all those CEOs?  Who's going to decide where that Google money goes?  Ruth Porat.  It's very clear.  They are the allocators.  They are the allocators.  That's Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  George Bush is the decider.  Larry is the allocator.  Isn't though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what's what's Sergey's role in all of this?  What's his role now?  Project X.  Big ideas.  See, Sergey, in my opinion, Sergey did this a few years ago.  Yeah.  And Larry's looking at Sergey going, man, he's got this project X.  He's having fun.  He's zooming around.  Doesn't wear shoes.  Rocket ships.  And me, I'm sitting in the meeting about what color the Google banner is.  Can we pay for his fun?  So he's I bet you he's you know, he's going to watch his philanthropy, see what happens  with his philanthropy.  He's got a foundation.  Watch what happens with Project X plus one.  The Larry Page version.  I think this and but what would have happened if if instead of this Google went through  some sort of reorg and Larry said, I'm now I'm going to be the go join the board and  Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Google.  How would the market have reacted to that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, no, I agree.  I agree.  And he has handed Sundar a kind of, you know, a ball of something, something that's going  to be something, something that might be unpleasant.  I mean, do you think Sundar was pushing for this?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But maybe I think Sundar was proving himself from day one.  I think Sundar, the respect that Sundar clearly has in in that world is and that's a world  where there's some, you know, there's some backbiting.  Sundar is beloved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's very impressive.  And I'm sure he wanted to be a CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what's interesting to me is Omid, who's also much respected, who came back in  important roles.  One of the stories said that he now becomes an advisor to Alphabet and Google.  That was I don't know what I don't know the terminology behind that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So here's my theory on all this.  You're going to love this, Jeff.  So my theory is this has been in the works for several years.  I've heard up to four years and I believe that they had a feeling there was a couple  of executives that thought that they would end up in the coveted CEO role.  One of them was Vik and Dhotra.  The other one was Sundar Pichai.  And Vik and Dhotra made a big power play with Google Plus by taking everything under his  wing and Keke and Vince Larry and Sergey to allow him to connect everything to his project.  And then at some some we'll hear about this in 10 years when we read Jeff Jarvis's book  about this.  But at some point Sundar Pichai won that.  And that's why Vik and Dhotra left a year ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's exactly what happened.  That's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sundar took Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chrome OS made it a success.  Took Android when Rubin left.  Made it continued its growth.  And is quietly operating in the background making friends building businesses.  And won.  He won.  And this is his reward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know how much faith we should put in them but there are rumors that Sundar had had at least one CEO offer.  Possibly more.  Interesting.  Well Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wasn't he a contender for Microsoft's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They mentioned his name.  I don't think he was.  And Twitter apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although I don't know how much there is to that.  Oh god can you imagine?  What would make you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What a horrific step that would have been.  Sundar we were gonna make you CEO but enjoy the Twitter.  Yeah.  You get a free account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get a free job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be the biggest what was I thinking.  Oh my god I could have had a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I could have had a B8.  Would be a challenge.  Do you think that's interesting you brought up Omid Korda Stani.  It's interesting that he went back just a few days ago.  Yeah.  That's very interesting.  He was their first business.  Their first CFO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he went back.  That was a few days ago.  But he went back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well he's been working on it for the summer.  But Larry on August 10th.  August 10th was two days ago said there's you know said he's now going to be a part of  Alphabet.  The advisor.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  But what was the.  Oh.  Name's Rosalind N. Who was in charge of revenue.  He left the company to become an investor.  N is for.  D Keshe.  D Keshe Aurora.  Oh yeah.  Keshe Aurora.  So when Nkeshe left.  Right.  That's when I think Omid kind of came back into the chief revenue role.  And so I don't know whether Omid was also another candidate for CEO of Google.  I doubt that.  I think it was pretty clear a year ago that it was it was Sundar.  But Omid is also much respected.  He's staying.  He's an advisor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A year ago Larry Page said in a little bit we're going to make this Alphabet thing.  I'm going to step down.  And I need you as part of a senior management team to help me do this reorg.  Here's what I think.  Omid was doing it all behind the scenes.  This is who is working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.  OK.  That makes sense.  That makes a lot of sense.  He's the guy to do it right.  Constiglieri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  He went off to a cottage much like Matthews in the woods with a lake.  He spent a year doing this.  If I did that I wouldn't get anything done.  That makes me wonder what Matthews up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No that makes sense.  Here's I mean if you're going to pick a guy to do that.  Somebody from out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that.  That now makes sense.  I couldn't forget because Omid is so respected there.  So like Sundar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Help us do the reorg.  And I bet you that kind of what's underlying it is hey I want to do this day to day.  But I don't want it to look bad to the market and to investors that Google is now going  to be a rudderless ship with who's this Sundar guy.  I want to make this look good.  And I think Alphabet makes it all.  Look at the stock market.  Yeah.  Now what are there any.  This is something I don't know.  Maybe you guys do because I'm not a financial guy but are there tax or financial consequences  benefits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or is it just not the structure.  You got to figure the roof flat higher was critical to this.  And what do you think Anderson left because of this.  No I don't know but I would imagine that Ruth had to be key to not structuring was the CFO.  Yeah I think her hiring was because of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anderson was Apple.  She's perfect for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I was going to say who was the guy before for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She got hired in the spring.  What was the.  She joined in May.  Replacers replacing you'll find this.  If only there was a site five years at Morgan Stanley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chat room come on chat room you're feeling us.  Come on come on you can do it.  Patrick Pichette.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Patrick Pichette yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh you evidently did it apparently you know did a good job people liked him and so on but wasn't the kind of power when Ruth was hired she was seen as a powerhouse hire.  And since then the results have been making people happy and she's got it into shape and I saw I think the structuring I bet she had a huge role in the structuring and so now to answer your question you know it depends on how it's done.  I mean because now what now what's possible is you could set up Nest as a Dutch company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know that is one of the financial issues Google and a lot of big tech companies have now is that most a lot of their cash is overseas to avoid US taxation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not repatriated if repatriated it would take a lot of a lot of loss.  So what can you do can you create an end you know they invested 100 million dollars a year in Europe and a VC fund which I still think is is a little small for what what they need to do but they're doing interesting things there you could imagine.  They're doing things there you could imagine them creating entirely new divisions new companies rather new companies in India Europe in South America in Asia.  And that they could then use that capital expatriated for another company there I don't know I'm not no I'm believing I'm no financial person either or certainly not a tax person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They could attach bags of cash to balloons and float across borders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But when you think about it and those balloons would provide Internet access yes along with cash but it feels to me like and I don't know this either but a holding company is probably going to be treated significantly differently tax wise than an operating company like Google.  I don't know that but it feels to me like there's got to be a difference there.  Maybe there is a benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well a lot of these companies will probably lose a lot of money and their tax benefits for losing money.  So who knows.  Who knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's interesting.  Is that kind of stuff is black art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah I mean Calico is going to be on welfare for like a decade.  Well that's why you don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm puzzled because you don't really want to tell people how much these companies are losing because they're all we've known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But don't forget the smartest analysis analysts know that losses are a good thing when you have a highly losing let me.  So this makes it easier to balance.  That goes back to your question of of you know Christmas with daddy Larry.  How you know how much how much is in my stocking.  That that's not just about Google revenue it's also about the tax structure here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm reading an article in the MIT technology review by Robert Hoff.  He says Google's new structure has few historical precedents and techs are outside it and that it's a fairly risky proposition.  He says and he quotes a number of experts in finance and management that this they're going to have to spin off the companies that are worth something.  In particular these pieces that do not perform need to become independent companies in the reasonably near term not just remain part of Larry and Sergey's big technology sandbox.  The strategy only makes sense if they spin these companies off.  Investors want to see results before we're dead and Calico while it's trying to prolong life forever is not likely to see results until people are dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody's holding companies holding companies typically traded at a you know sometimes a very sharp discount to operating companies.  So there's going to be eventually a discount on the stock.  The timing of the reorg.  This is a different company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a different company.  This is not as we've already said it's not Buffett.  It's not P&G.  It's a different beast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But in fact it's even more risky.  I mean Bercher Hathaway is a day at the beach compared to.  But that's a big risk big return.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is this is the theory in this article is that some of the investments that Google made are about to cross.  They have passed the biggest risk point and are about to cross into profitability.  There are already according to a fellow at Stanford's Rock Center for Corporate Governance there are already two or three possible Googles in the portfolio.  They mentioned Nest self-driving cards and Project Loon all of which have crossed the risk point which means that they're that they would be a very smart thing to spin out.  And if you I mean imagine if you did you did kind of calve three or four new Googles out of Alphabet.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's not forget how you can spin them out too.  No you could just create new new capital by selling 10 percent of them.  Yep.  And control to the market.  Yeah.  And you thus create capital that's useful for the next new divisions.  And that's really what's possible here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this article says that the companies that are going to make money need to be spun out.  Then and finally concludes in any case the sweeping reorganization sets Google on Alphabet on a path that may be difficult to change in the future if it doesn't work because it's more than simply a promise to report the financial results of Google and the alphabet separately.  It demonstrates their commitment but it gives them less less flexibility in the future for better or worse.  Page and Brin have made a bet on which they can't easily rename.  Well it gives them less flexibility if they fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a high stakes.  They succeed.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a high stakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that may suggest that what where the name came from.  Alpha.  Alpha.  So Alpha.  In fact Larry says that.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He mentioned that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a bet to be the Alpha company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Wall Street Journal has a piece quoting a guy who says a tax and accounting expert says there are no obvious tax benefits.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because it's really it's a reorg.  Yeah.  And I mean as long as you shift the stock over to Alphabet which you've done.  Yeah.  Then it's just a reorg.  The naming doesn't make that much difference.  Yeah.  You know what's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Other companies should look at Google not not because they did this but how they did it.  It's so much more exciting than a regular reorg.  If you just said we're going to shift an operating unit over to this other thing.  No one would people would fall asleep during while you were saying that sentence.  But Google has this cool name and it's got a new logo and it's it's this huge.  It's huge.  Future looking thing.  It's basically just a restructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there a new logo.  I haven't seen a new logo yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if they have one.  Andy Biao came up with one.  Because I won't thank you.  I just take it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The the you know the other issue.  John Payton who's a newspaper executive.  Matthew and I both know well had a really interesting tweet right afterwards who said that what newspaper companies would have the courage to.  Basically isolate their past.  That would make the company the future.  And so in a sense you hate to imagine that Google is just the past.  Google is the old thing.  But the company didn't want to.  You know part of what I said too was that Google was seen too much as just a search engine a search engine a search engine.  I've long argued for years on this show that no it's much more than a search engine and it's much more even than an advertising behemoth.  It's a personal services company that moves past the mass market to treat people as individuals.  It's huge in that way and all these services.  The BBC had me try to name every Google service I could in 20 minutes 20 seconds and there's so mail and maps and so on and so forth.  There's so much there.  But yes Google is in a sense it's past.  If you took a newspaper company if they were if they spin it spun off the difference is that Google has a future and newspapers don't.  But if you spun off that past and or not were isolated that passage they fenced that past and made the essence of the company the future.  That's really what Larry just did.  He made the essence of this company his future which is yet unknown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in a way of course John Payton tried to do that.  I don't want to get off topic but with digital media and unfortunately as you pointed out print still produces a bunch of revenue but that revenue is declining dramatically.  I mean 10 15 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it also requires that we have a future strategy.  Exactly.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's that's another show.  Nobody's arguing that Google is anywhere near the same position.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it is interesting that there was an effort to say listen folks we are you keep on thinking of us as a search engine.  You think of us that of that as a business where there's a hiccup in ad rates you say oh my god you think of us that regular regulatory terms.  Oh my god you promoted this on search.  Nobody was seeing Google itself properly and still doesn't in and of itself I think.  But then they also didn't know what that would be a TF to do with self driving cars and and medical contact lenses and balloons and all this other stuff.  It just didn't make sense.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does.  From the public point of view it streamlines stream rationalizes the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so that brings up another question.  Why not take Android out of Google and make that an operating subsidiary too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It feels like they kept all the good stuff.  Yeah.  Sundar and I.  Once again.  I think I'd like to keep.  OK.  Look you take the project Loon but I'll keep Android.  Is that OK.  And can I have the Terminator robot too or is that too much.  No.  How about YouTube.  I'll tell you what.  You keep Calico.  I'll take YouTube.  How about that.  Was there where they put all the cards on the table and like have a Dutch auction for the parts.  They kept all the good parts.  Yeah.  Did they keep any money losing divisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  90 percent of the money the companies that went into Google the new Google make 90 percent of Google's revenue.  I have almost all of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why don't I take Twit and spin off an operating unit.  Actually it is not an unheard of thing.  For instance if we're considering and we have been considering buying a building you wouldn't buy it as Twit.  You would buy it as a separate operating division.  You create a new LLC and then why do you do that.  And then you rent another company you rent back to Twit.  Oh I see right.  I don't understand.  You could you could get the URL ABC BFD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The building would be owned by a numbered company listed in the Cayman Islands typically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is this is this is not unusual at all in business.  In fact Lisa's prior job which was working for a massive development company every development they did was a separate LLC.  At one point she was managing well over 100 LLC's.  So so that's very it's not a bad way to do things because it does kind of separate the structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come to think of it that's how Trump runs his business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's everybody else is a loser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're all stupid.  You're stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The reason why people kept thinking of Berkshire Hathaway is that Berkshire Hathaway started with the thing that makes the money.  Right.  And so there's this core business that just spins off vast amounts of cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's very different right.  It's just a holding company right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  But Warren so Warren invests that cash in other things.  He doesn't build things.  He doesn't not trying to cure cancer.  You know he just buys a bit of like Coca-Cola and a bit of Dairy Queen and a bit of whatever.  But it's it's a similar strategy.  You have a money spewing thing at the core and then that gets doubled out to different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's been great to watch everybody from Danny Sullivan to you Matthew to you Jeff kind of try to piece tease out the meaning in all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My favorite was when it first happened when the when the announcement first came out.  I happened to be looking at Twitter.  And of course and because my eyes were happened.  Happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Happened.  Or is it just something you do all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The first was the first things I saw were literally WTF with a bunch of exclamation marks.  Just people because the first response was what the hell is going on.  What does this even mean.  What.  I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was my reaction.  We were on the air when we got the word we were doing iOS today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My first reaction was that it was a joke or something like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a reporter coming to me saying I presume you've heard this.  We want to talk to you about about this.  What.  And I was driving.  So I literally pulled off the road to go look because it's too big to just ignore and get to it.  Ten minutes.  How much we need self-driving cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff you could have just kept going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know I think I think for years people called for Microsoft to split into two or three divisions.  You know operating systems.  I can't remember what they were now.  And they should have.  Maybe they should have.  Maybe there would be more value now.  I don't know.  But this isn't quite the same thing is it.  Because Microsoft did do many a reorg.  In fact when such an Adele came and he vastly reorganized the company Google reworks before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think what people were thinking about was you know Microsoft had windows and particularly office as the thing that basically spewed out all the cash.  Right.  And they could have kind of separated that and then hardware and cloud maybe.  I guess.  Where they tried new things like mobile.  Right.  Of course.  Oh that's the other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where does the where is the whole cloud division of Google go.  That stayed in Google right.  Yeah.  Yes.  That's it.  I mean that strikes me that could be a separate infrastructure company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really feels like the company we care about people.  The number one tweet I got was what are you going to call it this week in alphabet now.  Yeah.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A hundred times that working.  Oh you're a.  You're a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well.  Nice.  I'd like to make an announcement.  How did you get that so fast.  Welcome to the new this week in alphabet.  Tuiya.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had to have a new logo this week in alphabet.  Tuiya.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was handed that.  Well handed that in a digital sense from Anthony right before the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're not going to do that.  But we can if we want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could.  We have the means.  We can do it on the fly.  We have the technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel like really what happened is that all the good stuff was kept at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So here's here's the way I look at it.  Google is still Google.  And then what Larry Page did was he created his own private Silicon Valley where he is  the one and only VC and everything else is a start.  That's interesting.  Google is the company and then plus there are seven startups and they're going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But what does somebody worth 30 billion dollars like Larry do when they retire.  They become a VC.  They play God.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So what are we talking about self driving cars though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to be really hard.  It's like a gender switch.  It's you know it's starting to call Caitlyn Jenner she.  What are we going to say Alphabet drive the self driving cars or we're still going to  say Google self driving car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well you know yeah it's all good.  That's an interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good point.  That doesn't have the same ring at all.  So they only spin off moonshots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No because that's not a moonshot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're startups.  They're startups.  OK.  But next is about YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean Nest.  Nest and YouTube are both operate companies.  They have revenue.  They have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Nest is a unicornish sort of startup the kind of a pretty new.  I mean it's you know.  Listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  YouTube is still an advertising based.  Listen Google.  Look at it this way.  Everything that's advertising based is in Google.  Everything else is technology based in various ways.  More hardware based oddly.  Nest cars and so on and so forth.  Biomedical stuff.  That's all hardware.  That's off in new divisions.  What about advertising is Google.  Google fiber is spud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Android doesn't fit that model at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Android should.  Yeah.  What does it.  Hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Android.  No.  Android.  Well yeah I thought about that.  But Android.  No Android.  Exactly.  OK.  And it is a signal generator because Android.  So they need those to be tightly coupled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They need this.  They don't need to own it.  Well but if you own it.  They need to control it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tightly couple it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No because Android.  Here's my argument.  Matthew.  Matthew.  Here's my argument there.  Google coming out with a $50 phone.  There is no money to be made for the manufacturers for Android.  It's going to get worse and worse and worse for there.  So it's not going to be a very good company on its own.  But it's an important enabling technology for not only Google but for everybody else  to spread mobile.  So it's a necessary step but it's not going to be a great business.  Android is never going to be a great business.  I do have a feeling though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean Leo you were joking about this but it feels to me like to some extent this reorganization  says you know Google is boring and not much is going on there and it's I'm sick of it.  It's a risk.  But it produces a bunch of cash.  So we'll just let Sundar run it.  And it kind of makes it feel you know it downplays Google to some extent even though it does  produce all the money.  Sundar is going to surprise us isn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Sundar I think what Larry has a vote of faith in Sundar here that says that you're  the junior Larry.  No but the key is it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why?  What doesn't matter?  It doesn't matter if Google goes up or down.  It doesn't?  Not to Larry.  Larry's more interested in everything else.  It provides all the money.  Well that's a good point but he's got enough money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Google, Matthew what you're really asking is will Google surprise us and innovate?  Will it come up with a new Android or a new Chrome or anything?  Maybe not.  I think it will.  I think it will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well but why, what's the incentive to, I guess the incentive would be that you might get  your own company under the alphabet umbrella.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Again Google started as, that's why I keep on saying everybody still sees Google as a  search engine.  It wasn't even an ad company.  It became an ad company.  Then it became a platform company.  Then it became a personal services company.  It became a navigation company.  It became all these things that do fit together under the rubric of advertising supported  personal services.  That's to me what Google is and entertainment in the form of YouTube.  And distribution in the form of YouTube.  But it all to me fits together there and no there could be big surprises left.  But what if, here's what I guess I'm saying is, if Sundar wants to start his self-driving  planes, he probably won't be allowed to because it just won't fit.  He's got to have something strategically that fits with Google as a division and its mission.  There's not an alphabet within Google.  Would they ever spin off Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they might.  Or part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why not?  I don't think they would simply because why would they?  They're gazillionaires and they love it and it's their life.  I just think even if it made sense financially, I don't think they'd do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't create any more capital than they already have.  That's in a capital market.  You'd spin off the other things that are undervalued within it.  Google is valued properly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room says, yeah, but what happens to Orkut?  It's gone.  They closed it.  We're going to take a break.  Actually, what happens to Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Larry said that was the one comment that he answered in this entire discussion.  We still like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Doesn't mean we're going to keep it around.  He said we still love it.  We still love it.  I love it.  We all love it.  We all love it.  Nobody's not saying we don't love it.  Just saying.  Sometimes you have to put things down.  It might be the loved one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that was part of the question too is that people said, well, this requires Larry  to be ruthless.  He's been ruthless.  He's killed things.  He's killed the beloved.  He's been more than ruthless.  Yeah.  It comes to his detriment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It requires him to not be required to do anything he doesn't want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I think.  I'm honest to God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I really think that from a personal point of view, this is just Larry retiring.  Retirement.  But retirement in the sense that a Larry Page retirement, much like a Sergey Brin retirement,  would be a very active retirement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Larry is bumping himself upstairs to the moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Had he not split these companies out, it would have been a bad thing for the stock market.  Oddly enough, by doing it this way, and fortunately he has somebody who has a high quality Sundar  Pichai, which the market probably thinks very highly of, he was able to add 5% to the market

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who else besides Vick and Sundar could have been candidates for CEO over the years?  Yeah.  Kim Armstrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There have been some, but Sundar has really shown that he can run a division.  He's not what I would call inspiring.  He's boring.  He's boring, although my experience with him has been really, I've always been very impressed  with him.  Very smart, very charming.  He's charming.  I got in an argument with him early on about whether Chrome OS made any sense at all.  Instead of getting upset, he listened and it was very coherent in his response and persuasive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The one word people tend to use is dependable.  So not exciting, but you can count on him to deliver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So basically he's got the engine room.  Larry said, I don't want to spend any more time down here shoveling coal.  Scotty.  Scotty.  Take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Larry said beam me up to an entire place.  I want to look at the stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Larry is Kirk and Sergey is Spock.  Spock or vice versa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But who's a wholo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who's Sulu in this?  Tony Fidel.  Tony Fidel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Before we leave it, let's make one more note.  The three immigrants from India in this country running three huge companies.  Isn't that amazing?  And what an argument for changing our immigration structure to say that the amount of talent  that we could have here if we weren't so short-sighted and stupid about this.  Prachai, Nadella, who's the third?  Oh, I'm forgetting how suddenly it was in the story.  What company?  I forgot.  I'm spacing too.  Sorry, I brought it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you want facts on the show?  We don't do facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just do blab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll take a break.  We'll talk about a mattress.  You take a nap.  We'll come back and then you'll know.  Our show today brought to you by Casper.  Oh, I love my Casper, an online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost.  We got Casper for our guest room.  We got Casper.  I mean, we kind of went all in on Casper.  We got Casper for my son in college.  And there's our queen size Casper.  Now, this is nice because it comes in a fairly compact box.  So that's why I got it for my son in college.  It was very easy to transport up three flights of stairs, no elevator.  Open it up and there he is.  The mattress opens up and it's beautiful.  It's comfortable.  Combining latex and memory foam for both support and comfort.  Just the right sink and bounce.  It's risk free because even though you're buying it online,  you have 100 nights to return it at no cost to you.  So you literally can sleep on it for 100 nights, say, you know, I decide I don't want this.  They will send a courier who will come and get it.  You will have paid zilch.  You refunded all your money, zero.  And I think what they do is donate it to charity, which is kind of nice.  Everybody wins.  Except Casper.  You're not going to return it.  You're not going to return it.  You're going to love it as much as we do.  Casper mattresses proudly made in the USA.  They are comfortable.  You'll love them.  And because they're selling direct to you, the price is right.  It starts at $500 for a twin.  In fact, even less because you can say $50 when you go to Casper.com slash twig and use the promo code twig.  $50 off your new Casper.  It is revolutionizing the mattress industry.  No resellers, no showrooms mean the savings go right in your pocket.  Casper, C-A-S-P-E-R dot com slash twig.  We love our Caspers.  And I asked Henry, he was home for the summer.  And I said, how do you like Casper?  He loves it.  He's loved it.  He's moved it to the new place.  He just got another place.  Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Moved it over.  They're easy to move too.  Sometimes you move a mattress or like a futon or something like that and you just can't get a handle on it.  These fold up.  These fold up.  You can move them easily.  They're really nice that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  He really loves his Casper.  He says the ladies do too.  I don't know what that means.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't tell you.  Let's not go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is though how they advertise on the Howard Stern Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know they do.  I know they do.  I had a waterbed in college.  This is not a recipe for romance.  You would have.  You would have.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Splash, splash, splash.  It was terrible.  You can't get a purchase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had a California king size waterbed in high school.  Yeah.  Me too.  Yeah.  And it was like, it was ridiculous.  Well, it never stops.  It just is like, yeah, it's like being on a ship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're not exactly.  We're close enough in age that when we were that age, I was in college, you were in high  school, that was the thing to have.  Yeah.  It was awesome.  It was a terrible idea.  Yes.  It was before the internet, right?  Yeah.  We didn't have, there was no one to tell us.  Don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Check it.  So.  There was no one to make fun of us.  So I have eight Indian executives from Forbes in the chat, the rundown.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In the top, in the Fortune 500?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty amazing.  It is.  Have we covered everything we need to say?  Yes, we still love Google Plus.  BMW will not sell Alphabet.com to Alphabet.  But they got aabc.xyz, which is actually pretty good.  And you know what that means?  Doesn't it give xyz.xyz some legitimacy?  It does.  It does.  In the past, you would have said, oh, yeah, go to twit.xyz and people go, what do you  mean, twit.com.xyz?  What do you mean?  Now you just, it's real.  Who owns xyz?  Google probably.  Yeah.  No.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  The chat room will tell us.  But before we go on, Leo, if I may.  Yes.  I have a prepared statement about the name Google.  Nobody seems to know, and this shows obviously the perfect place to talk about this, nobody  seems to know what the origin of Google is.  Everybody tells the story that it's a big number.  It's a one with 100 zeros.  G-O-O-G-L or whatever.  G-O-L, yes.  Oh yeah, G-O-L.  And there's another story that's in the rundown now about Raymond Chandler, who in 1953 wrote  a letter to his agent that referenced Google as a pseudo sci-fi style of writing where  he mentioned-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is going to get fans going crazy because it makes fun of sci-fi.  It's worth reading for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Raymond Chandler, who was one of the great genre writers mocking another genre?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  But that is not the origin either.  The origin is in 1919.  Okay?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  And one of the characters of that cartoon was named George Google?  So the cartoonist was Billy DeBec and he created a character in 1919 named Barney Google.  Oh, Barney Google, yeah.  Barney Google.  I want you to read that.  Yeah, Jason, if you can find it-  The Googly Eyes.  Yes, that song.  Yes, that was a song that was a very popular cartoon and that song was written as a popular  song about the cartoon character.  And he had a horse named Sparkplug who's always trying to convince to win races and Sparkplug  was a real pain in the neck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm playing the theme right now, Jason, if you have my audio.  Yeah.  Why didn't we ever think to make that our theme?  Yeah, there you go.  This is our new theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This sounds like the Sousa version of it.  There's actually a popular singer version of this that's-  This is not it?  No, this isn't it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The only question is why would they choose that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so here's why they chose it.  They didn't choose it from the cartoon.  They chose it from the mathematician, but the mathematician in 1940, his name was Milton  Sarata.  No, I'm sorry, there was a nine-year-old boy-  His kid, yeah.  Yeah, there was a nine-year-old boy named Milton Sarata and his uncle was mathematician  Edward Kasner.  That's right.  Edward Kasner went to the kid and said, give me a great name for a really big number.  And the kid who's a fan of the cartoon said, Google.  But here's the interesting-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I knew that story as a kid.  I remember that story as a kid.  But he spelled it properly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  The original Barney Google, the Google was spelled G-O-O-G-L-E and the mathematician  changed the spelling to G-O-O-G-O-L for 10 times 10 to the 100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  But the origin is a cartoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I remember as a kid, we all thought, oh, that was the largest number, one with 100 zeros  after it and-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Huh.  Why would we think that as kids?  Well, why not?  A million zeros.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why that?  Yeah.  But that's what it was.  So given Larry and Sergey's obvious knowledge of that, I think that- have they ever spoken  out- did you ever ask them, Jeff, why the name?  Oh.  By the way, this is funny because if you read this bit from Raymond Chandler, it was a letter  to his agent in which he's kind of- he says, did you ever read what they call science fiction?  It's a scream.  It's written like this, quote, I checked out with K-19 on Adabaron 3 and stepped out through  the cremaillite hatch on my 22 model Sirius hardtop.  I cocked the timejector in secondary and waded through the bright blue mandagrass.  My breath froze into pink pretzels.  I flicked on the heat bars and the brilis ran swiftly on five legs, using their other  two to send out Krylon vibrations.  The pressure was almost unbearable, but I caught the range on my wrist computer through  the transparent cystocytes.  I pressed the trigger.  The thin violet glow was ice cold against the rust-colored mountains.  The brilis shrank to half an inch long and I worked fast, stepping on them with the  Pultex.  But it wasn't enough.  The sudden brightness swung me around and the fourth moon had already risen.  I had exactly four seconds to hot up the disintegrator and Google had told me it wasn't enough.  He was right.  They pay for this crap?  Asks Raymond Chandler.  Nice.  Google told me it wasn't enough.  It was enough.  I think Google's a thing in this, but a person.  Apparently he's done the same thing with TV.  This is a good article.  You know, a little kudos to Vlad Savov writing in The Verge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So going back to Google, sorry.  Oh, really?  Don't apologize.  Believe me, he's Canadian.  There was an article in The Wall Street Journal, 2004, that mentions Milton Serrata and Kazder,  who came up with Google.  And it says that Kazder, so his great niece says she thinks Kazder tweaked the spelling  to avoid trademark issues.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  But there's no interview with Larry and Sergey about this.  Not that I've been able to find.  They've never been caught on record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was there ever a case of the owner of Barney Google having a fight here?  Who owns Barney Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Kazder thought about suing Google at one point.  Really?  But never did.  Yeah.  Did he trademark?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is odd.  Should have sued them for a Google dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'll take one to the one hundredth damage.  Is there anything else to talk about?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Are we done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Everything pales secondary to alphabet.  Did we mention last week Android One is being relaunched?  Apparently it was kind of a flop.  The idea of selling a hundred dollar phone in developing nations, apparently that's still  too expensive.  Yep.  They're going to relaunch it with phones less than 50 bucks, which might even still be too  expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even as low as 30.  The range they're targeting now is 30 to 50 dollars in India.  Just India is where they're starting.  And I just can't imagine how you make that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am so impressed by this Moto G.  Yeah.  But that's a 200 dollar phone.  Yeah.  Although that's what they charge.  I wonder what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason, what did you guys have to say on Android about the Verizon ending the.  No more subsidies.  Subsidies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, we didn't actually talk about Verizon last night.  Sorry, we talked about an ad infinitum on every other show.  We spent a lot of time on Alphabet as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a model for reducing the cost of the phone is that kind of subsidy structure.  But at that scale, it doesn't work in India, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that's one point, which is that subsidized phones are kind of a unique to the United  States situation.  Yes.  Because it's a scam.  Yes.  I agree.  It would be prohibited by any sensible regulator.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or consumer marketplace.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, that's an interesting thing.  Why do consumers put up with this?  Do they not know it's a scam?  They do not know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's short-term thinking.  They think, well, I get a cheap phone now.  It's only 200 bucks.  Right.  And they think it's not a subsidy.  Everybody calls it a subsidy.  A subsidy is when money comes from somewhere else and comes to you.  A subsidy is not where you pay for it later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not a line item on your bill.  It will be from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why it works because it's all muddled in there.  But let's say you spend an extra $25 per month on your bill for the two-year contract.  After two and a half years, you keep paying that $25.  And after another year, it's a wonderful business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It clears the scam when you change your plan and they say, oh, by the way, that's going  to be another two years you owe us.  It's very, very...  I like it to the dry cleaner who gives you a bag when you first start using the dry cleaner  with their name on it.  And then you say after a year, hey, thanks very much, but I'm going to go across the  street.  Yeah, that's fine.  But there'll be $150 for the bag.  We have an early termination fee here at the dry cleaner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or it's like your cable company, your cable company rents you your router or your modem  or whatever and it's $15 a month.  You've paid for that thing 15 times by the time a couple of years go by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cable companies in the US, I don't know how it is in Canada, but in the US, they're even  worse than that.  They actually do have early termination fees.  So if you sign up for a deal as I did, an internet deal, it runs for a year with Comcast.  And I went and I said, well, I've got business class service now.  I want to cancel mine.  They said, well, okay, but that's going to cost you $150 early termination fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well do you guys have when you...  Let's say you want to get out of your cell phone contract, you have to buy out the remainder  of the contract?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  I mean, that's an early term...  ETF.  I think what's broken this is that the number four carrier, maybe number three or number  four carrier T-Mobile, and I guess Sprint sort of started doing this too, started saying  we'll pay your fees to move to T-Mobile.  And that started the whole crumbling of ZFs.  And then T-Mobile went to that month to month no subsidized phones and Verizon is now doing  it and I can only imagine AT&T and Sprint will do the same soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a perverse logic to it if you think about it though, because you're essentially  screwing over a customer you've already lost.  So why not take a parting shot and get an extra 100, squeeze another 150 bucks out of  them, they're leaving anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So making this all explicit is certainly going to put price pressure on phones.  Apple will never go down.  Apple's still at 650.  But this Moto G, and even the Moto X, the high end Moto is less than, is what, 400 bucks?  This Moto G is every bit as far as I'm concerned is the same as the original Moto X for 200  bucks.  It's faster, it's snappier, in fact it's snappier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Today I actually went in the Apple store.  There's various things happening here and there and everywhere.  I really should have an iPhone.  I really should be able to use it too.  You should.  Yeah, you should.  But Jesus, you know, so I go in and I look at the C, the 5C, the cheapest one, you can  get 450 bucks and it's not half the fold that Moto G is.  And it's three years old.  What?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's outrageous.  Well, you know, the new Apple phones are coming out next month, which means the old ones will  be reduced a little bit.  But still, they'll be reduced to what, $550?  You know, I wonder if this is going to impact Apple, this loss of this subsidy.  The fact that you'll know how much that iPhone has lost.  I think it will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think the Chinese economy and all that is going to affect them.  I think Apple's in for another rough year or two, comparatively speaking.  They'll do fine.  Don't worry about Apple, folks.  They'll be fine.  But I think that they had a big spike because of China, a big spike because of their giant  phones.  And that was a blip.  I don't think that was a trend.  It was an aberration.  Yeah, it wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, there's this kind of you tend to think of Apple as being home run after home run  after home run.  In fact, they had a few hits.  They had a few home runs.  Then they had a grand slam.  But you know, I don't think the watch is even a home run.  I don't think the iPad maybe is a home run.  They don't have another grand slam in their back.  A big iPad isn't going to save them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The new Apple TV isn't going to save them.  The home automation is not going to save them.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now back that up to if I made a Google for a second is that is that what if you look  at what Larry because because what was Google?  Google was Larry and Sergey's inspiration.  Since then, the other great inspirations of the company didn't really always flow from  them, whereas at Apple, everything had to flow from Steve.  True.  Yes.  Just throwing that out.  So I'm just trying to think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  From Steve flow through Steve.  He certainly in modern era CEOs was the biggest control freak, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you wanted to get your product idea to market, you had to go through Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you look at Gmail didn't come from Larry and Sergey.  Advertising didn't.  Yeah.  I mean, all those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then, you know, Google Plus Vic and Dottra had to go on a several year lobbying campaign,  right, to get that to to go through.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  It's interesting that one of the when I was talking about the odds that Google might buy  Twitter, especially since, you know, they've been kind of deemphasizing Google Plus to  some extent, maybe.  So the theory was, well, maybe this will make it more likely they're going to buy Twitter.  One of the responses was it's not a Larry size problem.  So basically Larry, Larry doesn't give a head about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the equivalent of Orson Welles saying I don't get out of bed for less than ten thousand  dollars.  Larry size.  Well, there that's kind of the writing on the wall.  We maybe should have paid more attention to that.  Larry doesn't isn't interested in the minutia, the day to day minutia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I also think Google Plus is from an era where everybody was freaking out that  Facebook was taking over the world.  Of course, Facebook is taking over the world, but not necessarily entirely with Facebook.com.  Now they're going after YouTube.  They're going after the messaging business.  They're going after all these other things.  But there was a period of time there where Facebook was directing all the track where  social social network, social networking was viewed for about a year as the only way in  the future you would be able to direct traffic and get eyeballs and do all that kind of stuff.  Now we kind of know where there's lots of ways to do that.  It wasn't really the big scary doomsday.  But they're all social, are they not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that's the risk for Google, I think, is social just keeps climbing as a as a means  of referring traffic and as a means for people to find things, to find content.  Google. So Google Plus, I don't want to say anything bad about it.  Google Plus has not achieved some of the goals that it set out to achieve.  What else does Google have?  I mean, look at Instagram or WhatsApp or Facebook has, you know, four out of the top  10 iOS apps in the world.  It's got billions of users for text messaging and photo sharing.  And what what does Google have to compete with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google. Google has Android and Google Now and Android is spinning out of its control,  which is a problem. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Google Now is great.  I feel like, well, OK, let's take a break because I want to ask about messaging.  Yeah, because I feel like that is a potentially fumbled opportunity on Google.  Yes. Yeah.  And I feel like messaging, it's very clear now that messaging is the app that you need  you know, need to own right now.  Yeah. But let's take a break and talk about that.  We also we've got news.  The Moto X will now be available starting September 3rd.  Motorola just tweeted that I just bought my OnePlus 2 thanks to you, Jeff Jarvis.  I bought it on. I bought it on Tuesday.  Says 15 to 20 days before it ships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm still not sure which to buy.  Still going to figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been looking at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love that. I don't have to think about it.  I mean, well, there's advantages and disadvantages.  On the one hand, I don't have to decide.  I just buy everything on the downside.  I have to pay for it all.  Yeah, that's not an inconsiderate considerable amount.  No, I would love to see that budget.  Oh, you bunga jinga.  This is the worst time of year.  You break up, you're going to have to report those numbers.  You know, I even not only have to buy it, but then I have to use them.  They're all over my operating system.  And you know what?  I'm getting 20 hours battery life in the Moto G.  I don't want to give it up, even though I made a butt ass ugly choice of colors.  Oh, come on, burgundy.  What is that? Burgundy and lime. Yeah.  It's it seemed like a good idea at the time.  Our show today brought to you by Linda.com.  Learning is a lifelong thing.  We all love to learn.

Transcript:  And here's a pro tip for people who have who want to do a tablet.  It's a lean back learning experience.  You get kick back on the couch, you do Chromecast it.  Oh, yeah. Nice.  Kick back, get a nice beverage and a giant hamburger  and sit there and enjoy yourself as it's really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good idea, because like for the photography courses,  you kind of want to have, let's say, light room on your laptop  and you're sitting with it on your lap watching the thing.  That is a good way to work. I like that. Linda dot com.  We should start a thing. How do you watch Linda dot com?  Exactly. Linda dot com slash twig to sign up for a free 10 day trial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was just a great feature about 12 men who were lucky to be married  to powerful companies in Silicon Valley.  I should be in that and I should be in there.  You well, yes.  But Linda and her husband were one of the 12. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  His last name is dot com, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, very well. Oh, nice. Very nice.  So, yeah, if you're choosing a phone, this is an interesting time of year, isn't it?  Because if is coming up in September, we know the Apple iPhone  will be announced September 9th.  I think the Apple iPhone is going to be such an incremental upgrade this year.  Yeah, yeah.  That I don't know if that's going to be something that's going to stimulate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And and we all paid so much for the first one. Right.  It's got to be just amazing to justify an upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Force touch, better camera, better processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's it. Force touch is a difficult thing to get excited about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I ordered the OnePlus 2, which has some not it's not.  It's got some question marks, too.  But it is type C, which I kind of like. Yeah.  The camera is becoming more and more important to me. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's the two new nexuses next.  I will be interested because they probably will have fingerprint.  They probably will have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel like, yeah, the OnePlus and the motos of a chewed  fingerprint readers where no, no, the OnePlus does have a very good fingerprint.  I take it back.  The OnePlus 2 has supposedly the best of the bunch.  The fastest fingerprint reader of them all. Yeah.  I feel like I I could live with that NFC, but I got to have fingerprint  just because of the convenience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got with their track record.  You have to wonder whether people are going to trust them with the fingerprint data.  Of course, a lot of the Android based, including Samsung's fingerprint reader,  has been hackable, et cetera.  And so that's something.  I'm not sure that they've demonstrated that they're a reliable company.  They certainly make high quality, low cost phones.  But they they've had some questionable judgment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was a presentation at Black Hat  researchers showing how hackers can attack your smartphone  and steal your fingerprint on a large scale.  That's not one zee two zee.  FireEye demonstrated ways to extract  fingerprints from the sensors in Samsung, Huawei and HTC devices.  One in particular, there were four attacks  dubbed the fingerprint sensor spying attack can harvest  fingerprints on a large scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's what's here's what's really, really scary about that.  Your fingerprint is permanent.  It's not like a password that they're stealing.  Like it's more like your social. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, you can even change your social, but you can't change your.  Exactly. This goes on the market and becomes out there.  You know, can somebody do with my fingerprint?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unlock my phone in 10 years from now. Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody showed no, there was a demo of that,  of taking your fingerprint and putting it on tape.  And, you know, I saw that at the time we came out with Apple.  Yeah, we managed to do it. Yeah.  But, you know, again, the sky could fall down tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple stores your fingerprint in a in a first of all,  they don't store the fingerprint, they store data points about your fingerprint.  A hash. And then second, they also store in a secure store,  which apparently Samsung doesn't do. Yeah.  I don't know. We'll have to find out what OnePlus does.  Yeah, we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, this is the those are two facts that we got to wait for.  One is what are the pictures actually look like?  They can talk all day about the camera.  No, I got to see the pictures.  And then the second thing is, you know, let's get the big security companies  and the hackers banging on their fingerprint reader and see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thursday, we're going to do the Samsung unveiled event.  That's going to be presumably, although we're not sure,  just the rumor mill has been very active.  The the new Galaxy S6 Edge Plus,  which is an oversized version of the S6 Edge, which I like a lot.  There's a great camera. Good looking phone.  I don't know if I want a bigger screen.  One of the things that's intriguing to me, this this G is a five inch screen.  And I kind of like it a little bit better.  I wish we were a little higher res screen.  But yeah, the battery life, I think, benefits from a low res screen. Yeah.  The Moto X is going to be the new Moto X Pure is going to be five point seven inches.  They'll Samsung will also announce its Note five.  Is that going to be six inches or they're going to stay with the five points?  Whatever it is.  Giant, giant phones are the are the wave of the future.  Apparently. So let's talk about messaging, because I think this is a really  interesting area. There was a good article in Wired.  Was it David Pierce, I think, who wrote the article in which he said,  can we just all agree on one messaging program?  Yeah, like they do in China, like in China, where they get great  benefits of this of scale for WeChat.  You can buy not only can you chat, you can buy train tickets,  get your laundry done. You can do all sorts of stuff.  There's gaming, gaming.  Facebook Messenger is the closest to becoming that in the US, I think. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. Maybe Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've already got they've already got payments. Yeah.  Everybody's on Facebook.  Almost everybody. But do people use the payments?  No, I've never seen anybody use it.  They say they've got a new a new feature called MoneyPenny  that will be a digital assistant.  Yeah. Now, the third party versions of that exist. Right.  You can say, please get my laundry and MoneyPenny will be human assistance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. That you use Facebook Messenger to us to conjure up. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the only way to do it.  You can't really bring my dry cleaning in as if you're a robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think they'll take your dry cleaning in.  I think I think they're going to function like Siri.  They'll get information for questions. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They will be like the Amazon mechanical Turk kind of. Exactly.  I think that's closer to interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your dry cleaning is going to have to wait for another technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are even, according to Pearson, this article, there are even WeChat  stars, much like their Vine stars.  Yeah. People who use WeChat as a broadcast medium.  Which I find kind of we've got to get in front of that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think his point is we can reach out every you've got all these apps  that focus on sort of one thing.  So you've got kick does something, you know, WhatsApp is for certain users  and Facebook Messenger is popular with some.  And then other people use this one or that one.  I'm trying to keep in touch with just a handful of friends, let alone my kids.  There's like five different apps that I have to use.  And I can't I'm not sure which one to use.  You use the wrong one.  The person never sees it because they're not service anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're kind of like the days where you couldn't text message  somebody who wasn't on your carrier or if your friends used I.C.Q.  then you had to use I.C.Q.  MSN or in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think you was so great because it was really underrated.  So we had a trillion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And Adi and Pigeon.  There were a few of these.  In Canada, everybody used MSN Messenger.  And here in the States, I think AIM was the big one. Right.  What happened when MSN Messenger went away?  Did they did people stop? What did they people just stop communicating?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They just stopped talking to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They went to their cabins. That's right.  No, I can use signals as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Blackberry and Blackberry Moose calls here here in the States.  Yeah, Blackberry, BBM, BBM.  But here in the States, what happened is everybody just started using  texts, messaging, SMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you remember how we were, how very late we were to that.  That's right. The world was on TV.  We didn't even close this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would say BBM came the closest in the last, like recently,  to sort of owning messaging.  And and I think there were a couple of things.  So they I remember when my daughter said she wanted a Blackberry.  And I said, what are you talking about?  Nobody wants a Blackberry.  What are you working government? What are you the president?  Yeah, everyone wants iPhones and stuff like that.  And she said, no, no, no.  I like the physical keyboard for BBM, but I have to have BBM  because all my friends use it.  And the main reason she told me they wanted it was read receipts.  So BBM was one of the first ones to have read receipts  in a sort of mainstream app.  And she said, if you text somebody, you know,  I did a pregnancy test last night and it's positive or whatever,  something related to your romantic encounter.  You want to know that they saw that thing right away.  And you want to know when they sort of saw it and when they replied.  So read receipts was a huge deal.  And for a variety of reasons that we can't go into because that's a whole program.  Blackberry basically screwed the pooch and BBM became,  you know, didn't become what it could have become.  Yeah, but it was close. Very close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, speaking of close, I feel like Google had  or has an opportunity with Hangouts, but doesn't seem to get it.  You just can't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just not working. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they're trying to do too much.  You know, messaging, if you think about the apps that really have worked,  whether it's kick or line or WeChat or even Snapchat when it first started,  they are so simple.  Like Snapchat has now started adding a whole bunch of stuff and it's trying to become.  So it started with simple. That's a mistake.  And it's trying to become a much bigger, full featured thing.  I don't know if that's going to work.  But but so they started with something.  The kids found it simple.  I could it took me half an hour to even figure out how to do it.  I agree with you.  You know, so I had this conversation with my 21 year old yesterday

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  at breakfast, I said, what apps do you use?  I always ask the kids.  And he said the Holy Trinity.  Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat.  And I said, but I find Snapchat a little opaque.  He said, no, no, no, you just do this.  I open it up and he said, he said, I said, I can't.  He said, well, swipe right. Oh, swipe left. Oh, yeah.  They it's and I said, how did you understand how to use that?  Did somebody somebody must have shown them, right?  But because there's no it's not intuitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, those are anti dad features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are. They are.  That features.  But he loves it.  Swipe left, swipe came from Tinder.  I don't know that.  No, well, Tinder does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think Snapchat predated them.  But then he does not do the Snapchat.  If you swipe right, he says, I don't swipe right.  That's just crap.  That's people who are doing this is the new stuff.  Snap the stories and then the official stories.  He says, no, no, no, you always swipe left.  Never swipe right. Yeah.  Yeah. And so it's that you're making an excellent point, Matthew,  which is Snapchat is trying to become mainstream more mainstream when they're  really the kids like it because it's very simple.  You swipe left.  You you know, you make a joke.  You do something.  I said, do you type sometimes because they make it really easy.  But mostly it's just and then you and then you want to see what you got.  You swipe you swipe left.  And that's where all you know, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The reason why I think Snapchat's valuation is a 20 billion or whatever is  some of what they've been doing has been working.  So whether discover is working or whether sort of becoming a more full featured  media app is working, I don't know.  But Snapchat stories, my teenage daughter started talking about,  oh, I'm I'm I'm making this Snapchat story.  Oh, so she says she is using like interesting.  You're talking about I don't even know what it is.  Right. She is creating stories,  which then people look at multiple photos, video clips.  And I think it was earlier this year,  one of our writers looked at the kind of traffic those things get.  Some individual Snapchat stories were getting 20 million views.  I think was during a blizzard in the winter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think I think about like some of these make sense.  I mentioned this before, but ESPN would just be sports highlights.  Right. That makes sense.  So this is so when you launch Snapchat, it launches like this.  You're in the camera and I can immediately send a message.  It's very straightforward.  If I swipe this way, he says, swipe, swipe to the right.  Oh, that's people sending you stat chats.  I said, what? Yeah.  People have been sending you messages. Oh, I don't have anything.  Oh, and then you swipe this way.  These are the stories.  And yeah. And then like I have this this person.  The other thing I thought I had to hold it down.  You just tap that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's one of the so they made it so you don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't have to hold it down. They changed that.  So and then here's Snapatunde, Baratunde does the stories.  He does some fun stuff.  But my problem with this is it's gone after a day.  So like why?  I spent a lot of energy making stuff that you can download forever.  And then these are the big brands.  And so you're saying 20 million views in a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And yeah, of a single Snapchat story, it's amazing.  This was somebody taking video of a blizzard or something during the  during the New York women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yahoo's gone. Yahoo.  Yeah, Katie, you know, Katie, Kirk stopped doing news.  They were there for 24 hours and they vanished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But BuzzFeed in, I think.  Interesting. But what's interesting to me is they're they clearly started with.  It's a little like Twitter.  They started with something incredibly simple and they're trying to add more features.  So the question becomes, can they do that or will their sort of core users think,  I'm not going to use that Snapchat thing anymore.  There's too many features or there's too much crafter.  There's too much.  You know, it doesn't do what I want it to do anymore.  See how it's interesting to watch messaging,  messaging, you can see sort of emergent behavior.  Like I always like you, I ask my daughters what they're using.  My my middle daughter uses aim.  And I said, what does that even exist anymore?  And she says, oh, yeah, all my friends and I all use it.  And I was like, why? Why on earth would you do that?  Haven't you tried prodigy?  I said, what's up? Why don't you use that?  Oh, well, what's up?  Some some of my friends don't want to pay.  I said, but you don't have to pay, do you?  Well, you have to pay a dollar a year.  And then after.  And so this is actually I wouldn't have thought that would stop anyone.  But aim is the only is the closest thing they found to a cross platform app.  They all have it. It's it's super cheap.  You know, it doesn't cost anything.  You can install it on everything.  The only problem is, I think there's no she was telling me there's no.  Why don't they use Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Feels like Facebook would be the right one.  Is Facebook? Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've got stickers. They've got.  She doesn't even want to be on Facebook.  My youngest daughter.  Oh, that's interesting.  He did her Facebook account.  She doesn't have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People our age are looking for messaging services where we can message everybody.  And people your daughter's age are looking for the opposite for places  where they can't be reached by most people other than their tiny crew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can have select groups that they message about specific things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So maybe this this point that we should have a universal.  I brought this up on Twitter.  The people everybody said the same thing.  No, no, we don't want that. Yeah, we don't want that.  You want your own little niche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But aren't most of these universal through SMS, Snapchat supports  and Hangout supports it.  I mean, you can just you can just, you know, if somebody isn't on the  the message, let's go back to the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. But let's go back to the problem of email. Right.  Because email is universal, because it is center controlled.  That's what ruins email.  So this is a form of recipient control is that I go where I know I am.  My friends are nobody else can find me there and I don't get spammed there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, speaking of messaging, Twitter just changed the length of DMs.  Now you can send limitless DMs.  There's no 140 character length.  So now DMs can become effectively service based email.  That I like. Yeah.  So the other here's what we discussed last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is really interesting.  So Facebook is introducing this direct message to companies thing. Right.  And to me, this is the guy who did Dell.  Hell is interesting.  The way that customer service now works through Facebook and companies  being able to direct message you back and actually deal with things.  Is there a afraid of public humiliation? Right. Yeah.  Michael Larrington says my cable's not working and they jump on it.  And Frank, who went from Comcast and just now she's quitting in the city.  We don't know what's next for him.  Basically created that structure of being able to deal with that.  Right. Now, Facebook turns around and says, no, no, no, no.  You can you can directly message a company through Facebook  and we will rate them on whether or not they respond within 90 seconds. Right.  And so what Facebook I think really sells then is the opportunity  to avoid public humiliation if you behave well. Right.  Which I find just fascinating.  And I don't know if it's going to work for Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Companies may not be that the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The threat of public humiliation on Twitter is what gets results.  Right. Public. Yeah.  If they say, hey, are Canada screwing me?  Are Canada's like, holy, we better respond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this is but this is the genius of Facebook.  This is the genius of Facebook's plan.  You get results with their system, too, because they have a they have a metric  for earning a badge that says highly responsive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The company avoids humiliation. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The companies certainly don't want to be forced to give results.  There's less direct humiliation. Right. Yeah. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And actually, I've noticed that on Twitter for a long time, companies responded.  Now what they do is call you and say, can you stop tweeting? Yeah.  They don't. They.  I've had this with Comcast. At first, it worked.  Now they just have somebody from the executive office call and say,  would you mind not tweeting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then, of course, you tweet, hey, they just called me and said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  don't tweet. That's immediately what I tweeted.  That was stunned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just called me. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so Facebook's doing some interesting things around this.  They also are are are unconfirmed reports that they're starting a news application.  The law. Have you been have you guys been watching Richard Ricky Gervais on Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I can't bear it.  And you know why? I'll tell you, I can't bear it.  He's making a mistake.  He's too close to his face, which is ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, this is the TV.  You're really you're rarely just an irritating person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know, but it's irritating.  He's blogging on Facebook.  Right. This is important. This is important.  Here's your base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Set the tone of podcasts like crazy for media companies, not for you guys,  but for media companies.  When he did the original podcast, we're a media company.  No, no. Old media companies, old parts at the Guardian.  Watch this. He did the original thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think this is something you want to have in your life, in your feet?  I don't want to have a close up of his bad teeth in my feet.  I'm sorry. I love Ricky Gervais.  I love the office. He's experimenting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, good for him. It's hilarious.  It's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they're not that bad.  For a British guy, they're pretty good.  No, it scares me because he's got sharpened cuspids.  He does have he does have a little scary.  It's like he's going to bite you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If he had an appealing personality, I don't think this would be so bad.  But he's just he's just irritating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This works if you're a beautiful woman.  I'm afraid it does not work if you're a gentleman of certain

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  debility. Have you ever thought that Ricky Gervais and Nick Denton  are separated at birth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  God, no. Now that you've said it, though.  But what he is doing is Facebook native, which is interesting.  He's not getting the engagement that you would one would hope like this.  Because it's live. This is the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a discovery issue.  I never have seen him live.  Yeah. Oh, this is live.  Well, that's but then it's recorded. Yes.  But this is this is experimenting with Facebook Live.  How would you see it live?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You'd get alerted to show up in your stream.  Oh, Ricky's live.  But do I have to like him first? Yes. Yes.  All right. I'm going to like him.  And then we'll know when he's live.  But I still haven't seen what sign up mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's weird. You click on that and it goes off to a separate thing.  Sign up.  I know I've never seen that link of any other celebrity.  And it's totally just YouTube.  How did he get that link in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, man, they're giving him special treatment.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.  This is the YouTube. This must be an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is part of a new trend where where Facebook, Apple and Twitter  are creating elitist mechanisms and separate and they're they're destroying  the the egalitarianism of the social web.  Oh, they got special to this social network that you can't fully use.  And they would say that they're experimenting at this level

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  with a small population that's going to push it.  And then because there have been others who've been going after them,  say, what do I get it? What do I get it?  They said, we're just starting. We're just starting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to judge them on what they're doing rather than what they're saying.  And what they're doing right now is they have just like Apple has connect,  just like Twitter has special features for verified users.  They're they're they're creating different tools,  different powers, different resources for famous people,  for powerful people, for leads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, and the rest of the signup takes me to a YouTube page  where I'd I'd subscribe to more about this Netflix original he's doing.  So look at that now. I notice on his Facebook page, there's also a videos link.  And if I click it, it takes me to this.  Is that a YouTube page or a Facebook page?  That's a Facebook page. It is a Facebook page.  It looks like it looks like a YouTube page.  Oh, man, does that look like a YouTube page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So go back to that other link that really was YouTube.  That really was YouTube. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Unclear. Now, let's not go back to that.  They do that. Gina Tripone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why would Facebook have a signup recommend?  I should tell you. I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I bet you I'm thinking Netflix paid for that, that that's an ad, Netflix ad.  That that signup button right there, that's an ad is an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, we have that, too. Like if you go to we have that, too.  If you go to TechNewsTodayTV on Facebook, Facebook.com slash TechNewsTodayTV.  Go away. Go away.  I don't know when they rolled this out, but they said you can put a button on your on your page.  And it goes to YouTube?  It goes wherever you want.  What is it? TechNewsTodayTV.  Today. Oh, I see.  TV.  And so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So.  Oops, I got the wrong spell.  So you can refer it to wherever you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I know this, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so it's kind of like what you can put on the video itself,  which is a different feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And so I don't see a subscribe button here.  Wait a minute. No, that's the wrong.  I'm on the wrong.  How do I get there?  TechNewsTodayTV.  Did I type it wrong?  Oh, you know what? I have to do Facebook.com.  Yeah.  Slash.  Right.  OK, I was doing this in the search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this this actually for pages, this is for media pages.  This is one of the things that's really great about.  But you don't have a subscribe right there.  Oh, you do. Sign up.  You click on it.  Now, what do I get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What the heck?  How did that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a paid ad.  I've been I stole your credit card and I've been paying for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, so this is a feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's interesting.  Have you guys tried the new Facebook author tag?  Very, very familiar from the old Google author.  Yeah, no, I haven't.  What?  I haven't heard about it.  So the Facebook author tag, it's like the old Google author tag.  It's a line, which is now dead.  It's a line of JavaScript you put in there.  And I'm not.  Put in where?  Put in where?  So I put on a buzz machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, in your blog.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then when someone goes to from a Facebook link to a buzz machine thing  and they come back to Facebook, they'll see a byline for me  because it shows they engage with me.  I can't explain it well.  That's what I heard today.  Have you ever seen this happen?  No, I haven't yet because it's pretty new.  In action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but it's something we've probably should have played a bunch of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We spent a bunch of time integrating with Google's author tag.  And then they're like, oh, yeah, we're not doing that anymore.  So thanks.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, what are we talking about?  I just feel like Facebook is really dominant in everything.  In fact, I still think Facebook Messenger will become dominant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And actually, this isn't messaging related, but Facebook and YouTube  are going head to head on video.  Yes, going to be a massive like, you know, Thor and like  a whole kind of Norse mythology thing, because they are Facebook is clearly targeting  YouTube in every way possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We talked last week at Infinitum about the article on Medium.  I'm fed up with your lies and cheating Facebook.  No, that's actually a Facebook page.  Who was that?  It was a Facebook.  It was a YouTube creator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a Hank Green.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder if in the intervening week, Facebook has approached Hank Green and said,  what can we do to make this right?  They certainly had a response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like half an hour after that published, I'm sure they're going to have to face  YouTube creators, aren't they?  Definitely.  They have to be and they are going to ramp up the monetization,  which is what's been missing.  Here's the question back to the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matthew, should Mark Zuckerberg reorganize Facebook the way that Google has?  Facebook now seems to be a controlling brand, but WhatsApp is gigantic.  Instagram is gigantic.  Funny Goggles will be made fun of on Time magazine, but will become big.  Is Facebook in a similar position?  Is Zuckerberg in a similar position to where Larry was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In a way they are.  Aaron Griffith wrote for us a piece very much like that.  Facebook should do the same thing.  It has become a kind of holding company in a way.  WhatsApp and Instagram are both huge entities by themselves.  Completely autonomous.  What should its name be?  Yeah, Oculus Rift.  It's arguably like self-driving cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It should be whatever the Chinese equivalent of Alphabet is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That peace trophy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Huffing the Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's an argument that because Larry said that Alphabets are a key invention of technology  that enables everything else, that it was politically incorrect to the Chinese.  Come on.  That's just dumb.  It is.  Washington Post went on at length.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, even the Chinese I think are realizing that  ideograph based language is a liability in the technology.  Yeah.  And that's why everybody in China is learning English.  Wow, that was a good conversation.  I never know where they're going to come from.  Have we come with a conclusion though?  Do we have any recommendations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I would like to tack one last thought on the end of that, which is this is your specialty.  Yeah.  Yes, Facebook is going after YouTube, but Facebook is in the same bad position with video  that Google is with messaging and social in that first mover advantage.  YouTube has so many advantages.  They have the stars.  They have the studios.  They have the kids.  They have all that stuff.  And Facebook can can bang away at it all they want,  but they're barely scratching the surface of genuinely competing with YouTube.  And I don't see any reason why they're a threat in any way.  They have a billion users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have a billion active users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google has more eyeballs than Facebook with search and Android and all the rest.  And I don't think that that helps them dominating.  One thing that Facebook has that really helps them with video  is control of their algorithm.  If they want people watching more videos, they just throw a switch on the algorithms  and people are going to be watching more videos.  They've already done it with self playing videos.  And that's a huge tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're going to it can drive volume to a video unlike anything.  I'm going to do a Facebook live video as soon as they throw the switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But but that's awesome.  But when it's coming, right?  Yeah.  I'm verified.  You know what I did recently that was stupid?  I took my verified profile and made it private, but I'm going to have because I just want to  because I wanted to Facebook to be just for me.  Oh, you and my oh, you fool.  Well, I can go the other way.  Have you tried Snapchat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm no Leopold, but I've actually been thinking about the same thing.  Should I have a page or should it just be for family?  I have a Leopold page, you know, a public page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have three times more followers on Facebook than I do on Twitter.  Now, I don't know, you know what the algorithm service to them anymore than I did on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I have been woefully neglecting my Facebook presence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have been I've not because of Scoble.  I have been digging into Facebook and really, you know, combing it, making it work.  And it's it's a very good experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So here's the call to action button.  You found it.  Yeah.  I just went to my my long neglected Leo Laporte page.  Journalist call to action.  Don't look at the ad a button to get people to take an action from your page.  It isn't just it's book now.  Contact us.  Use app play game shop now.  Sign up or watch video as you pay for it.  Or no, you don't.  And then on mobile, you can have a different one.  In fact, you can even have a different one on iPhone and Android.  Wow.  That is amazing.  Where do you get to it?  How do you get to it?  It's on your page.  It's right there for a page.  Not for private.  Yeah.  Create call to action.  But my page is not verified.  So how do I get that verified so I can stream?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your page is very, but I think you are.  I'm personally very, I think if you allow people to follow you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then I can do live video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But no, no, no.  But I think that's that's what that's what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but no, I'm verified as but I made that.  But if you're very personal page, that doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got to be verified in public before you can do public things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but I can make this public.  Yeah, make it public.  But my question is, I would like to have my Leo Laporte  person public page be the verified page.  It's not.  So I don't know how to do that.  I'll have to look.  I'm not sure.  I don't think you can.  You can't.  I don't think you can.  It's like Twitter.  You just have to hope that the verified.  No, no, I don't.  I don't think pages are verifiable at all.  Only pages are verifiable.  Oh, so this is Facebook's way of forcing me.  Yes.  Yeah.  To be public.  Yes.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a good thing, Leo.  Well, let me see if there's any new photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And if there aren't, I'll make myself public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sharing is good, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sharing with the world is good.  Sharing is caring.  And is the 45 minute limit still in place for live?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, for uploaded.  But for live?  I don't know about live.  For live, I don't know.  Could I just stream?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem Gervais has had is it keeps cutting off on him.  So my joke today was get this man a net connection or a job  because he's sitting there all day on the stairs with the cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this is why movie stars are perfectly suited for this  because it's not apparent, but they only work a few months a year.  They got nothing to do.  90% of the time, they're just home waiting for a script.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could shoot a video all day long.  Nobody would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm telling you, just play Ricky Gervais' video for a second.  Listen to him.  All right.  All right.  The first one he did was in the bathtub.  Oh my God.  Just like Robert Scoble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, that was a show.  That was a show.  All right.  OK, and by the way, Ricky Gervais uses his personal page for this.  Notice he's verified.  That's exactly what it is.  So which one should I, which one should I?  Let's go to, let's go to, should we do the first one in the bathtub?  I see one from...  That's disgusting.  All right.  Well, I'm going to go to the YouTube, faux YouTube thing  and show all of them.  Look at all of these.  This guy's a busy man.  So I guess that I'll do me again.  We're not a busy man.  Let's watch this, everybody.  Me again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I've done is I've propped up the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm hands-free.  It's just a coincidence that his Emmys are in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look at those canines, though.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Welcome to another...  He's a vampire.  I'll move my chair.  This view is like the last thing his dinner sees.  Close up.  Hello, Mavis.  He did say thanks, didn't he?  Samantha Campbell.  She says, J.D. Edwards.  They're loving it.  They're loving it.  Stephanie Gentle.  Hi.  Hi.  Tune in.  See, he's mocking the entire forum.  I've already sort of built a little studio.  Well, actually, what it is is I've just propped my thing on a...  It's an old paint...  I don't know.  What's it called?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  How about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is riveting content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tries to be crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hopefully I could get one of those wherever I am.  It's so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was his name, the comic who did the stupid stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All of them.  See?  What you just said?  But he's...  I actually haven't done a press interview for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's undercutting the whole genre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's on Twitter.  Yeah, exactly.  Facebook.  Don't have to do press interviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But let's...  So this is like permanent periscoping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is periscope that you, as a member of the Riff Raff, are not allowed to use.  But here's the key.  But here's the opposite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the opposite, Mike.  You go into periscope and it is nothing.  It is an unmanageable mountain of video crap.  Whereas here, by starting with Celebrity, it's kind of brilliant.  Oh no, they're starting to spark.  Live stuff here is going to be interesting to watch.  Number one.  Number two, there's a problem of...  So you're a verified person.  So we know who this is.  It's not just somebody who's going to show you his penis.  Number two...  Oh, that's a good point.  That's a good point.  That's exactly what it is.  They're not going to have that problem as long as they keep it tight.  They can...  Howard Stern's not going to be invited to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although with Ricky Gervais, you don't know for sure.  Right.  You never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But my point is it's television minus all the good things about television.  It's television in the sense that it's famous people sending it to you  and you're supposed to sit there and watch and oh, buy something, by the way.  And you don't participate.  It's not participative media.  This is what they're killing with this kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People send them messages.  But television never was either.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I could send fan mail to Gilligan too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dwayne Johnson, The Rock, is also one of the people involved in this.  He actually does a pretty compelling Instagram video.  Well, he's The Rock.  He's The Rock.  And he's apparently at the gym.  Of course.  Clanging and banging.  It's in the iron paradise.  But see, The Rock, yeah, for all his flaws,  this is more interesting that Ricky Gervais up close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's aspirational, right?  People like The Rock.  Maybe they want to be a giant.  Let's see. Wait a minute. There's others on this.  Nobody wants to be Ricky Gervais.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Serena Williams, Martha Stewart, and Michael Buble.  It's an interesting mix.  Here's Serena Williams lying in bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's so rich she has people as her bed.  Oh, no, there's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, we got Ricky in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I turned off Ricky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and I didn't make it on practice day,  but after that I'm going to go...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, this is what intimidates me  about using this stuff,  is I would actually try to make it polished, interesting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you what she's not going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's supposed to be informal, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's not going to go over the three weeks of files in my book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These guys aren't even as good as the most mediocre Vine celebrity.  Let's see what Martha Stewart's up to.  I think it's interesting that...  Oh, my God, it's terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Welcome to my official first live broadcast with Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's trying to be professional.  Big mistake, right?  This is not the medium.  Big mistake.  No.  Frankly, Serena was the most interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Facebook wanted to compete with YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Next.  Where is she?  In the prison cafeteria?  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, really.  I'm hearing my...  When it comes to compete with YouTube,  Facebook has one big...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, you guys, this is my first live chat with this new Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, by the way, Ricky's the only one who's done more than one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thanks, Mike.  You know what?  She got...  Yeah, run away.  Run away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She got to do hers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a lot like Meerkat and Periscope.  This is exactly the experience you'd have.  But you see, remember the discussion last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the kitchen photo in a People magazine story.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm actually with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get to watch the professionals be unprofessional.  That's what the sale point is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get to see their hallway and their cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I'm going to make my page public and do this.  Well, I think you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unless you're maybe even going to start.  What would your council...  Were you invited into...  Is it Mentions it's called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's Mentions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the celebrity thing.  That's the celebrity video streaming thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to be invited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's before video.  Mentions was there so you could share things all kinds of ways.  Mentions is the base of video.  Video was added to Mentions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to be in Mentions first.  Like private Twitter.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you're public, but it's only for the stars.  Mentions was a way that stars could more easily communicate with their publics using Facebook  and going across platforms.  I think this is right.  Tell me if I'm wrong, Jeru.  And then video was just added.  Live video was just added.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a feature of Mentions.  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, I'm resetting myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't believe you didn't get invited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He doesn't even have a public profile.  That's probably why I'm making it public right now.  Why would they invite him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a lot of respect for you already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know and I feel bad.  Where do I make it public?  Under privacy?  Who can see my stuff public?  Is that all I have to do?  There's something about people being able to follow you.  Yeah.  I used to do that.  I turned that off about a month ago.  Bad timing, Leo.  Because I thought it'd be fun to be private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love that feature though because if people ask to friend me and I just ignore them,  they automatically become followers.  Yeah.  Fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you got mad, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I wasn't mad.  No, I just thought I'd like to experience Facebook as a normal person  like following friends and family.  You can't do that.  I'm not a normal person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to be a normal person in order to do that.  All right.  You have to use some other number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to turn this on and well, I don't really have a private life, do I?  Really?  I mean, really.  So it was all an illusion anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not after that later hosing shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh man.  Yeah.  Well, that actually is exactly when I turned off the public sharing.  I don't blame you.  It was a bridge too far.  Okay.  So what else?  The attention economy.  I don't even want to hear that word anymore, Matthew.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say just before we get off Facebook and YouTube,  the one thing that Facebook has that it can use as a lever,  and it's a pretty big lever,  is the control over the algorithm.  So like we were talking about, they can make certain videos show up all the time.  They can make sure that people see them.  That's a huge bargaining chip if someone wants their content to be seen.  Facebook can say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If Howard Stern said, I'm going to take my show off serious,  and I got to go to YouTube or I'm going to go to Facebook.  He said that?  No.  Oh.  But it's as if he said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When I called him to a show the last time, I yelled at him again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We went on his podcast rant.  I said, you should be owning your own venture.  I say this to him every time I call in.  He's a wage slave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so obvious that that's the case, that he should do that.  His wage is massive.  The problem is that he says that, oh, that doesn't work for all these people,  but he's Howard Stern.  He should have done it three years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's the issue.  I argued five years ago when his contract was up,  and I revealed on the show that I actually introduced his people to executives at Google,  and it went nowhere.  But the problem was the last six-inch problem wasn't solved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you say last six-inch and Howard Stern, maybe you better clarify the last six-inch problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From your phone to your car.  Oh, thank God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, is that still the aspirational Google Fi case that you have on your phone?  Yes, and I haven't signed up, but you have the case.  Oh, I've signed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have it, but I haven't installed it.  I haven't gotten it on.  Once they start charging you.  Oh, I see.  I'm not charged yet.  I'll be charged as soon as I started.  I got to figure out the phones,  and that's why I got to figure out the OnePlus versus the Moto X,  versus should I really instead buy an iPhone  so I can test out things that are on the iPhone, which I hate having to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get them all.  Do what Leo does.  Buy them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's only, you know, really, it's only a few thousand dollars a month.  You know what adds up?  Having two numbers on each of the four carriers.  After a while, that adds up.  Leo.  Well, it's no phone is no good if you can't use it.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why do you have two numbers on the four carriers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, because I just, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you have one that's actually your real phone you can really use for life,  and the other one is the one that can get messed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, my phone situation is much like a Facebook situation.  I don't have a real life phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But don't you just use Google Voice?  Actually, like, I do.  I do.  But Google Fi screws your voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How does this screw your voice?  Because it suddenly you no longer have your voice is converted to Google Fi.  Your voice number becomes your actual phone number.  You still can have forwarding.  So I have forwarding turned on, although I haven't figured out how to add new numbers.  It's going to be a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You need tech support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wish there was someone I could ask.  If only.  Call for help.  If only.  Only.  All right.  Anything else you want to talk about before we get to our picks?  Oh, I'll let you look at the rundown.  Yeah, well, this is really what we are talking about, isn't it?  The attention economy.  Definitely.  That attention is more important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead.  That David Pakman piece that I linked to from Venrock,  one of the things he mentions, which I didn't get into, it's a whole separate post.  But one of the things he mentions that I think is really true is that  messaging and sharing are the most central apps for particularly for millennial users.  So whether it's WhatsApp or kick or line or Instagram, or those are the key ways in which  they experience the Internet and content, which is why what Snapchat is doing is so important  or why that that's why I think Snapchat is doing it.  It's trying to leverage the messaging and get into all sorts of other areas of media.  But it's a that's where attention is going.  So basically what David did was look at where is attention going, not what are the big companies  or who's making lots of revenue or what market caps are, but where is our attention going?  And when it comes to millennial users, it's mobile and it's messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And YouTube.  And YouTube.  Come on.  I mean, YouTube is huge.  No, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And YouTube.  So let's say video streaming and messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  But TV and radio shrinking piece of the pie.  Actually, you want to you want to really look at a bad one.  Newsprint print newspapers and magazines.  I think I can't even see that line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go down further.  There's a chart where he looks at the things that actually keep going.  Keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is good.  This is a good article.  People's he was at music, right?  But now he's a VC audience size of media platforms and properties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at the far left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The far left, which is like through the roof.  Facebook, YouTube, Yahoo, Twitch, Riot Games.  What exactly?  What's Twitch Riot Games?  It's all e-sports.  It's a studio.  It's not even it's a subset of Twitch.  It's Riot Games is a game studio on Twitch.  It's not even all of Twitch.  Riot Games is bigger than Tumblr, Twitter, Snapchat, the Super Bowl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at the size of that thing.  So that's his point is that some YouTube creators, some Vine creators,  they have audiences that are substantially larger than the NBA, Major League Baseball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  PewDiePie, 38 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  PewDiePie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, four billion views.  You know, they're conflating numbers here because YouTube views are not the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not the same as a TV viewer, but that is still a massive number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at that gift horse of the mouth, though.  40 million subscribers.  PewDiePie's audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, which would you rather have 18 million viewers on NBC or 18 million viewers on YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  NBC because they can sell ads for a lot more.  Now they can sell ads, but let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't even think 18 million viewers on YouTube means the same thing as 18 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Advertisers are wildly stupid.  Their ads aren't being watched.  They're going to figure it out.  Whereas this is also a big thing that Google did this week.  Google also cut off certain ways to buy on YouTube.  You can only buy now through Google.  And they do the TrueView thing where your ad is actually really watched, which TV can't give you.  And that's going to end up being a very high value.  Every media company I know is dying for video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So how much money was spent on the Super Bowl?  It's got to be a billion dollars.  It's going to be some huge amount of money, right?  Super Bowl had 114 million viewers.  Riot Games, which is League of Legends, had 739 million viewers.  Now, admittedly, Super Bowl is three hours and Riot Games is probably a year's worth of viewing.  But still, why is it at least a large segment of that billion dollars going to Riot Games?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, part of it, I think, is the average person who watches the Super Bowl has a better job than  the average person who uses it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is the value of 144 million Riot Games viewers, right?  Or whatever, 739?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But so, part of David's point, and part of my point is...  He's talking to our intern who watches Riot Games incessantly.  You look at the gap, right?  That gap is going to close.  So attention is going elsewhere.  And all I'm saying is media companies in particular should be paying more attention to where that  attention is going because that's where the money is going to go eventually.  Whether it's esports or streaming.  Facebook sees that.  Otherwise, why would they be doing half of this stuff?  They see Periscope and Vine as the future of video to some extent.  Those are the things that are going to determine the platforms of the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess I'm also...  But I am pointing out that this is quantitative and there is a qualitative measure that is  maybe somewhat different.  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Totally.  Yeah, but the quality...  So I talked again to one of my daughters.  She watches Twitch all the time.  She's watching people play Minecraft for hours.  Right.  Like, is that as good as the Super Bowl?  I don't know.  But she's spending hours watching people play games.  Right.  So all I'm saying is there is something there.  There's something there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  She's chosen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, what you want to look at is not what's going to replace television viewing.  You want to look at what behaviors are going to change and be able to capture those behaviors.  Regardless of the quality of this audience, what you're really seeing is that in a new  generation, there is a behavioral shift and that's something that everybody has to pay  attention to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think part of what David is saying is it's messaging and sort of interaction and  emotion-based consumption, whether it's gaming or streaming video, is what lots of younger  viewers want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other thing to keep in mind also...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Will they grow out of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the question.  Will they suddenly decide, oh, I think I should watch the Super Bowl?  Oh, you see, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I doubt it.  That's a really important question because that's the one the media pin their hopes on.  When you get older, just go to your watching shows.  You'll start watching.  When you have a job...  The exact opposite.  Didn't you use this line?  Did you use this line?  Somebody used this line.  I just read it today where somebody said that you invest in the behavior of youth.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whereas saying that youth are going to become like their parents, it's the opposite.  The parents are going to become like the children.  Right.  And that's where the world is headed here.  And so, no, they're not going to grow up and start buying newspapers and buying Time magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, for years, newspaper executives said, oh, when they get jobs and have kids,  they'll all start subscribing to newspapers.  How many times did we hear that, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many times?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To me, the difference though is that, especially if you know,  I think a good example of this is the Super Bowl versus Twitch.  The biggest difference between how people used to watch media or how older people currently do  and how younger people do and how people in the future watch is that a single show that  everybody's watching the exact same thing will be replaced by whether it's 10 media or a thousand.  Everybody will watch in something different.  And that's the biggest change and that's what's really changing  is that the shared experience is gone with the exception of maybe Beats 1.  But there are still some shared experiences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually just saw a news report on an esports competition.  It was watched by millions of people and the winners won something like 18 million dollars.  To people who like esports and gaming, that is the Super Bowl.  That is their shared experience.  It was a huge arena full of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, but I think if you look, when I was 20 or whatever, there was like three channels  and cable was like something that some people had and so on.  Nowadays, even though there are occasional events and people will also watch the Oscars  and the Super Bowl and various things, even the Republican debates, lots of people are  watching that as well.  But I think that the really interesting behavior is that the number of individual things,  the thing that's diverting eyeballs is everything.  It's not one thing that's replacing another thing.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I also think it's a misnomer to say that on your phone, that all this is in the apps.  Because when I'm gaming versus when I'm communicating versus when I'm getting information,  these are entirely different use cases that I happen to use the same device.  The fact that it occurs in an app or not should not make media companies think,  we all need our app.  You've got a different use case for somebody playing a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, lots of Facebook content comes through their built-in browser,  which is the mobile web.  It's not true.  It comes through an app, but it's effectively the mobile app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep.  Oh, we just missed a live Ricky Gervais calling his cat.  Quick.  You see?  Build a time machine.  It is about attention.  It's about attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should be paying attention to Ricky Gervais.  Pay attention to Ricky Gervais.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If I were a massive, if I were Coca-Cola, should I buy ads on the Ricky Gervais live stream?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Why not?  You can't, by the way.  Can you?  Friskeys.  You can't.  Can you buy an ad?  Can I buy an ad on that?  By the way, can I just point this out?  He posted this yesterday.  It has 1.4 million views, 57,000 likes, 4,200 comments.  See?  Okay, I take it this is a much bigger platform than YouTube.  But it's got no ads on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, because that's, don't forget what I said last week.  It will.  Mark doesn't bother with it until it's a billion users.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I hold up a Coca-Cola can on my feed?  Then he monetizes the crap out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  Well, if you want to follow me on Facebook,  I promise to put lots of stuff up there.  I don't want to be famous.  I just want your attention, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You should pet your cat.  Yeah.  By the way, yeah, your cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have cats?  Yeah, your dog gets all the star time here on Twitter.  Oh, you got to follow Lisa's feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's the cat person.  You said that was such a good thing.  The cats are new.  The cats are 15 weeks old.  You know what?  They're getting spayed tomorrow.  I will pull a Bob Barker.  You should stream that.  Livestream the cats getting spayed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to say you probably shouldn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But we could do a whole thing about taking them to the cat hospital,  giving them their last meal.  And then when they come home, show them limping around.  Make sure not to be too professional.  Right.  Shaky Cam.  Yeah.  Can you do this with a...  Can you do...  You must be able to just do it with your mobile device.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Make sure that your awards are in the background.  My award?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll put my award in the background.  I have a major award, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could wear some laterhosen if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ricky Gervais doesn't have laterhosen.  You could dominate this.  I can beat him on that one.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could own that market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do we care about Zirtual?  What is Zirtual?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Zirtual is a company that's...  Virtual assistant.  Well, it's exactly...  Virtual assistant.  But the difference is it's not a sharing economy play.  They're employees of Zirtual.  They had, until they laid them off, 400 employees.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's pretty big for a company I never heard of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They went from 150 to 418 months.  And then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they went from outside contractors to employers.  They were contractors to employers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  It's a secret weapon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It says it's the secret weapon of successful people.  It isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, they crashed and burned yesterday.  They announced that they were laying everybody off and closing the company.  And then this morning they announced...  Oh, never mind that.  Startup.co bought them.  Exactly.  What is startup.co?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  They couldn't afford an M?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Another thing that's going to run out of money.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there was some criticism of Calacanis on this.  Is he an investor?  Was he a board member?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He interviewed the CEO a couple of days ago.  Right before they went on this.  Yeah.  On this weekend...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he said he had started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  He said he had no knowledge.  Yep.  But the CEO probably did.  I mean he must have known about the burn rate.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No wonder this didn't go anywhere.  Exactly.  750 bucks a month for this virtual assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a weird model and I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and it sounds like they went from the contractor model to the employee model  and that increased their cost by like an order of magnitude.  Yep.  And then just couldn't keep up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they were counting on infusions of cash from investors who said,  I don't think so.  And then it was a sudden crash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But these assistants aren't in your meat space, right?  So they can't do my dry cleaning.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They cannot do your dry cleaning.  They work in their meat space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  And never the twain shall meet.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  So I think someone just put up something on the rundown which I was being cagey before  about Facebook Live.  Oh, yes.  Now that it's out, I was being told things on TechCrunch's reporting.  Yeah.  That it will soon be opened up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been showing this article during the entire conversation.  Oh, I see.  I didn't see that.  I was being cagey.  Don't be so cagey.  Although I thought John Constein left TechCrunch to get a job with Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But again, journalists and verified profiles.  It's another level of...  Me.  That's why I just went public.  Right.  Please follow me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If everybody who watches this show goes immediately to Facebook.com.  By the way, I can't get Leo Laporte.  Somebody has that.  So Facebook.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How about leolaporte.xyz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's another Leo Laporte?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  They say I can't have it.  Maybe they're saving it for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What happens when you go there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Sorry, this content isn't available right now.  Oh, maybe you can get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How could I get it?  Yeah.  Well, ask the nice people on Facebook.  Somebody had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Probably somebody impersonating me had it is what it was.  Yeah, maybe you can get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it wouldn't be verified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know the people in press there, right?  No, I don't know anybody.  I intentionally don't know anybody.  If I knew somebody, I'd feel bad when I say bad things about them.  No, I don't want to know anybody.  I like not knowing anybody.  No, Jeff, I know you and I know Matt and I know Mike.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You shouldn't have it public.  I liked one of my comments once.  Did I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, Mark Zuckerberg liked one.  Mark, he liked one.  So he knows you.  So we're pretty tight.  That's pretty good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I waved at him last time he was in the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know Robert Scoble.  Does that help?

Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because everybody knows Robert.  Who doesn't know Robert?  Who knows everybody?  All right, let's take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a table.  Actually, I want to buy one.  Once you told me the price, I said, I'll take two.  This show brought to you by our great friends at Zip Recruiter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  His tool of the week is a canoe.  A paddle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you got for us?  I don't have a tool for it.  You got nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have nothing.  Do you have a tip for me to get into Facebook's good graces so I can live, do live video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you should try and lean closer to the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm getting my teeth filed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a great idea.  It's like Johnny Ive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Get some aluminium teeth.  I have aluminium teeth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They are very sharp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Matthew.  I saw that.  Somebody ducked behind me.  Do you have anything for us?  Actually, Jeff will do a number.  Okay.  Because then we want to save this for last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll do a report from PageFair and Adobe.  The 2015 ad blocking report.  Oh, I saw this.  Estimated loss of global revenue due to blocked advertising during 2015 was,  well, we're not over 2015 yet, but anyway,  $21.8 billion.  I don't buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, how would you measure it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have the methodology here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is like how much money the movie industry lost from pirated downloads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, one thing they do know, and this is I think telling, is that there's been a 41% increase  in using ad blockers.  11% in the United States.  The number one state for ad blockers is Oregon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Figures.  You know, we talked about this on Tech News Today, and we heard from some very savvy users  who said, you know what?  The elephant in the living room is that ad blocking software is being used as a protection  from security.  From malware.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all about JavaScript.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I understand that.  I do.  It's also about slow loading pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  A lot of garbage.  It's yeah.  And you know, I'm thinking about this, writing a column about this, now that I have to write  one, is that, so help me out here.  I think that advertising itself as a form is getting worse and worse and worse.  Right?  The form is getting more desperate to trick us.  And I'm not a fan of native advertising.  I think that, you know, headlines that aim to say, this will change your life.  I believe lots of ways to try to fool us and bad pop ups and all kinds of things.  It's becoming more and more and more desperate.  And so, yeah, we kind of deserve the ad blocking.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got to point out that ad blocking will give you more native advertising.  Well, that's one way to try to get around it.  Because it doesn't get blocked.  It'll give you more product placement.  It'll give you more of the kinds of sneaky ads that can get around ad blockers.  So, Matthew, funny you should ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One answer is if you go to YouTube and you start an ad there and you don't watch it,  in true view, the advertiser doesn't pay.  So what is the advertiser motivated to do?  Make a good ad.  Really clever, amazing ads.  What is the second motivation?  Is to give me relevance.  Right?  Don't just show me billboards of things that I don't want to buy baby carriages.  I have no reason I hope to buy baby carriages.  You know, so don't show me that stuff.  Advertising has gotten worse and worse, more desperate, more desperate.  Just like I argued that we in the content side and journalism side have to go to higher quality,  not to crap in the future.  So does the advertising side.  We've got to help them figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So anyway.  Although I was just so Marco Arman wrote something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A guy who created a service that blocks out ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's not break it.  Which a number of people have pointed out.  But his point was very similar.  That the ads are bad.  JavaScript is bad.  Pages take a long time to load.  This is normal behavior on the part of users to sort of claw back some of the time that  they're losing to crap web pages and to things that don't load properly.  And so his response was, well, if you the alternative is you can charge people directly  or you can use native advertising.  And I think there were a number of places that like publishers who responded, well,  we would love to do that.  But we can't you can't make a business.  Not everyone can make a business out of charging people directly.  And even some people who could do that.  Maybe they don't want to do that.  Advertising is the only thing they have available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There isn't enough money from that red lines journalism.  It's only for the rich who can afford it.  It limits the audience.  It limits the growth.  I'm not a paywall fan.  Never never.  You know, I'll say my books happily, but paywalls are not the answer.  And native advertising is not the answer either.  Relevance and quality are going to be the only answers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So then we just have to wait for advertising to get better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we've got to help them get better.  We've got that's that's the problem.  We've got to take that on even in a journalism school.  I'm now seeing that I've got to take on advertising.  That's going to be controversial.  Why would you help advertisers?  It's not like a journalism school teaching flax, which we don't do and I don't want to do.  But it does say that if we're going to still get support from advertising,  we've got to help improve the efficacy of that advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the solution is similar to spam filtering and filtering in email.  Basically, I'd love to see a granular blocking of ads where the default is that you're shown ads.  You can also go in and say, I don't want ads to do this.  I don't want ads to do that.  I don't want ads that drop cook, whatever it is.  And then you can also go in and say, when you see a, you know, a baby carriage ad,  you can say, I don't want anything in this category.  And so you can choose to see ads that are relevant to you,  that are interesting, that aren't exploitative, that don't, you know,  Isn't that what Facebook does?  No, Facebook has terrible ads, completely non-contextual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they do give you some control over what you see and what you don't.  They do.  And they hide this or I'm not interested in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And Facebook is trying to be the alternative internet,  but on the actual internet, it would be great for the ad blocking companies to figure out some way  to do something other than get rid of all ads.  Well, they do do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Adblock Plus has a policy if you aren't an annoying ad and you can also pay them.  Yeah, if you could also pay, exactly.  If you'd like.  And I think that's still the number one used ad blocker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we need a lot more granularity though.  I mean, it's just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My fear is that ad blocking is basically helping Facebook.  So ad blocking is going to get rid of lots of the sort of low-hanging junk in ads.  And Facebook is going to be the one that benefits.  And that in turn is going to convince more media companies  to do deals like instant articles with Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think one solution would be to honor, do not track.  I think responsible companies will do that.  To stop using flash ads because that's how the malware-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, let's just get rid of flash ads.  Let's get rid of flash ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And maybe limit a little bit the amount of scripting that's going on in ads.  I don't know.  Let's do it.  There's a great extension.  I'll make this my pick of the week called Privacy Badger.  That the EFF has put out and you've got to trust them.  And it will show you trackers on pages and give you a slider that will let you  block cookies or completely block a domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's note again that number one, cookies are not necessarily evil in tracking.  And I would argue two things.  One is that they are a way to in fact get higher relevance in advertising  and less repetition in advertising and less irritation.  And number two, they're important to supporting media.  And if you killed cookies and got rid of them,  you're going to kill the content that comes of value to you.  So believe the figure of $21.8 billion or not.  The direction is still the same.  If you don't want everything to become behind a paywall,  then we're going to have to support on advertising.  We have to figure out advertising.  And just saying that all advertising is bad and all tracking that makes advertising  work economically is evil and bad, is infantile and damaging.  I love the EFF for 99.8% of their work, but this is I think going a bit too far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's pressuring the ad company to do exactly what you're saying that they should do.  It's serious pressure when this thing is growing,  ad blocking and things like Privacy Badger are the screws that we have that we can turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a negative way to do it.  A positive way to do it is to say, here's how advertising could work positively and decently.  And instead, what you created is a huge population up to a third of the world  that's now blocking all ads.  Make them operate well.  They're not going to see it.  Nobody's going to see it.  And places are going to die as a result.  I think they're not going to respond to good ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're only going to respond to being squeezed and incentives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's cynical.  In fact, your own company right there.  Leo doesn't take crappy ads.  Leo takes ads that he believes in.  He does them in a certain way.  There are things he will and won't do.  And advertisers want to be associated with that because it is seen by this very audience  as a quality relationship.  And there's a trust with those advertisers.  And I have an affectionate spot in my heart for Harry's and Casper and Ford should come back.  And those places because they have a relationship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My model doesn't work for a lot of media, including websites.  Can't do what I do on websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The punch the monkey people aren't going to be persuaded by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't do it, but it's called native advertising.  I think if you really want to make advertising better for media companies,  native advertising is one way to do it.  If it's good content, then it works.  If it's bad content, it doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think really good content would be live streaming videos for me on my Facebook page.  So if you all go to your teeth, I want to see your teeth.  By the way, good news.  If you turn off followers, but then turn it back on, you don't lose all the followers you had.  So I have 227,000 followers still, even though I just turned it on.  So if you want to see more of me in later, Hosen, here's your chance.  It's better in than not.  Yeah. In the later, Hosen, you bet.  We had this conversation.  I recuse myself on the conversation you just had because I have very strong opinions,  but I've expressed them on security now.  It was your tool.  For Steve and I to just talk about this.  One of the things Privacy Badger does that's a little different is  they actually are trying to block advertisers and advertising tools that don't follow to not track.  Instead of just blocking all ads, they block ads from advertisers who say,  we're not going to honor the request of a user not to track.  I think that's maybe a good way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But let's turn that part.  Do we need to track?  This whole tracking is bad.  It doesn't bother me.  Yes, you do.  You do for a couple of reasons.  Number one, you need a very simple level for...  Sorry, I'm turning orange now.  What color is Jeff going to be now?  It's the sun setting.  I know it is.  It looks like I'm the sun turning orange.  Sunset Jeff.  One is frequency caps.  By putting cookies on, you get to know who has this person seen this at.  Or we're throwing our money.  That's actually very useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Most advertisers want that.  We certainly do that on our shows here.  That's one of the things.  There's this thought, and I think it's probably true,  that there's an ideal number of impressions.  Too few impressions, nobody's going to act on an ad.  Too many, nobody's going to see the ad.  You want to get five, six impressions.  And that's it.  The rest is wasted money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The second is going to be some measure of relevance.  Now, relevance taking to its stupid extreme we see right now,  which is so-called retargeting advertising.  You go to Amazon, you look at boots, those boots follow you around  every place you go on the web for a month.  What that says is the data point about your interest in boots  beats any value of being in media next to context.  And it commodifies media down to zero value.  So that's the kind of stupid.  And by the way, once you bought the boots,  it still keeps trying to sell you the same boots you bought.  It's still stupid.  But that's where advertising value is going to go.  And media are going to lose.  We've lost.  We've lost that already.  And so the only way we're going to fight back is by coming up with means  to have relevance and value to people.  Now, that means we've got to have better advertising,  lots of other things.  But the only way we can know you as an individual  is if we know you as an individual.  And that's otherwise known as tracking.  And we've demonized this idea of tracking.  What do they know to the point that just having a relationship with someone.  So my argument constantly is the media have to follow the example of Google  and get to know you as an individual  and not see you as an anonymous faceless mass  because that's the insult that media has given us for the last century.  And now it can change.  And I'm tired.  I want to go get a pizza.  Sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Your pick of the week, Mr. Mike Elgin.  It's a it's called a bat.  Big ass tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  And here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've seen these before running Windows.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This one is a Chromebook.  This is the this is the Acer Chromebase Touch.  Yeah, this is also.  How big is that?  It's twenty one point five inches.  The screen and then it's got a pretty good bezel.  So it's like a TV.  It's quite large.  And how heavy is that?  It's I don't know.  You know, that's the second time.  So feel heavy.  Yeah, it's like.  Let me look it up on your own.  Nine pounds.  It's Asus.  Asus.  I'm sorry.  It's Acer Acer Chromebase Touch.  The Acer Chromebase Touch costs.  Here's the best part.  It costs four hundred and twenty nine ninety nine.  That makes it attractive.  As ten points of touch, the non touch version costs three twenty nine ninety nine.  But again, this is like a Chromebook.  This runs Chrome, Chromium, Chrome OS.  And it's just a it's a it's a kind of a slow performing thing.  But one of the great things.  Oh, it's not real fast.  It is not even even with a direct ethernet connection on a very fast internet connection.  It's still kind of pokey.  But it's a great one in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, which is not a bad processor, but that's a lot of pixels.  This is a two or four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Two or four.  What?  Ram.  It's four gigs of RAM.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  And sixteen gigs of storage.  And it comes with a complimentary hundred gigs of Google Drive storage,  right, which is nice, which most Chromebooks do.  Yeah.  And it comes with keyboard and mouse, which you can use.  And I'm using the virtual keyboard right now, which pops up when you go to to do something like this.  But it goes down to like like almost a drafting table for touch, which is great.  And then it goes up to a monitor.  Twelve and a half pounds.  Yeah, it's part of the fitness plan.  And it's 178 degree viewing angle.  It's got a 1080p screen.  The screen isn't great.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, for instance, from over here, it looks terrible.  Yeah.  And that's not necessarily a disadvantage.  Although this is the kind of thing multiple people might be using it, right?  Yes, it might.  I'd use it for breakfast.  Yeah.  As a tray.  Yes.  Put the cereal, the eggs on it, bring it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'd be great.  It'd be great for that, although it's 12 pounds.  So but it's, you know, it's a nice construction couldn't feel more solid.  I mean, just feels incredibly solid.  And it comes with the keyboard.  Comes with the keyboard and mouse.  And I normally use it with a keyboard and mouse, but for the show, I'm just using touch.  It's flexible that way.  It is not a mobile device.  This is not a mobile tablet.  So carrying it around is a bit clunky and awkward.  So it's not designed to be carried around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just returned the review unit of the Chromebook Flip that I have,  which I did open up on the show.  I never reported back.  It turned out to be really slow.  Yeah.  Sadly.  Yeah.  And as I did think I said on the show,  that size screen, Chrome is not built for touch yet.  Yeah.  So the things you have to click on if you do touch only don't work so well.  But that size screen, the touch should work okay, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  And so a lot of people, you know, I think I'm recommending more and more  that people have multiple displays for different reasons.  And using a Chromebook or Chromebase or some Chrome OS based device  is very secure for email and web browsing.  You want to go ahead and be tracked, but not get malware  and not have the phishing attacks and all that kind of stuff.  Then do email and most of your web browsing on a Chromebook or Chromebase.  And this is a great way to do that.  And then if you have to have another device, you can use that for other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This could be like the banking terminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're so cheap now.  They're so inexpensive that there's no reason not to do this.  This supports the Visa mounting interface standard.  So you can mount it on a big boom or whatever on the wall, whatever.  This is the return of the kitchen computer.  Exactly.  So at $430, I don't see any reason why anybody wouldn't want to get this  for the kitchen, for just have around the house to have on your desk.  Get two of them.  Get one for the kids.  It's a Chromebook or it's a giant Chromebook that supports touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I see a Bob's couch soon set up with this built in.  Yes.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be great?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got to be.  It's not a lap.  You can't lap this.  This is a table or a wall.  It'll crush your lap.  If it's got a Visa mount, that's kind of cool.  You get for twice as much as the actual cost of the computer.  Right.  Have an arm, an articulating arm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One use case, you put this on your desk at home and you have another one at work  and you don't carry anything back and forth from home to work.  You just sit down and all that stuff is in the cloud.  And you can do nowadays, as we've discussed on the show  multiple times with the Chromebooks, you can do everything just about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm very, I completely, as everybody knows, changed my tune on these things.  I really like the books.  I love the pixel and they give you enormous.  I wish this again, we need a pixel version of this, right?  A high end.  It would be 2000 bucks though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's right now that Google is off on its own.  Sundar did Chrome, did Android.  Yeah.  Do you think that the Chrome browser, I'm sure is safe?  Oh, yeah.  You can ever make another pixel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think so.  Yeah.  I mean, just for Google employees and, you know, in alphabet employees to use.  I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Somebody suggests this would be a great bathroom computer, although  it doesn't matter on the wall, but don't get the touch version.  Hey, could I, does there a camera on it?  Is it a decent camera?  Yeah, there's a camera.  Could I do my Facebook live stream?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could, yes.  Get it.  You get a cat and go to the orthodontist and have your teeth ruined.  I think you, you know, you're going to go places kid.  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It has 10 point touch because that's expensive.  That's probably one of the reasons why it is so expensive.  Nice pick.  Very nice.  I think we should wrap this up now since on a high note,  because anything I say might be depressing.  Hey, Matthew, thank you for joining us from the lake.  God, you could have been fishing, swimming, kayak and canoeing, hiking, making back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to get one of those tablet things.  I've been taking it out in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Great to have you as always fortune.com at Matthew I on the Twitter.  One T in the Matthew though that might throw you.  So just one T, Matthew.  And Instagram too.  I don't know where I see your pictures, but some beautiful pictures of  sunset on the lake from the canoe.  Your lovely wife.  It's just a congratulations.  This is your 28th?  28th.  28th anniversary.  Very nice.  Thank you, Matthew.  Thanks for having me.  Jeff Jarvis, thank you for thank you to your kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, for putting up with me wanting to be on the show today.  But this was an important week.  It's always an important week on Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You were scheduled to pick them at the airport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was all kinds of logistical things and they moved mountains and got here back in  time to move themselves and so I thank them.  And by the way, I should plug that as of today, I started a new media column in the New York  Observer, which is called...  Nice.  What's it called?  I don't know if they gave it a name or not.  I actually don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you're back to becoming an Inkstein rich once again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had to admit that I wrote to the editor who was nice enough to ask me to do this and  I thought about it for a while and I thought, I said, you know, I'm editorially feral.  I don't deal well with editors anymore.  You sure you want me?  And he said, well, I'm a light touch.  And so there it is.  So under innovation of the Observer, I argued that we have too many journalists.  I don't really mean it.  You'll see what I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what?  This looks like a night.  I don't know much about the Observer.  What's the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Observer has been a really, really neat publication in New York for,  I don't know, 25 years now.  Was it a print paper?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Still is.  It was salmon colored.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they also have an online site called Observer.com.  Looks quite good.  You know what?  I'm going to add this to my regular visits.  This looks great.  No paywall, huh?  Nope.  Nice.  Are you in the internet culture section?  I'm in the innovation section.  Innovation, but then there's sub-heads.  Media.  I guess under media.  Under media, internet innovation, media.  That would be a good place to put you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's amid layoffs, amid constantly off-straddle,  should stop parroting each other.  There it is.  There it is, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is a great picture at the Evening Standard in 1975.  You and Matthew remembered days like that.  Typewriters, telephones with dials.  Pneumatic tubes.  Pneumatic tubes.  Pneumatic tubes.  I love those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I remember when they were copy boys.  I know.  No, I used to love being able to scream, copy!  They come, they get it.  You rip it out of the typewriter.  They bring it down to type setting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They still say that at the Huffington Post.  Do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We usually see an article on another site and they're like, copy!  Copy!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.  Something different now.  Matthew, get beat Mike.  Get beat Mike's closures.
