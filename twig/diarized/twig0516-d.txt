Transcript:  It's time for twig this week in Google. There's lots to talk about this week.  Jeff Jarvis and Kevin Toffler here will chart how Google's privacy policy has changed over the last 20 years.  We'll debunk a rumor that Google is about to create a fourth telecom company.  And we'll talk about the 25th anniversary of a little e-commerce startup you might know.  It's all coming up next on twig.  From the podcasts you love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From people you trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Now I don't know where the Linux comes from, but we actually do have some Linux stories this week in Google mixed in.  Like a little, a little cream in your coffee.  We also have some Facebook and Twitter and we have a very sleepy Jeff Jarvis who is in Madrid right now.  He's had a couple of cervezas. He's had some jamon ibérico.  He's had some queso fundido.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I went to a Mexican restaurant in Madrid, which is kind of insane, but you have queso fundido.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm so jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And was it good?  Taco al pastor con queso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's hysterical. That's Mexican food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know. That's what I did tonight. Well, because here's why.  It's because of you.  Me?  Because every restaurant opens at nine o'clock and I got to be here at 10.30.  I know.  So I had to, I went over the Goya stop on the Metro and just tried to find a restaurant nearby that was open at eight o'clock.  Oh God. I know. Isn't that weird?  I hung out for an hour to get to eight o'clock so I could have dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Barcelona is like that too.  It's like you're going to the Denny's early bird dinner if you try to eat at seven. It's like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All kinds of restaurants do not open until nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I apologize, but I'm glad you got something delicious. It sounds like.  It was good. It was so much.  Thank you. What brings you to Madrid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Delicioso y demasiado.  What's that?  The IAMCR. I don't even know what that stands for. Academic Conference. I'm giving a presentation tomorrow.  Post Gutenberg, post mass. You've heard it before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the International Association for Media and Communication Research. IAMCR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I did that. I'm doing that tomorrow. I've met with El País today and Ser Prisza Radio yesterday and university students tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We forget, we forget because Jeff's here all the time. He's such a regular guy. So, you know, he's always smart and everything.  We forget that he's actually pretty damn famous in the general world about town. I mean, he's like in demand speaker.  So that's awesome. And congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would be if it were not for this, I would be at VidCon this week, which rescheduled into July.  First time in five years. Good to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wanted to go to VidCon with Michael because he's 16. And of course, he's what does nothing.  As anybody under 20 doesn't watch TV, they watch YouTube.  Yeah, it's their TV. Yeah. VidCon is an amazing event.  Also with us, Kevin Toffle, co-host of the IAMCR. Dr. Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am not as famous as Jeff. I'm just here as a backup utility player, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he's the shortstop who came in when Wally Pip went out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There you go. Wally Pip. I'm repping my community college, Monaco Community College hat today.  Are you done with that class?  Oh, I'm taking a summer class. Abstract data types, data structures.  So yeah. Wow. And you do that in Python? Very cool.  No, that's in Java. Java. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So how many students in the class and what's the range of ability?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're all better than me. Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know you're humble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of tricky, Jeff, because this particular class being a 10 week summer class is an online class.  However, we do get together, oh gosh, three, four, sometimes five times a week at the campus library as a group to make it a little more social, to share ideas, basically to cheat.  No, no, no. To study. It's a study group.  It's a study group. Exactly.  No, no, no. So it's a good mix of folks.  A lot of smart guys and girls and hopefully I'm trying to work on some internship opportunities with some companies I may have worked for in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, cool. Wait a minute. You want to be an intern?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no. I'm trying to pull a string. I could be an intern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no. Kevin is the Chevy Chase of Monaco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I get it. Yeah. There you go. He gets it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's got it. You're talking about community. He must have been a TV guide, a former TV guide critic.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's so good to have Kevin. He is, of course, the major demo about Chromebooks.com and Stacey's co-host.  Stacey is in the midst of a move and so she's going to be a little late, but she will join us in about 15 minutes.  And Jeff, if you really get sleepy, let Stacey take your place.  I'll let you know.  Yeah, and you can take a break. But it's great to have both of you.  Thank you.  We have such good smart people.  Our Chromebooks fanatics.  Yeah. Did you like, did you enjoy? I thought it was a very, I thought it was kind of well done. The New York Times piece.  Now, I know you're not a fan of the Privacy Project, Jeff, but Charlie Wartzel and Ash Ngu, I'm not sure how you pronounce that,  did a really nice piece on Google's privacy policy, which when Google first started with 600 words is now 4000 words 20 years later.  And they did more about the change in society than it is the change in Google.  Absolutely. Absolutely. It's Google reflecting how the Internet, you know, and the requirements of the Internet changed over time.  For instance, in 1999, when they talk about sharing information, they say we only talk about our users in aggregate, not as individuals.  Three months later, that line was gone.  Reduced to its simple simplest form. That is a statement that Google did not do exactly what Google does now as its primary business model.  They clearly care about individuals.  So that's something.  Well, they should.  Yeah, right. But that's something that's changing.  I think that line in aggregate is still used commonly by a lot of companies saying, well, we're not, you know, Facebook even says we're not, we're not interested in you as an individual.  We're interested in you as part of a larger demographic.  But that's not necessarily the case these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It isn't. It isn't. I mean, the machine learning models that they want this data for, they're obviously aggregating data.  Those are in bulk.  But yeah, but there are other cases where the services are very highly targeted towards individuals.  So it's kind of a mix between the two these days, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here is probably a better illustration of what we're talking about.  From 1999, what Google collects for things aggregated search activity, personal information, you provide click through information and cookies.  And this is the list from 2019. Your name, password, phone number, payment information.  Now, this is maybe just being more accurate because, of course, they had to do all that before.  Telephone number, phone number, calling party number, receiving party number, forwarding numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They didn't have a telephone service back then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, maybe not. Yeah. Audio purchase activity.  They didn't have purchases.  It's all coming from Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They did props.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You perhaps get your IP address, but now they're saying it explicitly.  Data from publicly accessible sources.  That's a big change.  That means their data sharing with trusted partners, marketing partners, security partners and advertisers.  That's a two way street.  Data from publicly accessible sources.  Not to, but from.  Location data, of course, that's become perfected since mobile began.  1999 wasn't mobile.  That was on your desktop.  So who cares what your location was?  You didn't go anywhere.  So that's a big change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't see anything about the content in your home from like the smart speakers and such and Nest products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love. Here's a good one.  This is 2011 to 2012.  One year difference.  The striker is the stuff that's gone, which is pretty much all of it.  And then they're on the blue on the right is this.  They pretty much replaced it.  You know, this is what the new language was for information we share.  We share personal information.  OK, not aggregated.  Personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google.  When we have your consent to do so, we require opt in consent.  Bravo, Google.  For the sharing of any.  Oh, wait a minute.  That's just for sensitive personal information.  And you have to figure out what they mean by that.  So this is, you know, it's a longer article than we have time to discuss.  There's there's the before GDPR and after GDPR, which is a lot longer.  A lot longer.  That's that's actually probably a good thing.  On the other hand, when something gets this long, does anybody read it?  Sure, there's more.  You know, they're they're more transparent about what they're collecting because GDPR made them be.  But it also makes it completely impossible to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, we had time for Mary Meeker slide deck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is shorter than the Meeker slide deck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By comparison to I think I mentioned this in a show a couple of weeks ago.  When Facebook first had moderators, they had a one page guidelines, which basically if you didn't like it, get rid of it.  And now it's a 40 page.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Times have changed and no better way.  I think that that to look at Google's privacy policy and policy now it's changed over the last that's 20 years.  It's kind of kind of amazing.  Great piece. I thought.  Thank you, Charlie.  Google is this is from the post.  So you're going to have to take it with a grain of salt or not.  Google is joining the New York Post, not the Washington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that's that's that's a salt lake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, salt lake. It's a Murdoch corporate organization.  Google joins Dish. I think this is accurate and talks to create fourth mobile carrier quickly denied.  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the next is the next item in the run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, Alan Mullally, who we know well when he was the chairman of the Ford Motor Company, is now an alphabet director, according to the post, has recently been discussions with Dish about a plan to create a fourth player.  I'm glad that Alan's still in business.  I really thought he was a great CEO at Ford and so do many others.  And but the other thing that I liked about Alan is he was very forthright.  He really he enjoyed talking to the press and I don't think was a covert or a secretive guy at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he advertised on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he happened to be an advertiser.  So Google denies it.  But let me let me read the denial.  Is it a denial or a non denial denial?  These claims are simply false.  That's a denial.  That's a denial denial.  Google is not having any conversations with Dish about creating a wireless network.  However, he did decline to comment on whether Mullally was speaking to Dish.  Maybe Alphabet's doing it, not Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Or with Google Fi, maybe they would just not create a wireless network, but add one to Google Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would explain, though, the post mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, there is Fi is a fourth network.  It's an MVNO running on T-Mobile, Sprint and US Cellular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think Google competing with phone companies.  Haven't we always said that Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, get them in trouble.  We've always thought we always wish Google would.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think it's a business they really want to be in personally.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they got out of the fiber business, the internet business, why would they get into the far worse, more...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they out or just stopped on fiber, by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Out.  What happened to the service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've been slowly shutting it down, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, one city.  They are still available.  You can still get it in a couple of cities, but other than that, they are not going to roll out new ones.  So, yeah, but that's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, if you go to the Google Fiber website, that's not the impression you get.  You get faster, fairer, kinder internet.  I'll take it.  If you look at the cities, Atlanta, they're still showing.  Austin, they're still showing.  There are some asterisks.  I don't know what the asterisks lead to.  Soon to be shut down.  Right.  Upgrade your internet experience.  Oh, this is because they do the deal with Webpass, which is a provider in San Francisco.  Right.  Yeah.  So, it's not Google's infrastructure.  It's Webpass's infrastructure.  And it's only in apartment buildings, by the way.  But it's nice if you get it.  Remember, O'Malley was in love with Webpass.  He had Webpass in his apartment.  He loved it.  So, yeah.  I mean, I think Google...  Well, what about Project Loon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was going to bring that up.  Like, they don't want to be a phone carrier.  They want to put balloons in the air.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in fact, now we know that there is a balloon that's been up for 200-some days.  It's traveled almost all the way around the world.  And I guess they're providing internet access via those weather balloons to...  What is it?  West Africa?  So...  Atlanta.  Yeah.  So, it's not around.  It's not Kenya, I guess.  Well, they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just last week, I think we had a story that they were applying to actually provide it  in some place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well...  Yeah, we're...  So, now we got Amazon, by the way, which just got FCC approval to put up hundreds of satellites  for low-Earth orbit internet access.  12,000 satellites from Elon Musk's Starlink.  So, I think the total is something like 15,000 or 16,000 satellites for the two of them.  Then you're going to have lower balloons in the...  But they're not there in the stratosphere, I think.  So, they're going to be there pretty soon.  You're not going to...  There won't be any sunlight.  It's...  But we got lots of internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fine.  Maybe it helps with the climate change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I think that Facebook dropped its plans to fly...  Remember, they had a drone that was going to provide internet.  Akidos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, 15 minutes of service, yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, I do hope that actually I am kind of rooting for Elon and or Amazon because the  idea of gigabit internet on every square foot of the planet is really attractive to me as  a podcaster because we could do the show anywhere.  You wouldn't have to worry about getting hotel internet anymore.  I don't think it would work.  You don't think it would work?  Because of latency?  No, latency, exactly.  But that's why they're low Earth orbit.  That improves the latency.  But you're right.  It's still more latent than landline.  Let's beta test.  Okay.  I'll try it.  I'll be the first.  I'll be your guinea pig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I put a balloon over my house, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if it's low Earth orbit, it's closer to you than...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It might be than your central office.  Central office?  Yeah, might be.  Oh, they claim pretty low latency.  I don't, you know, we'll see.  Yeah, I gotta wait and see.  Elon's already, you know, he put up 60 Starlinks and they've already lost two of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One fell in my backyard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me see if that's right.  I want to because when they first launched the 60 satellites, they said they had all  of them.  But now as of end of June, all but three they have.  And two of them have been deorbited.  That means what crashed into the atmosphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Deorbited is like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Destroyed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, I don't know, is that a good percentage or bad percentage of three out of 60 fail?  What you don't want is not so much failures.  So much failures, fine.  You won't want to lose track of them.  You don't want to lose control of them because the key on these is that they don't run into  anything.  If you're going to put 12,000 bits of debris in the...  Admittedly, there's a lot of space up there, but you don't want them up there.  Final orbit will be 550 kilometers.  So, it is still pretty distant.  That's still farther than your central office.  It's pretty...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you get to cruising altitude at 35,000 feet.  Yeah.  You think you're high up.  Yeah.  Oh, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, the reason that they crashed those two is they just...  There wasn't anything wrong with them.  They just wanted to test it.  They wanted to see if they could deorbit.  So, this is actually responsible.  They wanted to make sure that if it needed to, that they could take the satellite and  crash it into the atmosphere, which would burn it up, of course.  Five of the satellites still raised their hands.  Five are still earning additional systems checks.  So, it's actually...  Have I told you the story of Space Lab and me?  Have I told you that story on the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Space Lab?  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Space Lab's the one that crashed into the atmosphere.  And it was a big deal.  And everybody said, oh, Space Lab's going to hit us.  And did you get hit by Space Lab?  No.  I was at the San Francisco Examiner and I offered $10,000 to the first person to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was at the San Francisco Examiner and I offered $10,000 to the first person to arrive  at our offices with a piece of Skylab.  Skylab.  That's it.  Yeah, yeah.  Skylab.  Skylab.  And I called NASA and got their assurances, this thing's falling over water.  No way you're paying.  I told the publisher, no way we're paying.  You said it's safe.  So, a 17-year-old beer truck helper named Stan Fort arrived at our offices with minutes  to spare with pieces of Skylab.  Oh my God.  How much did you have to give him?  And so, we had to send one of our editors to Huntsville.  So, did Phil Bronstink strangle you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, he was gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was not there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Did Will Hurst strangle you?  It was Will's money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was Will's money.  So, the publisher, well, actually it led to my departure from San Francisco because I  got a lot more publicity than the publisher.  Oh, awesome.  So, we sent an editor to Huntsville who had to spend a week there waiting for NASA to  authenticate these little black blobs.  That's so funny.  And there was much panic because they said, well, we can't find these elements in Skylab.  There's nothing organic in Skylab except perhaps astronaut poop.  Oh my God.  So, we thought for a while that it was astronaut poop that we had there.  Skylab coprolites.  But in fact, there was balsa wood in the lining of Skylab.  What? Really?  And so they verified that Skylab, we gave $10,000 to young Stan Thornton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here you go.  Skylab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was our old newspaper war thing we did.  Watch this.  Oh my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Watch this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Skylab is going to fall.  The experts still think it's going to happen around midday tomorrow, but they won't know  where until about two hours before the impact.  Our science correspondent, John...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish network announcers still talked like that because I could get a job.  We don't know where Skylab will fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Skylab control center at NASA.  You have to grow a mustache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will be glad to grow that mustache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's easy to see this falling spacecraft has caught the world's imagination and attracted  the world's press corps.  Reporters from Japan, Australia, and Canada are here to name just a few.  They're all studying maps and puzzling over orbital charts, wondering about the predictions  on Skylab's fall.  And the story of Skylab's demise is being told in almost every language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  News was a more leisurely profession in those days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But right now, Japan appears safe from Skylab.  However, Australia may be on the path.  And Canada and the United States seem to be prime targets.  What could well be Skylab's final orbit passes over parts of Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia.  But space agency officials don't like to talk about all the land beneath Skylab on that possible final orbit.  No, they prefer to talk about all the water that will be under Skylab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's a better chance it'll hit water.  That was what they told me.  Yeah, it's going to hit the water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're safe.  No chance, Superland. No chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know what network that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We shared a composing room with the San Francisco Chronicle.  And we snooped on them and found out they were going to offer Skylab insurance to Chronicle readers.  If you died or lost a limb, you would get a payout.  That's horrible.  If you were a subscriber.  We sat there and said, what can we do to beat them to the punch?  And we came up with the $10,000 for Skylab.  Brilliant.  We made fun of the Chronicle for saying how dystopian they were, how negative they were.  Yeah, you're positive.  We were positive. We were on for a roar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who was the publisher that did not like that?  Reg Murphy.  Reg. Oh, Reg. Where is he now?  I don't know.  He's buried somewhere with some astronaut poop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I still have a trophy with Skylab astronaut poop in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You do? You actually have some Skylab?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Probably the only one on the planet, Doug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is so awesome.  So awesome.  All right.  I think there's some Chromebook news.  And since Kevin's here, we're going to do that.  And then we want to talk about a New Yorker article, the fight for the future of YouTube.  I haven't read it yet, but I'm sure Jeff being the literate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't either because I don't want to use my New Yorker articles for the month.  I don't know if you're going to talk about it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The paywall strikes again.  Well, let's see. I'll pull it up and then you can read it over my shoulder while I talk about our sponsor today.  Actually, a good picture of Susan Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube.  She looks tough and ready to take on the challenge.  How neutral should a social media platform try to be?  This is Nehma Jarome.  Actually, we've had this conversation many times, so we don't need to reprise it.  Our show today brought to you by a very confusing sponsor.  I'll tell you why. They're called Ahrefs, but they're spelled A-H-R-E-Fs.  But that's okay, because if you know the web, you know what Ahrefs are, right?  That's part of the linking system in HTML.  Ahrefs, or Ahrefs as they call themselves, is an all-in-one SEO toolset that's here to help you  and gives you the tools you need to rank your website in Google.  This isn't snake oil SEO. This is real stuff that really will help,  whether you work for a big brand or run your own small business  or even do freelance work getting traffic to your website.  I actually have a friend who says, how do I get more people to go to my website?  The nice thing about Ahrefs is it's affordable enough. I can point her to this.  For instance, they make competitive analysis easy.  She's a massage therapist in Sonoma.  She says, when I search for massage Sonoma, there's 20 people ahead of me.  Well, those are your competitors with Ahrefs tools.  You can show how they're getting traffic from Google and why.  You can see the pages and content that send your competitors the most search traffic.  You can see what it is people are looking for.  You can find out the exact keywords your competitors are ranking for,  which backlinks are helping them rank, because it's the backlinks that drive you up the ranking.  From there, you can replicate or improve on their strategies.  You now have that information about what's the other guy doing that they're beating us.  If you're not getting significant search traffic, Ahrefs tools help you find topics worth creating pages for or content on.  You can easily see estimated search volumes, gauge the traffic potential.  They have this great keywords explorer tool.  If you are getting search traffic, data like their top pages report helps you know which of your pages are bringing in the most traffic.

Transcript:  Quick program note. Stacy will not be joining us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, okay. She got tied up. You can still take a nap if you want, Jeff. It's okay.  This is really if you read this New Yorker article, it really is what we've been talking about for weeks, months.  I mean, it's the whole story, the ins and outs, the idea that radicalizes people, the problem with banning people, the problem with demonetizing people, YouTube's values.  What are they? Whether it should have values and how it should uphold them.  In fact, that seems to be a question that even YouTube hasn't really answered.  So I don't know if there's any answer in here. It's really but it's a good article if you want a survey of the stuff that we've been talking about all this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it keeps coming back to, you know, I was at this lunch today at this academic conference and somebody said, what research should we do?  And I said, the problem is that most of the discussion is around what does technology do to people?  And that's not the story. It's how are people using the technology for good and ill?  And that's what I think the story of YouTube and Facebook and Twitter really is, is what we're doing is it's the story of society today.  Yeah. And regulation is an attempt to regulate our behavior.  And, you know, our good and bad stuff is about us, not the technology. It doesn't make us do that.  We have agency. We know what we're deciding to do, including what we decide to be a holds.  And so that's the interesting thing about this is really we're trying to re-figure out how to regulate each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I honestly have come more and more to that opinion that it's that there's nothing the platforms really can or maybe even should do.  It's up to us rejecting things we don't like and promote.  Now, one thing that they talk about in the New Yorker article is Creators for Change.  The idea and a lot of companies are doing this of creating kind of a positive force, funding a positive force.  That's the kind of proactive instead of reactive way to improve content on Facebook.  And there's some question about how well Creators for Change works. It does put better content on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is critical. You know, Dana Boyd talks about the data voids that exist. That's trademark. Dana Boyd's data voids.  And one of the problems they have is you have things like PragerU up there, making very slick right wing videos.  Propaganda. Propaganda.  And the platforms don't have things to counterpoint that with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's exactly what they're talking about, what they call counter speech, which is creating a counterbalance to one side just to give you content to counteract it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But as we discussed the show before, nobody thinks they need to make a video saying the Holocaust happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  But we need that.  Yep. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's where I think that the Green Brothers are an important force in my view.  Love what they're doing.  Because they make educational video about basic topics in some cases that are explanatory that create that kind of base. We need more like that. More like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So good. I think a fairly good article on here.  So not dystopian?  Not dystopian and really just kind of more a survey of what's happened, what's been going on.  Did YouTube cooperate with it?  Yes. And Naima Jerome seems to, at least they've got a lot of quotes in here, cooperate. I don't know what that means.  But in fact, there's a comment from YouTube on this about their hate speech rollout. But I think the creators for change is the big focus here.  And I think it's a very, you know, the issues of, okay, you can make those videos. How do you surface them?  This recommendation engine problem is a problem that's not going to go away because, you know, if you tweak it to improve engagement, you're going to surface hateful stuff.  That's what engages people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had this discussion today at a newspaper company here where a very bright executive said, you know, the Trump bump was good.  Do we end up in a moral hazard of wishing for bad stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's good for ratings. That's what Les Moonves said, right? It's good for ratings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'd be bad for America, but good for our business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then here's an article from Casey Newton. Once again, great piece from Casey on The Verge.  The pivot to privacy at Facebook is creating a problem because now bad actors have private spaces to gather.  Well, what a shock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And what do you want? You take them out of being under your nose.  Yeah.  And you can't see them. And now you complain that you can't see them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Le Monde, the French paper Le Monde found a group with 56,000 members devoted largely to making anti-female comments, misogynist comments.  Of course, we have just heard about the Border Patrol group.  A group that's been operated for some time, a Border Patrol agent, a secret private, a secret maybe not, but private group on Facebook joking about migrant deaths and making racist and just highly offensive comments.  So in other words, this is just, this is the other side of the face. Yeah, you can go anonymous.  I honestly, given the choice between anonymous and public, I'd like to see the hate groups be public.  But then you have this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got a point. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. But then you have this problem of people being drawn to it.  I don't. It's so hard. It's so hard.  I don't know what the right answer is.  Let's talk a little bit about the Chromebook.  So we can start with your article about Chrome OS 75, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, what a debacle that's been.  So what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Explain that to us, Dr. Crowe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I can, I can explain what happened. I don't have all the details as to why it happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been coming out last week and then they pulled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  And in fact, last week it was actually already a couple of weeks late, like two, two weeks late for no apparent reason.  But then, but yes, it started to roll out and then pretty quickly got pulled.  So the rollout stopped.  Now, I already had the version that they had rolled out.  I did not have any issues.  Then let's see.  They started rolling out again to the pixel slate just late last week.  So they were working on the fixes. The bugs were private.  Nobody knew anything.  I had asked Google for a response on what was going on and I got nothing.  It's been a week, week and a half since I've been waiting for that.  Then finally, after the pixel slate started getting it a few days ago, just yesterday, I believe, is when everybody started getting it.  So I don't know.  I'd heard a lot of issues with the dev and beta channel versions of seventy five.  And I did see some of them, such as the Google Play Store would load.  But then when you try and get an app, it would say, I don't have Internet connectivity.  That's obviously not good.  We've got people that had no access to their Linux containers at all.  And I mean, somebody like me, I use that every day for coding and I'd be kind of screwed.  So there were definitely some issues that we know of.  And I'm wondering if there are issues that we still don't know about yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just relax. Seventy four is not the end of the world.  Just stick with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was good in seventy five? What should I be jealous that you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, one of the things in seventy five, Jeff, is is definitely geared towards the pixel slate.  And that was they finally addressed and improved the animations and tablet modes.  They're not iPad pro like, but they're at least good, I guess is the best way to say it.  So there are some parental controls in seventy five Linux.  You can access Android devices over USB.  So if you're rooting your phone or you're putting custom ROMs on, you can do that from a Chromebook now.  One interesting thing, if you had any Android apps installed for cloud services such as OneDrive, a couple of other ones,  if you had the Android app installed with seventy five, it actually shows up as a mounted drive in your files app.  So that's kind of cool. Yeah, I get excited over the little stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, that's why you're the host of about Chromebooks dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There you go. Oh, reader mode. You get reader mode to Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like reader mode, actually.  I love your mode. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it strips away all of the ads and other superfluous content.  So it's just the content that you want to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not crazy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From an app perspective, as a publisher, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I understand.  Yeah, actually, Apple was the first to do this with Safari many years ago and publishers didn't like it then.  But if Chrome does it, that's a big deal.  And it's actually a little surprising that Google would do this given their business model.  But I like it. I'm glad I look forward to that.  Will that go to Chrome as well? Besides Chrome OS, will that be part of Chrome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that'll be on the Chrome browser for all platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice. Yeah.  It's funny that they went, you know, Apple got a lot of heat, but because it was just Apple, I think people kind of, oh, well, that's Apple.  What are you going to do? But when Google does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Debian 10 Buster.  Only Kevin cares about this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. So there were a couple of pages of this, at least five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the deal with Project Crustini, which allows you to run Linux kind of in a it's a charute, right?  Is that how you run it in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's actually Linux is running.  That's the old way.  That's the crouton way.  Okay. Yeah.  The Crustini is a Linux container running in a virtual machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of like Docker a little bit or something like that.  Yeah. Yeah.  And so you can this is this is you can have different Linux is right.  You get your choice.  One of the most popular Linux versions out there.  It's one of my favorites is Debbie.  And it's it's what Ubuntu and Mint and Papa Wesson.  A lot of other spins are based on.  It's kind of the community version of Linux Buster is the most recent version came out July 6th.  But you can't get it on your Chromebook.  I guess. Does that mean Google does some stuff before they allow you to download it?  Yeah, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They actually created the custom VM for for for this tool work.  So they've got a lot of sandboxing in between Chrome OS and the VM and the container.  So they've got a they can't just slap an image in there and call it a day.  You know, because these things are interactive.  Right. You've got access to the Linux file system in the Chrome OS file system and so on.  So there's a lot of a lot of mojo going on there.  You can do it yourself, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's if you're really crazy.  Kevin has an article crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's three. It's only three commands.  I mean, it took me 15 minutes to do everything seems to work.  But of course, I didn't test every single feature of Chrome OS and Christine.  But yeah, you can just run three commands and do it yourself.  So I have Buster on one of my Chromebooks.  It's working fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you modify basically you add it to your sources and then you can do the dist upgrade once you add it to your sources.  Bingo.  OK, that sounds a little risky, but what the hell?  Debbie and I test machine.  Yeah. Debbie and has forty five thousand apps that they mean that they maintain.  So it is a significant.  I know if people sometimes say, I can't use Linux, there's just not enough software for it's like, oh, yeah, there is.  But that's one of the issues, Debbie.  And is they that is a big project and there's a lot to do.  And it's all done by volunteers and forty five thousand apps.  And they have to keep them all up to date.  And most importantly, security patches for all of them.  That is not insignificant amount of work.  So I took my hat to the Debbie and project.  Those guys do a great job.  That's a lot of work.  And if you use Ubuntu or if you use Mint or Popo, that's my current favorite distro.  You should tip your hat to them, too, because I'm just reading a post from the Popo guys.  People said, well, why don't you just use Debbie and why do you use Ubuntu?  And I said, well, because there's only a few of us.  There's a lot of people.  So Ubuntu takes forty five thousand packages, makes sure all the security things are up to date and all that stuff.  And then Popo West can take the Ubuntu distro.  You take advantage. It's really their stand.  Everybody's and this is how open source works.  That's why it's so great. Everybody stands on the shoulders of each other.  In fact, that's how Chromebook works. Chrome OS is on Linux.  Do is it what what version of Linux is Chrome OS on?  Is it their own? You know, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I heard it was based on Gen 2.  Why? Yeah, I'm not 100 percent sure.  But that's the trick with this whole Christine thing.  There's there's Chrome OS on top of Linux.  So you don't know it, obviously.  It's just there. You're using Chrome OS, the interface.  But they use the same Linux kernel to China, kind of replicate or take advantage of in the Christine container.  So it's it's all just one platform with all these things on top of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Gen 2 is a good version to use because you built it yourself.  You kind of roll your own from the beginning on up.  And so the people who are doing Chrome OS can say, well, we're going to put that in, but not that.  Let's see. Stadia Linux.  You should do a Linux show.  I really want it. You could tell I kind of wanted to a Linux show.  I mean, you know, we were interested in that.  There aren't there aren't the kind of personalities and players.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, there I think we could find them.  There's some really good Linux people on YouTube and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But and there's people like Doc Searles who writes the Linux magazine.  Yeah, no, that's true.  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it would be more of a how to show than it would be like this.  A philosophical. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am honestly of the opinion that Linux is dominance is now very clear and it's going to eventually just be the  dominant operating system.  And I think it couldn't be a better time because proprietary the problem with proprietary operating systems is you're you're then reliant upon some giant corporation to to keep it up to date to fix it to keep it secure.  And that's not working so very well.  And I think the at least operating system should be not not proprietary.  Okay, application software can be proprietary, but operating systems that they should be non proprietary.  And I think Linux is a very good candidate.  Any Unix based operating system.  But that's I like what you said.  I think before the show, did you predict that Windows will give up on Windows?  I think so.  There's no Microsoft's money is no longer used to be Microsoft made its money on Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not a good thing.  It's a good thing.  It's a good thing.  It's a good thing.  It's a good thing.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no Microsoft's money is no longer used to be Microsoft made its money on Windows in office.  That was it.  And that was you know, they the fact that was the innovation that Bill Gates created the whole notion of selling bits up until Bill Gates and Microsoft came along and started selling software.  Software was basically free, freely traded.  If it's you try to make money on it, chances it would get pirated or very high.  It just was it just there was nobody really thought you could make a business around software and and Microsoft showed that you could and you got to give them credit because if it weren't for Windows in the 90s, you know, I mean, they really powered the personal computer revolution.  Maybe not in the best direction, but they certainly powered it.  But now that we have an open source operating system, I think there's a great article.  It's really kind of a it's an essay by Neil Stevenson, one of my favorite authors that's 20 years old, but is very germane today called In the Beginning was the Command Line.  And he talks about this in I think a very observant and intelligent way.  And in the long run, operating systems are so fundamental and so basic that they they should be free and open and widely available.  And the money should be made on top of them.  And that's really what Microsoft has done.  They have Windows, but honestly, their future is all in cloud.  It's all in Azure.  It's all in services.  Even Apple is saying, well, we can't really sell any more iPhones.  So let's let's make our money on iPhone users and services.  That's that's where this is all moving.  And it's platform agnostic.  You know, that's why you can use a Chromebook, Jeff, because it doesn't most of the stuff you're doing doesn't care what operating system you're using.  It's on it's on the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I love it.  Yeah, it's no longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's no longer the case that you have to have Windows or you have to have Mac OS or you know, plus the beauty of Chrome is that it's it's not an operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  It's the it's the unoperated system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but it is writing.  It is writing.  I mean, Chrome OS is writing on on the open source and no reason why it shouldn't.  It'd be nuts to have made Chrome OS based on Microsoft Windows.  That would have been a horrible nightmare.  And look what's look how this we just talked about Debian and then Ubuntu is running on Debian and then Papa is writing on Ubuntu or Chrome OS is running on get to imagine that happening in the proprietary operating system.  It couldn't it wouldn't it wouldn't work.  The whole thing would be a house of cards.  It would fall down.  But because this it's a really remarkable thing.  It's one of the great remarkable success stories of technology.  If you ask me and of the Internet.  You know what else is running on Linux?  Stadia.  We're starting to learn a little bit more about their gaming play.  Well, that's probably a bad word to use in that context.  Their gaming platform.  There's an FAQ now on Google support, which talks about the signup process.  It's coming in November.  A redemption code will be sent to the account used to purchase the Founders Edition.  If you bought that a lot of people around here did.  I did not.  Once you get that redemption.  You did.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Because you get a special controller.  You get a Chromecast Ultra.  You get a free game that nobody wants.  Destiny 2 or whatever.  Gaming is a service.  Gaming is a service.  But remember, Stadia, you have to buy all the titles.  You don't get any.  At least there will be a free tier later.  But right now you'll be buying whatever games you want to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The free tier, you'll still have to buy the games.  You will.  It's just free service.  Please.  Well, you buy the game and then you can play it.  I know.  You play it on there.  Here's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you own the game in the same way that if you went to GameStop and you bought a DVD and you took it home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have said publicly that even if the game company stops supporting Stadia, you will still own that game and be able to play it on Stadia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But only on Stadia?  But only on Stadia.  It's a Stadia game.  So that's my question.  Is it like that or is it like the ebook you bought from Microsoft, which last week Microsoft just turned off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say it is not like that.  Yeah, BS.  But yeah, yeah.  Where are you going to get the bits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We decided to kill Stadia.  Okay.  Can I have my game?  What do you mean?  Well, I want my game.  I bought this game.  It doesn't exist anymore.  And by the way, they're not cheap, right?  They're the same price.  They're 60 bucks.  It's the same price as if you went to GameStop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you'll get some discounts in the pro version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is, Carson's got a really good insight in this and it's mostly because of Zach, your son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, this is all, all Stadia is, is you renting a computer.  You're renting a computer in the cloud.  From Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it's a more powerful computer, even potentially a gang of computers.  Yes.  Which you wouldn't own.  Much better computer than I own.  That's for sure.  And potentially multiple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really great for things like video editing coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's, this is all part of that same conversation.  Goodbye, proprietary operating systems.  You will have a thin client in your house.  Doesn't need to be an operating system at all because your computer's in the cloud.  Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't wait for my spark box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is a spark box a thin client?  It's a son joke.  Yeah.  But didn't it have like a processor and stuff?  It did have a processor, but it was, it was a thin, it was a pretty thin.  Thin-ish, thin-ish client.  Actually, it's funny because Larry Ellison of Oracle fame started a thin,  thin client computer company called Think.  Do you remember this?  In the 90s?  Oh, God, yes.  Yeah, yeah.  It was just too ahead of its time.  In fact, Gina Smith, our friend Gina Smith ran it.  And it was on a, and it was on a pier in San Francisco, but it, it didn't go anywhere  because it was too soon.  Had he started today, maybe.  And yet there are a lot of us old timers who say, well, wait a minute.  Wasn't the whole personal computer revolution about getting away from the client  server architecture and having a PC on our desk?  Wasn't that the whole point?  I get my own hard drive, my own processor, my own video card.  Have we abandoned that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was just that everyone has access to a computer.  In that era, that was the easiest way to get access to a computer.  In an era of ubiquitous bandwidth, maybe that's no longer true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the real question, by the way, Google has addressed this a couple of times.  This is giving way too much power to the gatekeepers, the ISPs.  And you'd better believe Comcast is rubbing their gleeful little hands at the notion that,  oh, you mean all computing will have to go through us?  Oh, oh, well, that's what an opportunity.  This, none of this works if you still have proprietary ISPs.  You also have to have some sort.  I think you're going to have to have a society run government.  I hate to use the word government.  It scares people.  Say municipal.  Municipal.  Everybody loves their city.  You're going to have to have some sort of public Internet infrastructure because this is not working either.  This is another big discontinuity in this system.  And all of this relies on it.  Mobile devices, Stadia, according to the FAQ, will support the Pixel 3.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  The Pixel 3 3A for mobile gameplay and tablets running Chrome OS.  More devices available in the future.  You have an Android phone right now and you're thinking, oh, I can't wait.  Got to have a Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's interesting they say tablets running Chrome OS.  Why?  Why?  Why not just any Chrome OS device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is any Chrome OS device, but it's all tablets.  They have to touch.  The only tablet that will run it is a tablet running Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's that's an interesting way to slice that.  OK.  He went to Harvard.  Mobile devices.  I see.  Chromebooks will still be.  It's all about sentence diagramming.  He knows how to diagram.  Oh, I knew I should have skipped that class.  Harvard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, he learned that I was trying to explain since diagramming to my kids.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sixth grade.  Yeah.  You went to a good school.  I went to public school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Raby Arc Public School in Montana and Helena, Montana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, it's Helena, Montana.  That's why.  That's why.  At this time, we have no news.  Say again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dreyer's English.  It's a new book out from the copy editor of Random House.  You told us about this and I'm buying.  I think I bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  An utterly correct guide to clarity and style.  Oh, you can't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  No.  Awesome.  Perfect graduation gift.  A sharp, funny grammar guide.  They'll actually want to read.  And this is, is this replacing Strunk and White?  Is this the new?  God, I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is Strunk and White with white wit.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's wrong with Strunk and White?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Strunk and White's fine, Grandpa.  It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody's saying Strunk and what?  What are you talking about?  I'll get Dreyer's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm now reading a book about the dictionary wars of Webster's attempt to make the English  language American versus Samuel Johnson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I love it.  What a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really is.  And post-revolutionary war, the Brits looking down on us and what we're doing to their language  and that we'll never be able to understand each other in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  I just, I will have Dreyer's tomorrow.  One day delivery is now a reality on Amazon for me.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the dictionary wars.  Is this the book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The American Fight Over the English Language.  Nice.  I want that.  Peter Martin, Princeton University.  Very nice.  Yeah.  This man reads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was reading that tonight with my queso fondido.  Oh.  Trying to make it not get grease on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why not get grease on it?  Then it shows you read it.  I break the spines.  I write stuff in it.  I want people to know.  I write stuff, but I don't want grease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just like, you know, you slop you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not decorative.  Let's see.  What happens to a game I bought if the publisher stops supporting Stadia in the future?  Yes.  Can you still play the game?  Once you purchase it, you own the right to play it.  In the future, it's possible some games may no longer be available for new purchases.  Existing players will still be able to play the game.  So this means this means that they've made a deal with these publishers.  Look, you no matter what, you got to keep supporting this.  You're in.  You're all in.  A Stadia account will support up to four Stadia controllers during local multiplayer gameplay.  This is the thing I was really interested in because they said that even with multiplayer, you might get multiple computers.  So everybody in the co-op game, this is one of the games, get packed.  It's their first exclusive coming next year with multiplayer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just so happy that local multiplayer is making a resurgence.  This is couch play, right?  Exactly.  This is what families want.  Yeah, you'd play Goldeneye, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  Left side of the screen, it'd be you.  Right side be your opponent.  So this is a hot job.  So this is this looks like a Sims game.  What is this?  What is this with games that simulate real life?  This is very popular.  Apparently you have to push.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's not cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's incredible physics in this thing, too.  Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go.  So this is couch play.  You can play next to each other.  It looks kind of fun.  Actually, it looks like a kind of game you laugh at, right?  Oh, they even call it couch.  Couch and online co-op.  Four player carnage.  But it's not it's a good kind of car.  Oh, don't get in that machine.  Yeah, don't.  Oh, no conveyor belt.  Ridiculous.  OK, so Goat Simulator is was the first game I experienced where it was all about just kind of aimless, crazy physics.  And this looks like it's it's kind of like like that.  Get packed.  All right.  From CoatSync.  All right.  That's the first Stadia exclusive.  Yeah, I am glad to Carson.  I feel like this is something that we lost out on this.  I get gamers became loners sitting by themselves in a darkened room.  The rest of the family either in their darkened room or doing something else.  Now the family could play together again.  I think that's good.  I like it.  Let's take a break.  And we're going to talk about Amazon at twenty five.  Google's twenty.  Amazon's twenty five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We hardly do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're starting to become there.  They grow up so fast.  They're moving out.  They never leave.  They never leave.  Our show today brought to you by Captera.  Finding software for your business is complicated.  I understand.  Nerve wracking.  You've already got a program you're using.  Maybe it requires Windows Vista and Internet Explorer 8, but it works sort of except when it crashes.  And the kid who wrote it, he was in high school when he wrote it for you.  It was the son's the boss's nephew's son.  But the problem with that is they're gone and your software, your whole business is running on it.  And I know this scenario plays itself out all the time all over the country.  Captera is the solution.  There is state of the art great software for every business just waiting for you.  Don't don't fear it.  Embrace it.  Embrace it.  Captera is the number one online resource to help you find the best software for your business.  Partly because they have every program.  Seven hundred categories.  All the big ones.  CRM, IT, project management.  There's e-commerce.  There's link management tools.  There's web conferencing.  But there's also it's fun to look through.  Actually, I really like just browsing through Captera load balancing software.  Let's see.  There's a license management software, legal document management software, a lot of legal stuff.  There's yoga studio.  Here's legal billing software.  You got a you got a law practice practice.  Panther legal software.  There's one.  Actually, there's dozens.  But once you narrow it down, you can then pick it, you know, filter the results by product rating users.  How many seats it can have?  How it's deployed, whether it's on premises or in the cloud, the features you need.  You can even compare side by side up to four programs.  They'll show you a list of related categories for further options.  But the best part is the reviews.  Captera has nearly a million reviews now, all of them vetted from real users.  That's one of the things kept her does so well.  This is such a great resource.  Thirty thousand new reviews every month.  That's a thousand a day.  That's awesome.  You can discover everything you need to make an informed choice.  Nine hundred fifty thousand user reviews.  That means that a couple of months it'll hit a million.  This is so great.  No matter what kind of software your business needs, Captera makes it easy to discover the right solution fast.  And by the way, once you find the right software, leave a review, pay it forward, help everybody else out.  Now you might say, well, that's pretty good.  How much is that going to be?  Twenty bucks a month, twenty five bucks a month, a hundred dollars.  What is it going to cost?  It's free.  It's free, free forever.  It's free free from accounting to zoo keeping.  Captera has every program you need.  Captera dot com slash twig.  Join the millions of people who used Captera last month to find the yes, every month to find the right tools for their business.  C.A.P. T.E.R.R.A dot com slash twig.  What a resource.  What a great resource.  Captera dot com slash twig.  And it's absolutely free.  Captera is software selection simplified.  You can forget that software that the kid wrote 20 years ago.  What about this Instagram plan to stop bullying by scanning the comments and warning you?  Oh, you're about to say something.  You want to say that?  Yeah, we're asking people to rethink comments that seem similar to others that have been reported.  It doesn't even say they're snotty.  If we made a mistake, let us know.  Do you think that's going to do anything?  They say that it has had an impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, good.  So as a friend of mine at Oxford said in response, give us the data.  Nobody checks their own homework.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, we have this on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I use the thing that blocks offensive tweets and whatnot because I just don't want to deal with it.  Quite honestly.  Yeah, more valuable, of course, the ability to restrict commenting from people that you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And here's an interesting pop up.  Are you having a problem with this person?  Protect yourself from unwanted interactions without them knowing.  Only you and this person will be able to see their new comments.  They will be able to see your new comments.  They won't see when you're online or when you've read their messages.  That's kind of good.  So if you're getting stalked, I'm sure this is becoming more of a problem on Instagram.  That's a good thing.  But the president can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Neither can AOC.  AOC can't either.  No public leader who is using one of these social platforms.  This is a court ruling that affirmed a lower court ruling.  Regarding the president.  Regarding the president.  But I think that that's the implication, right?  If you're a public figure using a social network to post pronouncements, you can't block people from commenting.  That's part of the deal.  Right?  That seems completely sensible.  And I'm sure it would apply to AOC.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has not officially applied to her yet, but she is being sued for blocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But does that also apply to bots?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you block bots?  Bots don't have rights.  Yeah, if you knew it was a bot, how do you know it's a bot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's various mechanisms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of hard to prove something's a bot though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  There's a media freedom conference going on in London right now.  Big deal conference yesterday today.  And they blocked a bunch.  The only time I have RT on is in a hotel room.  And they blocked RT and Sputnik.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To their complaint, of course.  It's widely considered Russian propaganda news sources.  Honestly, I read these stories and then I go, I'm just glad I'm not on Instagram.  I'm just glad I'm not on Facebook.  Oh, shush.  That seems to me the right solution.  Just don't participate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you're missing good things.  You're missing AOC who's doing amazing things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, at some point, the bad outweighs the good, but I'm not there yet.  So I'm on all of these just to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, at some point, the good outweighs the bad, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a non-combatant and I kind of enjoy that position.  I just say, I don't care whether the bad is outweighing the good, the good's outweighing the bad.  I just say goodbye.  And maybe that'll make it worse.  See, that's one of the problems, by the way, with all...  And this is historic.  This goes back to Usenet and the flame wars on Usenet and forums.  Anytime you start getting a lot of bad behavior, the good people don't fight back.  They just leave.  They go, yeah, fine.  And so your garden is suddenly overgrown with weeds.  You don't have any flowers.  You just have weeds.  And I think that that's kind of the inevitable devolution of a lot of social networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Usenet was utterly destroyed by flamebots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  That's right.  And I think that's true of a lot of fora.  And I don't...  You know, I mean, maybe I should be a gardener and getting in there, wading in and weeding,  putting good content in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We just need better tools, too, to ignore bozos.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To me, you know, for me, it's not a big political stance or anything.  It's just, it's not good for me.  And I don't want to be there, period.  I just don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's because you're also public and you get stuff.  I mean, I...  Again, I keep on saying...  Well, you do, too.  No, I really don't, as a rule, except for your viewers complain about my cameras.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You can take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook did have a tool that would help it track hoaxes and fake news about itself.  They shut it down a couple of years ago.  Storm Chaser and Night's Watch helped them track public sentiment over them.  Since 2016, Facebook employees have used Storm Chaser to track viral posts,  including a popular conspiracy.  The company listens to users through their phone's microphone.  This is a story from Bloomberg, of course, anonymous sources,  three former employees.  Storm Chaser is apparently one of multiple tools Facebook has used to manage its reputation.  But apparently they shut it down before anybody could say,  hey, well, if you've got that...  Facebook stopped using Storm Chaser to respond to memes in mid-2018,  but they don't say why.  Actually, this is a Facebook spokesperson who said,  we didn't use it to fight false news because that wasn't what it was built for  and it wouldn't have worked.  The tool was built with simple technology that helped us detect possible false news.  We used simple technology that helped us detect posts about Facebook based on keywords  so we could consider whether to respond to product confusion on our own platform.  So don't think we knew how to stop fake news.  We didn't.  Nothing to say here.  Move on.  Move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got me reading about the E Foundation now, all this talk about privacy.  I'm sure you've heard that big story with Google's privacy.  What's the E Foundation?  Oh, it's the un-Google phone.  Oh, it's a phone.  Hey, it's Lou.  It's a platform.  It's a de-Google platform.  And your data is your data, as they say.  E. Foundation.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But can you put this on your Android device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you can put it on certain devices now?  It's a wrong.  It's a wrong.  It is.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so it's Android, but it's an un-Google Android.  Yeah, it's AOSP.  Yeah.  So the minute you put anything on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the ultimate problem, isn't it?  I mean, you're going to give up privacy to get the functionality of the apps you want and use.  But it got me thinking, do I really need to be on all these social media channels?  OK, no, I don't have to put them on there.  There's an email app.  There's, I mean, I could move off Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you use their stock apps, I guess you're safer.  But the minute you put your standard app on there, it's, you know, this is something Apple started to do with iOS 13.  I think it's really good.  And man, it's really scary.  I put iOS 13 on my iPad.  It's going to be out in the fall, but they have a public beta today.  And if you, what it'll say, it'll pop up.  Hey, I just got, I can't remember.  But let's say some app, Facebook, has been tracking your location all the time.  Here's the here's three locations.  It just tells itself about it gives you a map, shows you the locations that some app that maybe doesn't even need location permissions.  Netflix just sent back information to the home office and then gives you.  Do you want to make this app only get location information when it's running or do you want to leave it the way it is?  I think that is a great solution from Apple.  Thank you, Apple.  That is really good.  And it's very dramatic.  They've always done this.  Hey, this app is, you know, getting location information.  Even when it's not running, you want to continue it.  But by putting a map in there saying, here's the last locations that it just sent back to the home office, that is fantastic.  Good job, Apple.  Maybe that's a better way to do it.  Because, you know, you're going if you're going to take this E Foundation operating system, put it on your phone.  Great. But the minute you put, you know, Hangouts on there or whatever, it's sending it back.  You might as well have a Google phone because anything you use, it's going to start sending it back.  You put Facebook on there, you've just breached it.  You got to trust your app developers.  Yeah.  So which one they use in their example, installing Telegram.  They do. Now, what's good?  Each app in the store is scanned and analyzed.  So they do have their own app store.  And apparently you get information.  This is kind of cool about the app's privacy policy.  So and what information?  So maybe this is maybe this is good.  I don't this isn't going to be for the every.  But and it does have a maps app.  OK, I'll get this.  And they do apparently come with Telegram as your messenger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So by a smart fire, all 10 of you will be very happy with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing, Jeff.  We all we all have concerns about privacy, rightfully so.  But yet we're not willing to do to go to the extreme as to address concerns are only so valid.  No, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So a little breaking news here.  Yes, reports the United States will investigate for possible unfair trade practices under Section 301 of the Trade Act over its initiative to slap new taxes on Google, Facebook, Amazon and other tech companies.  Who are they investigating?  France, France, the French measure, which is close to final approval, would levy a 3 percent tax on certain tech industry revenue earned inside France.  Other countries are considering similar taxes on big companies developing story.  Who's investigating France?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The U.S.  Is as part of a new transatlantic trade rift, says the Washington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  This is all going to end in tears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So now the U.S. is investigating France.  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I mean, I don't blame them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's ridiculous what France is doing.  But eventually this is the this is the splinter net, right?  This is where you have.  Yep.  U.S. Internet, France, Internet, China, Internet, Russia, Internet.  And by the way, the good news is all the good companies work for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you just can't trust any of them.  Oh, yeah.  Whoops.  There's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whoops.  AT&T says it's going to automatically block robo calls soon.  New customers will get it immediately.  And then as you're if you're an existing customer, they'll slowly roll it out.  Last call protects service.  Well, at last, maybe remember the FCC in June said that they could do this.  They'd prevented them in the past because of First Amendment concerns.  Phone companies have in the past.  I can't remember which phone company it was.  One of the big four blocked messages from NARAL, the National Abortion Rights Action League,  because it thought it was because it didn't agree politically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So explain to me, boss, how come how how is it through what mechanism is it that  robocalls can now ghost a apparently legitimate number?  Isn't that the big difference that's occurred?  Well, for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's one of the big here's a couple of things.  And this is kind of the same reason spam took over took off on email.  You can send email spam from any address, including what White House, US,  dot gov or whatever.  That's an easy thing.  You know, the president of White House dot gov.  I can make an email message come from anybody.  That's because email has no built in authentication system.  And furthermore, email is really cheap so I can send out a million messages for pennies.  So the same technology that transformed email and made it a spam haven has made it now a haven on phone calls.  It costs very little to make a phone call.  Virtually nothing.  Thanks to IP networks.  And it is trivially simple.  You can do it.  Anybody can do it to spoof the calling number, just as it was on email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fairly recent.  It wasn't happening.  It didn't happen.  It's only been moderately recently that that's occurred.  The spoofing of numbers has occurred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What changed that enabled?  It was always there.  Same way that's always been in an email.  There's never been authentication systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was always possible.  It just wasn't.  It got really easy.  It wasn't easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the big change was things like asterisks was the idea that you could create a virtual switchboard, an IP based system.  It got very cheap to make phone calls from India to the US, from China to the US.  Basically, the cost of calls is nil now because of the internet, because of VoIP.  So combine that with the ability you've always had to spoof the calling number.  That's never, that's always been out there.  That's not a new thing.  Now, there are proposals.  There's this shake and stir proposal for authentic.  That's an authentication proposal.  One side of the conversation that your phone carrier uses shake and to say this is this phone call is coming from our network.  It is a subscriber and then stir on the other end, the incoming network saying, OK, yeah, that's validated and telling the recipient this is a valid authenticated email just like or a phone call just like email would have some authentication through PGP or certificates or that kind of thing.  That's that's going to help a little bit.  I'm a little nervous about these call protect services.  As long as AT&T doesn't overreach and says, look, we're going to.  It says AT&T's call protect does three things.  It detects and blocks fraudulent calls entirely.  How does it how do how do it know flags, telemarkers and spam calls a suspected spam when this phone rings?  That's fine.  It allows you to maintain a personal block list to specifically block individual numbers.  That's useless because it's as you point out, Jeff, the numbers are spoofed different every time.  It's meaningless.  So, yeah, you can block a number that doesn't do anything.  The real question, and I don't think it's answered, is how does AT&T determine that that's a fraudulent call?  So this has been around for postpaid AT&T customers.  I didn't know this.  I didn't I didn't use it.  You'd have to download an app and enable it.  Now, thanks to the FCC's ruling, the AT&T can.  So this is the key.  The FCC says you don't have to get customers to opt in.  You can have it by default.  So if you have AT&T, you can turn it on right now.  If you want, you can still receive all of your calls unfiltered.  AT&T will allow you to opt out of Call Protect.  It's the only thing that's really changing is its default.  You're opted in by default.  T-Mobile has similar features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I wonder what that app does that you have to install.  I mean, is that kind of like a gateway kind of thing that is doing some verification?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a lot of apps out there right now, third party apps like Truecaller,  that have a database of fraudulent numbers.  But databases really aren't very useful because, as we said, the numbers can rotate per call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I just don't understand why they can't do it on the network side.  Why it has to be an app?  Yeah, what do you need an app for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yesterday or the day before yesterday, I got a call from Jerry that he did not send me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  So now it's spoofing calls from people you know.  How does it know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  That was really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the worst kind of email spam, of course.  In fact, that's where spear phishing and phishing emails are really deadly,  is when it comes from the boss, you're going to open it.  And you can't ignore a call from Jerry, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, I did because I was driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always ignore Jerry's calls anyway.  Now, that concerns me that somehow they have your contact list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was weird. That was... I did not like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's illegal.  Neighbor spoofing is illegal, but none of these people are in the US,  so it's very hard to prosecute.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get a lot of calls on my mobile using my home area code and extremely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's called neighbor spoofing.  And one of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How does it know from my mobile number that that's me at home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. That's a good question.  Location information where that mobile phone is most of the time.  Maybe. Oh, that's scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Almost the time, okay.  So that's why I use as my public number a Google voice number out of Baltimore.  Because if I get a call from Baltimore, I know it's spam.  I don't know anybody in Baltimore.  That's kind of a simple hack,  which is get a Google voice number with an area code that's not from anywhere you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mine's from Wisconsin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you do the same thing?  Yep.  Clever.  All right.  So the US is investigating France.  And the White House is having a social media summit,  but neglected to invite Facebook or Twitter.  That's tomorrow.  Basically, CNN says it's going to be a right-wing grievance session.  It's not really aimed at discussing the issues facing social networks.  It's just a chance for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder if RRG will be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Bring the Russians. They probably have something to say about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who is going to be there if Twitter and Facebook are not invited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Washington Post reported last week the White House has asked the event a number of right-wing luminaries  who have been extremely critical of social media.  Of course, even the president has been fairly critical of social media.  We played that interview with Maria Bartiromo on CNBC,  in which he said Twitter's been very unfair to him.  Republican lawmakers and conservative media personalities.  Won't see Jack Dorsey there. You won't see Mark Zuckerberg there.  And frankly, do they want to go there?  Oh, Diamond and Silk maybe. That'd be good.  Bring them in.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, one more thing to ignore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You asked earlier about how to deal with trolls. How do you ignore the news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't. Okay.  Highly recommend. I know you appear regularly on MSNBC.  Don't watch 24-hour news.  This is a poison, a blight on American society.  Left, right, middle. It's not what's going on.  Because it's a 24-hour news cycle.  They are scavenging the world for breaking... everything's breaking news.  Read the newspaper. Read the newspaper. You don't need to watch it on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ...the streets about what's happening to Little Brownsville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. And you can know about that.  Yeah, we're not. Because we're not important to it.  Well, some people are marching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they're selfish.  Our generation was out there demonstrating grief on our ass.  I go to Vietnam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. But that's because we were going to get sent.  That's because we were getting drafted.  No, I've been thinking about that. This is an easy one to ignore.  Just as the concentrate... this is Dachau was easy to ignore.  Auschwitz was easy to ignore.  No, I think it's shameful.  And I don't... I guess we should all be going down to Brownsville.  I don't know. I don't know what to do about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got to stay informed about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but not by watching MSNBC, CNN, or Fox.  By reading the newspaper. Reading magazines.  You don't need a 24-hour news cycle. That's just going to...  That's grinding you down.  I think 24-hour news cycle is a very, very bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think reality is grinding us down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's true. But it's because you watch too much 24-hour news.  You don't need it all the time. It's going to kill your limbic system.  You're just going to... you're going to be...  No, I can say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rachel Maddow and Nicole Wallace and Joy Reid keep me sane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're wonderful people, but they are not keeping you sane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's more than just that it's 24 hours. It's that it's...  It's heightened. It's sensationalized.  It's one and a half minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everything is sensationalized.  Everything has to be...  Oh, I don't think it is.  It is all breaking news. Of course it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has to fit into a three-minute and 33-second...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not Nicole Wallace or Rachel Maddow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not my criticism of it. In fact, it's kind of the opposite, Carsten,  is that sometimes they'll spend eight hours on the simplest little typo.  You know, I mean, they can...  The problem with 24-hour news is, as you well know,  because we had to do it on tech TV, you've got to fill.  You've got to fill. You've got to fill.  And in order to keep people watching, everything has to be a five-alarm fire.  It has to be breaking news. They never take breaking...  It is a five-alarm fire.  No, because you're watching...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're abusing little children at the border.  I agree. It's a horrible thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should all be doing something about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is that when everything is a five-alarm fire, nothing is.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But, you know, so my old friend, E. Jean Carroll's story went nowhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't that interesting?  Right?  Isn't that interesting?  But it did go somewhere if you were thoughtfully reading news sources  as opposed to trying to watch 24-hour news.  The New York Times buried it.  The Times buried it, but then they...  But admittedly, and they mishandled it, absolutely.  But they don't... But they have covered it since.  And I should point out that MSNBC has moved on as well.  The 24-hour news cycle is not conducive to long-term cogitation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How this day unfold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, you know, now they're all on Jeffrey Epstein.  It's all about Epstein, right?  Yeah, well...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't know that I knew his alleged madam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See? You're involved. Now everybody's involved.  Now it's close call. Glenn Maxwell.  Former TV Guide critic knows Jeffrey Epstein's madam.  Alleged madam.  Alleged madam.  How old was she?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was she a young madam?  She's of contemporary AESH.  The daughter of Robert Maxwell, who bought the New York Daily News when I was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  FCC. Let's get some...  I try not to be sensationalistic, but this is kind of a hard one not to be.  The FCC just killed part of San Francisco's broadband competition law.  FCC has preempted...  So you didn't know this, but the FCC can preempt local laws.  It's a law...  So in San Francisco, we were just talking about this a little bit with Google Fiber.  In an apartment building or any multi-tenant structure,  generally what happens is the owner of the building negotiates  with a single ISP to provide internet for that entire building.  San Francisco passed a law, Article 52,  which says service providers, just as they do right now with DSL,  have access to the existing wiring inside multi-unit buildings  even if there's already an incumbent ISP serving the building.  The FCC says,  it's preempting the law to the extent it requires the sharing of in-use wiring.  In other words, the entire law.  San Francisco told the FCC its law doesn't apply to in-use wiring,  and the law's text never uses the phrases in-use.  Oh, I see. In-use is the key phrase.  It applies to any existing wiring.  The FCC says that could be interpreted to include wiring  that's actively being used by another ISP.  Of course, what you don't want is a competing ISP to come in and unplug the incumbent ISP.  The point of the law is that the FCC says  the point of the law is to give residents some competition,  a chance to switch ISPs.  If you're in a big apartment building, in almost anywhere in the country,  you have one choice, the provider of that building.  That's it. You don't have a choice of price, you don't have a choice of provider, that's it.  I think this is at least a well-intentioned law.  Adjapai claims the ambiguity over whether the law does allow simultaneous use of wires  is enough reason to preempt the law.  But of course, we know, we know the real reason,  because the FCC never met a telecom company it didn't love.  The House of Representatives, by the way, voted to block a prize proposal on June 26th.  But in order, of course, to make that law pass,  you'd have to get through something called the House of Lords, aka the US Senate,  and the King, President Trump, would also have to agree, and that ain't gonna happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not familiar with the San Francisco housing market as well as you would be, Leo.  It's all rentals for the most part, no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, a lot of rentals, yeah.  Yeah, I'm just thinking about the broad day.  And a lot of multi-tenant, right?  Right, right.  And as I said, O'Malek, who lived in a high-rise, I think, loved his ISP, but he didn't have a choice.  I guess if there were wireless providers.  I think maybe 5G will solve this.  If you get high-speed wireless, then there's no wires and there's no...  It's not gonna work through buildings, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  5G will not fix this.  Well, you could put something in the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  5G will fix this.  5G will not fix this.  And if it doesn't, Elon Musk Starlink will fix this.  Yes, satellites will fix this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  5G will not fix this.  Wireless will fix it.  5G is just for home is just a last mile thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Project Loon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Project Loon will totally fix this.

Transcript:  25 years old this week, Amazon and a great BBC piece showing the numbers.  The numbers.  The Amazon Empire.  Online sales 2018, $234 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's still just a fraction of commerce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's gonna get it all though, right?  This is what worries me.  In fact, I bookmarked Walmart.com just because I don't want Amazon to get it.  I think that we need some competition.  And I know, I myself, I just immediately go to Amazon.  Yeah, I go to Amazon right away.  It's default.  Pure as the driven snow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was a story in the long reads this week about grocery stores just fearing the future.  Oh, God, yes.  Trying to redesign all these experiences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We went to buy furniture at a brick and mortar store over the weekend and they couldn't even...  No, I'm sorry.  It was a big, it was like a big, yeah, well, it was Friedman's Lumber.  It was like a big hardware store.  They could barely be bothered to help us.  Yeah, it's over there.  It was like, and honestly, it's just a brick and mortar's dying.  7.7% of all retail in the United States goes to Amazon.  That's a pretty hefty number.  And it's only going up.  199 average monthly US uniques.  How many people are in the US?  That's like...  330 million.  It's like almost everybody.  330 million people, 200 million of them in visiting Amazon.  100 million Prime subscribers, 24 million Echoes sold, 12 million tablets, fire tablets sold.  They lead, they sell 88.9% of all e-books.  42% of all physical books.  I just bought a physical book from Amazon, not from Walmart.  So I run a group of media people who are trying to do commerce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they recognize that just as they were stuck with Google for traffic and Facebook for users, they're stuck with Amazon for commerce.  And the thing that tends to drive conversion for a commerce offering on their sites more than anything else is if it says Prime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do not buy anything that's not Prime on Amazon.  It's just, it's silly that I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that book that I bought?  Because you told me to buy it, the English book, one day delivery.  It's coming tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm surprised it's not already at your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It probably is.  I'll probably go home and it'll be there.  And can I tell you, we still have an independent bookstore in Petaluma, Copperfields.  But when I went in there to get a bestseller that had just come out the last few days, they said, yeah, we don't have it yet.  Because they're shipping a big box from the publisher.  They'll get it in a week.  I'll have it tomorrow from Amazon.  It's pretty hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I find the opposite.  When I go down to the Princeton bookstore, they tend to have books before Amazon does.  Probably violate the rules.  But you can't bring them.  They're in stores now.  I find that you can get them before you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Prime Day is coming up in about a week.  That is a big two-day event.  The biggest, I think one of the biggest e-commerce days of the year at Amazon.  Amazon warehouse workers in Minnesota are going to strike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  100 employees.  Try not to get your stuff in one day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or you'll get it from another warehouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Amazon says, we're already giving them plenty of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's people walking an awful lot.  15, 18 miles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon did confirm that unless you explicitly delete your Echo recordings, they keep them forever.  I didn't think otherwise.  But maybe they'll change that now that everybody knows.  This was in a response to a letter from Chris Kuntz of Delaware.  Senator Kuntz asked, how does Amazon use and retain customers Echo voice assistant data?  We retain customers voice recordings and transcripts until the customer chooses to delete them.  Period.  But even then they're exceptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Metadata skills, third-party developed skills.  They get to keep the information.  Well, you know, the foundation, I'm telling you, the foundation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you have an Echo, did you think otherwise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I mean, you're putting a microphone in your house.  You know you are.  So can you complain about it later?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do I have a change log here?  Yes, I do.  Let's do the change log and then we can go home.  It's the Oogal change log, ladies and gentlemen.  Prime Video, Amazon.  Now on Chromecast and Android TV plus YouTube on Fire TV.  Some deal, some deal with the devil has been made between Google and Amazon.  You can watch Amazon Prime Video now on your Chromecast and Android TV devices.  No mention of the Echo Show devices.  I want. Yeah, because that was a big problem, right?  There was a big battle over YouTube and Amazon didn't like the YouTube app.  And then YouTube said, well, you're not doing it right.  And then that's gone.  I would like it on my Echo Show.  I would like that.  Google is making night sight one of the main camera modes on Pixel phones.  So as you probably know, when you have a pixel and you go to the phone,  there's some base, you know, some defaults, some choices that are always visible.  And then there's more.  They're going to take Panorama, shove it back into more and make night sight.  Because that's smart.  Yeah, that's like the thing that this phone does better than anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I take every photo with night site on daytime night time.  No, seriously.  So it's so nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now it's night sight, portrait, camera, video and more.  And more has panorama, photosphere, photo booths, slow motion, time lapse, playground, lens settings and so forth.  I look forward to getting an update to my Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus.  Apparently the June update enhances its low light photography to be roughly equal to Google's.  We'll see.  Google's testing a play button for Chrome's toolbar.  Do you want a play button on your toolbar?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't.  Where will it be?  Where will it be?  Right here.  Hmm.  That's going to.  I don't get it.  Is it to play whatever videos on that page?  I guess it must be.  Those videos play anyway.  I want to not play button.  I want to stop button.  That's what I want.  It's in Canary now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can mute the tabs or the sites.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually use Brave, which is a Chromium adaptation that automatically stops that stuff.  Although lately I've been thinking about switching to Firefox because I'm worried about Brave has other agenda, including its own cryptocurrency.  That's right.  Yeah.  So I'm thinking maybe I'd be better off.  With the open web.  With Firefox, the open one.  Do you use Firefox?  No, you use Chrome because you're on Chrome OS.  Yep.  You have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hmm.  Unless I use an Android browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And do you use Firefox on Android?  No.  Use Chrome.  OK.  Just Chrome.  Just Chrome.  Android Q beta 5 is out.  I'll leave that to you to install.  I have it on my Pixel, but I honestly it's been so shaky.  I don't even use the Pixel anymore because it's the betas are kind of rocky.  So once they settle down, maybe I'll go back.  Google has a live camera translation.  They've talked about that before at I.O.  It's now getting smarter and 60 new languages.  So that's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think either of the translation side has to be English anymore either.  It used to.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  So you could do whatever to whatever now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the cool thing is it can go from whatever to whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  New languages include Afrikaans, Arabic, Bengali.  It's going to be useful for me when I go to the Middle East.  The Middle East, Bengali, Estonian, Greek, Hindi, Igbo, Javanese, Kurdish, Latin, Latvian, Latin.  Do you see Latin signs a lot?  Maybe in Pompeii.  Latin, Latvian, Malay, Mongolian, Nepali, Pashtun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure that Karsten will use it.  Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually never took Latin, but my wife did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I took two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Post-hawk-ergo-propter-hawk.  That's Latin.  Hic-hic-hawk.  Huy-us-huy-us-huy-us-huy-kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh-ho.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh-oo-bee-oh-oo-bee-s-me-so-boobie.  That's all I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's just because it says boobie in it.  Yeah, I know.  School boys.  I didn't know about this.  I'm not happy.  I'm not happy.  Google Drive and Photos sync goes away today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's gone.  Yeah, I'm very happy.  It's already gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very happy about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you're happy.  The problem is all these photos I never meant to sync.  Oh, because they're on Drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It should kill them in Drive because it will kill them in photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay, good.  So you get the backup and sync for your desktop.  I do use that.  And that gets all my good DSLR photos up in the Google Photos interface.  And then you're going to have a new option in the Photos web interface  that lets you choose the pictures from Google Drive you'd like to put on photos.  So that's good.  Yeah, that's better than automatic.  I like that.  Google has recreated.  If you've got AR in Search, I guess everybody does,  you can now visit the Apollo 11 cockpit for the 50th anniversary.  So what do I have to search for to do that?  This is launched today.  It's the AR experience.  Place users in a 3D creation of the Apollo 11 command module.  Oh, look, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then you can put it in your own space as well and walk around it.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice.  I love commemorations of this because honestly, I know this was 50 years ago.  It's the best thing we ever did in my lifetime anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think they could have cleaned off the capsule a little bit?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's because it came through the Earth's atmosphere.  It got some flames.  Looks a little rusty, doesn't it, though?  Yeah, apparently you can get in.  Later this month, Neil Armstrong's space suit.  And you can see what it's like to be in the space suit.  I think this is cool.  This is cool.  Here's a glove, the EVA glove.  Wow, that's cool.  It does not look very comfortable.  A lot of duct tape on that.  A lot of duct tape, holding that together.  This is the repairs in the beta cloth medical container.  This is John Wilkins' 17th century manuscript.  I don't know how that got in there.  Here's Reatha Clark King, a physical chemist and principal investigator  contracted to work with NASA to study select chemicals of special interest for rocket fuel.  Rocket fuel investigator, right up there with the glove.  It's an interesting mix of photos.  I don't get it.  And finally, Google Nest is killing its smartwatch apps for Wear OS and Apple Watch.  Nest is no longer supported for Wear OS.  This is, of course, goes along with the replacing of nest.com with a new Google Nest.  I think this is a mistake.  Will they have a new app to replace it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. I threw this on there because, again, I think it's a mistake.  There are times when voice works great in the home and so on to turn the thermostat up or down or whatever.  There are times when voice does not, though.  If I'm watching TV, my wife's falling asleep, I don't want to shout out, you know, hey, turn the air conditioning up.  Something on my phone, something on my wrist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're going to have to fire up your phone. You can't do it on your watch.  According to Google, only a small number of people use the watch apps.  So they're going to do mobile apps and the Assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That may be true of any Google Watch app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was going to say, a small number of people actually using Wear OS apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they're killing the Apple app, too. The Apple Watch app.  True.  If you're using an Apple Watch, you'll no longer be able to adjust your thermostat or change the home away mode from your watch.  However, the actions you were able to take on your watch are all available in the Nest app on your phone.  So just pull out your phone.  You will continue to get notifications on your watch with the Nest app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it cold? But you can't do anything about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, sorry. And that's your Google change.  I like that. Yeah, I like that.  Is that my is that my computer?  We're getting Neil Armstrong in the little audio chatter from the moon.  Oh, it is mine. It is mine.  I wish I wish I don't know.  I wish we'd stayed on the moon.  OK, I think we can we can wrap it up with your picks of the week.  Jeff, Jeff, what time is it now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is twelve twenty three. Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you have to get up in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then Friday morning, I have a six a.m. flight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's get this over with.  First, very important word from our sponsor Express VPN, the number one VPN solution.  I think everybody listens to the show knows you want a virtual private network for a couple of reasons.  One for security when you're in an open Wi-Fi access point like Jeff is in Madrid.  You don't know what those hackers in Spain are up to with VPN.  You're protected. You'll your traffic is encrypted and doesn't enter the public Internet until you get to express VPN servers.  They have one near you in Spain, Jeff. In fact, they have them all over the world.  That's another reason Express VPN is awesome.  You can emerge into the world in any country you want.  So geographic restrictions are a thing in the past.  No more Internet with borders.  It also is great for protecting your privacy.  We know that Internet service providers and mobile phone carriers track what you're doing online and even sell that information to marketers.  Express VPN blocks them out.  They can't see what you're doing online.  Now, I have to say when you're choosing a VPN, you got to think about this because you're really just kicking the can down the road.  No longer can the ISP see what you're doing, but the VPN provider can.  So choose a VPN provider who protects your privacy, protects your security.  And that's Express VPN. A third party audit was completed yesterday.  I was very pleased to see this on Express VPN.  And they said everything they say in their privacy policy is absolutely true.  They do not log your contacts.  They do not log what you're doing.  They know nothing about what you're doing.  And Express VPN's new cutting edge server technology, they call it Trusted Server.  This audit said does exactly what they say it does.  Trusted Server prevents the operating system and apps from writing to the hard drive.  It sandboxes your VPN traffic.  It's a whole new standard of privacy and security.  No one knows what you're up to, including Express VPN.  It's time to stop hackers, stop Big Brother, and stop Internet companies from grabbing your data.  Tag back your online privacy and security.  It's what I use, expressvpn.com slash twig.  And by the way, not only is it the best, securest VPN, it's also the fastest because they've got so many servers.  They really work hard to make sure that there's no penalty to use Express VPN, that you're on the Internet the same way you would be without it.  Apps, one button click apps for every platform.  So it's very easy to start and stop the VPN service.  And at less than seven dollars a month, it's very affordable.  Now you're going to say, I know you do. I hear it.  Oh, but Leo, I know about XYZ VPN. It's cheap. It's free.  Yeah. Well, believe me, it costs some money to run that VPN.  It's free because they're doing something like injecting ads, selling your information.  No good VPN service is going to be free.  Express VPN is a very fair seven dollars a month and has a 30 day money back guarantee.  It's actually less than seven.  Look, if you get the one year package, you'll get three extra months free.  And that makes it even more affordable. Express vpn.com slash twig.  You got to use that address. Express vpn.com slash twig.  Three extra months free with a one year package.  Now, I've been saying this for months. I've been saying it for years.  Express VPN is the most private, does not log.  Read the privacy policy. You can see they are absolutely pure as a driven snow.  And now we know, thanks to an independent audit from PWC, that Express VPN,  number one on TechRadar, is also completely secure and private.  I love that. Express VPN, you don't have to trust me. You don't have to trust anybody.  You can believe it. It's right there. PWC's report.  Express vpn.com slash twig.  Here's the article on TechRadar Pro.  Express VPN, latest VPN provider to get audited.  And by the way, this is a TechRadar who does rate Express VPN, their number one provider.  So that's awesome. Really awesome.  Thank you everybody for listening to the show today, for using Express VPN and all of our sponsors.  Before we go though, we've got to get Kevin's stuff. His pick of the week, Mr. Tuffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, going along with my community college theme, I mentioned I'm doing abstract data structures and all my programming.  I found an open source IDE that we use, and it's actually very functional,  not the kind of function where you would create a big application.  But for learning, it's actually fantastic because of the debugger and it's open source,  which kind of fits in with a lot of the themes we talked about.  It's called J-GRAP. It's made by the Auburn University.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huh. But this is based on Eclipse. So the IDE is Eclipse.  No, this is built in Java.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  And it runs on the Java virtual machine, and you can use it to program just about anything.  But the viewer, where you can like, I'm working with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have a plug-in for Eclipse, but they have their own IDE as well.  Exactly.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's just amazing to look inside a data structure, for example, such as an array and see what's in each thing.  As you run each line of code, the visuals actually change in the debugger to show you what's happening.  It's phenomenal for learning and again, open source. Fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very cool.  Yeah.  And free.  J-GRAP.  J-G-R-A-S-P dot org.  Yeah.  Nice.  Wow. I'm not familiar with this. I'll have to give it a try.  Very cool.  Jeff, I know one number. Midnight.  6 a.m.  But let's have another number from Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Quickly, giant GDPR fines for breaches we knew about British Airways.  $230 million, Marriott, $123 million from GDPR.  Good. Yay.  Or gas records compromised.  Yay.  To some extent, yes, carelessness to some extent, file under crap happens.  To some extent, file under when it does happen, do the right thing.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this is a big part of GDPR that I'm 100% behind, which is mandated.  If there's a breach, you're mandated to report it.  And I think this is great. I presume that's the fine is that they didn't report it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the maximum is 4% of global turnover. Those fines were 1.5% of VA and Marriott.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's significant.  Very significant.  Wow. That's very significant. Holy cow.  Yeah, Marriott, that breach went on for four years.  Yes.  It was particularly egregious.  Well, good. I'm glad that that's...  I think that there are some times when you got to spank them before they do the right thing.  That's my motto.  Jeff Jarvis, go to bed, you poor guy.  I am so sorry that we kept you up so late.  But thank you for being here from Madrid.  My pleasure.  BuzzMachine.com. Jeff, of course, is the esteemed Leonard Tao Professor for Journalistic Innovation  at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the fabulous City University of New York.
