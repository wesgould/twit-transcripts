The show that covers Google, the cloud, the Twitterverse, everything having to do with whatever we want to talk about basically.  Because we've got a great panel on this show. Jeff Jarvis is here from the City University of New York.  He's pink again because we made him use Skype.  How come Jeff has a Skype logo in his upper right hand corner? Is that on the wall of your office now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't know. I didn't turn it on for Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is something new with Skype because Gina doesn't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If we used Hangouts we wouldn't have that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I see it on my side. You guys don't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. That's Gina Tripani from SmarterWord.org, ThinkUp.com.  Newly catified.  With the best lock screen ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's my girl.  Slide for Google Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kit Kat. So you're going to leave it on the Google Launcher?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I just installed Google Launcher, which, spoilers, that'll have something to do with my tip.  Because that doesn't come to non-Nexus 5 phones.  And yeah, I like the Google Experience Launcher a lot better. It's a lot cleaner. Really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Were you using the default launcher before or did you use a third party launcher?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I always use the default launcher.  And then I got Kit Kat literally like 45 minutes ago.  Oh, wow.  And so I looked at the Kit Kat launcher and it looks just a lot like the default Android launcher.  But then I grabbed the Google Experience Launcher just because I'm interested.  I'm very interested to see how Google is differentiating the Google Experience from the vanilla Android,  the open source Android app or whatever.  And it's interesting. It looks a lot nicer.  It looks more designed and slicker.  And I just I see Google kind of pulling away and being like, this is the Google Experience.  I'm probably going to see this launcher in the Play Store at some point.  So but I do I do actually prefer it because it is simpler.  And I do dig, you know, that the tap and and hold to drag across home screens and that kind of thing.  I think I'll keep it for now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Came to my Moto X. I have the AT&T Moto X last week.  My Nexus 7 got it yesterday.  Yeah, mine too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's spreading. Kit Kat is spreading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you're going to get your wood phone.  I don't know. You know, I the rumor is that the next couple of weeks you'll be able to go to Moto Maker and get a wood phone.  You can now do Moto Maker with Verizon and is it Sprint?  I know they've expanded it beyond AT&T, but nobody's offering the wood.  They said 50 bucks more for wood.  I would pay anything for wood. I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And after my surgery, so would I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just think having a wooden phone is kind of like old meets new.  I just I don't know. Something I like it. I like it.  All carriers have Moto Maker and that apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I just somebody I had a bad Wednesday last week.  I broke a tooth and then somebody apparently nicked my Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no. Oh, I think it was Verizon.  I think Verizon said we're going to shut this guy up.  You got a new one. Oh, good.  And is it is it Verizon or AT&T or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, not neither. And I'll well, it's just, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's right. You have to activate it with it.  But Verizon is still not doing it right.  Nope. Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So when it got when it got taken, did you use find my device or did you change your Google account password or for idiot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you forgot. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah, because I have my phone but I forgot to go back to the Nexus 7 and do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Right. Right.  So were you nervous about someone picking it up and being into your account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I changed every password imaginable immediately.  I drove home that I got my car to drive home that day after the train and just sat there for half an hour changing passwords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's everything. Oh, that's frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? It's fine. It's a good thing I did that because I've been I've been behind doing that.  So all right. Right. You've learned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. You did your penance. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your password. You're next to seven right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ironically, the carriers shot down the plan to put kill switches on handsets.  Yeah, which is ridiculous, isn't it?  I mean, this would this is you know, this is a nice thing.  San Francisco Attorney General George Gascon tweeted Tuesday saying that major carriers shot down plans for remote kill switch for smartphones that was developed by Gascon.  Along with Samsung.  I'm sorry, was developed by Samsung Gascon and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman have been trying to get manufacturers to add that to all smartphones so that service could be shut off when a phone is stolen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the conspiracy theory about why they did this, which is cynical and nasty, but hey, it's phone companies, is they would lose a fortune in insurance.  That doesn't make sense.  That's what one theory said. I have no idea.  It's speculative anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They lose a fortune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because phone carriers phone carriers sell insurance for lost and broken phones.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you buy that, I guess. Huh. Okay.  Gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know how that if you lose your phone, you still lose your phone.  Bricky and it doesn't make any impact on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess the thing I you know, they're gonna you're gonna buy a new phone.  I don't I really don't buy the conspiracy theory.  However, the phone companies have have left themselves wide open to it by not explaining themselves.  But I think their attitude is what that didn't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not admitting to rationale for not not proving this.  I don't understand.  I know what it is.  I know what it is.  Here's the fuller argument.  The argument was that if there was no value in stealing phones, then because phones are stolen all the time now.  Right.  iPhones are like candy to thieves.  And so if they're if suddenly now it's not worth it to steal phones anymore, then it's not worth it to buy phones.  The case that you get it stolen by insurance for the case.  I don't buy that.  You don't buy a new phone to replace the phone that got stolen.  I don't buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  That makes no sense.  I think there's other reasons.  And it may merely be that they don't want the burden of having to kill phones.  And if they fail it, there may be liability involved.  And I just I think they don't they don't want that in their hands.  They don't want to have to validate that the kill request came from the actual customer.  I just I think they I bet you anything.  First of all, they're not admitting that this happened.  And the only reason we think it happened is because this guy tweeted it.  And so we don't even know that it happened.  But let's assume it did.  The phone company is not admitting to it.  The word from 18th to your Verizon or T-Mobile.  But I would bet their lawyers said, oh, no, no, no, you don't want that liability.  Hey, look what I got in the mail.  Can you read that?  It says, meet your Google Wallet card.  What did you sign in right away?  I did it on the show last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I heard it on the change log and it said six to ten weeks.  Well, so no, here it is.  And it's an interesting card.  I'm not going to show it to you because I don't want well, I will show you the front  because the numbers on the back says activate your car with Google Wallet app or wallet.  Google.com and has this really cool logo.  But it is it's a credit card number.  Right.  Or you can show it now.  It's a master card debit card.  And it debits right out of my.  Your wallet balance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So how do you put money into the wallet balance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think you have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  Because the wall is tied to a credit card.  Oh, do I have to transfer money over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it deducts from your from what I understand.  It's from your balance and you add to your balance from whatever whatever other cards  or bank accounts you have linked to your wallet account.  That's that's why it's a yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, as well card mail November 26 estimated delivery December 1st.  No, I got it.  I got it now.  And to the last four digits, if you have credit cards, I don't I don't understand that.  It's just one more cool thing to have.  Now, I want a Google card.  Sure.  Spend your wallet balance, make purchases and get cash from ATMs all funded by your wallet balance.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it doesn't make sense, right?  Like at least.  So like with PayPal, you know, I've got my bank account linked to it.  When I buy something through PayPal, PayPal that automatically debits that from my bank account.  And I would kind of want Google Wallet to behave the same way.  I don't want to have to manually sort of fill my balance before I use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is what this is what they're you know, they're saying your balance is zero.  But I can add money to my balance.  Twenty dollars.  And there's and normally there'd be a fee.  This is how I guess how they make some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  So I'm reading a story now on USA Today.  I didn't put on the run down yet.  I guess I could.  It says that this is why they kind of why they had people aren't using wallets because there's all kinds of yes.  But right.  Right.  That you have to have a Google Android phone.  It has to come with that FC.  But if you have an iPhone app, you can't use it to tap.  But moreover, you have to be a customer of Sprint or to the smaller competitors to get past all of the above hurdles.  You can have Google Wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It gives you micro payment capabilities in effect.  Oh, right.  And then because you're buying a chunk of stuff from Google, they waive the fees.  I can add 100 bucks to my card.  Now I have 100 bucks on this card.  Plus, you don't have to worry about losing it or the number.  Right. I think it's more it feels more secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I mean, I feel like it's something I would give my kid, you know, here's a couple hundred bucks on this card.  You know, use it until.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now your money will be available in less than an hour.  So it's not an instant instant instant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's another but it's funny.  Like, I mean, I love Google and I trust Google.  They have, you know, they have my tax information because they pay me for the Play Store for my app sales and I have my bank information.  They have everything.  But if it comes transferring money, like I'm still going to reach for Square or maybe even PayPal when I actually have to before I even think of wallet.  And I think it's just a it's just a branding thing or what.  But I mean, you can attach money to Gmail.  Now you've got the card.  You don't need an NFC on your device to use the wallet app anymore.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know. I don't know what the psychological block is for me.  Anyway, I don't I just I just don't use it now.  Ron on all my Android, my co-host and all of that Android.  He loves it.  He absolutely loves it and goes into the, you know, into the gas station place and taps and pays for his Snapple before a week.  Yeah.  And I just I just haven't I think just takes a lot to change habits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Laura, let me understand.  It's not everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just another credit card, really.  Or another debit card.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although it is a MasterCard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I guess, you know, just OK, you know what the real reason is now Google has one more way to monitor what I'm buying.  Yeah.  I mean, the more I use this, what they love is for me to make every transaction through Google Wallet in some form or fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're going to have to give me well, I guess I can store my points because it's still going to go to my credit card.  My credit card gives me the points.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I just got 100 points from American Express.  Well, OK.  Funding card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I stay there.  You're right. Right. Right.  So now my MasterCard, my personal MasterCard, you got to know what I buy.  Everything I buy in the world is from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I like that.  So it's a transfer of knowledge from your MasterCard to your Google.  That's interesting.  I don't know what that all means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wasn't thinking about it in terms of data.  I was thinking of it in terms of like, well, Google just wants me to buy stuff from the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When it comes to Google, you always have to think of it in terms of data, Gina.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're absolutely right.  Absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now if I use Tap to Pay, Google knows.  If I use my Google Card, Google knows.  If online, I use my Wallet, Google knows.  And all that information is useful to them.  It happened yesterday.  We were talking on one of the shows on MacBreak Weekly about hearing aids.  And I did a search for hearing aids.  And within seconds, then the next site I went to had a big Google ad for hearing aids.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the whole essence of whatever they call it now this week.  Does that bother people?  Tracking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, to me, that's like, OK, that makes sense.  Let me say it this way, because I know it bothers people.  But let me say it this way.  If that's all it was, if you knew for sure that it didn't go any farther than that, that all it did was put an ad up because you looked for something, would that be OK with you?  Or is it the presumption that there's something more going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, what bothers me about it is I look for a motel room in Oshkosh, and eight weeks later it's still telling me about damn motel rooms in Oshkosh.  I bought it by you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Well, that is because it's an imperfect science, just as recommendations on Amazon are imperfect.  They always recommend the stuff I already bought.  If I buy a hearing aid with my Google Wallet card, will that stop the ads?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, wouldn't that be cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you use Google Wallet card to stop advertising?  As soon as I purchase it, you can stop showing me ads for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, if Google's really smart, that's they get all the signals and they start to put together a picture of not only do you look for it, but he bought it.  OK, stop showing the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what I think Amazon.  I mean, there have been times when I've surfaced on Amazon, then I've bought it.  And the question is, do I still get the ads for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you do.  I don't think it's smart enough.  Somebody in the chat room said, you know, it should really happen is now they should give you a hearing aid battery ads.  Yeah, because they know you bought it.  I mean, if all of this is because they aren't good enough yet.  You know, it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not the ads that bother me.  I ads don't bother me.  I feel like a lot of times they actually do create a better experience.  You know, if I get information I didn't have before, the thing that bothers me is the tracking, the retention, the sort of long term memory and the type of things that Google knows about me and aggregate that I don't know.  And the fact that I don't have a view into that data and I don't have a way to like to change it or to see I want to see me the way that Google sees me.  You know, that's part of the reason why I'm building ThinkUp.  But like even like at one point I went back to Amazon.  Yeah, I've been shopping in Amazon 15 years or wherever, whatever.  I was looking at purchases that I made, you know, 15 years ago, which I don't even remember.  And it was just, you know, because I have a short memory.  I'm a human. Right.  But computers don't.  They have a long memory and can store tons of data, a lot more data than I can.  And it was a moment where I was like, oh, and at least on Amazon I can say this was a gift.  I already own this.  I bought this for somebody else.  You know, I can I can say like this is me.  This isn't me or whatever.  But there's not really any way to do that with Google.  And so it's the retention and it's the aggregate sort of insights that Google has.  And that all happens in the dark.  And I know that that's happening in the dark.  Like I can't do anything about it.  I don't really get a view into it.  Take out.  But it wouldn't be hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It wouldn't be hard to add that to your Google dashboard.  And Google would gain value from you if you told Google, never mind that.  The same way you can with Amazon.  Amazon to me is the gold standard here.  And Amazon did it in light and self-interest because every time my standard joke in conferences,  I say that when I buy my daughter a Taylor Swift album, the next morning I feel like a dirty old man on Amazon.  Right. And Amazon gives me the chance to pick.  I feel like a gangster on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because all those songs my son buys.  So Vint Cerf, who is Google's chief Internet evangelist, speaking to the Federal Trade Commission, was asked about privacy.  This is, you know, I love Vint, by the way, super smart guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is an Eric Schmidt moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the problem is engineers tell the truth.  Tell the truth, exactly.  And sometimes they don't finesse it.  And he probably could have finessed this better.  He says, you know, I grew up in a small town of 3000 people where there was no privacy.  Everybody knows what everybody's doing.  Privacy may actually be an anomaly.  Technology created the notion of privacy.  It's the Industrial Revolution and the growth of urban concentrations that led to a sense of anonymity.  That's right.  He says, I don't want you to go away thinking I'm shallow about it, but overall it will be increasingly difficult for us to achieve privacy.  Our social behavior is also quite damaging with regard to privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is going to come back to haunt them.  Yeah. He could have said, you know, let's put privacy in perspective.  Privacy is a relatively recent invention of society.  We also have benefits from sharing and should have dodged it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're, by the way, the king of public parts.  So this you've you've had a lot of time to think about how to address this.  He says the right thing towards the end.  The technology we use today has far outraced our social intuition, our headlights.  We need to develop social conventions that are more respectful of people's privacy.  That's what he should have said.  Yes, just left it at that.  But he's an engineer and he said he's a professor and he wanted to say, well, let me explain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Historically, of course, is the privacy now is not just about companies.  It's about government.  I chaired as they put it in the UK or emceed a Guardian all day event on Wednesday last week.  That's why I wasn't here.  And so I ran a panel with the amazing Yochai Benkler and Rebecca McKinnon and Senator Bob former Senator Bob Kerry.  And he started off on the on the rant of, well, I distrust companies a lot more than I distrust government.  And I just said, whoa, whoa, no, I have a transaction with Google and I can leave Google.  And I didn't know this stuff was going on with the NSA.  Wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that also I would point out that the kind of invasion of privacy in a 3000 person town is not what we're talking about.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, they kind of know what you're up to, but it's not like they have a camera in your bathroom.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, one argument that I used in public parts was, I guess, an author named Mark Giroud, I think it was, said that privacy was really an invention of the technology  known as the hallway.  That before the hallway, you would go through room to room for people's businesses, no matter what they were doing, a shop and whatever was there.  You had to do that.  When was the hallway invented?  There was a year.  I forget what it was.  There was a time period.  It was part but said that, yes, the one hallways and then and then in the case of British aristocracy, the back stairs.  When the different stairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When was the hallway invented?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I knew that this would be a good theme for the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The 18th century.  How about that?  According to homeowners hub, which is known for its scholarly expertise.  And let go back to the search results.  That was the first result.  And now the Internet's dead.  So I can't go back.  OK, here's Wiki answers.  Know your meme.  The inventor's secret.  Who invented the hallway?  Cha cha dot com.  I don't know if there really is.  We're going to find the definitive answer here.  God, it's so it's so interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, when we were looking for houses in Brooklyn, like in like old, you know, old Brooklyn houses, the one that we bought is like 1910.  But there's this like railroad style where it's just, you know, room stacked on one another and so many of you have to walk through the rooms.  That's very common.  Yeah.  And there are mid middle rooms that didn't have windows.  And it was just like, ah, you know, but then, you know, you have the one with the like a really small hallways.  Around around around most of the rooms.  That's so interesting.  I had somebody saying the Romans had hallways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm thinking back to Ephesus.  I don't think there are any hallways.  The revolutionary invention of back stairs back stairs was huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the late 17th century, separated servants from employers, according to historian Mark Gerard, reading a certain book that I know.  Oh, yeah.  The use of interior halls in the 18th century.  Enabled rooms to be closed to traffic.  The closet created as a place to lock up one's stuff later became a retreat for what we would call privacy.  In the 19th century, Richard Sennett says Londoners joined clubs not to socialize as we do today, but to sit in silence away from the hustle of the city.  At the same time, Daniel J. Solove points out.  Notice how well I attribute all of my stuff.  Very well.  Work shifted from farms to factories and offices, turning the home at last into a family's retreat.  Thus, England, says Philippe Erès, became, quote, the birthplace of privacy.  Wow, you.  This book.  Everybody should read public parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My God, Vince, would you send a copy to Vint Cerf?  I actually I actually was thinking about that.  I need to.  Yes.  I think you just say event, you know, just you're right.  Here's what I'm thinking.  In 1516, Sir Thomas Moore argued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like I'm Steve now on the reading some long memo on the security show argued in his novel Utopia that you do society is a transparent society with the eyes of everyone upon them.  People have no choice but to do their customary work or to enjoy their pastimes, which are not dishonorable.  In Moore's time, everyone worked under the gaze of everyone else.  Public business was conducted out of private homes.  The cobbler made his shoes there.  The ale house was a house.  Privacy in the modern sense was not expected, even among the rich who were surrounded by servants and homes whose layouts required residents to walk through rooms to get to the rooms and not take that's fascinating.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have learned here.  We have learned something.  I think this is really so private.  And, you know, that's something we often have to point out is that privacy is not enshrined in the common sense of the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We often have to point out that, you know, in the early 20th century, the  So private, you know, that's something we often have to point out is that privacy is not enshrined in the Constitution.  It's not even mentioned in the United States Constitution.  But that makes sense.  They didn't have they didn't have hallways.  They didn't even know.  Doesn't doesn't the word privy come from the root privacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  And the other thing that fascinates me is that the reason in England that public schools are actually an American jargon private schools is because public schools in England.  Yeah.  But just to say rich entry schools were for public people, the children of public people, people of privilege.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting.  Somebody said the Fourth Amendment implies privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the argument that was made, but it had to be written in from 1890s when Brandeis and Warren wrote their famous essay about privacy.  They were seeking to find privacy in law and they had to find a rationale of it around.  Isn't that nice?  But as you say, there was no specific mention of privacy.  Boy, get me started and see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yet if you're a child pornographer, Google could go through your Picasso images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and not only that, if you're a child pornographer and somebody who has an Arab name, the NSA is going to go through them.  Yeah, we got two pornography stories today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, a child pornography bust reported by CBS Sacramento is raising questions about Google's access to consumer data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to the Verge struck me as a red herring because because all the Google did was the government put watermarks into child porn stuff and Google reported back where they found that stuff.  I don't see a problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google says it does not search images indiscriminately, performs automated searches, looking for specific image fingerprints that have been flagged by law enforcement and then forward suspicious activity to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which then passes to law enforcement.  I don't have the slightest problem with that.  No, I think that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Knowing that we can say like, hey, Google, show me pictures of cats, show me my pictures of cats and show me my friends pictures of birds.  And like, I mean, we know that Google has very strong searching capabilities.  If they're searching for particular watermarks, I don't have a problem with that.  No. And I'm knowing what the technology can do.  I'm not surprised by that at all.  I don't know why privacy advocates are would be surprised by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it's a knee jerk response now.  Any story angle now on this verge is generally, I think, superb.  But but in this case, I think they went off the mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the what what people get nervous, they go, oh, well, if they could do that for pornography, they could do it.  If I start looking at a lot of cat pictures, suddenly they can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But of course, technologically, they can do anything.  But that's what you don't limit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why we have live in a world of law where some things are illegal or illegal.  And as soon as they make searching for cat pictures illegal, that's when I moved to France.  Oh, please.  You and Sarah Lane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The entire Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sarah Lane, just the thought of it, she's already there.  So what was the other pornography story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't see that somewhere in under NSA.  The NSA, according to how you go to Huffington Post today, the lead story,  Glenn Greenwald writing for everybody on Earth now, Huffington Post.  Oh, he's ready for the Huffington Post now.  Today, what the heck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Waiting for today and having to post tomorrow eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they were the NSA has been going out for the porn habits of it's even strong to say suspected terrorists.  But there were people who had no necessarily suspicion.  But but they had a plan to use that to embarrass them because that's not OK.  And one of them was an American citizen.  That's not OK.  Did you find the story on Huffington?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Top secret document reveals NSA spied on porn habits as part of plan to discredit radicalizers.  Radicalizers, yes.  But you know, that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they had to search hard for that picture.  What picture can we put up that would say porn but not say porn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is the what is the key word for this?  Let's see the document provided by six targets.  All Muslims is exemplars of how personal vulnerabilities can.  But this is isn't this what we expect?  This is called spy work.  If I mean, they're foreign nationals, we suspect them of being bad guys.  Don't we use whatever tools we can to undermine them to figure out where their weaknesses are?  If they're homosexuals and they live in a country where homosexuality is illegal, would we not use that to try to turn them?  I mean, I read a lot of spy novels.  You can tell.  That seems like I'm not I mean, that seems like what we do if they're not if they're not accused of or suspected of an actual crime.  Well, but that's if they're if that's if they're in the United States.  But this is presumably not in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but that's that's another point is we've got to get past this idea that unless you're an American citizen, you have no rights whatsoever under the troll of the American government.  That can't live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but OK.  But OK.  But isn't this how you pursue intelligence against foreign governments that are enemies?  I mean, isn't this a longstanding tradition of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's right.  Every time you said OK, just now, I thought you were going to say Google.  OK, Google.  What's wrong with spying?  Is it OK to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It matters if they're foreign national.  I agree. Look, if I'm a foreign national, I'm going to be pissed off.  But but but but I mean, maybe I read too many spy novels, but that's what kind of the basis of all this stuff is you subvert the foreign nationals that you think are threats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So it's an economic problem very soon.  That means that the laws that are attempted in your in the EU and Brazil to say you may not store any data or pass any data from our citizens through the US because the damning sake is going to come across.  That's going to have a big impact on our cloud business here on the cloud show.  Well, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you don't try to take down terrorists and other bad guys that could have even more bigger, bigger problem than our cloud.  If you think the guy is a terrorist.  Well, that's what they're doing.  I mean, so now the only reason the only thing at all that comes up as illegal in this is that one of the people was identified as a US person and people who are either citizens or foreign nationals.  And I think that the other residents of the United States do have better protection, supposedly against any surveillance think that foreign people should have international people should have due process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you mean by who the special court that protects foreign people.  Well, whom by whom.  Well, then we don't have to have to do a wiretap of a Saudi national they suspect of financing terrorism.  There is no court you go to to say, can we do a wiretap?  That's that's a cloak and dagger work.  It's surveillance.  We've never had any overs.  I mean, there's the you know, there's the House Committee on Intelligence that does oversight but there's never been any you know court that says well, or any any any law that says you need a warrant to do that.  That's what we do.  Right.  I mean, I understand.  Look, if I were foreign national I'd be pissed.  If I'm if I'm Angela Merkel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  What are you looking at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just wondering.  Do you is that reprehensible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it has no opinion.  Gina, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we're all just global citizens.  I don't know.  I have a bunch of liberal lefties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We are.  Look, I have trouble with the distinction between citizens and foreigns.  Everybody's foreign somewhere.  You know, I don't know.  I look I'm not I'm not arguing with the way that it's done.  I'm honestly I don't know enough about the way that it's done to really comment intelligently.  You don't read spy novels.  I don't read spy novels.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Watch Homeland.  You ever watch the Homeland?  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do love Homeland.  I'm not watching the current season, but I did love Homeland last season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK.  So, yeah, I mean, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why aren't you watching the current season?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't I for for stupid reasons.  I won't go into I just I don't have show time and I haven't had time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm getting a little sick of Carrie's cry face myself.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I and I heard the season wasn't so good.  And it's good.  No, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you kidding?  There's a massive twist that will blow your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, OK.  I heard that it wasn't as good as season one and I sort of I love season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love season one.  But I think there's a I think there actually this is good.  Whoever told you that hadn't hadn't gotten that far in the first five episodes.  Something happens in six that nullifies what you've seen.  Well, don't.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm just saying that we this is a longstanding tradition.  All nations, if they identify somebody as hostile to the nation, will pursue any means  necessary, including murdering somebody in Mexico City with a hammer.  If they're, you know, if they're foreign nationals.  I guess here's the point.  Here's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the point.  Would you agree, Leo, that it's wrong for the government to do corporate espionage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it needs to be in.  It needs to be in the defense of the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so there has to be some establishment of some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there is.  But it's not suspicion.  It's not what we think of as US citizens.  We don't have the right to a fair trial and a jury of your peers.  This there's oversight by the House Foreign Intelligence Committee and various committees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But when I when I interviewed Kerry on the Guardian panel videos up somewhere online,  you know, he said that congressional oversight isn't that good because there hasn't been  a single subpoena from either of the committees.  Maybe we need to make it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  However, this is just this has always gone on.  This has gone on since 1777.  And nation all nations do it.  They pursue their national interest.  Maybe we, you know, and then we make we make conventions like the Geneva Accords so that  because there's this issue of, you know, blowback.  So we all have kind of some restraint because you don't want you don't want this to become  untrammeled.  Then you really have a problem because we need we need to have international commerce.  But I think that there's a longstanding tradition of doing this.  Maybe this should change.  But I think that's a very big conversation that nobody's proposing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a big conversation.  But the Internet changes things a little bit like the you know, if people in nations other  than the US are using US services and what that means, like I get that global commerce  has been around for a long time.  Right.  But the Internet hasn't been around for that long a time.  So I guess things are changing and very much more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This conversation would never have happened 50 years ago.  Very much more than ever.  We see ourselves as citizens of the world, not as of the US.  You would have never had this conversation 50 years ago.  We're the man. We're America.  We have the right to defend ourselves.  What are you talking about?  Right.  Those Ruskies that blow us up in a heartbeat.  You do anything you need to to subvert them, including check up on their porno.  Man, if you could get how many novels, how many movies, how many plays, how many books  have been written about the idea of figuring out somebody's gay and then blackmailing them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's this is a longstanding tradition.  Now, I agree.  Maybe maybe this isn't how we want to proceed.  But that conversation we're still far from having.  I go to go to Washington and say, hey, you know, maybe we should be nicer to those bad  guys and see how that goes.  Maybe we shouldn't spy on the terrorist porno.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we won't get into this, but I also have a really hard time with the whole good  guy, bad guy dichotomy.  That's never really the story.  I agree. But you're a hippie.  We're not always the good guys.  No. Oh, God, no.  And that's well, and see, but this is no one is this is we are now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's yeah, of course.  And I agree with you.  I'm by the way, I'm arguing a little more strongly than I might feel.  But I think this is the it's unrealistic to think, oh, we're going to be nice to people.  Let's let's extend the same rights and privileges U.S.  citizens have to foreign nationals.  I don't think that's going to happen.  However, we didn't have Google 50 years ago and Google's a U.S.  company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if we found out that France was spying on all of us, we'd be pissed.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just as they are pissed at us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We all used what is the Chinese social scene?  A Weibo is the Chinese Twitter.  I mean, we all use that and China used it to surveil us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And here's the here's the funny thing.  You know, I some Chinese people, journalists tried to get me to set up a Weibo account.  And I said, kind of out of protest, no, not as long as the government is doing what it is in China.  I'm not going to use it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then the NSA happened.  And you saw that your hat.  It's actually a really fascinating question because I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It may not be practicable, but I mean, wouldn't it be great if we lived in a world where every person's rights were and privacy were somehow protected?  But what would you do?  Would you have a world court where you go and say, I want to wiretap Osama bin Laden.  May I, sir?  Please, sir.  May I?  One thing you have is encryption of the U.S.  citizens.  Well, and that's by the way.  OK, so this goes back to this very fundamental conversation that I think we've talked about before.  I know we haven't security now, which is as soon as you say, as we did after 9-11, never again, then you have to get then then that gives permission to the NSA and everybody else.  To go for total information awareness, Because that is the argument.  And on the panel at the Guardian Gilchai Benkler, who's a brilliant brilliant legal mind of Harvard Berkman Center set, he argued Bob carrots that we have this threat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have Muhammad Atta sitting there doing the security of the US maps, and uh, we can go along with it, but what's the Parte Burki found out today?  He's as 선esthefdmuffled about that?  He's as said, we have to be able to stop him.  And Gilchai came back and said, no, the threat is overblown.  And we've used that threat as a basis to trample rights.  And he said, I grew up in Israel and one gets used to certain things.  And I wonder whether the NSA overreach is such that Americans will start to say even Americans will start to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think at some point you have to presume that people like our Secretary of State and our president are men of goodwill who will pursue our interests judiciously and not use this to blackmail innocence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think the problem with the problem is the problem is it's not just what they use in the end to blackmail.  It's that along the way they try to gather every dot they can.  They have to basic fact.  No, they don't have to.  They don't have to get getting more dots doesn't make getting the dots easier.  It probably makes getting the dots harder.  The spies by their nature are going to gather everything they possibly can.  The job of the politicians is to exercise oversight on them to limit what they do and protect rights.  That's the balance that should be struck here.  And that balance is struck through transparency sufficient that citizens can get mad at the executive branch.  Transparency sufficient in courts that we know what they're actually doing.  Transparency to Congress so that they can represent our interest in oversight.  This Guardian panel what came out is all oversight has fallen apart officially.  The executive branch hasn't done bupkis.  Congress isn't really doing anything.  Feinstein only got mad when Angela Merkel's phone got bugged.  The courts are secret.  We don't know anything.  The journalists are now afraid that their sources are going to be compromised.  At the end of the day, Leo, the only oversight that can work now is the oversight coming from the conscience of an individual.  Right.  That is to say a whistleblower.  Right. Edward Snowden.  Right. And they put a headline in the Guardian.  I don't like how this piece that I wrote about this that it was about Snowden, traitor or that wasn't the discussion.  The discussion I think is this notion of conscience.  And to me it comes down then not just whistleblowing his conscience after the fact.  Hey, this bad thing happened.  We also need is conscience before the fact.  So, you know, was there no I'm going to go ahead and slam them because they're guessed to be the ones who did it.  But, you know, a caveat here alleged in rumors and but if level three was the company that allowed the NSA to tap in to the communications not only on the Internet as a whole, but also among Google and Yahoo servers, was there no employee of level three who said, hmm, should we do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that evil? Oh, I doubt it worked that way.  I'm sure they got a national security letter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't I don't think I think a lot of this telecom stuff is happening very voluntarily.  They didn't need to get letters for a lot of this stuff.  Yeah. But I think they well, even then, even then.  So you have the Google employees who when they found out that this tapping had been done to internal and they both of them said, FU to Google.  If one of those employees had been ordered to do something.  All right. What does that employee do?  Now, at some level, they try to refuse.  They try to tell their bosses we can't do this.  Yes, if they go and try to whistle blow their violating the security letters, see why earlier efforts, larger efforts and official sanctions or official oversight do not work.  But we as a country, as a society have to end up depending upon the conscience of a few geeks.  The NSA is the largest employer in America of mathematicians.  Do mathematicians have a Hippocratic oath?  Do they do they do they use their power for good or ill?  Do they even watch Spider-Man?  You know, at some point, you've got to say in technologists, technologists have power at their hands.  And I harken back and I did it.  Maybe it's overkill because we're not talking about the A-bomb here, but I harken back to the letter, the slither, slizard letter signed by I think 153 scientists out of the Manhattan Project begging Harry Truman not to use the atomic bomb over Japan after Germany had surrendered.  And the bosses held that letter up until the bomb was ready to go.  Yeah, it's not having a debate over this.  So because debate equals doing nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  In that case, I think the perception was if we if we start to question it, we just got to go.  Nobody's going to this is never going to happen if you start to think about it.  Let's just do it.  That was what it was.  You know, they're OK.  This is where I hate to bring a TV show back into the game.  But this is where this is where the most current episode of Homeland is kind of germane because there is a battle within the CIA between two different points of view.  The old school point of view, which is you plant you plant you subvert foreign intelligence officers, you plant people in, you know, in country.  You do careful intelligence work to gather information or you just send a drone over and you blow them all the hell up.  And it's a lot cheaper and easier and might even be appear to be more effective, at least initially, just to blow them all up.  And in fact, it looks like what we're doing, you know, our intelligence efforts failed.  We couldn't coordinate our various intelligence agencies.  The information that they knew about 9-11 and every other attack on the US soil was there, but just never coordinated enough to do anything about it.  At least those anyway.  So just blow them up.  Send them a drone in.  No, no, no American lives are at risk.  And it's a blunt weapon, but it works.  It seems like that's what's going on right now, right?  Robot war.  And I mean, that's pretty reprehensible.  So I'd rather they if it means going and looking at their porn habits and blackmailing them versus sending a drone over and killing a bunch of innocent civilians along with your target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they're suspected terrorists, Leo, I don't disagree.  The issue here is they didn't stop at collecting data on suspected terrorists.  They collected it on all of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, not in this case, not in this case.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got our porn.  They got they got all of our they've recreated our not that not that many of us here have porn.  They've got a right.  I actually have a little cheetah.  What are you saying here?  What do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just I because you're the guy that's always like, hey, you know what?  Like everybody does all these things like we should we should lift the taboo.  And that's the problem.  Like the problem is that it's a big deal for anybody to have porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I said I said in public parts that OK, you know, yes.  I'm looking porn.  You know, it's a big deal.  And some interview once I forget where it was.  Some foreign country made a big deal of saying, well, he even confessed to looking at porn like you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like it's such a revelatory confession anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, NSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, this is this is the Snowden identifies six targets, all Muslims.  Presumably, I don't know, but presumably foreign nationals who were radicalized and considered dangerous.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If if there is some reason to go after them, I don't think anyone disagrees.  But the issue of blanket surveillance is that it is not selective.  It is everything they're going after jihadists in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you don't have evidence that they're going after you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are collecting data on me.  Yes, they have they have photos of every letter sent to everyone in America.  Right. I have metadata on me, my phone calls, my emails.  The NSA says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wherever you are, the NSA's databases store information about your political views, your medical history, your relations and your activity online, according to the deputy legal director of the ACLU.  The NSA says this personal information won't be abused.  But these documents show the NSA probably defines abuse very narrowly.  But my question, and it's somewhat of a it's somewhat of a rhetorical question, but my question is, well, what do you propose?  You can't after the fact say, well, you know, let's find out what he did last month or last year.  You have to collect it now.  Isn't it isn't it reasonable for the NSA say, look, we're just going to collect everything.  We won't look at it until we have reason and then we'll look at it.  And unless we have collected now, we won't have it in six months when we need to find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have a standard that defines what we do to Americans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's start. And they also say that they don't break the law with regard to Americans.  I mean, whether you believe that or not, I don't know.  They should be held to the law. I'm not saying they shouldn't.  But here's here's the but it sounds like people are offended when they do things that are lawful as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At this point, yes, because it goes over the bounds of what we think.  And that's what that's the argument we're having. Start here.  Wiretapping phones was was done willy nilly until the public said, no, you went well.  That's creepy. You can't do that.  And then warrants were required for wiretaps.  In other words, you had to be selective in what you went after.  That's the principle work here is that there must be some measure of selectivity  in who you're going after. And if you choose if you could move to General Alexander's movement of collect it all,  then you are going to collect information on all of us.  Now, your argument against me could be I go with I learned the lesson from Dana Boyd that we should we should worry about the use of data over the collection of data,  that limiting knowledge is a dangerous thing.  So you could use that back of me and say Jarvis, they're just collecting information.  Then the question becomes, do you really trust them to do that?  Do you trust the government to just collect all of this information on all of us for the rare case?  That's the fundamental question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Stephen Baker, who is one time general counsel for the NSA and the top Homeland Security official in the Bush administration,  HuffPost quotes him saying the idea of using potentially embarrassing information to undermine targets is a sound one.  Quote, If people are engaged in trying to recruit folks to kill Americans and we can discredit them, we ought to.  On the whole, it's fairer and maybe more humane than bombing a target, describing the tactic as dropping the truth on them.  He says any system can be abused, but fears of the policy drifting to, for instance, domestic political opponents don't justify rejecting it.  He says, quote, on that ground, you could question almost any tactic we use in a war.  And at some point you have to say we're counting on our officials to know the difference.  Now, you're saying we don't trust them.  So I'm saying, well, what's the alternative?  Who's going to defend you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who do you trust to defend you?  Transparency and oversight is the fix.  It's to say that if they are reasonable people going after reasonable ends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're not going to tell you because they can't tell you, Jeff Jarvis, because that would make it public.  This is an interesting thing.  And that would disarm them.  So they need to tell somebody in secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But here, to an extent, one of the odd things, very interesting things that Kerry said to me was that he actually argues that more intelligence  data should be crowdsourced.  When it comes to knowing, for example, what's going on in Syria, you get a lot more out of Brown Moses, the guy who sits in his room in London and looks at videos, looks at things and understands where the weapons are.  Then you get out of the spooks doing it.  And by the way, the guy you just quoted, Stuart Baker, he debated Russ Burgers and Janine Gibson of The Guardian a few weeks ago.  And when I asked a question, I said that was Jeff Jarvis.  And he said, Oh, I know you.  I watched Twig.  What?  Hi, Stuart.  Stuart would be happy to be on the show.  He's saying the same thing I am.  And I think I asked Stuart if he would be on the show.  And he said, yes, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I'm trying to make the same points he is, which is OK.  So OK, so clearly we can't make it public because it won't.  It'll mean that the tool is no longer useful.  So we need to reveal it to your trusted proxy.  Jeff Jarvis, who is that?  It should be your member of Congress.  Your member of Congress, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Congress doesn't know much what's going on.  And when one one widened, didn't know what's going on, he had to hint to us for years.  He wasn't allowed to say anything.  He wasn't to have any means where the oversight was effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We can't because if he tells us what's going on, it will make it unusable.  Do you recognize the need for some secrecy to make that that porn stuff you're arguing about unusual?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What he's trying to make unusable is the is the broad blanket collection.  He asked straightforward intelligence officials before Congress whether they were collecting data on millions of us because he knew they were and they lied.  And they lied. I understand.  They lied.  But they lied.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Understand why.  Understand why General Clapper lied.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He lied.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He believed whether this is true or not, he lied in our interest.  In our best interest.  He felt it was better.  Talk to the Politburo, comrade.  Well, I'm just saying we you got it.  You got to give us an alternative so that we can pursue some policy to protect ourselves.  So what is that alternative?  You you have a Congress you don't trust.  OK, well, then who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly the problem I'm raising.  I have courts that are gagged.  I have Congress people who are gagged.  I have an executive branch that's going too far.  I have journalists who are now afraid of talking to sources because their contacts are all known.  That's why I'm saying that at the end of the day, our our.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not unusual for intelligence officials to lie in public hearings.  They do it all the time.  They have to.  It's a public hearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they violated the law to think he committed perjury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I understand.  But I and he understood what he was doing, I'm sure.  But I think he also felt like he had to protect.  I mean, it was it was an up feudal because of Edward Snowden, but he felt like I'm not justifying it.  But I'm trying to argue the other.  We rarely hear that other point of view, which is, look, you want to be protected against terrorists.  This is what we need to do to protect against terrorists.  What can we do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, right there, right there.  That's that's the argument that I think Yochai would make.  Who's to say that we do need to do that?  That's that's that's the challenge that needs to be made is that the fact that the Internet allows you to collect more and more and more means you should collect more and more and more because you can collect more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You agree to the premise that there are people outside and inside the United States who would like to do us harm.  I saw their handiwork firsthand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you propose as a means to?  Ideally, ferret them out and keep them from doing us harm or maybe ideally would be to to eliminate them.  But let's say to ferret them out and keep us from doing harm.  How do we do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that you set some principles that we live by and that courts and Congress can check.  And that one of those principles that I think is what comes out of the NSA argument is that collecting everything on everyone is not acceptable that you must have some targeted basis of your collection.  The problem is that we need to find that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is that I think that I would I would guess and we'll maybe get Stuart on and you can explain this.  That doesn't work.  And because we have the means to do total information awareness, we need to pursue that with what they believe, I'm sure, is proper safeguards.  We're not we're going to put that we're going to seal it.  It's sealed.  It's vaulted until we have a person of interest.  And now, thank goodness, we've been collecting all this information.  We can go through it in regards in light of that person of interest, collect the information we need to take that person out.  And it was justifiable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The NSA feels like the opposite of innocent until proven guilty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I mean?  I understand that.  But I think it's also practical and pragmatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me bring it to technical terms.  Do you think it was justified for the NSA to tap into the internal server connections between among Google servers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, see, there's two answers to that.  One, it's reprehensible and I hate it.  Two, I think we gave them permission.  In fact, we gave them a mandate to do that when we said, hey, protect us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's crazy.  Okay.  All right.  That's crazy talk.  I did not give anybody permission to to collect everything that I do online.  No, no, you didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You gave you.  But when you say protect me.  Okay.  So you didn't say protect me with any means necessary.  You said protect me.  But I don't want you to do anything that I think is bad.  And what if they come back to you say, but wait a minute, we can't protect you unless we do these particular things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm saying I'm an American citizen, a citizen protect me.  And I'm assuming that that means within the system that we've set up.  Right. And when the system that we set up, you have to have just cause to start somebody's stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's no, I mean, you know, this is all legal.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  It's all legally in secret, right.  Because everyone's it's legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you know, we should have voted out the guy, the sons of bitches that passed the Patriot Act, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, even the author of the Patriot Act says he wants to change it now.  I know.  But it's the law.  Here's the technical question for you.  I want to come back to this notion of the conscience of the individual.  So you're both working for level three.  And you're given the little box that the good pastor on the network showed us.  You said hook this up into these cables.  What cables are those?  They're the ones in Google.  Those fiber optic ones over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you do?  You do it because it's the it's a legally it's a representative of it's a it's the people.  It's a representative of the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you know, I like to think that I would say, no, I'm not doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if what if you found out what if there were the thought that by saying no, that you would actually enable an attack on the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's what Yochai argues is bogus.  Well, we don't know, though, we don't know.  Well, but we never can.  So what you're justifying is the police state.  Because because there's no break, there's no end.  They will collect everything on everyone in case anything could be valuable.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then what they do and then what they do is they say we're going to collect everything, but we are going to follow strict rules.  And they believe they are doing this, by the way, strict rules about what we do with that information.  We're going to we promise we're going to protect U.S. citizens.  But when it comes down to we've got a person of interest, we need to have that prior data.  We need it because otherwise what law enforcement is very concerned about is they're peering into that there is a dark net that they cannot see into encryption.  They cannot see into what is going on.  And frankly, I got to think that what Google is doing by encrypting its its level three traffic and Yahoo is now doing it and everybody else is going to start doing that is going to scare law enforcement.  They say, oh, my God, now we're really screwed.  We can't find any of this information.  Then what do we do?  What do they do before the telephone?  Well, I would argue that just as the Internet has given them unprecedented ability to collect this information, it's also given the bad guys technology, given the bad guys unprecedented information ability to attack us on our shores.  So it was a it was a different.  You can't compare this to the days of muskets.  We have it's a very different world.  And I feel like I feel like these people are acting in their mind honorably.  And I feel like we the onus is a little bit on them, but it's also a little bit on us because I do believe we are asking them to protect us and that we are concerned that there's a threat.  And I think there is some onus on us to to propose a system that works instead of just going, no, you can't collect information because that may not be workable.  If it turned out, I mean, let's this is completely hypothetical.  It turned out that there was, you know, if we don't collect this information, there'll be another 9 11.  Which would you choose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a reductionist, though, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I understand. But it's it's a hypothetical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm saying it's hypothetical. Yeah.  I mean, it's just there's a huge set of assumptions there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. It's hypothetical that all this collection has stopped.  Yeah, the arguments that I've made that argument to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I understand that.  I'm trying to make the argument on the other side just so that it's a little more balanced.  What if what if what if what if it does stop this stuff?  Would you be willing to allow well supervised gathering of information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you want came back to supervise.  The problem is, that's my point about that's what you're asking for supervision.  OK, so let's get supervision working and then it's OK from abuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If we have the oversight, is it OK then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That super that oversight, what is the oversight if the oversight can't say no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, but let's say let's say we have a perfect system and we have oversight, then is it OK?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If the oversight is able to say what goes too far and we trust those people to say what's too far.  Yes, that's OK. How about you, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it OK for them to spy on you if there's oversight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My point is they're not going to spy on you if the oversight is proper. Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you're assuming that there's no that I'm not a person of interest.  Right, for whatever reason or that I am a person like am I OK with it if they have a good reason?  Yes. Am I OK with it? If they don't have a good reason, no. That's what we're saying.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, I understand also and somebody saying, well, that just justifies torture.  No, I mean, the thing is you have to think broadly torture doesn't work because it causes more problems and it solves in the information you get is not useful.  Drones don't work because it radicalizes people and creates more terrorism.  There are things that you can't do because they don't work.  But what if there's something that works like finding out some radicals into porn and using it to discredit him?  What if that works? Is that so bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just a good story.  All right. Enough of that.  Porn is the cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Spy stories, you know.  It's a hard. This is hard stuff. I think it's very hard stuff.  It is. It is. It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if the chat room is interested or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I think this is something we all have to as US citizens and citizens of the world, we all have to have this conversation.  It's a hard conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the issue there's an economic issue here is can anyone trust America and American companies anymore?  And can they trust our governance of the Internet, which, let's be honest, we really have that is going to face us square on real fast.  And I think that the cloud companies are going to lose business.  Cloud technology is going to lose trust.  America is going to lose trust.  And America is going to lose power over the Internet to people who really are bad guys.  And that's because we went overboard.  There's abuse here and abuse saw no oversight.  That's the issue.  And now what's new with Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To be clear, any culture where someone looking at porn is such a shaming thing that I'm totally in favor of shaming anybody about porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use that example of homosexuality because that is the best argument for making same sex marriage legal.  Then you can't be blackmailed for it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was the primary argument I made in public parts is that publicness disarms stigma.  Right.  Publicness makes these connections.  Transparency does these things.  And that's why I mean, you're right.  Obviously, you can't make all spying transparent.  But that's where I was amazed when Bob Carey argued that a lot more intelligence should be open and transparent and crowdsourced because it's transparent anyway.  And they just try to make it secret.  I talked to Wolfowitz once at a reception in Washington.  Some people will now growl at me for even talking to him.  And it was about blogs in the early days of blogs and the Iraqi blogs.  And he said that he yelled at his intelligence people and said, I get up in the morning, I read these Iraqi blogs.  I know more about what's going on in the country than you're telling me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I think that, unfortunately, here's what I would lobby for, something a little simpler.  Unfortunately, these conversations have become so polarized and so tied to people's beliefs, political beliefs, that we don't hear the other person.  And it really is just this kind of futile beating our heads against each other.  And if we really are going to solve these questions, very tough questions, we need to listen, we need to hear.  And I don't think we should assume that people are acting from bad intentions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, in fact, I think the spies are doing what they I don't blame the spies, actually.  I mean, I do blame at some level.  I don't blame the spies who are spies.  They're doing they're going to go to the limits of what they can do.  I blame those who we expect to set the limits.  That's the issue.  But then I am asking the next question, which I think is an important one, especially for folks like us who follow technology, is that at the end of the day, a technologist doing one cog's turn in this machine has an ethical responsibility.  And I mean, it was before doctors have a Hippocratic oath.  Journalists, even though we don't always follow it, we think we have ethical oaths and statements.  Other fields, you know, academics believe that they have statements about about their ethics as a trade, as a craft, as a profession.  Do technologists do programmers do system administrators do mathematicians talk about ethics?  Ethics. So we got after the financial crash, we got all upset.  The business schools weren't teaching ethics to business people who have power.  Well, technologists have more power than business people.  Do technologists have these discussions about ethics?  Are there professional organizations that are trying to examine these ethics?  Are there these kinds of discussions among the technologists who are the ones who turn these switches?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There I gave an interview for a since, unfortunately, submarine movie about hackers in 2003, in which I said the hackers will be the freedom fighters in the years to come, that it won't be weapons that we will need to maintain our knowledge or use of technology so that we can fight for freedom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's the problem is that then that's an anarchistic statement because rather than trusting the institutions, rather than trusting the employed legitimate technologists, what we're saying is this is an argument I've had with you, Gina, is that the hacking culture is we'll just go around it and that's OK.  Where what I'm looking for is the Talmud of techies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, right. Well, look, there's I mean, I think about ethics a lot.  I try to think about it. I talk about it a lot.  I think that some coders do and some coders don't.  It depends. But, you know, there's the person turning the screw and there's the person telling them to turn the screw.  And then there's the boss telling the manager.  I mean, that the responsibility lays certainly on the shoulders of the person who's crimping the Ethernet cord and plugging it in and typing the code, but also the their bosses and their bosses.  So I don't think that you can rest it squarely on the shoulders of the technologists.  Like if the actual technologists like had stopped and said, I'm not doing this, I'm walking out because there are cogs, most likely they would just be replaced or they would lose their job.  I mean, Snowden sacrificed his entire life.  Yeah, well, he did what he said.  I mean, he sacrificed his entire it wasn't just his job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, he sacrificed his freedom and his life.  Chelsea Manning as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chelsea Manning as well.  Chelsea Manning.  I'm not trying to say that all the responsibility is a good point, Gina.  And I want to make sure I'm clear.  I'm not saying that all the responsibility lies in the technologists.  What I'm saying is that is the oversight of last resort.  At last resort, one honest person of conscience puts the brakes on and says, should we do this?  Is this evil?  Yeah, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I mean, the unfortunate truth is a lot of nerds and I include myself in this a little bit are apolitical.  Right.  And who have just sort of decided that the system doesn't make sense and it deals with messy humans and their emotions and their relationships and therefore is illogical.  And therefore, I just will not participate in it.  Right. You know, like you have, I think, a lot of that in the in the in the tech community, not to generalize.  So there's there's a weakness there.  And I think, you know, I think that with the the Gov 2.0 movement and some of the some of the more more recent awareness around what's been going on, particularly with Snowden, I think Snowden is a is a incredible role model.  I think I think geeks are becoming more aware and are because are thinking more about their but their responsibilities.  But I think we could go further.  I think that I would love to see or I would love to even have a hand in drafting the Hippocratic oath.  You know, I don't know of any organizations off the top.  I'll look into it more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do I would love to write about that and see and and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what do you what ethics do you teach, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, journalism school.  I mean, no, but I mean, just saying, what do you teach?  I don't I don't even know if there's a clear right or wrong.  Well, I'll give you an example of journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Lord knows what is don't be evil mean.  Well, in journalism, it's that the reader, the whole argument now about native advertising, about all the stuff that you see on BuzzFeed and Forbes, where it's the Scientology thing on the Atlantic.  There's a lot of that going around.  And I had last term, my students went to see one of the practitioners of the stuff and they came back in class.  And I realized I would teach ethics way too late in the term because they were all kind of shrugging.  Oh, yeah, it's funny.  You need money. I said, Whoa.  By the way, it was the year it was the week that I was being observed as to whether or not I should become a full professor.  And I got it anyway.  But the issue is in my field, for example, when it comes to native advertising, the reader must never be confused about the source of content.  Of information, right?  And if there is a vested interest at heart, then it should be revealed.  That's as as as David Weinberger has said, transparency is the new objectivity.  And that's that's that's an ethical statement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think that's a little simpler and easier problem to solve.  I agree.  The problem of how do we how do we protect ourselves and still preserve our values?  I mean, that's really the fundamental question.  How do we protect ourselves and still preserve the values of our republic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, our rights. Yes, that's exactly the question.  And what role does an individual have in doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can say I know what the values of America are.  I mean, that's I think that's well known.  But then how do you protect yourself?  I think it's very difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And as you were saying earlier, Leo, anybody can convince themselves that the thing that they're doing is right thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And also the other way, you know, what Bob Carey said was he said he couldn't buy the argument that Yochai was making and I was making about this.  And because what he said is that if you have a group working to get against the threat, you can't was inflate by the threat of the threat.  One member of that team can't suddenly just say, well, I don't agree with this and I'm going to reveal everything.  And I get his point.  Yochai was arguing, interestingly, for amnesty for Snowden and that there was a principle to be written there that said that if what was revealed caused change in society,  whether through law or through courts and caused a reversal of something because it was revealed,  then that should be seen as of societal value and that you should have amnesty for your revelation.  Carey wasn't buying that at all because he was saying at a practical level, how do you how do you run an intelligence operation?  Probably you're saying, Leo, with the thought that anyone in my team here can turn around and say, yeah, you're all evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's not how the military works, right?  It's a chain of command.  No, you trust your superiors.  You do what you see because you can't have a soldier making ethical decisions on the field of battle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. It's not a place for independent thinkers.  Let's let's just be you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My point is it doesn't work.  Well, but you got to work still lines when Lieutenant Kelly kills a village.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree.  There's lines.  Yep.  There's a line.  There's a line.  Now, let's hope the line doesn't have to be so obvious as that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was violating, by the way, yes, the rules of his superiors.  I mean, he was acting illegally.  So that's not a question.  In fact, he well, anyway, let's not you know what?  This is a great conversation.  Let's end it here because we have a long show and there's more to do.  This was a good conversation.  I think it's a great, great conversation to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We haven't had one like this in a while.  I don't know if the audience likes it or not.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you're highly uncomfortable that it's a good conversation.  Yeah. And you're right, Leo, you know, playing devil's advocate and and explaining, you know, the other point of view.  I think it's important for these kind of these kinds of debates.  I actually earlier, Jeff, you were talking about crowdsourcing intelligence kind of related.  This is in our rundown.  Eric Schmidt said at a at a in a speech recently that we should drop smartphones on Iran and Iraq.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that'll that'll solve the problem.  That'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the people surveil themselves.  I think he's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would hope what he's saying is access to the Internet and information changes hearts and minds.  He's also saying that Android should penetrate every every country.  And it just happens to be good for business, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the dots just occupies their time so much that they don't have any time to build.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Give them angry birds.  Then we'll see.  I want to do the Google change log.  Let's play the trumpets and bring in Gina Trapani.  Time to see what's new at Google.  The Google change log.  What is new?  Gina has the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brand new Google Chrome extension enables voice search in your browser.  So you install this Chrome extension.  It's by Google.  And then you go to Google dot com and you can say just like you can to your phone or in Google now or your Android phone.  I guess IOS to OK, Google and do and do search.  So Google said that the new extension is ideal for those preparing a Thanksgiving feast this week here in the U.S.  Anyway, this year rather than stopping midway to wash your hands to type in a search, you can just speak to your laptop.  OK, Google, how many ounces are in one cup?  And while the cooking can go on, the extension also supports reminders.  You can say, OK, Google, set a timer for 30 minutes.  And when you're once installed, you have to give Chrome permission to access your computer's microphone and then say, OK, Google, to activate the hot word.  Your microphone is not always listening when you have this Chrome extension installed or at least it.  Yeah, it's only listening.  It listens for OK, Google, but it doesn't it doesn't record everything else related to our earlier conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think I found that irritating, Gina, because I had the Google search page up where we were playing before.  But then it times out.  So I have to go to the effort then of going to the Google home page again.  And there's no battery issue here.  Why? I should have the option to set my laptop all the time.  So Chrome can always do it.  Yes, it's really annoying to have to go to Google dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is. It is. It is.  It's a first step.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've just revolutionized the way we interact with computers and already I'm complaining.  I have to go to Google dot com and then I can talk to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, Google.  How tall is Yao Ming?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It doesn't talk back, which makes me mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you your sound up?  I think so.  Does yours talk?  Hold on. Let me see here.  No, I don't think it talks.  My phone talks.  OK, Google.  How tall is Yao Ming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doesn't talk back, which makes me mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It talks back in my voice.  It talks back in my voice.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still had the stream on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Brian, do you have my audio up?  Yeah, I think it doesn't talk back.  Is it an option?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it does.  Let me try here.  Everybody's going to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All our volumes are turned down because we don't...  We don't want the stream on.  OK, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How tall is Leo Laporte?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's not going to be a card, is it?  Because it's only going to respond with a card.  It's not going to know that.  OK, Google.  How many ounces in a cup?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that Leo just whispers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just talked to me.  It did talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It did.  You guys can hear it because obviously it was in my headphone,  but it said, yeah, one US cup is eight US ounces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK.  So I don't know.  Maybe my audio is not up.  Google voice search hot word, allowing incognito options.  Let me see here.  OK, Google.  Yes, it's stopped listening for after five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  According to Wikipedia, the important report is an American technology  broadcast.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The talking back is at least a big part of the functionality.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  My phone will do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can have your computer anywhere and get information.  Now, we already observed, as you noted, one problem,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which is that I have multiple devices that respond.  OK, Google.  It gets a little crazy.  I think you should do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you should get everybody's devices together that can do this  and do a little shtick about this.  I think that can be very funny.  Well done.  Somebody pointed out that if you do command T or control T to get a new tab

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  page, that will give you a Google search.  So that's all you really have to do is command T. OK, I killed that page in  Chrome because I don't like that page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's no good.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, my new page is recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you could change that.  That's a setting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I like the set a reminder for 30 minutes.  That's pretty cool.  Really nice.  I do coding sprints and like our coding sprints.  It was set a timer for 60 minutes and just code.  Hey, Google.  I dig it.  Hey, Jarvis.  OK, Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was your computer that got it.  That was Chrome.  Yeah.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People have told me that I was a fool to tell them right off the bat that it was  Iron Man, that I should have clicked on the wrong button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People have told me that I was a fool to tell them right off the bat that it was Iron  Man, that I should have claimed credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it Iron Man?  No, no.  It's Jarvis.  I mean, let's try it.  OK, Jarvis.  OK, Jarvis.  Yeah.  You're not believing this.

Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are you doing, Hal?  I want to respond to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, anyway, I think this is cool.  I want to see more.  OK, Jarvis.  And I want to see more stuff you can say.  More and more of our divide.  This is clearly something that's going to happen, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although, I don't use it that much.  I mean, I really only use the voice stuff when I'm in the car or with the baby, when  my hands are, I mean, I guess that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would you use it more, though, if it were smarter and were more interactive and conversational?  I bet you would.  Maybe.  It just has to work better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like I'm standing in the street being like, OK, Google.  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, Twit.  Somebody said it works with OK, Twit.  OK, Twit.  Sorry, it doesn't work with OK, Twit.  OK, keep going.  You're not done.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not done.  HBO Go on iOS and Android can now stream to the Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a big deal.  Showtime, Jeff.  Showtime, Jeff.  So Chromecast can now stream from, and this is from the native apps.  There's a little Chromecast button inside the native apps.  Chromecast can now stream from Pandora, Hulu Plus, Netflix, and YouTube, and now HBO Go.  So this was long awaited.  They announced that it would be HBO Go when the Chromecast was announced several months  ago.  So that's in the latest update for HBO Go now.  Google Wallets.  There's another story in the rundown that says Chromecast is now being sold at Walmart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can get it everywhere.  You can start to think that Chromecast can go mainstream, which is pretty cool.  I really think, though, it has to be sold at Walmart.  Yeah, everything has to support it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Particularly Android on Chrome on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't cast from Chrome on Android, which makes you crazy.  You can cast from Chrome on your Android.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, if you want to send something from your phone to Chromecast, unless I'm wrong, chat  room, correct me if I'm wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I thought it was just because Chrome on Android doesn't support it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought it was just because Chrome on Android doesn't support it.  Yeah, but anyway, Google Wallet.  We talked about the Google Wallet card last week.  Leo just got his.  There's an update to the Android app that lets you add additional cards to your Google  Wallet just by photographing them.  So you snap a picture of your credit or debit card and the number of the expiration date  will be captured automatically.  I like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, they're just trying to get you to get your credit card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, they're just trying to do everything they can to make Google Wallet easy to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So does a scan.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So really, I should just go through my wallet and add every everything to it.  Snap pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that's an update to the Android Google Wallet app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But would it?  It wouldn't see the C. What is that CVC number on the back, though?  I'd have to add that later somehow.  Right.  I should get my wallet.  Keep going.  I'm going to try it.  Yeah.  I'm going to try it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  There is a new refreshed interface for Google's account permissions page.  This is the page that lists all the apps that you've signed into Google and given access  to your Google account to.  It's at security.google.com slash settings slash security slash permissions.  It gives you the same information.  It just lists it kind of a nicer way.  Big icons.  It lets you know what each app has access to.  So you can see, for example, Hangouts or Feedly or Picasa, third party and internal Google  apps.  And you can see also if you click on one of the apps that you've granted access, you can  see when you gave access and you can revoke access as well.  So if you're here in the US, kind of a good holiday weekend activity, just clean up your  permissions if there's old stuff in there you don't use anymore.  And finally, Google adds airports, train and subway stations to Street View in a Google  Maps update.  So this is on the LatLong blog.  Basically, this is about Thanksgiving travel here in the US.  You can kind of do a street view around train stations like the Waterloo station in the UK  or different airports from Tokyo to Dubai.  Kind of cool.  You can check out, I think you just search for stations and you'll be able to zoom in and  do the street view so you can see ahead what's it going to look like when you reach your  destination.  And that's all I got.  Play the drums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't see where I can add a credit card by taking a picture.  So maybe I just don't have the latest version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe they didn't get the update.  Let's see.  Yeah, at least an update to the Android app.  Let's look at the Android app.  They do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do the rolled out updates.  Where would it be?  I see my balance that I put in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it looks like looking in the Play Store.  There's an update pushed out yesterday.  Add credit and debit cards.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's credit and debit cards.  Oh, yeah.  Wait a minute.  Here's a push button.  Now can I take...  Oh, look.  Camera button.  Maybe I can scan your credit or debit card.  Oh, this is awesome.  Let's see.  Okay, put the numbers right over the numbers.  Yes, it got it.  You don't even have to take a picture.  Okay, so it got the number, but I still have to put the expiration in the CVC and then  all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a second.  If I just happen to take anybody's credit card from a wallet, I can put it into my wallet?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that what we're saying here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you have to have enough time with it to take a picture and get this additional  information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just never thought that.  Boy, that seems like light security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, hold on to your credit cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you don't give your credit card to people and then have them disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I give them all that data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All you need is a waiter with a Google Wallet app and every time somebody pays, it walks  around, walks away with your card.  Snap a photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is it.  Okay, I'm going to add that.  Add card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The expiration date should be captured automatically.  It must have gotten the read on yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It might not have seen it.  Oh, I can give each card a color too.  So you can choose what color you want your card to be.  That one should be blue or maybe gray.  Oh, let's make it blue.  Wow.  That was pretty easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where do I get that, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huh?  Where do I get that in the app?  So it's hard to find because basically you have to go into settings and then it says  payment methods, credit and debit cards, and then you have a list and then you press the  plus sign.  You can show this, Brian.  It's nothing.  There's nothing.  I got it.  Okay.  Then press the plus sign.  I got it.  So it does normally pick up.  Maybe it just couldn't on my card because of the glare or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a United Airlines card and no one can ever read the number because it's embossed  badly.  I bet it wouldn't take that one.  This is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What else don't you know?  What other cards can I put in?  Oh, I'm sorry.  We're doing a show.  Never mind.  Did you put in your Starbucks card or?  Does this do loyalty cards?  It does.  Well, it does limited loyalty.  I kind of like coin.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder how much of this is in response to coin.  We better rush these features along.  It happened so quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's hard to think there was a response.  I mean, this was the rumors of this physical card had been around for a while, but they're  definitely doing a push and it seems like coin was too recent for it to just find it.  It landed at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eric Schmidt said some months ago, we said it on the show that Google at one point thought  of starting a currency and they said, well, we wouldn't do that because governments don't  like that.  Now Bitcoin is getting acceptance and other currencies are coming out.  I wouldn't be surprised if we get Google Bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google Bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every, you know, this is every science fiction novel from the 70s and 80s basically had corporate  including the great William Gibson novels like Neuromancer had corporate really corporations  were the government's transnationals were in fact the de facto governments of the world.  That's only a matter of time.  Hmm. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google's building flying cars, too, and I think that really means the end times are near.  This is a stealth company that maybe it's right next to Google, maybe even inside Google.  It doesn't look like anything I'd want to drive.  The patent covers personal aircraft.  They're signed to Z Arrow, a stealth company in Mountain View.  And apparently Z Arrow's offices are near Shoreline Lake in Mountain View.  And that's apparently very close.  It could very easily be a Google skunks work.  I think I Sergey Brin would like to have a flying car.  He probably has some trusted minions working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Dumb question.  Isn't a flying car just a little plane?  I mean, isn't it just a personal plane?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There used to be a sitcom.  Leo, see, there was a sitcom about a guy who had a flying car.  When it landed, you basically just fold the wheels up.  Do you remember that?  Wasn't very long on the on the.  This is back in our youth, sir.  There are the supercar planes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was one on display in Terminal 5 at JFK.  It was like a little over a year now, but it was like a personal plane.  And it kind of folded up.  I mean, it was a little big for a garage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Jetsons. Is that what you're thinking?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually made a note of it because I was like, when I'm rich,  I'm going to buy one of these because I love flying.  So 40 or 50.  I don't feel like it was that much money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there anybody there over 55?  Bob Cummings, right? It was a Bob Cummings show.  You're right. Cummings. I loved him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you too?  Don't know.  So apparently the author of this was who's a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle.  Caleb Garling emailed Google and got a response from Dr. Crew.  Thanks for your interest and note this morning.  As you gathered, I am working on some interesting transportation ideas at an early stage startup in Mountain View near Google and other tech companies, but not affiliated with them.  The company is in early stages, still in stealth mode, and we have not been talking to people about our flying car.  Thank you. But I'll let you know.  So there.  Too bad. I would like a Google flying car.  I would. I would.  Have you been scrugelled?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You probably talked about this last night. I had the Pawn Stars and all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We didn't. I actually miss this. I'm so sad because like I love Pawn Stars.  Like I love that show. When I went to Vegas, I went to the shop. I was totally fangirl.  I saw this ad and I was like, now you hate them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So these guys who do anything for money. Give me a break.  You think the Pawn Stars are in it for the fame and fortune?  They're pawn brokers.  So if you go to scrugelled.com, this is a continuing campaign for Microsoft that is so stupid and misguided, created by Mark Penn, former pollster for Hillary Clinton, got fired by the Clinton team in 2008 after she lost a bunch of primaries.  He's a political dirty trickster. Let's face it.  Think. Here's the scrugelled on the mail. The first one I saw a couple of days ago.  Think Google respects your privacy. Think again. Google goes through every Gmail that sent or received looking for keywords so they could target Gmail users with paid ads.  And there's no way to opt out of this invasion of your privacy.  Jesus.  Tell Google to stop. Sign the petition. Outlook.com is different.  We don't scan the content of your email to target you with ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because we can't sell any ads. We have no revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do, however, scan your email for anti-spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Feel sorry for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love this too. You can buy a mug.  You can go shopping.  Oh, that's Google shopping. Let me see. Where's the store? There it is.  Click the store. Here's the Google mug.  There's a scrugelled logo hat.  Don't you love the logo of the spider with the chrome? Like it's a black widow, except instead of an hourglass it has the chrome logo.  The mug says, keep calm while we steal your data.  Jesus. Can't they just be subtle a little bit?  This is so... political dirty tricks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that... are they going to argue it's fair use of the trademark?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. I thought it was interesting that they are using the trademark. I guess they have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm watching you.  Are they just trying to bait Google into doing a little bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You used Procter & Gamble's trademarks in an attempt to slander them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The New York Times has stopped every parody that comes out.  I think they're trying to bait Google into doing something that Google should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, come on. This is so stupid. Step into a web.  The t-shirt has a spider in it. Don't get scrugelled.  I just think this is what happens when you hire political operatives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bet the t-shirts sell better than Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They probably do.  So the latest is the Pawn Stars. This is a hit piece on Chrome, Google Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got this Google Chromebook as a gift from my mom.  I brought it in today, hoping to get enough cash out of it to get to Hollywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sure that's what mom wanted you to do with her nice gift, is pawn it,  so you can go to Hollywood and become a drug addict, live on Sunset Boulevard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi. I'm looking to trade in this gift for a ticket to Hollywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What makes you think it's worth that much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the Google Chromebook, a relatively new kind of device.  Because Chromebook applications are web-based, when you're not connected, it's pretty much a brick.  That's a major drawback.  I could do a better fake laugh than that.  A traditional PC utilizes built-in applications like Office and iTunes that work even when you're offline.  You see this thingy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you this, Gina. You can see that these pawn stars have really become television celebrities.  They really understand how the medium works now.  They're very comfortable on camera. I'm impressed.  Even when they're selling out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says that as if any computer isn't anything more than really a calculator when it's not connected.  With the exception of games that you can play without being connected, it's just such a terrible...  If you're not connected, it might as well be a brick.  Yeah, most computers are...  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't have Windows or Office, so it's not a real laptop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Without Wi-Fi, it doesn't do much at all.  Wait a minute. All Chromebooks have Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I see. If you don't enter in a Wi-Fi access spot, it doesn't do much at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Also, it doesn't mention the fact that there's data connections from a lot of Chromebooks.  You can have a Chromebook with data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're online, Google tracks what you do so they can sell ads.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Honey, you got a job in Hollywood. You are good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just raise that eyebrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's a scroogle?  Google is always trying to...  So that guy, that old guy, is he always clueless like that? Is that part of his shtick?  Yeah, part of his shtick. He's like the old-fashioned dad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To make more money off your personal information.  This Chromebook hardware makes it even easier for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not going to Hollywood, am I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a Google Chromebook. You might get the Reno.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unfortunately, I can't buy everything. Especially when it's not what it appears to be.  And this is not a real laptop.  That's exactly what it appears to be.  I don't want to get scroogled.  It's a good... It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I was hoping the guys would take this thing off my hands, but I appreciated how honest they were.  Scroogled? Who knew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your mom was scroogled when she gave you that horrible gift.  I don't like about this.  My mom gave me this. Can I pawn it?  Anyway, I think that's a good ad. It's, you know, silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, I just put in the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's perfectly in the format of the show.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, Jeff. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just put in the rundown. Bob Cummings flying his flying car.  Oh, how exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The comments in the rundown.  Oh, let me click the comments and let's take a flight.  I have old comments here.  There we go.  Oh, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll take it. The new Bob Cummings show.  So much better than the old Bob Cummings show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't know there was a Bob Cummings show.  That's the last shot of it. You can...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's driving a flying car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is the difference between a flying car and a plane the fact that a flying car has like a wheel?  Organs, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you can fold up the wings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what happened.  That's a good question. It really is just a personal plane, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is. Okay, so I found the personal plane. It's the Icon aircraft.  There's this like personal... It's $190,000, which, you know, not cheap.  But the wings actually fold up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's quite a few things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, sport flying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think really this is a great idea.  I don't want a rush hour above my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, one of the discussions in journalism circles is that for journalists to start to use drones,  the problem is, of course, that the ones with the carbon wings and rotors and all that,  if they fall, if journalists are bad pilots, they could kill people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, but it makes the CNN race to get home so much more. Are you seeing this today?  The CNN is spending so many of hours of its airtime on a race of its reporters to get home from New York to D.C.  They're tweeting.  They're just like the great race.  It's like, what, there's no news today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There clearly is no news today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what they need. They need a flying car.  It is cool.  I am bummed about this, although I think I'm understanding it a little bit better.  23andMe, it's the one where you spit into the vial and then you get your genetic analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The FDA says, you have one? Are you going to do it?  I would monitor for the follow up. I've already done it once.  So folks can see you get this kit.  The spit kit.  There is a little vial that you spit and spit and spit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to do a lot of spitting. It requires a significant amount of spitting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you send it in and then they analyze your DNA.  Now the FDA is sane, as you were saying, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're concerned and I think they want 23andMe.  Actually, I think they've suspended their 23andMe sales right now because they've asked them in the past,  23andMe did not respond, to show that their genetic testing is real.  Because their concern is that people are going to do this and then based on the results of this 23andMe test,  have their breasts cut off or, you know, somehow act in some crazy way because of perceived health risks.  This is my 23andMe.  The truth is you get so little information from this.  But they're saying, you know, if you have twice.  So this is a good example.  My risk of coronary heart disease is 1.24 times higher than the average.  Should I be worried about it? My risk of prostate cancer 2.43 times.  But you know why? Because I'm a white male from European ancestry.  So I don't know how useful. Exfoliation glaucoma 2.9 times more likely.  But my risk is still only 2.2 percent.  So their concern, and I think this is not an illegitimate concern, is that people will act on this.  People will act on this as if this is health information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is the same issue, I argue, as getting mammograms and prostate tests.  And it goes back actually to our security discussion.  The knowledge isn't the problem. The problem is what you do with it.  Yes. And that's what some doctors say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're still going to have to go to a doctor and the doctor is going to have to agree to do a procedure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know, the same issue comes up for these full body scan places, right?  They do a lot of advertising out here. I don't know if they do it back there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're not as narcissistic as all of you are in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can go in and like this is like a storefront where they have like MRI machines and CAT scans.  And you go in and they and it's like proactively tell you what's wrong with you.  And most physicians I know say it's a terrible idea.  Not because it's dangerous, but because you might get information that you will act inappropriately on.  It's just a bad idea to get these, you know, proactive testing.  I have a 17 percent chance of getting risk of getting gout, but that's less than average.  So I don't think these things are all that useful.  I think it's completely legitimate for the FDA to say to 23andMe, you got to show us, you know, that these are that this is real.  This is not just some page you made up.  Right. But others are saying conspiracy theory, the medical industry is trying to shut down 23andMe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, at the same time, the FDA is not protecting us from these quacks.  We're talking about how all men have low T.  Well, I know they should do a better job in some areas.  Risk of prostate cancer. Right. But you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, really, is that true? Yeah.  I stop rubbing that stuff in my scalp.  No, I'm just kidding. I don't have low T.  I got plenty of T, whatever that is.  I think it's probably the case that 20. So you've done it, right, Jeff? Yeah.  Yeah. And have you done it, Gina? I have done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And, you know, as well as things, I was like, oh, it told me I had brown hair and, you know, you know, you can look in them.  Earwax, you know, it was like it was mostly kind of wet earwax.  But I think I think I shared with you guys there's there's this one chromosome that's an indicator for Parkinson's.  And so I got this email. It was like, hey, we have this new test that's going to give you this information about whether or not you have this chromosome.  And I think I told you guys, I was like, I'm going to work day. You know, I was like sitting at my desk and I got this email.  So I go to the site, I log in and it kind of like, hey, you know, this could be potentially life changing, changing information.  And I started to get really scared. You know, you should really talk to a doctor like they they really kind of tell you that you should talk to an actual doctor.  This is an actually an indicator that you're going to get Parkinson's. But I got really like nervous.  I got kind of worked up and nervous about it. And so I was like, OK, and then, you know, you click on unlock and I didn't have it.  Right. And I was like, oh, you know, it's kind of scary.  But this is but this is what the FDA is saying. Right.  Testin 23 means test is creating chaos with people in their 20s and 30s. Look like it's it's scary.  It's scary to see like I have a higher risk of breast cancer or heart attack or whatever.  But at the same time, I kind of feel like you can't have a mastectomy or an MRI without going to a doctor and getting it right.  I mean, it's not like this is something I can do just on my own. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You would talk to your doctor. I think I think all 23 me has to do is say, hey, look, this is what we're doing.  This is this. This is the standard. We disease are legitimate.  And I think the FDA will probably go away. It's not unreasonable for them to ask for this kind of information.  My point is I don't get all that much out of 23 me. And look, I'm ninety nine point six percent European.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. So the same thing about me. Surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, apparently a white white supremacist in Europe was 14 percent African-American.  So that was that must have been a surprise.  I don't know what the point four percent unassigned is.  But you know, I would like to I would like that there's some oversight saying that's an accurate result, not something they just generated randomly.  And the reason it's a Google story is because and and what how do you pronounce it?  What's the key? Well, just who is the co-founder of this is somebody's wife, Sergey's wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, ex-wife, ex-wife. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, this is the. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or soon or separated wife or something.  Larry and her sister is the head of advertising.  That's right. She's still at that school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  Oh, we have one good shoe. I was getting nervous there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we're I think we're going to go into Yahoo.  Do we care? Well, I actually I want to ask you about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because I'm going to do a NPR appearance tomorrow.  So tell me what I should say about it. What do you think about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, she's you know, she's old and washed up.  So Yahoo got her once again, confirming the notion that somehow  Internet media is somehow secondary to real media.  Oh, wow. But Internet natives are going to dismiss Katie Couric.  They're not going to be interested.  She has not. She's not has nothing to say to them.  This is Yahoo pursuing the same silly media strategy they did under Terry Semel.  In fact, they started talking to Katie Couric back prior to Marissa Meyer  to do the same thing. They couldn't make a deal because this is the problem  with mainstream media.  They're paid millions and millions of dollars to do very little.  So under Ross Levinson, a couple of years ago, they were trying to get her over there.  I don't know. I think this is very this is a very common response.  It's self loathing new media. They don't feel that. Huh? Yeah.  Self loathing new media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yahoo feels like it's more legitimate when it has Katie Couric.  Katie Couric feels like she's more legitimate if she's on the Web.  No, that's what's no Katie Couric isn't getting work because in mainstream media,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  when you're 56, you're old and washed up, especially if you're a woman.  So Katie's got a syndicated talk show and their NBC is paying her a lot of money  to sit on the sidelines.  So Katie is just taking the money.  Yahoo is self loathing media.  Yahoo is self loathing media saying, well, nobody's ever going to watch new media  unless we have some real celebrities.  And I see the other thing going the other way, too.  I see a lot of new media types saying, well, you know, you're not really making it  unless you're on NBC, ABC or CBS.  And I think that that's really an old fashioned mindset.  So Katie, I don't blame her. She's going for the bucks.  She's probably I'm sure Yahoo is going to give her a lot of money.  But I don't think she I'm sure I'm sure she jokes about it in private.  Yeah, I'm going to do something at Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I used to be I used to be the news anchor of the Tiffany Network CBS.  Yeah, I'm going to Yahoo. What the hell? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a it's a it's a depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I sort of I Katie Kirk is badass. I sort of I love I love Katie Kirk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love Katie Kirk, too. I love Katie Kirk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But her talk show is not doing so well, but she's not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't understand. Is the talk show dying because of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She says she's going to finish this season of Katie and then then start to work for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's not clear that the talk show is going to get renewed.  It seems unlikely that it will get renewed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And here's the other thing I don't understand about this.  Is this is this intended to be an appointment viewing show?  Oh, it's noon. It's time for Katie on Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's that's why none of this makes any sense,  because that's not how people consume content on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, if that's the case, I don't know if that's the case.  So it shows at certain times that people tune in for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's not Yahoo hired David Pogue, I'm sure very expensive from the New York Times.  They're trying to get mainstream media types to come over to Yahoo to legitimize whatever they're up to.  And it's not the first time they've done it. They do it all the time.  And, you know, I'm sure Oprah will be doing a show.  Actually, Oprah doesn't need the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that didn't stop her. Right.  She didn't need the money for a long time. Yeah.  Yeah, she's one of the richest women in the world. Right.  Well, what is it about Oprah?  All right. But here's here's when Howard Stern was looking to renew his contract at Sirius.  I personally introduced his agent to Eric Schmidt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's my opinion that somebody like Howard Schmidt is Howard Schmidt.  Howard Stern is a brand and doesn't need Google.  Google needs him more than he needs them.  He should do his own thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, totally seems like somebody who could do the Louis C.K. in the set of his own website and just have it.  He's built a marvelous brand. He's got a huge community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does he need Google for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he's always why did he need Sirius?  He's always needed. He's always worked for some company.  He's a wage slave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some people. It's hard for people to get out of that mindset.  And in fact, it's been hard.  It's always hard for us to attract attract people to tweet because people say, but I need I need to work for a real company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, I would work there in a flash.  I'd rather work for you than anybody.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you say that, Leo, you mean like you mean like people with who are established names at like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Other other of my you know, I don't want I won't say particular names, but people in the new are in new media.  I don't go after I don't go after Katie, the Katie Courx of the world.  I can't afford them. And it's funny.  Even I mean, you know, we can't pay millions of dollars to anybody.  We can't give them Yahoo money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So some of it might be that it feels like there's got to be tons of like indie podcasters who do it for free, you know, for the love of it, who are like you are good at it, who would jump at the chance of being at Twitter.  I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the people with real jobs working at CNET and places like that and revision three who have, you know, see the you know, CBS, but CNET.  So now I'm working at CBS.  Right.  Discovery, but I'm working discovery.  There's this kind of feeling like that's a real media enterprise.  Yeah, I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wrote on the web for years and thought I wasn't really a writer until I published a book.  And I was like, this I haven't I didn't hear back from any reader of the book.  Like I still I read so many more people and had so many better conversations on the web.  Like it was stupid of me to romanticize print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do that.  You know, we're in this transitional period.  And, you know, what's funny is that Yahoo has doesn't want I mean, I think Yahoo probably could do better by certainly could appeal to a young, you know, you want you want to make money now the audience to go after the people who are watching only the web, the 18 to 25 year olds.  And every advertisers desperate to get a hold of them, you know, hire Katie Couric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  You want David Pogue or David Pogue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You cultivate a team of young identifiable people.  So but then the other thing that companies like this do is go to YouTube and say I'll Phil DeFranco or whoever you know whoever's hot pot PewDiePie whoever's hot on YouTube.  That's the next and I think you just have to grow the grow organically myself.  But I don't know.  But somebody like Howard is a personal brand.  You know, the whole thing nowadays is the personal brand, right?  He's got the brand.  He should he should do it himself.  He doesn't need anybody.  He doesn't want to if he doesn't if he doesn't want to do it on his own.  Yeah, Google be a good partner.  The problem the problem with Google or anybody like that or Yahoo for this matter.  There there's not a real coincidence of Howard's goals with with with these companies goals.  They have their different goals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Howard strikes me as someone who just wants to talk who just wants to do radio.  He doesn't want to run a business.  He doesn't want to think about it.  So do I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm on America's Got Talent because he says that it's great.  He's not actually in charge of it.  He just goes in and does what he's told.  He's just talent.  He likes that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you can put I mean, I'm the same way.  I don't want to I don't want to do any business.  I just hire people to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but you make a lot of business decisions though, Leo.  I mean, but I only make creative decisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't make business decisions.  Really?  I try not to make business.  Yeah, I mean, I'm a little bit involved.  But I mean, really, Lisa is is the business size.  I only only care about the creative decisions.  The content, stuff like that.  Yeah, I mean, also, I'm sure Howard makes a gazillions of dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's serious.  They paid him half a billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would have taken the job.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, for us to start on your own and your own thing, it's just take.  Oh, I suspect they paid a lot of serious stock and as a holder of serious stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It ain't worth much.  Oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's a big payday that he got from them.  At least a theoretically big payday.  So I was I was when I spoke to Barrelsman in Berlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On my last trip, an executive from Fremantle was there.  Fremantle with all the reality TV shows.  And I don't think I'm going to get away because it was it was tweeted like crazy.  But he said, you know, put up an iPhone and he said, what really scares them is the lone  creator who's creating stuff that scares them death.  That should scare the smart of them.  That's the world we're entering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  I'm I'm struggling with that because I don't want to it to be the Leo Laporte network.  I would like it to be bigger than that.  I mean, it's it's kind of built on my brand, but maybe it maybe it is.  Maybe that's all it'll be.  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would love to make something that you know, I'm thinking my model is more like United  Artists.  Remember when they when Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford said,  I want to work in the studio system anymore.  Why don't we form our own movie company, United Artists, because we have a brand.  That's kind of I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know how it worked out for them, but I think it worked out all right.  Going to have some turkey tomorrow?  No.  Yeah.  Do you do do you do as many Italians do?

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.com.  Are you if you're in a creative enterprise, maybe you're starting a new show with Katie  Couric and you realize that creative you need you need images, you need vector graphics,  you need something to make it gorgeous.  Shutterstock has over 30 million stock photos, illustrations, vectors and videos.  They always have the number down at the bottom here.  Thirty one million three hundred eighty thousand and eighty nine with two hundred five thousand  new images this week alone.  The images are fresh.  They are high quality, often from professionals, individually reviewed, cleared for use and  backed by a legal guarantee.  They are royalty free.  You can use them in anything you're up to.  And look at the footage page.  I think people go to the front page and they sometimes forget to click this footage tab,  footage.shutterstock.com.  Great video as well.  One point four million royalty free stock videos.  If you create an account, they're free videos and images every single week.  You can download any image in any size, pay only one price or choose individual image  packs or do what we do for the best deal.  You get a monthly subscription.  The standard subscription is when we have 25 images a day.  Great for a publication.  Really fantastic.  The search tool is one of the things that makes Shutterstock so great because you can  find things not only by the noun, the dancer or the Santa Claus or a turkey, but you can  also add adjectives.  I don't know.  I could say angry turkey.  Do you think I'll find anything for angry turkey?  I think with 30 million images, there'll be a few angry.  Oh, these turkeys are mad.  That turkey says, back off, buster.  That is one.  Who would have thought they'd have angry turkeys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The turkeys have a right to be angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd be angry too.  Is that a turkey or a buzzard?  Here's a turkey that is not so happy.  Look at that.  That's not a turkey.  That's a duck.  Anyway, the other thing I like about Shutterstock is you can also narrow it down by color.  If you look at their color wheel, you say you've got a web page that has a certain palette,  you can choose the palette you want.  I also love the light boxes that you can take images and save them for later use for inspiration,  for ideas, because it's often the case when you're browsing Shutterstock, you're looking  for angry turkeys and you find something like this.  He's a turkey, all right, and say, you know, later when I want to do a blog post on angry  young men, I could use that.  Everybody knows when you're blogging, when you're creating content of any kind, having  an image just brings it to life and Shutterstock is a great way to do it.  I don't know what's going on there to do it.  Search for angry turkeys and search for anything else and have fun.  Make the free account, create the light boxes.  You can share them with friends.  And if you decide to buy 25% off when you use our offer code TWIG1113, TWIG1113, it's  your way of letting them know you heard about it on this week in Google and we appreciate  that.  In return, we'll give you 25% off.  TWIG1113.  It is time for Gina Trapani's tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I kind of ripped this one off from all that Android, but I've been digging it so  much.  I showed you earlier, I got KitKat on the HTC One, which is the Google Play Edition,  and it comes with a stock Android launcher, but I wanted the Google Experience launcher,  which is the launcher that you get on the Nexus 5.  And it's not, you can't get that through the Play Store, I assume yet, but you can get  it if you sideload an APK, which Fandroid, and that's what a pH Fandroid has posted.  So if you Google Fandroid, Google Experience launcher, you can download the APK and you  can change your launcher to, and of course you can change it back if you want to the  Google Experience launcher, which gives you that slide to the left to get Google Now and  the translucent app drawer and the tap and hold to get the different home screens and  to get to widgets.  And it's really, really nice.  I have to say, I was saying before in pre-show, I really like it.  The Google Experience launcher is really clean and pretty and gives you that translucency and  just makes your phone feel really new with KitKat.  I feel like it's like, oh, now I feel like I really have KitKat because I've got the  Google Experience launcher.  So yeah, check that out if you've got KitKat.  And I think you might be able to even install it on Jelly Bean if I'm not, if not.  Oh, that's interesting.  Yeah, yeah, if I'm not incorrect.  But yeah, check it out, particularly if you have gotten KitKat.  It works on the Nexus 7 as well.  I got it on my first gen.  I got KitKat on my first gen Nexus 7 and also switched it over to the Google Experience  launcher and it looked really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that doesn't happen automatically when you get KitKat.  You have to choose the new launcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.  Right.  Well, so when you get KitKat, you get the Google search update.  But you still don't have the new launcher.  The launcher isn't an option.  It's just the vanilla Android launcher.  So you have to go get that APK, side load that APK, and then you get access to the new  launcher.  So the launcher only shipped with the Nexus 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So and have you with KitKat switched over to the new runtime?  No, I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not after the horror stories I heard or the horror story I heard from Ron.  I didn't switch over.  You switched over though.  I did.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I have had no crashes, no problems, no program didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And was it a was a noticeable speed up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, it's hard to tell.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unless you're doing a side by side.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to turn on developer options and then you'll see select runtime on KitKat.  I did it on my Nexus 5.  I've done it on my Moto X.  Now that my Nexus 7, my 2013 Nexus 7 just got KitKat, I'll try it on there too.  It takes a while because you have to it's like installing a new operating system has  to run through all the apps and update them.  But it's instead of Dalvik, which is the well-known Java runtime for Android, you  select ART, Android runtime.  And this everybody thinks was being created by Google in case the lawsuit from Oracle  went south.  They won.  They prevailed.  But there's still a new runtime.  And I don't know if this is going to be the new runtime later or what.  But yeah, I mean, that's certainly something not to do if you value your your  functionality, but I haven't had any problems at all.

Melt that into the bechamel and then you you cook you can cook some macaroni or like I like those little squiggly little.  Rotini.  Rotini and then you cook those ahead of time.  You pour this bechamel over the rotini and some panko on the top.  Now, if you really if you're not if you go crazy, it's not it's Hanukkah.  I know, but you could also put a little salt pork or ham in there a little bacon.  Just give it some flavor and you bake that lunch today and it's dinner time.
