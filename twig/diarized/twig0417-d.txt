Transcript:  It's time for Twink, this week at Google. Jeff Jarvis is here. Stacy Higginbotham is back and of course,  item number one on the agenda, the Google Memo. We're going to try to break it down in a way that's,  you know, kind of makes sense of everything and explains what happened and why.  And Stacy, of course, will have, I promise you, the final word on this one. We'll also be talking about  changes at T-Mobile, the next iPhone, and why I think I might be using that next time,  and a whole lot more this week at Google, coming up next.

Jeff  is of course the professor of journalism, the distinguished eminence Griez of this show from  the City University of New York, CUNY. Boring guy. What are you saying is the boring guy? The  boring guy. He's the pontificator. Buzz Machine, no that's my Jeff. BuzzMachine.com is his blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you in Chicago for today? I don't even know what it stands for. AEJMC, which is the  Society of Somehow of Journalism and Mass Communications Professors. Oh neat. I know.  It's your trade group, your union. I was sitting in these panels and things and inside I was  screaming. Just screaming and I decided I wasn't going to get asked. Are they talking about paywalls?  Well, yeah, they're talking naively about business. Plus you think the professors would be really  good at giving presentations because they're supposed to do it with classes? No. So it's just  naive and thin. Anybody who's gone to college knows that professors, some of them can be,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and my dad's one and my good friend Jeff here is one, can be the most boring people on the face

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of the planet. Oh man. So yeah, I'm screaming. I'm here because I need to be here. They're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  performers. How's the carnage by the way? Is the carnage okay in Chicago today? Oh, I'm in privilege  north of the river. No carnage in your neck of the woods? No. All right. Well, if you need any rage

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and fire and fury, we got it. You saw the great headline? No. There was a huge headline in the  newspaper and it was why copy-righters should exist because the headline was fire and furry.  Fire and furry? Yeah, two R's. It was a couple words of cats aflame. We're going to send some

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  furries your way. Also with us Stacey Higginbotham. She is at the IOT podcast and is, I'm very proud  to say, the number 12th most influential tech journalist in the world. Yowza? Yowza? Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A, 12th in the world. No, just a lot of journalists follow me on Twitter, which I'm so sad for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a study. Study. Or is this a different study? I don't even want to give it the...  Twitter map. It's a Twitter map by an analyst at Apollo 100, I think. He's done this a couple  of years in a row. The 100 most influential tech people on Twitter or something like that. And you,  I was very proud to see. Of all the people we have on this show, you are number one.  There we go. Yep. And Jeff and I, I'm on the list. Jeff isn't. Most of our hosts are lower than you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Jeff isn't a journalist quite. Yeah, you're right. He teaches journalists.  I don't know how I should take that. Well, no, I didn't want to insult. I was trying not to,  but I'm like, I don't think of you. You don't work at a magazine in that sense. That's all I'm saying.  I guess I don't work at a magazine either. Nevermind. You know what I'm saying. I'm not  trying to insult you. Good. Get her to join, which both of you dig holes. I was like, here I go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's usually my turn to dig holes. I like it. Well, as long as we're talking about, let me  pull up the article. Number one, Kara Swisher, which I think is, you know, that's fair. Totally  fair. Yeah. This is from Apollo research. It's the top 30 technology writers followed by most other  US tech writers, Rich Levin, and they made a tag cloud. And your name is right there. Look at that  right above Mike Isaac. There's Stacey Higginbotham, big name in the tag cloud. I was going to say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a big name in the tag cloud. I'll remember that. But I think it's just because my name is  so long. I'm a little name. It is an advantage. No, look at my name way down there. I'm a little  tiny little name under Lauren Go. Joanna is on there. Joanna Stern, who I adore, is on there  twice. She's on there twice. And I'm trying to figure out why. She's right under Sam Biddle and  then vertical next to Quentin Hardy and Brian Chen. Quentin isn't even a journalist anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Scoble's on this list too, but I'm just thrilled. You're number eight.  Scoble's everywhere. Okay, first of all, you're number eight. And more importantly,  Mary Jo Foley's number 12. Yeah, Mary Jo Foley's in there too. You're the highest  non-affiliated, independent in here. Everybody else is with a big publication.  Oh, that's really a big point. Yeah. So Swisher, Mike Isaac, who is like with a bullet. He was  like number 100 last year because he's at the New York Times. And he does great stuff. We like his  stuff. Farhan Manju, Walt Mossberg. I think this is Harry McCracken. More a testament to people who  were active on Twitter and post great stuff on Twitter so that other tech journalists follow them  on Twitter. That's my story and I'm sticking with it. I think it's true. Yeah. Lots of great  people on here. And I'm proud to work with many of them. Yeah, normally I'm on lists of weird people.  I had to actually give them my email address and download the, they only published the first 30  and I'm not on it. Download the other 100 just to see if I was anywhere on there. That's like being  in who's who. It is terrible. I get to give up information. I'm number 63 and I'm very proud of  that. I hope someday I'm tweeting more just to get up there with you, Stacey. I want to be up in the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's because you don't like Twitter. I think that's always going to hold you back, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have completely revamped my Twitter strategy in response to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, okay. Are you tweeting about your dog? No. Because that really works for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, I- Oh, because I thought if you tweeted a lot about tech and tech stories that you'd get

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  more followers. See, I tweet about your dog. I tweet about my dog and I tweet about really  esoteric studies from like crazy places. And then I also tweet about my gadget experiences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I consider this little discussion here are a moose bush.  There we go. The little or-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's light and not filling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Little hors d'oeuvre. They give you fancy French restaurants to prepare you for the big course to  come. Little goose liver on toast. I've been trying to avoid- I've been putting off the big  story because I don't even want to talk about it, but I guess we have to. You all probably,  if you follow tech news, know that last week a Googler, at the time unnamed Googler posted  on an internal board a memo about why he felt Google- Now I'm going to try to phrase this in  a neutral way. Why he felt that Google was barking down the wrong path with its diversity  initiatives and was perhaps too politically correct about it to do a good job. He wasn't  anti-diversity. He said right up front, I'm not against diversity. I'm not against an attempt to  make the workplace more diverse, but we have to understand the difference between men and women.  I think a lot of people read it and took it as women are not suited for tech jobs. That,  of course, got an immediate response. Loud, vociferous response. Gizmodo somehow got the  actual memo and published it. Yonatan Zunger, former senior engineer-  Our former, recently former.  Yeah, we didn't even know he wasn't there until he wrote this piece and said-  A brilliant guy.  I can talk now because I'm not there anymore, so I can talk in a way I wouldn't.  Completely dismissed, A, the factual material in the memo and B, said the guy should be fired  because this is destructive to Google. The VP diversity at Google put out initially a memo saying  this is unacceptable and Sundar Pichai, apparently the CEO of Google, came back from a family holiday  to address the issue and they ended up firing the person who wrote the memo. It's a 10-page  screed, at which point Julian Assange immediately offered him a job at WikiLeaks,  saying he was a victim of the politically correct culture of the United States.  Have I summarized that? I think that's pretty much where we stand today. There have been articles  since, both in his favor and against him. I'm not going to use his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think to describe this as neutral is like, you cannot describe what he did as neutral  in a neutral fashion because what he did was basically take a position, which fine,  let's talk about Google's diversity efforts. But the way he decided to do the conversation  was by saying it was the equivalent of me walking into a place and saying, hey, let's talk about  crime statistics and then saying something terrible about black people and accusing all of them of  being a problem or not up to white people crime standards or something equally horrifying.  So to even describe this in neutral terms, I think gives it way more credit than it should even get.  This is, A, a terrible piece of writing in terms of just spewing hate in points that  are directly from men's rights activists. But two, doing it in such a way that if any reasonable  person had decided to take issue with the company's policy by saying, by doing it like this,  they should be fired. This is not a reasonable thing to do because anyone reading that memo  is going to be like, holy cow, I work with a guy who's a total kind of misogynistic jerk.  I would say bigger, worse words, but I won't. And so I get that people are like, oh, let's argue  the science. I'm like, screw the science. He is wrong. He doesn't address all of the issues behind  the science. And B, the way he did this was like dropping a bomb in his workplace. And his

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  colleagues are going to have to clean that up. I'm not sure what I don't know. Maybe you do,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but I don't know. He posted it, we're told on a meme board, an internal board, and then an  internal equivalent of Google+. I don't know if this was sent to every single person at the company  or was posted in a discussion group for this. Everybody could see it, I gather, but I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  even. If you send it to 10 people, then one of them is a woman, then there's a hostile workplace,  and if they're all men, then they're kind of conspirators. It doesn't matter how many in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. And think about when Facebook posted their wall where they had their wall where employees  could write stuff. And then suddenly when Zuck had to come down and say, hey guys, you cannot,  I think, was it white lives also matter? Or someone took a stance and wrote that on the wall.  He is a CEO. He had a responsibility to come in and say, guys, that is not our culture. That is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  not okay. Right. Well, that's kind of what Google did. And of course we should stipulate immediately  that Google as a private company has the right to fire the person or the right to discipline the  person, has the right to react anyway it chooses. There's no free speech in the workplace in that  sense. Right. So what he wrote was not protected because he published it on a company board.  I don't think anybody would dispute that much of what he said was hurtful and inaccurate about women  saying things like women have a higher tendency to anxiety. So if you're going to have a tech job,  you should have them in a place where it's less anxious. Women are extroverted. Men are  introverted. That's blatant. Obviously not generally true. Neuroticism, higher anxiety,  lower stress tolerance. This may contribute to the higher levels of anxiety. I don't want to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey upset. Has he seen a Woody Allen movie? How does that man's entire... Well, okay. So a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  couple of things. First of all, and he even says this, these are generalities. But you're  generalizing about a gender just like generalizing about a race is offensive to people. But Stacey's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  onto something else here which is really important, which is... And I could barely get through the  damn thing because it was so badly written. Yeah, I couldn't read the whole thing either. I tried.  So that's part of the case going on here. Whether it's political or technology, the Venn diagram  we're getting here of the so-called men's rights movement, which is, as a man, I will say is BS.  We've had plenty of rights for plenty of time and it's a reaction to feminism. It's a reaction to  perceived loss of power. It's a reaction to all kinds of things like nationalism, like racism.  The misogyny fits in there. And so there's a set of dog whistles. There's a set of ways to talk.  And when I criticized it, then boom, I got it on Twitter like that.  Right. And so what's disturbing to me is... So that exists and that has a voice now because social  enables it. Enables lots of things good and bad. I'm okay with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think there's also a tenor in this country right now to tolerate speech that we would not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  have tolerated 10 years ago. Well, that itself is an argument, right? Because if you go to NRO,  National Review and others, they're decrying his firing as a lack of free speech and as  political correctness. But the point I'm trying to make here for the show that's relevant,  so don't send me your emails. I'm being relevant. Oh, send them emails anyway.  You think that's going to stop them? What disturbs me is the connection of the technology industry  because it's not gender diverse and the so-called men's rights movement and the misogyny that is  inherent in that and how they come together and the whole gamer gator world around technology and  men and technology not being open to respectful of women. That's a huge cultural problem, not just  for the individual companies. But I don't think you can take this one guy as the Atlantic did and  said, well, this shows the horrible core of Google and the horrible core of technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to propose something. I was going to go because first of all, if you just  go to the end of his memo and look at his suggestions, I think we can clearly throw out the  bogus sociological crap he's throwing in there. Although people with some expertise in the area

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  are defending him. No, no. There are people with expertise defending him. There are also people  with expertise saying he's full of crap. That's why we're throwing that out. There's some debate

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  about it, but we're just going to throw that out. I'm not even going to call it. Would you agree with,  he says, my larger point is we have an intolerance for ideas and evidence that don't fit a certain

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ideology? Would you agree with that? No, because he's using my ideas and freedom of expression to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  espouse stereotypes, bigoted thinking. Well, but he then says, I'm not saying we should restrict  people to certain gender roles. I'm advocating for quite the opposite. I couldn't disagree  with this line. Treat people as individuals, not as just another member of their group, tribalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's fine. But he, in this memo, lumped women under an entire group who's bad at engineering.  So I love the fact that he's like, oh yeah, that's all be individuals. Women are extroverted,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  neurotic. So here's what I'm going to propose. Maybe we'll diffuse this a little bit.  Technology and frankly, business in general, but technology particularly, has been a male  playing field for so long that we have a certain picture of it. And people who've grown up in the  industry have a picture of how it looks, how the workplace looks, how the product that we create  looks. On Windows Weekly, I said it's like we for years have been operating with a black  screen and white text. It's in black and white. And then all of a sudden,  people are saying, no, but we want to make it a rainbow. We want to include everybody. We want  technology to reflect all the people in the world, not just this white, short sleeve,  pocket protector, skinny black tie, nerd glasses. Speaking of stereotypes. Well, but that's the IBM  thing. And I think what we're saying is it should be in rainbows. And it's upsetting to people who  say, but no, but tech is this way. And that's the thing. This is what this guy really at bottom is  saying. But I feel like what he's saying is he doesn't know it. But what he's saying is this is  how it looks. This is how it should look. This is how it's always looked. This is how it feels good  and right to me. And what we're saying to him is what I would say is I understand why you'd feel  that way. But there is, it could be so much more and there's so much more opportunity with diversity,  not just gender diversity, racial diversity, national origin, that the melting pot is a  melting pot of many colors. It could be so much more interesting. Yes, it doesn't look like what  it used to look like. That's upsetting to people. But the opportunity is so much better that it's  worth opening up your mind to that idea. This is a discreet against change and diversity.  Diversity is change. That's what I think this is. This is as all conservativism is ultimately  saying, I don't want it to change. Yeah, yeah, because I'm in power now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So did you see, I don't know if you guys read what I wrote, but I wrote something on this  that was really about it speaking to those people who don't want the world to change.  Unfortunately, the world needs to change and tech especially.  I agree. Because if you don't have,  Yotan actually did a great job. If you don't have that empathy, if you don't have that  understanding of your consumer as tech becomes less about computing and more infiltrated into  everything, you're going to build crappy products. Right. And Google has shown us how-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Furthermore, you're going to perpetuate the monoculture because the only people who be  attracted to the products you build are going to be the people like you. So you create a  monoculture. That's not a good thing. Tech does this all the time.  And that's what we've been doing. That's exactly right, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And tech does it with young people, teenagers. It does it against like, oh, I don't want to build  smartphones for old people. Meanwhile, jitterbugs over there doing a successful business. I mean,  look at venture capital and the things they invest in. So-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stacey's article is on Medium, by the way, not on her blog, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And put that on the rundown so I could see it ahead.  Oh, sorry.  No, no, no, I apologize. I'm just so I can make sure I see it. But I just looked for your Twitter  feed and I couldn't stop laughing about your dog at the habanero.  There's a lot of dog stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a traumatic moment this afternoon for people who want to know. I dropped some  habanero raspberry jam on the floor. My dog swooped in. She licked it up.  And she actually yelped and then she started pawing at her nose and I was the bad guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I want to defend myself. I didn't read this ahead of time, but we're in agreement on this,  not the raspberry habanero sauce. We're in agreement on this. You say the world has revolved  around white men's needs for so long that as their parents began to set limits, they rebel and claim  that's not fair. That's not fair. It's not right. And I think you're exactly right. That's what's  happening is this reflexive. No, we don't want it to change.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's not my job. And this is the angry Stacey. It is not my job to hold this dude's hand and to  teach him all of this. And a lot of that, I'll call it emotional labor, I feel kind of cliché saying  that is women have to do that. We have to say, Oh, engineering guy, here's why it matters that  you need to care about other people are, Oh, you weird introverted, creepy guy. I'll work around  your schedule. Screw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't have to do it. And I understand why you're angry. And as anybody who's been  oppressed would naturally say, well, I'm not going to help the oppressor get over their  misguided notions. But I will say as a fellow oppressor, I would like to do that because  somebody is going to have to do this. Somebody is going to have to drag, not drag, that's the  wrong phrase, coerce, cajole, encourage this patriarchy to start to be inclusive. We have to  figure out a way to do it. That's why I wrote that article. I don't understand you. I don't at all,  at all fault you for being pissed off and not wanting to do that. It isn't your job.  But I will take that job on as a member of the patriarchy because it's, it's, you're right.  It's better for everyone. We just have to get over our like, but I like it when I'm in charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's, that's exactly what's happening all around. Right. Disruption is bringing a react.  We're seeing equal and opposite reaction happening. Challenge the nation brings nationalism,  challenge to the white majority brings white nationalism, challenge to male hegemony brings  the so-called men's right movement. But it's a little more complex than that. I recommend once  again, the data and society report about media manipulation that came out a few weeks ago.  It goes into great detail. Well, not great detail because in a lot of things, but it's a very good  explainer about the backwards world of this kind of manipulation of the dog whistles that, that,  that if you, if you think something's bad or wrong, then, oh, we're just, we're just lulls.  We're just trying to, trying to show something. We're just trying to get a discussion. It's all

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  we're trying to do. I was just joking about beating up a boys will be boys. Yeah. Well,  no, boys will be boys is a different thing. Boys with the boys is not joking about it. Boys will  be boys is saying, Oh, well men are that way. You can't change them. Um, and that's a little bit of  a fatalistic, uh, point of view. That's actually the latest one. It's an earlier wrong. It's  medium. It's this for may 15th, the spread of false or misleading information is having a real

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and negative effects on the public consumption of news. And so it also talks about how the part of  the so-called men's rights shtick is that being a so-called loser is what they want to be. Cause  that's what ties them together. Cause that makes them oppressed. Right. But let me, let me just

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  take this and make it less, uh, general and more specific to our topic. Um, uh, which, uh, which,  I mean, basically that's all we've been covering for the last decade is how technology is disrupting  all the incumbents, all the ways we're used to having things be. It's very upsetting to everybody  who's grown up in a different world, including me, I'm 60 years old. And it's, it's, you talk  about techno panic. It's that Jeff, it's that it's the disruption of somebody who had a job  and doesn't have a job. It's in the nature of this. We're seeing, you know, change happens all  the time, but this is happening. I think I would say at accelerated rate we've never seen before  in humankind, maybe in 30,000 years. So, uh, it's incredibly upsetting to people, all people. And

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  not all, no, those who are losing, no, some things who are losing, some of them are energized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, everybody's losing something. Everybody's losing something. The world you grew up in,  even if you're only 20 is changing and it's changing very rapidly. And the natural human  inclination is to say no. And to, and it comes out in a lot of ways. I don't, I think it's a mistake  to say, Oh, it's them that are upset and we're embracing change. And there's in everybody's life,  some aspect of this, but also some people are gaining in this. No one's, you know what? I think  it's a, I think it's a huge mistake. I am totally gaining in this. I will say every time people,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have sat through so much crap and not had it been validated and dealt with sexism,  dealt with all kinds of things. And now I'm actually gaining the ability to speak out  against that. So I'm gaining huge amounts of, not necessarily power, but as your hope,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a risky thing to pick winners and losers in this. Um, because that's going to  further polarize. I understand what you're saying. You are gaining. However,  I think it's a more politic thing to say that the change we are going through is disruptive to  everyone. And we all are going to have to buckle down and start to understand that life is not  going to be as it was. But that's, but that's, but that inherent, what you're saying is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and I don't mean you're saying this, but, but, but, but my, the reason I'm objecting is because it  sounds then as if the change is bad. No, it feels bad. The change brings just, I don't think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  neither bad nor good. That's a mistake. It is neither bad nor good. It's neither winners or  losers. That's one of the big mistakes we make that turns this into that polarizing point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's polarizing because some people are losing. You're like, we're all losing the way it used to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  be. We are all losing the way it used to be. Yeah. But most of us don't look at that as a loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're an African-American person, you don't say, wow, I really wish things could be the way  they used to be back when. And even today, I mean, if you're an African-American cab driver,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you might be glad that there's maybe perhaps less racism, but you may also be out of work  soon. The point is that, that we are living in an unprecedented generation of change. It's very  disruptive. You're, we're seeing huge disruption in every area there. If you're a winner in one,  I promise you, you will be a loser in another. And we just, this is going to be one of the most  difficult things for humans to go through. We're not built to accommodate this rate of change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all. So I would say, and I'll expand on kind of the idea, because I was, you actually said  it, you were like, your instinctive response to change is, ah, I don't like this. This is not fun.  And I said that in my essay, I said, it's not fair, but the response that you have to things  being upsetting and change, messing with your life, isn't to say it's not fair. It's to say,  holy cow, what's happening? Reflect on how you fit into that. And that is actually a recipe for  success when you're a cab driver without a job. So I would say, we're in agreement. Instead of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  picking winners or losers, a fair and unfair, good or bad. Okay. I don't. Yes. Okay. I'm not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  saying we're in agreement there because I don't agree with you on that. But what I'm saying is  tangential to that or next to that is the reaction you have to something being unfair is what matters.  And some people are actually going to be better equipped. If you're equipped to say,  holy crap, this sucks. How can I get around it? You're actually going to be better off in a change

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  in a constantly changing world. I agree. So there's a couple of things I think everybody  it'd be great if everybody could do. One is to start embracing change. One is to acknowledge  that change is discomforting and that we are all discomforted in one way or the other. And to have  some sympathy for people who are discomforted by it. I understand if you don't want to have sympathy  for your oppressors, that's completely understandable. But I think that in the long  run as a general rule, it'll be better if we can all acknowledge that this is uncomfortable for all  of us in some way or other. And that the best way to deal with it is to acknowledge that and to  embrace the change as best we can. We can agree on that. The only thing I think that was a lot of  things in there. Well, I think that I'm trying to kind of take a little more of a Zen approach

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  than say hate the oppressor and say, well, I understand your Zen approach. But as someone who  is dealing with this often in a negative light, I feel that a Zen approach will get me nowhere.  And in the past, having a Zen approach has gotten me nowhere. Yeah. No, I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's convenient for the oppressor for you to be Zen'd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, I mean, you could be Martin Luther King. You could be Martin Luther King or you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  be Malcolm X. I mean, there are ways and ways to resist. And I just think that the thing that  we've been fundamentally covering on this network and in tech in general, but particularly on this  network, because we take kind of more philosophical bent to it, is the vast disruptions that are  occurring in our lives and are about to occur in even greater ways. We haven't even seen the  disruptions that CRISPR is going to bring. You know, you want to have a big debate over gender.  You know, wait till we have the ability to genetically modify babies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my gosh. Have you guys, am I the only person who does this?  Have you thought about what you would want modified?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Constantly. It's like thinking about what superpower you want. What do you want? What do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want sunblock.  I need a skin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's called being an African American. You just want a little more. You just need a little more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  melanin in your skin. No, they burn too. I'm like, God, how awesome would that be with climate  change being crazy? And then I want some sort of like Bluetooth headset that's constantly in my  head. Although when you start talking about implantables, standards become a real thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want the metaverse. I want to jack in. I don't want to have to wear a visor. I want to jack in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and be in the new world. I just want to live longer. Leo, let me ask you an unfair question.  If somebody on your staff had written a memo like this internally or, you know, done a show,  how do you as not just the manager, but also Twig is your, Twit is your brand,  putting yourself in Google shoes and running the culture and trying to have empathy inside the  company and all that, how would you react? This happened at Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's an interesting question. I hadn't really thought about that. I mixed feelings about  them firing this guy. I understand why they had to because he was creating a hostile workplace.  If anybody did that here and it was clearly a case of making a hostile workplace,  understand that this company is mostly run by women. I don't think there would be much  tolerance for that. I think that person would be gone. However, our hosts here are encouraged.  It's a little different for a host, right? You're encouraged to have to stimulate discussions.  I wouldn't, I'm not going to put a Sean Hannity on the show. And if somebody started becoming  a propagandist for a point of view, that might be different. But I mean, I, you know, you,  one could maybe argue that I should be fired because I'm not, I'm not saying this guy should  have been drawn and quartered and hung out to dry. No, but if you got on your show and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you argued that women are not good candidates for engineering because we're neurotic,  I don't know if you should fire someone who's a host. I'd be like, I would, I would probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  do that. I guess, I guess we'd have to do something about that. Actually, I don't think I'd have to  because they're audience. No, we've never had a case like that. I only hire intelligent people.  That's an interesting question. We, okay. I've had, okay, this is not exactly the same thing,  but we had somebody on one of our shows say that moon landing was a hoax. Never had him back on.  It's not exactly the same thing. I think you said moon landing. No,  moon landing was a hoax. We have had hosts on who believe in UFOs and I don't, I can't really,  I can't knock them for that even though we might disagree. But I don't think we've ever had anybody  come on ever and say, well, women are somehow less suited to tech, to tech jobs. And man,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  besides the moon landing, have you ever had somebody come on and say something offensive  and you or someone on the staff said, let's not have that person back? Oh yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All the time. We don't make a big deal out of it usually. It's gonna be my last twink show.  But we don't, I kind of don't, I don't want to cross over into censorship either. And so it's  a little different in a, like if somebody says, put something in a company wall,  that's very different than if somebody says something on a show, you know what I'm saying?  So if something like that were posted in our company wall, we'd probably fire the person. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And if you have a whole, I mean, your audience would react presumably to someone who's  just a hateful person. And you know, there are plenty of people who are hateful on the air  or, and then the other thing to think about with a host is you could be perfectly normal and then  you could do something crazy and like send dick pics to your staff. Yeah. Well that, oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  they'd be fired for that. So that goes into that hostile workplace. Yeah. We do have an HR,  you know, a man, a employee manual and we have very strict rules just as Google does.  And there are absolutely firing offenses. I don't really do the HR, Lisa does. And I can tell you,  I doubt very much she would tolerate anything like that day more. So the other interesting part of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this is that Google now, and I think Jonathan did the best expression of this and put forward a  summary that said, if you were my employee, here's what would happen and here's why.  And so I think, I think as a manager, he did a good job with that, but Google is now in a position  where ever more they're going to be seen as political in their actions, whether it's this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay. So let's, I wish we could throw the memo out and just say, do you think Google is left wing?  Google is liberal. It's very liberal, but look at it. Conservative speech is not tolerated there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like if you're- No, no, no. So not liberal like that. Google is the anti-conservatism and  conservatism in the most literal sense of the word don't change. Google is pushing things forward.  It is constantly changing. So that correlates to a lot of policies just, but I don't think it's  politically leaning one way or the other, except when it benefits Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The irony of all this, and one of the reasons Google did have to fire this guy  is their diversity is terrible. I mean, really terrible. Not only 20% of women in tech jobs,  1% of African Americans at tech jobs. It's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you encountered this in Google, I mean, I've had friends who worked for Google and  Google does have a very big culture of worshiping the stereotypical engineer.  That's my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Break out of that.  You've had a lot of points here.  No, but that's what I said in the beginning. Break out of that. We have this picture of what  an engineer looks like, what tech looks like, how a computer should be. And we need to  part of the reason that exists is because there's been this monoculture.  We've got to break out of this monoculture. It's a terrible thing.  It's a terrible thing and it really hurts technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we can agree there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not going to disagree with that. Yeah, we're all going to nod our heads to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's really the bottom line. That's kind of the fundamental bottom line of all of  this is creating a monoculture is not a good thing for a company that wants to make products  for all the people, not just all the people in the US.  But that's tech in a nutshell.  It is tech in a nutshell.  That's the culture fit.  It's because in the early days of tech, and I was there, it was a bunch of us guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was media in a nutshell too in the day. Media was old white men.  Here's the key difference. It's my mass shtick. In a mass world, you were making a single product  for everybody and so the majority could be favored. Two things have changed. The majority  anymore, but also Google does not make and Facebook is not a mass product. It is a personal  services product. So it has to work for people personally as their own. And if you're not able  to make a service that does that for people because you don't understand them and their  needs and their presumptions, then you will fail in the business. It was a lot easier making a mass  product because you could just television, news, all those products. You said, let's get to the  most people we can. And then you could go niche. Yeah, you go to a portion of that,  but Google is very different. It's not niche. It's not mass. It's personal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did Connor Friesendorf get this wrong? Friedersdorf in the Atlantic, he said the  media completely got this memo wrong. He said by labeling it anti-diversity,  they were really misleading their readers about the actual contents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was. Oh, I read that and I thought that was just kind of dog whistling in some ways.  I think so too. He's like, oh, this memo is really arguing. For diversity.  For diversity and for this guy, because he says in the beginning that he's not against diversity.  I could say I'm not a racist, but I. Let's not have. It starts off there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just not fair having black people in the Olympics because we white people can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  compete against them. There you go. I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or, you know, I mean, it's the problem is it's so ingrained in us. And so we're fighting,  all of us are fighting an uphill battle in some degree with that.  That's true of all of us. Yes, that is true.  And so the best thing in my opinion to do is to say just what I keep saying, which is  as hard as this may be, a monoculture is bad, especially in a company that wants to produce  products for everybody. And we've diversity is just it's like Skittles. It's just bring in the  rainbow. And that's what we want. I'm going to write the Skittles memo.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll save you for yourself. It seems obvious to me that A,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  we're discomfited by this and B, it's obviously the best way to go forward.  And we have to acknowledge our discomfort and still go forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is also why I object to your notion before that says that everybody is uncomfortable by  change. If you have been oppressed, if you had a crappy life, then then no, you could welcome the  change. And the problem is that conservatives are the ones saying that the change is bad.  Everyone's uncomfortable with the change. So let's deal with it.  That's picking one slice. No, let's also celebrate the change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's picking one slice of men, white men who are been in power for very, very long time  and have written history and would like to keep it that way. And well, of course,  they're going to be discomfited by the notion that they're not going to have a monopoly on  history anymore. I understand that you would be discomfited too, but it's in your interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey's not discomfited by that. Stacey says at long friggin' last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right? But she might be  discomfited by something else. I don't know. Do you misstyle telephones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a poor dog that's discomfited because of Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would say your job here isn't just to be like, hey, can't we all just get along and  have a multicultural society? I think we actually all have to do real work around understanding  other people's perspectives. I'm not saying that's easy.  I'm just saying the goal should be that, right? Well, if the goal should be that, but you can't  just, I mean, any manager will tell you, you can't just set a goal. You have to tell people how to  get to that goal. And that's what Google's doing. And some people will argue that he's saying that,  oh, the way we set about going about our goal is wrong. And that's a totally different discussion  that no one can have because he filled his essay with so many freaking insults and dog whistles that  that kind of gets lost. And Mother, was it Mother Jones, had an article that said,  hey, guys, this memo looks fishy. And their idea was that this was kind of a  right kind of push out there to argue for free speech in Silicon Valley. So  I don't know if that's true or not. But the idea here is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My brothers at Mother Jones always did like a good conspiracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There, yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let me give you a different example. So I can't talk about this. We're dealing in an organization  where there's some insensitivity going on. And I think it would be fair to say that people who  are insensitive aren't aware of how they're insensitive, but they're in positions of power.  It's not where I work. Don't worry. It's just the one thing I'm watching from a distance.  And then how do people who are not in power try to educate those who are in power about how you  treat those with less power? It's a dynamic that's pretty much impossible to fight. And so you can  bring in outsiders, but it's easy to say, oh, yeah, we brought in the consultants. Everything's OK.  And there's an educational process, too. Let me bring up a different thing.  So have you seen Detroit? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, I haven't, but I want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So well, I've had different reactions to this. I thought it was excellent, but obviously-  Oh, wait a minute. I didn't see Detroit. I saw Munich. What's Detroit?  Detroit is Catherine Bigelow's movie about the 67-  Oh, you're being-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I haven't seen it. I have a little bit of a problem with Catherine Bigelow in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's an issue. That's why I haven't watched it.  That's an issue. And I have African American colleagues who say, I'm not going to see it.  And I almost want to say to them, I get it, but I almost wish you would so that you could give  a critique that would be meaningful rather than just white media giving the critique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Catherine Bigelow is like Oliver Stone. She seems to-  There's an issue with facts.  Polemic to-  Yeah.  Yeah. It always seems to be a political statement.  Oh, it's definitely a political statement. This is a definite-  I don't enjoy movies that are arguing a political point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a very powerful political statement. And you could look at it as saying that it was a  white director exploiting black history. You could also say that it was a white person  coming to grips with white oppression. A lot of ways you can come about it.  That's kind of where we are as a country now is all I'm saying.  Is that- So then it gets then, if you try to have the discussion, then it gets slammed into  the political correctness debate, supposedly. We've got to- I guess what I'm trying to say is this.  We don't know how to address this person to person. We're still bad at that as a society.  Yeah.  That's what's going on.  Yeah.  Sorry, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my friend who is German, he actually, whenever we go out to dinner, we sit down and we start  getting into these discussions. And he always, he confessed to me, he's like,  I always get so frustrated with you guys because Americans, they get right to the  interesting part of the discussion. And then they just back right up.  He's like, in Germany, this is where it gets good. And I was like, yeah.  We don't like confrontation here.  But I do think under learning how to talk to people, how to actually listen, how to be  respectful and acknowledge that your experience is not everyone's experience,  which I think a lot of people have a real hard time with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because it's not our experience.  That's called empathy. That's called empathy. You girls are good at that. We're not so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not even funny.  Girls will be girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, I read the Mother Jones article and I want to retract what I said, because actually  the writer has an interesting point. He thinks that this memo was intentionally made offensive  so that he could get fired so that he could portray himself as a martyr and even go to court  funded by some nice right-wing think tank. That I don't think is incorrect. I actually  think that that's probably the case because he didn't need to assert, for instance, that  there's a biological difference to make his points, but he did. He kind of went farther,  more offensive than he had to. Kevin Drum writing in Mother Jones.  He was embedded.  Well, I don't know if he's embedded or he just said, I think this is not an uncommon thing among  certain alt-right believers, people like Mylon Yiannopoulos who take it the extra step because  they want it to become a cause celebs.  Yes. Cults need enemies.  That's a strategy. That's a very common, well-used, well-known strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Especially if you're not really persecuted or oppressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mylo's gay. I mean, he could say, I know what it means to be oppressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is Peter Thiel and that man is doing a number on...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, that's kind of what I'm saying is that in real life, nobody's got it going on. Everybody's  got it. I don't know what you're talking about. I have it going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am number eight on some survey and by golly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You are the winner here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am working hard to make things better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to admit, when I read this, when this whole thing started last week, I said,  I can't wait to talk to Stacey about this. And I did not anticipate, frankly,  how upset you would be by it. I underestimated that a little bit.  Upset is also a loaded word too.  Well, I think you were very insulted by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was. Well, it's because I have to argue against this stuff all the time. And also,  as a woman in tech, I get very frustrated when people talk down to me or they...  What's the word I'm looking for?  Mansplain.  Oh, mansplaining happens all the time. And they make these assumptions about  my knowledge base. And as a journalist, my job is to ask questions and to try to understand  and learn things. So I don't mind people explaining things to me that are difficult and hard,  but I do mind when people give me the equivalent of don't worry, you're pretty little head over it,  as opposed to a real answer to something. Or I mind when people hit on me when I'm asking  them questions or when I get excited about something. They think my excitement over  software-defined networking is actually my excitement about them and they're wrong.  Oh, Jesus. That is self-centered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So let me give you a great example this week.  No, I'm really excited about software-defined networking, honestly.  Yeah, I really am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not you. Excited as you are. No, it's not you. So I've been trying to read  of the right-wing sites, just trying to understand somewhat what's going on. And  not even far right-wing, the National Review and so forth. So I forget which site it went to.  I went to a piece where it was trying to... It was basically the Google version. It should  have been the Onion, but it wasn't the Onion. It was biologically explaining and justifying  man-spreading. That women's hips are better being straight together. It wasn't just the obvious.  It was also about the bones and the hips and the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think it is a little overly political to assume that man-spreading  is an attempt to dominate women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I can't stand it. It's not an attempt to dominate women. It's just they're saying,  screw anybody else who wants to sit here. I'm entitled to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Somebody with weak adductor muscles and a very tight TI, my legs just naturally go that way.  That's how they fall. You know what?  But on the New York subway... I close them when there's a lack of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would like to do this on the New York subway, but I don't.  When there's a lack of space, I can't...  I respect.  Yeah, but it's work.  My favorite tweet was... I tweeted this and I said, of course, this site would say,  this is part of the man's rights movement now as to man-spreading.  It has become political.  It was man-splaining, man-spreading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Man-splaining, man-spreading.  Well, let me tell you, honey, if you... I don't want to go any farther.  I do too now.  I'm just going to stop right now. I'm just going to stop right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should we move on to a particular thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm glad we talked about this. Thank you.  Let me ask one more question, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it's a particular talent of yours that there's a topic like this,  and at some point you have to personally have a fatigue about it to say,  I've gone through this. It's difficult.  Okay, we've already discussed it on this show or that show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Especially the way we do shows because I do...  This topic's been a topic of discussion for four or five years now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So how many shows has been a topic on? How do you do that?  How do you keep that fresh?  How do you not say at some point, guys, I can't do it anymore?  I just can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the good news is I'm kind of slow.  So a lot of times my first take on something  evolves over the period of discussions with people more intelligent than me,  like you and Stacey.  So this probably drives our audience crazy if they watch all the shows.  They go, well, Leo's changed his mind now.  But I am slow and sometimes I need to talk...  You're not. You listen.  My nature is I chew on... I'm a chewer.  And it takes me a while to kind of... It drives Lisa crazy.  She's the exact opposite. She's very decisive.  And lots of evidence that being decisive, even if you're wrong,  some of the times is more effective than chewing on things.  But I chew... But that's just the way I am.  So I always have been the way and drives her crazy.  And so I chew on it.  And so it takes me a while. It takes me about four or five days.  And a lot of these complicated issues, to understand them, to think about my...  And I spend a lot of time... The worst thing, Jeff, it's not just the shows.  I go home and I think about this.  I've been thinking all... I thought all night about, well, how are we going to handle this?  And what are we going to talk about?  That's just the way I am.  And so it's fine for me. It works for me.  It may not work for our audience.  I always assume, which is wrong, that everybody just watches one show.  So this isn't repeating anything.  Well, you have rabid fans.  Many of our listeners we know from surveys listen to multiple shows,  and they're probably very sick of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they're screaming at their car radios right now, saying, yes!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I also, to a fault, as you well know, like to look at the other side of stuff.  I tend to be more empathetic to people and to think about, well, how does that feel?  And why do they say that?  And what do they think in there?  And try to get it from their point of view, which is, you know, makes for lousy discussions.  But...  Well, it doesn't.  Well, it isn't because it's better in this kind of a form to have a strong position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I didn't mean to delay the transition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm glad you asked because nobody ever asks about me.  Anything else you'd like to know?  But enough about Google. How about me?  What about me?  This week in Leo. It's a new show.  This week in Leo, yes.  It's a new show.  Well, some would say they're all this week in Leo.  All right. Let me take a break.  We're going to come back and talk more.  Stacey Higginbotham is here from Stacey on IoT, iotpodcast.com.  Do read her post on Medium.  Why did you post it on Medium?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it's not IoT related.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you link to it though from anywhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter.  Twitter?  Did I put it on Facebook?  This is hard with the fragmentation of stuff.  I'll put it in my newsletter.  I'll be like, hey guys, by the way, I wrote this.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't remember seeing it on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  But that's not just the picture.  They're not giving you my stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the title of it is, guys, it's time to grow up.  And you can search for Google Stacey Ties.  It's time to grow up on Medium and you'll find it.  Our show today brought to you.  Oh, and Jeff Jarvis is here all the way from Chicago.  The urban carnage capital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pizza night. It's deep dish pizza night.  I'm so jealous.  I was sent around the country.  This is the days when Medium made a lot of money.  I was sent around the country to personally judge the best pizza in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is where your heart problems came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this will be the most controversial thing said on this show today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's the best pizza in America?  And I'm going to really be mad at you if you don't pick the right one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I judged it to be Gino's East in Chicago.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You like the deep dish.  I'll give you that.  I'm personally a Pepe's New Haven fan, but that's a tomato pie.  That's a flat thing.  And for deep dish, I don't know.  I have a preference about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I used to be on Ron Owen's show here in San Francisco.  Or back in San Francisco where you are.  I'm going to be Ron in a couple of weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, Ron's the greatest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I would watch the...  Do please do.  And I'd watch the board and I was being boring and the phone calls were coming in.  All I would have to do is just say, you know, you can't get a decent pizza in this town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd be really interested if when you come to Petaluma next, well, maybe our next Christmas  dinner will be at our local old Chicago pizza.  I'm curious what you think of it because I think it's pretty good.  But I didn't realize I was talking to a pizza expert.  Little did I know.  What makes you a pizza expert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The boss was nice to me.  That's a great gig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never got any good gigs like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't win that one.  But there is...  It actually is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey, you get every doorbell made.  I'm jealous of that.  Oh, Lord.  That's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is not a good gig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You got to install them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, someone send me around to test mole or queso or the best Italian cream cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's the best queso in Austin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or test hot foods on dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have an assignment for you, Stacey, and I'll give you an expense account.  Find the best queso in Austin and then send me a queso the queso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But queso's so like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Perishable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's that.  If I send it to you, it's just going to be a brick, rubbery brick.  It's personal.  Yeah, it's very personal.  Yeah.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's...  Send me out for mole.  I could drink a case of queso and still be on my feet.  Mole.  You like mole?  I love mole.  Do you like a spicy mole?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do.  I like it spicy or less chocolatey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I had some very good mole in South America.  I would bet so.  Yes.  The best mole though is in South Mexico where you get the South American influence,  but you also get a Mexican influence and I think it's very good.  I would recommend anywhere in Oaxaca.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Excellent mole down there.  Let's all go.  I'm like, I'm there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm tired of this tech battle.  I'm taking my Spanish again, so I'm ready for you.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got a Spanish speaking child, so I'm working it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ooh.  She goes to a...  She's bilingual school, right?  She is.  That's so neat.  It's such a good idea.  Our show today brought to you by...  Well, it solves a problem.  I think a lot of you have.  I know when we're doing the radio show, people always call me and say,  what's the best business accounting software?  Nobody's ever asked me what's the best medical office management software,  but I'm sure that's because they think, well, I'm not going to ask that, doofus.  But I bet you what you do when you're looking for that kind of thing is you Google it.  And then what do you get?  You get a lot of undifferentiated results, a lot of research to do.  Why go there when you can go to Kepterra?  Go to kepterra.com slash twig.  This is a free service.  It's a software comparison site for business software, over 400 categories,  thousands of programs, and best of all, more than 200,000 reviews and ratings from actual users.  They vet them, they curate them, so that you get the best information about the software  you're looking for.  Look at all these categories.  Let's say, I don't know, pick one, Carson.  Construction, there's a good one.  So I don't know anything about construction software.  So you click construction.  Now it's going to give you a bunch of construction management products.  I mean like 100.  Maybe you want to narrow that down.  So on the right there, you could choose what capabilities.  You could say, I only want to see four-star reviews that are web-based or local-based.  You could tell it all the things you need to do.  Press filter, and now you've narrowed it down to just the programs that do what you need them to do.  You can take a step further.  Put a checkbox in the bottom of the icon there.  I'm walking Carson through the site to pick one for the comparison.  See that?  You can pick up to four, and they'll make a nice comparison chart for you  with everything you need to know.  And then you can read the reviews.  You can really narrow it down.  This is so much better than a Google search.  Know exactly what software is out there, what fulfills your exact specific needs,  how people who actually use it review it.  And this is all free.  There's not even any register.  There's no obligation.  Nobody's going to call you or email you.  This is just a great directory.  And they wanted you to know about it.  I want you to know about it.  Captera, C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A dot com slash twig.  Business software is expensive.  You know what's really expensive?  Picking the wrong business software.  Find the right software for your business free right now at captera, C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A dot com  slash twig.  And we thank you so much for being on the show this week in Google.  Captera dot com slash twig.  See any good IOT devices lately, Stacey?  Is there anything you're excited about?  I bet you get that question a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ooh, I'm excited about the changes coming to HomeKit.  Oh my God, it's so dark in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, maybe you saw my screen.  You should give a command to your lights to turn on or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you get storms, don't you?  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's what's happening.  I don't have this light is not actually tied into something yet because I've got to save  switches to test out new switches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to have a refuge somewhere.  Somewhere that's not wired.  HomeKit is Apple's home solution.  We've talked about this before.  Every year I would go to Comdex and then later CES.  I'd go to the home automation pavilion.  There'd be all these vendors and all this promise.  And it was never intended for home end users.  It was always intended for installers.  And even then it just wasn't really a great solution.  It was like for the Hollywood director, they wanted to press one button and his bed would  rotate, the curtains would close, the screen would come down, the picture would come on  or whatever.  It was not something normal people would use.  And now the tech community, tech industry has promised all this stuff.  It's still hard to work together.  So we need a hub.  Ideally we could talk to.  That's what I think Apple's, what is it?  iHome?  HomePod.  HomePod.  I think that's the point of the Apple thing is you could talk to it and it will become  a hub, right?  So you're saying HomeKit, we're seeing some improvements in HomeKit to support this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So there's two things.  There's actually three things that I think are interesting here.  One is, oh, I'm just looking at, yes.  So they're taking away their cert chip.  So you used to have to have a certification chip in the physical device.  And they introduced this at WWDC in May and said, and it was very much a little aside,  they were like, by the way, people can have software based HomeKit.  And everyone was like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's interesting because that would have been a cost, right?  And it would have limited how many devices would support HomeKit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does.  And like I had to buy separate gear if I wanted to update my HomeKit stuff.  So the second thing, so this is great because now people can retroact.  We add HomeKit to existing products.  We're not 100% sure how this program works yet.  I've been begging people to tell me, you know, and want to tell me, I will keep it off the record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because it's not hardware.  Now you can just do it in software on anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not, you can't, you have to do something with Apple.  You can't just magically make your stuff HomeKit compatible without working with them.  What do you have to do with Apple?  You have to license something?  That's the question.  It used to be that you had to be an MFI developer and get that license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Made for iPod or made for iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Made for eyes.  Eye.  So I don't know what they're doing now.  But two is when the HomePod comes out in December, people can actually control stuff in their home,  even if they don't have an Apple phone.  So like as an Android user, this is really important to me because I would never go all  in on HomeKit because I can't control it from my phone.  I don't often need to control my devices from my home or my phone, but I would still be pissed  off if I couldn't control it, especially because I'm an IT guy at her house.  And then three, I'm forgetting the third one.  What is the third one?  Oh my gosh.  Oh, they made it easy to run things without having to in the home app on the phone.  So you don't actually have to play with all of your devices in like the 30 different apps  you have for each device.  So that's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's interesting that they've dropped the MFI requirement.  Isn't it?  That's not an Apple-y thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not, but I think they realized the smart home was a thing that was happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They wouldn't be a player if they did this, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me tell you, the entire smart home device community was just, they hated it.  They hated working with Apple.  They wanted to.  They wanted that Apple marketing heft and that credibility, but they were just like,  ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Remember though, this is a new market in some ways for Apple.  So it's not like you, you know, if Apple does something with the iPhone, everybody has to  toe the line because you have hundreds of millions of devices out there.  But all the home stuff is relatively new.  And so Apple, and Apple is not dominant in this market.  So I think Apple couldn't act in the dominant way it would like to with ecosystem lock-in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right now, the only dominant thing is the Amazon Echo.  You have to launch something with an Echo skill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's about it.  But that's easy to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, yes.  In getting, I mean, it'd be better if you had native integration, but they're working on that.  And yes, the HomePod is the speaker.  It's an Echo speaker-like device that Apple introduced when?  Recently.  And then it won't actually be out until like December.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, someone called me on being the IT guy.  As I said, I was like, oh crap, see, it's sexism right there in action.  And they're right.  I'm the IT gal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to say her from now on.  My new pronoun is her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I got in trouble for that.  You did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I did.  What's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I, I, the logic, I, I'll screw it up till I get in trouble again by saying it.  Yes, I used in my book, I used, I, my default was female.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, and then I think all my articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Trouble that somebody came after me in trouble by some jerk.  Oh, jerk or an no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was, it was a feminist argument against doing that.  And I can't remember what the argument was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, feminist argument against doing that.  Oh, well, I don't buy that.  That's a crypto something.  The book, this came up for me in my mind the other day.  I'm listening to a wonderful book, which I highly recommend called sapiens  by Yuval Nora Harari.  And Harari, I don't actually know if it's a, it's a man.  He's a man.  Harari is writing the kind of book I love, which is probably anathema to social scientists  and historians and anthropologists and geologists, which is the broad brush.  Look at how societies work and stuff like that.  It's the, you know, the guns, germs and steel Jared Diamond kind of stuff.  I love that stuff.  Going back to Alfred Toynbee, it was said geography is destiny.  All that.  I love all that stuff.  So in this though, he always uses the feminine pronoun, her, to talk about cavemen or Neanderthals  or early homo sapiens.  It's always her.  And at first it's a little jarring and now I love it.  Why should it be him?  Why should it be he?  It's just, I mean, I don't understand why would you presume one gender or another?  One's as good as another and if, why should it be she?  So I've totally got used to it, but at first it was like, what?  Every time he said it, oh, she, yeah, he's being, he's being politically correct.  He's being inclusive.  And the reason, yeah, you're right.  In the chat room, the reason I'm reading this is because his new one, which is about the future of  our species, Homo Deus just came out.  And I want to read this before I read that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like, do you, I bet you like that kind of stuff, Stacey too.  I think you like broad.  When I was in college, they said, oh, you just love generalizations, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I tend to.  I like synthetic stuff.  I read them, but some of them irritate me.  I really, I actually like really, this is not going to surprise anybody.  Really in-depth nerdy.  Yeah, you're a geek.  If I can learn everything possible about the subject in one book, that's like crazy  textbook thick.  Yes, I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is one book that combines both geekery and broad generalities that you must read.  And you probably have read it.  George Gilder's microcosm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't think I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I never did.  I should have.  Yeah.  I'm sending you both copy of it as soon as we get off the air.  There will be a quiz.  It's old.  This was written 27 years ago.  This is not a new, but it is fundamental to understand what's happening today because  it's about the unique situation that digital technology is that as time normally stuff  as time goes by, the normal case of events like a car, maybe it doesn't ever get less  expensive.  It gets more capable at the same price.  Maybe if you're lucky, usually gets a little more expensive with digital technology.  It gets smaller and cheaper by orders of magnitude every year and a half.  And actually that doubles every year and a half.  So it's not quite an order of magnitude, but that's the idea is a very exponential rate  gets smaller and cheaper.  And that's what's made all of this possible.  That's the revolution.  Fundamentally, that's causing all this disruption that's making us all nuts.  Did you read about the iGen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that the new generation?  Yeah.  Okay.  I was like, is this a device or is this the general?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's both.  Article in the Atlantic.  It's actually a, by the way, the Atlantic had so many good articles this week that I  bought a subscription.  I said, you know what?  This is, I got to give them some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know who owns majority of the Atlantic now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I do.  It's a Steve Jobs.  I don't want to call her Steve Jobs widow, but she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lorraine Powell Jobs and Emerson Collective.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Her, what would you call it?  Fund?  It's a fund.  I think it's a fund.  Fund for journalism, the Emerson Collective.  Yeah, she bought it.  And other things, other causes as well.  Controlling stake in the Atlantic, which is another reason I gave them 20 bucks.  Anyway, iGen is a book coming out soon from Dr. Gene Twenge.  Why today's super connected kids are growing up less rebellious, more tolerant, less happy,  and completely unprepared for adulthood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This kind of generality drives me.  I know.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Addy.  And this is another example of something we've been talking about all week.  This is techno panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this presumes that our kids aren't, our own children aren't smart and aren't able  to do things and learn and figure out their own world better than we did.  I just, ah.  The premise is that since 2007, since the advent of the iPhone and the smartphone in

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  general, the iPhone specifically, children have had, their lives have changed.  They don't go out as much.  They stay in more.  They're safer than they've ever been.  They're having sex at a later age.  And she, by the way, Dr. Twenge, she's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very,  age.  And she, by the way, Dr. Twenge is a specialist in, in generational differences.  This is her field.  And she, and she quotes a number of studies.  They don't, that kids, here's the graphs.  The kids, since the release of the iPhone, they don't hang out as much with friends.  They don't drive at, they drive at a much older age.  They're dating less.  They're having less sex, but they're also more likely to feel lonely, to get not enough  sleep.  That's because I know a lot of kids go to bed with their phones.  I go to bed with my phone.  I'm in that group.  It's different though, because they, you know, I was, my brain was fully developed  before this, the advent of the iPhone.  This is about the generation that's coming of age with smartphones and Snapchat and always  on and constant screen time and all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I have a, I have a daughter who fits into this generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I brought it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And two, one of my good friends does generational research.  She is a famous speaker on that topic.  So we actually have a lot of conversations about generational differences.  And I think the way this is framed is very techno panicky.  I do think the relationship that kids have with their phones is unprecedented.  I don't, I mean, I imagine it is very similar to the relationship teens had with their cars  when teenagers actually started getting cars or having access to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or their record players or their, you know, pick your thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, you can find techno panic quotes about kids reading too much and not getting  outside enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those weird pulp fiction books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So every generation has been worried that the next generation isn't going to be anything  like it.  This is another example of they're changing and I don't like it because change is bad.  Big go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But.  And it fundamentally doesn't trust the next generation to adapt and create a new world.  It's the old generation.  So it's different from ours.  So it must be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do think that we should be discussing though.  So I don't think technology is inherently bad, but I do think we've talked about this  in the past, but the manipulation that websites and apps have to keep people engaged.  And to bring them back and the influence of the algorithms that Facebook or, you know,  Snapchat or Instagram uses to decide what to show you.  Those all are things that I think we actually do need to look at and how that affects not  just kids, but kids are more vulnerable in the sense that they're trying to figure out  the relationships with their peers, their world.  They don't have a sense of identity always that they can fall back on.  Like if someone's a jerk to me on Twitter.  I just close it down because I have a whole other life.  But when all of your peer group is on, they're not on Twitter.  I'm just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but you're right.  The opportunity for bullying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there are real things that we need to look at, but I don't think that this is,  I don't think technology is bad for kids.  I do think it does change some aspects of growing up, but that's the constant in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's going to happen.  But I also think it's unprecedented.  I think it isn't like books and and and television.  My parents didn't want us to watch a lot of television.  This is kind of unprecedented because it's Stacy nailed it of the of the  thanks to massive data, we now can make highly addictive games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I remind you of what was the what was the play?  What was the musical?  Bye Bye Birdie.  Yeah.  Right on the phone.  Oh, my God.  What's it doing to the ages?  They're all on the phone.  This is ruining their lives.  They're changing their social situation.  They're addicted to each other.  They're talking to each other.  No, I have faith in our kids.  I have faith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I used to fall asleep.  Yes.  With my phone.  I would literally fall asleep talking to my friends on the phone on my own.  My parents had to buy a second line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And haven't you told us you snore too so that your friends.  It's good that they couldn't.  Record calls in those days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is true.  I don't think I snored when I was that young.  It's now with allergies and moving to Austin and.  But too much time on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There we go.  I do worry about here is Bye Bye Birdie, by the way.  I do.  That's Ann Margaret on the left on the phone with her friend and they just talk.  And I think I think as the number goes along, they're all talking to one another.  It's great.  It's great.  Split screen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It becomes split screen.  And that's that.  But I remember that when I was a kid.  That was a constant complaint of parents is I can't use the phone.  Because, you know, everybody's the kids that are always on the phone talking to each other.  When Abby is kind of funny, my kid, my daughter is 25 when she was growing up.  She would be on Skype while they were doing homework.  So that she'd have video calls, group video calls with a bunch of people.  But then my son was three years younger.  It's all been Snapchat for him and Facebook.  And it's very interesting.  The generations are actually changing already from three years every three years or something new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, things change.  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I was going to say, and there's also something this article didn't talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wish they were doing it in the locker room.  I don't believe it.  OK.  This is the silliest movie ever.  It really is.  It really is.  I have not seen it.  You haven't seen Bye Bye Birdie?  Oh, you got it.  It's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm I'm younger than you are.  I'm sorry.  What?  But what I was saying is there is a very predatory way that companies are taking advantage of kids.  And that is I don't care if your kids have to be better or what.  But I think as parents, we do need to be more aware of that.  My daughter is on a game and I spend it's called Star Stables online.  And I spend a huge amount of time talking to her about how the game is manipulating her to spend money.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good.  But it's.  That's making it a valuable education experience for her and decontextualizing.  It's like when we were young, our parents told us how television ads were manipulating you.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I tell my daughter how television ads are manipulating and I tell her she's not on Facebook.  But we taught she's a big YouTube user.  And like I started a YouTube channel and she asked me literally every day how many YouTube subscribers I have because this is a very important number to her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it is to her generation.  It's huge.  I didn't realize this is a horse game full of adventures.  I've got a play stable.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, God, you pay so much money for my star stable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am Leela Fogelung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can see the torture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, God.  I don't want my horse to be.  I'm going to have it be amethyst champion.  There's my horse's name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can play for free for the first five levels.  It's seventy five dollars for an unlimited thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then you have to buy the image of that young woman.  Well, I don't see my daughter actually brought that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was like, I don't like the way the girls look.  They look weird, like eels.  And I was like, they do.  They do look freaky.  How come there's no boys in this game?  This is not me.  I know this is apparently there are boys that play.  And they, God, look at her like she is freaky looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uncanny Valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And body dysmorphia all rolled into one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So anyway.  Given her red eyes because she's been up all night on her iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's actually like they have a whole twitchy kind of thing about this where they,  the girls do videos of their horses and they talk about like,  you know how there's those swag haul videos?  They do the haul videos in star stables.  So you buy these virtual things and then you show your new things that you bought in the  virtual world.  And this is a big deal with the tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You cannot, Jeff, in any way claim that anything but that this company,  whatever this horrific company is, is designing a product to be absolutely a money.  Oh, I agree.  I think so.  To squeeze money out of children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And yes, especially fake hay.  But you know, on the other hand, Leo, I complained to the show many years ago  when my then young daughter was playing with American girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I spent so much money on American girl.  Dolls that there was also there was a social network around it.  They're in Chicago.  You could go to the American girls doll store.  They have a little bring your doll.  They have a tea party.  I did this.  I took my daughter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would look like a very dirty old man.  They have a tea party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I brought my daughter and she brought her best friend.  They both bought the American girl dolls, the two dads and the two daughters.  And then we and then we said, I said, we'll go to the American girl store and the tea party.  They have a little chair for your dog, but we're going to a Cubs game.  And then I never forget the image of me holding the American girl doll in the bleachers  at Wrigley Field and my daughter sat in front of me saying, this is boring, dad.  I know, but it's fun.  Now she liked it.  She'll never forget that.  That was a great trip.  They have a little hospital there for the American girl.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So no, but that's not as addictive as the point.  Wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They had a social network for right.  And you could argue on the one hand that this is an exploitation just for the brand.  And like the arguments, Facebook does everything just to get you on more.  But but my daughter was when they closed it, my daughter was crushed.  Yeah.  It was a community.  She had it was a safe community with with friends.  It was gone.  You know, that's true.  The example you gave me.  Yeah, that's pretty awful.  But we shouldn't presume that just because the company makes it and the kids like it,  that it's necessarily awful.  It depends on how it's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, right.  Well, yes, I just feel we do have to acknowledge that there are different  different ways your kids are going to be preyed on in.  Oh, yeah.  In each technological evolution.  And so we have to in in this one's particularly, I guess, insidious because it's  it's woven into the fabric of some of these things.  And it happens a lot of time when the computer like on the computer or the phone,  you're not with them.  You know, like it's not like you're teaching your kid how to drive or it's not like  you're all watching TV as a family and you get a chance to talk about this together.  You have to be very active.  And I don't spy on my child.  I don't do anything like that.  So for all I know, we do talk about not being able to unsee things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a big one, right?  Because kids will see things that they're really not ready for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see things I'm not ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but we can deal with it, right?  They don't have any context to deal with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have never seen two girls, one cup.  I've never seen Goatse.  Yeah, you don't want to see that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because I can as soon as you say either one of those, I actually, you know, I can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet you think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think about it, but it's but you brought it up and it's in my mind.  It's there.  It's stored away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I don't know.  Thanks a lot, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we're doing a grand social experiment.  The truth, I would say the truth is we are doing a grand social experiment.  For instance, Lisa's son is 14, lots of screen time, fairly laissez faire.  In fact, we made the decision he's going into high school that he could have the computer  in his room now.  We're setting it up tomorrow.  But Megan Moroney's kids, she's very, she's much stricter.  All the digital stuff is kept in one charging area and it has to be left there at night.  And I mean, it's really and she's got controls on the thing.  So we're doing a social experiment to see which kid turns out to be a serial killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like how that's your option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, how much did you spend on Pokemon cards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, as a father, God, we couldn't drive by 7-Eleven without stopping to buy Pokemon cards.  And they're, you know, bits of cardboard for $15.  I mean, they're really expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What were the Thai Care Bear things, those little bears, right?  Tamagotchis.  No, that too.  No, no, the little stuffed animal, little stuffed type.  I would say it's not on a continuous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have a thousand of those.  I hate them so much.  But that's your kid's too young for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's too young for that, isn't she?  Beanie Babies?  They had baby, yeah, she's only, they, Beanie Babies like 15 years ago.  Leo's saying it was all over.  It was over by the time she was born.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no, she's, she has like, she does have more than 60 of them.  And you walk into a room and they all look at you with their big beanie eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All our old studio was actually where we, because it used to be a drugstore before we moved in.  It was where we bought the Beanie Babies when my kids were little.  I used to bring them back from the airport whenever I traveled.  That's fine.  That's nice.  That's a nice gift.  That's good.  That's not bad.  You traveled a lot though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was like, my husband travels, I travel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lots of Beanie Babies.  I guess the point being, is this a continuum from every generation?  It's always been like this and it's just steady state.  Or is it getting worse?  I feel like it might be getting worse because of technology being better,  more adept at manipulating the kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or the kids are getting smarter.  This is where Dana Boyd comes in.  He used to study teenagers.  You have to have faith in your kids.  They are inventing the systems to work around that.  One of her great examples that I love this from Dana was the presumption that we oldsters make  is that kids don't care about their privacy anymore.  They just share everything.  Dana said, no, they come up with languages to do things.  I might have told the story on the show years ago, but a girl was on Facebook.  Her mother was on Facebook.  She was okay with that, but the girl was having trouble with her boyfriend.  She didn't want her mother to smother her with love.  She went on to Facebook and she put up the lyrics to, and I always forget this,  the end of Life of Brian when he's crucified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Every sperm is sacred.  No.  Always look on the bright side of life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look on the bright side.  Her mother thought, oh, good dear, you're having a wonderful day.  Every friend came in and said, oh my God, what's wrong?  Because there was a secret language that protected privacy, but still communicated.  That exists for sure.  We've got to have.  Isn't that a great story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you see the study that you can tell whether somebody is depressed  based on their Instagram posts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought it was their Facebook posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also their voice.  Well, this is a recent.  Their general unwashed appearance.  This is in Fortune magazine.  This is from the University of Vermont and Harvard.  Published in the EPJ Data Science Journal.  They built a tool to scan Instagram posts that could accurately identify depression  in 70% of the study's participants.  Doctors are only successful 42% of the time.  They looked at 44,000 Instagram photos posted by 166 study participants.  About half had been diagnosed with depression in the past.  They analyzed things like hue, the use of filters, the presence of people.  They were able to determine depression markers.  For example, depressed people were more likely to post photos with darker gray colors.  They liked the inkwell filter.  You ever use the inkwell filter?  People aren't depressed, use the Valencia filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So all the way back in 2014.  So this is a Fast Company article from 2014.  It says your Facebook status updates can show if you're depressed.  Yeah.  But now we've got a computer program that does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And with greater accuracy than a clinician.  Now before...  That's great.  Okay, I'm going to give you another data point on this.  My contention that it's getting worse.  Kids growing up and playing video games all day or on their phone all night  are more disassociated from real life.  And will end up growing up with social issues.  And it goes to...  I'll give you another theory.  Okay, but let me give you this data point.  Oh, it's not done.  Okay, sorry.  I need a point.  Steve Bannon.  No, no, he didn't grow up in his basement.  I don't know where he grew up.  But the point being, he had an insight because you remember,  he was at Goldman Sachs.  Goldman gave him money to create a gold farming business in Asia.  They hired Asian kids to create wealth in World of Warcraft  which they would then make money on by selling it for real money to gamers,  World of Warcrafters.  But his business ended up getting shut down.  Did you read this?  His business ended up getting shut down because of gamers  who took this as a huge violation of integrity, as cheating.  And he discovered at this time, this was late 2010,  you know, around 2010, that these guys...  This is the quote from Steve Bannon.  These guys, these ruthless white males had monster power.  It was the pre-Reddit.  He discovered a world populated by millions of intense young men  who have been socially maladriable, were smart, focused, relatively wealthy,  and highly motivated about issues that mattered to them.  And it was this insight that brought him to build up Breitbart,  to bring in Milo Yiannopoulos because Yiannopoulos could whip up  disaffected gamers and in fact, was a big fueled gamer gate, right?  So is there a class of kids who grew up kind of with this anomie  who are being manipulated and are in fact a danger to our society?  That's my thesis.  Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did the anomie come from us as parents being overly protective  and this is going to go back to the...  That's how they ended up in the basement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that's how they ended up in the basement.  I agree.  We said, don't go outside, stranger danger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  In stranger danger, we had to schedule their play dates.  You know, this is conservatism.  In my day, we just...  Parents just kicked us out of the house and we went out and played, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm not debating the cause of it, of course, but...  So it could be that you find...  Dangerous people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to agree that kids today have a lot more anxiety and stress than we had.  It could be parents.  I win.  It could be lots of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I win.  Victory.  All right, moving on.  Now you want something scary.  Google has decided that the next project DeepMind will take on,  and remember, it's the Go champion, is StarCraft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, I'm worried about DeepMind that it's going to have a bad adolescence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think this is unfair.  If DeepMind beats everybody at Go, that's one thing.  That's a human game.  But StarCraft is a game created on computers, played by computers.  It seems like a computer would have a real advantage.  Of course a computer can win StarCraft.  DeepMind is analyzing 65,000 StarCraft...  Played past StarCraft II games to apply machine learning techniques and become a StarCraft master.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, how much of StarCraft depends on hitting the right button at the right time?  All 100%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, so yeah, the computer is going to totally win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why wouldn't it win?  I mean, even Jeopardy, which part of Jeopardy is hitting the button at the right time, right?  If you listen to Ken Jennings talk about it, that was an advantage that Watson had.  Now to beat Watson, you had to buzz in before Watson did.  Right.  Watson did.  Right.  Watson could do it perfectly every time, right?  It did wait for the end of the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you have to.  That's the rule.  You have to wait until Alex stops talking.  Oh, really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I play at home shouting at my television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no.  I take pride in answering it before Alex stops talking.  I tried to answer the first five words.  Yes, every grandfather does that.  Yes.  I know.  I'm that guy now.  I sit in my easy chair.  It's got a dent where my butt's been for the last 40 years.  And shout out to Alex.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the real litmus test.  Trebek!  Wheel of Fortune, yes or no?  No.  Good.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sometimes I'm watching Jeopardy and it comes on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't actually watch any of those types of shows because I don't have TV.  I don't have over the air television.  You could play it on your Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wheel of Fortune?  No.  Jeopardy.  Oh, I lost to Watson at Jeopardy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, OK.  I keep saying I'm going to take the Jeopardy test and try to get on Jeopardy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I've always wanted to do that.  Yeah.  That would be the greatest thing.  It's kind of like I was better equipped in college.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They should do a geek because everybody on Wheel of Fortune is a geek anyway.  Right.  But then they should do a tech week.  Wheel of Fortune?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no.  No, Jeopardy.  He's not Wheel of Fortune.  Jeopardy.  He's getting a little confused.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm in.  It's time to take your pills, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's time to take a break, Jeff.  Jeff Jarvis is here.  He's from Chicago.  He is on at BuzzMachine.com.  Pizza night.  Are you going to go with a bunch of other professors and have Genos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just talked to the associate dean into it.  So are you going to Genos?  I hope Genos.  I'm right next to Uno's and Due's, but I'm still a believer in Genos.  I used to be on the wall.  I used to be on every menu at Genos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because you said the best pizza in America.  Jeff Jarvis, People Magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not pissed.  I'm still not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's the competition?  Not Uno and Due's.  It's like Luminati's and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's all that new stuff now.  But that's, yeah, but I'm a pizza conservative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we have Uno's out here, but I can't imagine it's as good as Uno's in Chicago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uno's is like a deep-chich pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what this is.  It's a pie.  It's a deep-chich.  Oh, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacy.  I'm not a deep-chich pizza person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's too much.  I like the Neapolitan style, very flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you can only eat one piece of Genos.  Because it's like this.  I mean, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm kind of with you.  And that's why next time we're in New Haven together, I'm taking you to Pepe's Pizza  to get a tomato pie, garlic and clam tomato pie.  That's three days of misery.  You will die, but you'll die happy.  All right.  There's always a line.  Rain or shine, there's always a line at Pepe's Pizza.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.  There's no line when applying for a mortgage at Rocket Mortgage.  You don't have to even put on your pants.  You don't have to get up.  You don't have to go to the bank.  You could do it from the convenience of your home, your couch,  on your phone, on your tablet, on your computer.  Here's really the most likely scenario.  This weekend, I like to do this.  Everybody likes to do this.  You want to drive around, look at open houses, just see how the neighbors live.  And you look at a house and you go, hey, this is great.  Good price.  We should buy this.  Now, you could just go home and dream or you could bookmark it now, rocketmortgage.com  twig.  Fire it up and you could get loan approval while you're standing there,  before you leave the open house.  That's how fast Rocket Mortgage is.  It's an entirely online mortgage process and it's from the best lender in America.  So, I mean, that's just icing on the cake.  Look at this.  Number one in customer satisfaction in the US for JD Power,  year after year after year in both primary mortgage origination and mortgage servicing.  They are beloved and rightly so.  But they've also done something special for us geeks.  They've created an online mortgage approval process.  Quicken Loans is huge.  So, they've got relationships with all the financial institutions.  You don't have to go through all your papers, find your check stubs or bank statements or  whatever paperwork you need.  You can literally just submit it on the phone online.  You don't have to have it.  They have relationships with your bank.  You just have to approve it.  They crunch the numbers based on your income, your assets, your credit.  They're going to analyze all the home loan options that are appropriate for which you qualify.  You pick the term, you pick the rate, you know everything.  The monthly payments, the annual percentage rate, all the details.  It's completely transparent.  Then you say yes or no and then they say you're approved and then you show that to the realtor.  And baby, you got a new house.  If you're refinancing, a good time to do it is interest rates ratchet up.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  They go there too.  Rocket mortgage from Quicken Loans.  Apply simply, understand fully and mortgage confidently.  Equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLSconsumeraccess.org number 3030.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  And we thank them so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I put out a thank you?  Yes.  Not to Rocket Mortgage, although awesome, but to ScooterX who posted an explanation  for something that just started driving me nuts, which is Google Photos requiring you to say,  boom, delete before you can actually delete it.  Like to confirm a delete before you delete your photos.  You don't have to say boom.  Sorry.  When you delete your photo, it says, are you sure you want to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacy clicks.  She says, boom, we now know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do.  I'm very definitive and decisive in my clicking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So before they didn't ask you to confirm it, they just deleted it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they just let you undo it.  But now I am one of those people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I delete like my accounts.  I am so OCD about it.  I am like, those are, I go in and delete photos.  So this is like driving me absolutely bonkers because I'm like,  yes, I want to delete it.  Stop asking me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but there's, it's not a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is a big deal.  It's an extra boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not that big a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's part of this like media manipulation.  You're just making it that much more difficult for me to do the things,  to get my data and make it go away.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me just show everybody and they can decide if it's a boom.  So you're here in Google Photos.  You say, you know, I don't really like that photo.  So I selected it, clicked the trash can, and then it says move to trash.  We remove from all photos, folders rather.  So that's good to know.  It's going to delete all and then move to trash.  Boom.  How hard is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Three versus two clicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I think it always did that.  You're saying you would just press the trash can and would just throw it out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would just go and then it would do a slider that says, would you like to undo this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you still get the slider that you can undo it, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh God, that's even two.  Anyway, I just, I was irritated.  Thank you, Scooter experts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In the past, so this is a Scooter link to an article from nine to five Google.  In the past, deleting an image on Google Photos would automatically send that picture to the trash.  A snack bar, I didn't know that's what you called it, but that's what they do, apparently,  would slide up from the bottom of the display and offer users a chance to undo their action.  However, it would disappear after a few seconds and it could go unnoticed.  So they're just trying to protect people from accidentally deleting their pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can undo it if you accidentally delete it.  Now I've got to click an extra button and I delete like 50 or 60 photos at a time.  So that's 50 or 60 extra.  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You mean each photo?  You can't do it.  No, no, no, no, no.  It doesn't do that.  It just does it once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it does it on your additional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me delete six photos.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so I delete mine one at a time because I want to look at the photo before deleting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Stacey, there is an easier way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can select multiple photos just like that.  That's what I do when I delete all the receipts that I had to take, you know,  for my expensive account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To save the time that they just used up, you know that it will now, you know, the assistant  pick up the receipts and say, would you like to free up some space?  These don't seem to be anything you want to, you would want to keep.  Did you see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I did not see that.  Isn't that nice?  Probably because I don't have, my photos are terrible.  They're like me and my child, my dog, and then 8,000 photos of gadgets.  And then a bunch of weird people from CES or whatever tech show I'm at.  So Google's like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I now get a classification that says these, these look like,  I like receipts.  I don't, I don't think they do diodes.  That would be pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would actually be a very useful classification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You still have a lot of pictures of diodes.  Maybe you'd like to delete some of those.  I haven't seen that one yet.  I like Google Photos.  I don't, I don't find that onerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like Google Photos.  In fact, I just sold my friend on Google Photos.  She's on an iPhone and I was like, let me show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everybody should be using an iPhone or Android.  There's no reason not to use it.  It's crazy if you don't use it.  Did you see that Google is going to buy Snap for $30 billion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did that just happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, that was last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, this is last year.  You couldn't get it for $30 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, right.  Okay.  Sorry.  I was like, they finally did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, Google.  What's the market cap of Snap?  Do you think he'll find it faster or me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The market cap is $15.9 billion.  Whoops.  Maybe they should have taken that $30 billion when they could have.  Three people inside and close to the company,  according to Alex Heath, the Business Insider,  separately confirmed they heard the chatter  that Google was going to buy or had floated an offer of $30 billion.  They confirmed the price too,  with one calling it an open secret among Snap's upper ranks  in certain industry circles.  So we'd heard this rumor last year, but this kind of confirms it.  So they got a valuation in May of $20 billion,  and they're currently at $15 billion market cap,  because their stock's been hurting after the Instagram copy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But in fairness, getting bought by Facebook versus getting bought by Google,  you're going to end up with very different trajectories anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I take $30 billion from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Sorry.  But if you thought you could do a better job  than Google building a picture-centric social network,  which I bet a lot of people thought they could do better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I think Google learned a lesson.  In 2013, we reported on a rumor four years ago  that Google had offered $4 billion,  and that Snap had turned them down and Zuckerberg.  I believe it.  And $4 billion sounded like a lot.  $30 billion.  That's hard to turn down $30 billion,  but if you think the upside's bigger,  and they knew they were going to go public, and wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. All those kids' eyeballs ready to be manipulated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's exactly what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have we talked about the Essential Phone getting crazy dollars and coming out?  Have we talked about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not really. I mean, I ordered one.  I don't know. It was supposed to come out in June.  This is Andy Rubin, the guy who created Android  and was at Google behind Android until he got promoted to robotics  and then left the company.  What's the story? I mean, I'm waiting for it.  I thought...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I reserved one.  Let's see. What is the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was there a delivery date?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, he said...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The launch date is coming next week now.  I thought there was also some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He said at Recode that they were going to come out in 30 days.  That was in June, so they didn't make it.  Oh, really? Oh, I didn't make it.  So 699... What is it?  They've raised $300 million in funding.  I see. Okay.  $300 million.  So the Wall Street Journal is reporting.  From Tencent and Amazon. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. That's what it was.  I was like, there's a lot of dollars in my brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is such a bad time to buy a phone right now,  or buy a phone company for that matter.  It's... Everybody's waiting,  and I think rightly so, to see what Apple does.  And even if not Apple, we're going to have August 23rd,  the Galaxy Note 8.  Probably sometime in November, Google will announce its new Pixel phone.  These are the big, big players.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think this is a bad time.  Do you think Apple can do anything groundbreaking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Believe it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, aren't they doing 3D image censoring?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Guys, you guys, when this happens,  I'm ready to talk about it because I learned all about 3D sensors.  Sorry.  We talk...  I'm sorry. I'm not sorry.  I don't think you were here last week when we talked about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very good article in Medium by an expert in augmented reality  about why Apple is going to eat the world and why Google didn't.  Google's Tango technology...  Oh yeah, I saw that.  Yeah, wasn't that good?  That was good.  Google's Tango technology and HoloLens from Microsoft,  both are very similar to Apple's technology.  In some cases, in some senses, HoloLens is superior,  but it won't be out until 2019.  Google was at a disadvantage because unlike Apple,  they don't control the hardware platform.  You need to do both hardware and software to make this work effectively,  which is why Apple, when it releases an augmented reality phone,  kind of like Tango, we've ordered the Zen phone.  Jason Howell ordered the Zen phone AR.  So that's a Tango phone, one of the first consumer grade Tango phones.  But I think Apple, just by virtue of 100 million phones,  something like that in the next six months, will be dominant.  Actually, it's more than that because every phone since the 5S,  once it has iOS 11, will be capable of augmented reality.  But you'll want the extra hardware that the new phone comes with.  Do you think, Stacey, AR is a gimmick like VR ended up being?  Or is it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I think AR is really exciting.  Yeah.  And really useful, not just in consumer things,  where I think it might end up being a gimmick for a while.  I think in industrial things, it already is being effectively used  to increase productivity and make life a little easier for people.  So I am very excited about AR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In the form Apple's proposing, I'm not all that excited.  The idea that you hold up your phone and it's like Pokemon Go,  and you see stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why I think industrial is going to be really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like Google Glass, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's the same way the personal computer, we all looked at...  Sorry, the computer was a business machine first.  And it had to be to get the economies of scale,  the software written to get all of this done costs a lot.  So you needed a customer who could pay a lot.  But the way electronics work, you then push that out to the consumer.  So I think we're actually with AR going to need that business  economies of scale and impetus to help develop the right ecosystem.  And then it'll come down to consumers and we'll start seeing better heads up displays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe then this is perfect for you and me and Jeff.  T-Mobile's new Jump on Demand lets you upgrade your phone every 30 days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I would hate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, even I, even I.  Even I. That's kind of wasteful, shall we say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You need to enter an 18-month lease agreement after which you could pay off the rest of the  cost of the device and trade it in or start over.  But the original Jump on Demand was three device upgrades a year,  which seemed like an awful lot.  They don't say what devices are included,  but according to a Reddit thread, S8, S8+, G6, Moto, Z24,  are all available through the program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do people not have a lot of things on Authenticator and other apps that, I mean, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and I will vouch for this because I am always trying different phones.  If you know what you're doing, it's very easy to set up a phone in such a way that  in an hour or two overnight, your new phone could duplicate.  Well, I don't have to spend that time, but I mean, you copy, it copies over very quickly.  And you use like Authy, which is an account-based authenticator.  So it has all of your authentication.  It's not so hard to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the biggest complaint.  How do I move my Authenticator stuff all over without having to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Start using Authy, A-U-T-H-Y, which is exactly the same as Google Authenticator.  With one exception, you have an account and it stores your authentication information  in an encrypted fashion on their servers.  They can't see it, only you can see it.  It's trust, no one encryption.  But that means when you set up a new phone, you put Authy on it.  You can have it download all of your authentications.  And then you want to encrypt them and you're good to go.  And that's what I do now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, that could save me time.  Oh, it's huge.  Because that's the biggest thing when I'm like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I do that.  I save my desktop layout, which is also complex, a lot of widgets and stuff.  But I use Action Launcher with Novel Launcher.  A lot of launchers will do this.  We'll let you save your layout, not just to the phone, but I save it to Google Drive.  So when I get a new phone, you log into your Google account, you say,  download all my apps.  It downloads all your apps.  Then I download the layout and that's immediately applied.  And I'm pretty much good to go.  The only thing that takes time is logging into my accounts  because your passwords aren't preserved for good reason.  But if you use LastPass or some sort of password manager that fills in the logins,  it's pretty quick to get everything up to speed.  I can get a phone up to speed pretty quick.  What takes the longest time is downloading all the stuff.  So I do that while I'm sleeping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But at least you don't have to do it anymore.  I know. Yeah.  It's much easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is. It works well.  Yeah. And you could do that with an iPhone by backing up the iPhone and restoring it.  So...  Ah, pah. Pah.  Pah.  You're all going to want an iPhone.  I'm telling you, the more I think about it, the more this new iPhone  is going to be a game changer.  Oh, you want to know why I think that?  Yes, I do.  Number one, camera.  Not just for augmented reality.  I think that's going to be interesting, but not something you're going to have to have.  Right?  That's going to be kind of interesting.  But the camera itself, I think the computational photography it's going to be capable of,  partly because of these new sensors it needs for AR,  is going to be a truly remarkable camera.  I'm hoping.  We've seen already evidence...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Vic D'Andotra is just going to die.  Yeah, Vic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But we've also seen other evidence that the camera is going to have some interesting new  capabilities.  For instance, we talked about this on MacBreak Weekly yesterday.  It's going to store...  It's going to use a new format, a high efficiency format, instead of JPEG.  JPEG, as you probably know, when you take a picture,  you are...  It makes decisions about what that picture should...  How it should be rendered, and then it's done.  It's fixed.  The new high efficiency format stores all the raw data,  all the focal length, focal plane data, stores much more data about that image in this image,  so that you can kind of change focal points.  You can do all sorts of stuff with this image that you can't do with a JPEG.  That's going to be huge.  This is an ISO standard, but it's going to be the first phone to implement it.  And the camera, you know, boffins on...  MacBreak Weekly are very excited about it.  HEIF, High Efficiency Image File Format.  So that's one.  Camera, very exciting.  Two, the screen is going to be OLED.  Now, that's a catch up for a lot of other phones,  but I think it will be as good as the Samsung Galaxy S8,  which is a very, very good screen.  Edge to edge display.  I think the end of the bezels is good.  And I'm very interested in how they...  It appears that they're going to get rid of the fingerprint reader  and just go with face recognition.  And knowing Apple, it won't be like the face recognition  that we currently get on, say, the S8,  which is a little slow and cumbersome.  You have to position yourself and so forth.  It will... I will be shocked if it doesn't, and maybe it won't,  but my prediction is it'll work even if the phone's lying flat.  So it'll be able to see at all angles.  And again, this, I think, comes down to better camera technology,  partly to support AR.  And so it will just unlock.  In your presence, it will unlock.  You don't like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm wondering if that's actually true.  In your presence, that feels like a big...  Well, not if it's over here,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but as soon as you are close enough to use it, it will unlock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think, and I don't know this for sure,  but Qualcomm's got a sensor that is very power efficient,  that is a...  It can recognize, hey, this is a face.  It cannot do the type of intense facial recognition,  high quality facial recognition you need for security purposes.  But what I think they're going to do is implement that sensor,  since Qualcomm told me a major phone manufacturer was going to use it.  They're going to have a sensor like that that says,  oh my God, it's a face nearby.  And then they're going to wake up the battery sucking 3D sensing technology.  But it's not going to be...  Your phone's still going to have to be able to see enough of your face  to get the angles that it needs to shoot the light, to get the angles that it needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If that's the case, it's going to be a problem.  Because right now Apple and same with the Pixel,  the unlocking is so straightforward and transparent and instant  that it's not a burden.  But I could tell you the face recognition I've used on every other camera is burdensome.  You have to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this will be faster because that tiny face recognition thing,  as you're picking up the phone, it's going to be like...  And it won't be...  So that one would be spoofed by a copy,  but the 3D sensors are not spoofed by a copy because what they're measuring  isn't your actual face.  Well, someone in the chat was saying that.  So I just wanted to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just saying that from a marketing point of view,  if you have to do this every time you want to unlock your phone,  I'm holding it up in front of my face, that's going to end up being a non-starter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you're going to have to look down at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, it would be interesting to see.  I can imagine a camera that has enough wide enough angle  that it can pick up your face.  Look, if you use my Sony camera and you say lock on faces,  you can move...  It actually does lock on eye.  You can move around in all sorts of configuration  and that lock, focus lock, stays right on you.  It does not lose focus.  So I don't think that that's impossible.  Well, they're Apple implemented is unknown.  I don't have any inside information on that.  No one does, except Gene Munster.  I did get sent...  I guess I can show this.  I did get sent a dummy, I think it was a dummy, of the phone  by a well-known...  Let me make it big so you can't see the name.  Leaker.  So this is...  He says this is a dummy of what the actual new iPhone will look like.  That is a lightning connector.  No headphone jack.  But the most interesting thing on this was the camera,  which is stacked instead of side by side sensors.  The camera lens...  I don't know if I can get it in a good position.  Is stacked on the...  See, it's vertical, not horizontal.  And it could be a complete bogus fake.  You never know.  Another thing T-Mobile did...  You're going to like this, Jeff.  I like it.  We get a discount if we're over 55.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, what?  Ageism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We get $10 off the everything plan if we're over 55.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's because we won't be switching very long because we're old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and because you're not probably using a lot of data  because you're not watching those darn YouTube videos on the cellular network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those kids with their internets.  It's unlimited 55 plus two lines for $60 a month.  Actually, that's a bigger discount than I thought.  So the next time you say, hey, you're old,  I'm going to say, yeah, but I get T-Mobile for $60.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Please, if I try to be a surfer dude...  Look at this guy.  Just shoot me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Andy Warhol surfing.  So I have to call him and say, hey, can I get this deal?  Because that would save me a lot of money.  John Ledger is 59.  He says, well, no.  But you know what it really is, I think,  is that T-Mobile does not do well with people of a certain age.  That's kind of a kid's...  Because of the magenta and everything, it's kind of a kid's network.  And they want to get...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought it was because it wasn't reliable.  And kids can pay for cheap, unreliable service, but adults...  I beg your pardon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  T-Mobile is fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  T-Mobile does not work where I live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's because you live in Texas.  Yeah, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So does a lot of other people.  So do a lot of other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's your defense?  That's the problem.  There's too many people using the phone.  There weren't so many people using the phone.  No, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  T-Mobile really is dependent.  It's very much dependent on where you live.  I use actually Google Fi on this phone.  And that's nice because I get Sprint, T-Mobile, US Cellular.  All of that.  That's where they become the same.  So another data point confirming my contention that Mark Zuckerberg  wants to be president of this here United States.  He has hired...  Wait a minute, this isn't the article.  He has hired Hillary Clinton's...  They say pollster, but he was also chairman of her campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I also know him.  He also advises lots of corporations.  His company is more than politics.  He advises corporations on strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're talking about Joel Benenson, a democratic pollster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Joel's a former reporter of the Daily News where I knew him.  Oh, I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Top advisor to Obama, chief strategist during...  Actually, that's not really a good thing on your resume.  Chief strategist for Hillary Clinton's campaign.  Maybe that's a mark against you.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you didn't have a lot of control of Comey, but we'll go there.  Yeah, he advises lots of corporations.  He's advising the foundation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's a smoke screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My favorite tweet of the week besides mansplaining, manspreading,  was when somebody just said,  so Zuckerberg's not running for president after all,  above a link to the automatic sound coming on on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's driving me crazy.  I woke Lisa up last night.  It's like all this noise is coming out of my phone.  I said, I can't stop it.  I can't stop it.  It's Facebook.  That is the most...  Why did they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, what is it that they're doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, now they play video automatically.  They just turn on audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you're scrolling through your Facebook at night because you can't sleep.  And all of a sudden a video comes on and so does blaring noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not popular.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why I don't surf Facebook at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Probably a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey doesn't watch television.  I wake up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do watch television.  I just don't.  She's perfect.  We're just scummy men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I meditate and do yoga.  Oh, shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, shush.  You have your green tea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I hate green tea.  That's terrible.  Oh, good.  So there you go.  And I'm not a vegan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Instagram.  You live in Austin, the capital of barbecue.  It's against the law there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do have a lot of vegans in Austin, surprising me.  Oh, I'm not surprised.  No, yeah.  Yeah, me either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's vegans everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're even more miserable because they can smell the barbecue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For a while, our city council was looking at doing,  I guess it's a law or rule or an ordinance about barbecue places had to install scrubbers  because the smell was bothering some people, which I thought was absolutely hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did go with a friend who was Hindu some years ago, South by Southwest,  and we're trying to find, of course, always a place to eat once in a while.  We walk into Fogo do Chão, which is a Brazilian.  That was nothing but meat, meat on swords.  They just bring meat and meat and more meat.  He just said the smell alone.  I just can't do it.  I just can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of good places that have lovely vegetarian food,  but that is not one of them.  They have a salad bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Instagram has now, and I think we should do this, Jeff.  I should Instagram, go live, and then you could join me.  We can have a two-person Instagram live thing.  I'm not, this must be, this is another, no, I'm not your friend.  I'm, no, I, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, why didn't you invite me to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I would, except you probably think I was hitting on you or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that was low and uncalled for, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right, you're right.  I don't actually know how to do it.  How do we do it?  How do you go live?  Are you Mr. Laporte?  Yes, Mr. Underscore Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So now I got to follow you.  I'm following.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do you go live?  Oh, that turned on the flash.  I'm like, oh, we don't know how to do this.  The phone is peeking to me now.  Well, that's not it, obviously.  Camera.  Okay, tap for photos.  One of these obscure buttons must be live, right?  Oh, there it is.  I just swipe, I swipe, start live video.  Okay, I'm live on Instagram.  Where do I go?  Just go to the camera and it's on the left.  It's just not, it's not immediately, obviously.  There's some text.  I'm now live.  Okay.  Now, how do we add somebody?  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Start live video.  Okay, I'm live too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, we're telling your followers that you started a live video.  Turn off commenting.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So nobody's actually watching this.  All these people are watching me all of a sudden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So how do I join Leo?  So we're doing an experiment on this week in Google.  Now, how do I, they said they're rolling it out.  Let me look at the article.  Oh, see, I don't have the double friend icon.  You need a double friend icon in there.  Do you have a, so that's the problem.  This is the most boring.  Hey, Rusty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, Ryan.  I'm on Twig right now with Leo Laporte.  We were trying to do a joint video.  Do you have this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you have the little two head thing like that?  No, I don't have that.  I don't have that either.  So we can't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can we call this show two old guys on Instagram?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wallace and.  That was me.  You know what?  You know what, Stacey?  You're an ageist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am an ageist on this one, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do I do now?  There's all these people watching me.  I have 130 people watching.  Hi guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm actually not doing anything interesting.  I'm just on a podcast.  You can go to, you can go to twig.tv slash twig.  And watch what we're doing for reals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll show them that.  Look at that.  145 people.  Hi from Australia, Tennessee, from London, Ireland calling.  Well, this is fun.  I should do this more except what would you want to?  I mean, I did this all day.  Did we do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do short little snippets in that location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is supposed to be a short little snippet.  So we're just trying to see how to turn on.  Now Instagram has this capability of, I'm going to flip my camera around.  So you can see it.  So it has this capability.  Of doing two people, but I don't have that.  I don't have that icon.  So we just wasted everybody's time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what we do on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  San Diego, Burbank, Carolina, Carolina.  Sydney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just got hello from Sydney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Al Ajahn Minam is in Chicago.  Where's the best piece in Chicago?  Hi Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey said hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, David says make America great again.  Right on.  Who couldn't agree with that?  St. Louis, Chi town.  Oh, you download the icon.  It says download the icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Download the icon.  How do you download the icon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Somebody in the Instagram says you can download the icon.  To start with.  Okay.  Go live toggle over from normal.  Then tap the new faces icon that appears in the bottom right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you don't have the new faces icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we haven't got it yet.  All right.  I'm going to have to stop.  All right.  Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was that the stupidest thing you've ever participated in?  Stacey was completely appalled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did not participate.  I want it known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You were jealous that he asked me.  First.  You're right.  You're right.  First.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  First.  I was like, I wasn't jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, you were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's my fault.  I didn't update my Instagram.  I'm updating it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, this is what Kevin and I do.  We just do it before the show.  I was going to ask you.  Yeah.  We investigate all kinds of things, but we don't do it live in the air because we're  not as comfortable as professionals and we're amateurs.  No, no.  Oh, that's right.  Jeff, you're not a journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not a journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was the first thing you said, Stacey.  All right.  I'm starting the live start live video.  Did you get it?  I've updated it.  Well, let's see.  I'm checking to see.  Nope.  Still not there.  It's one of those things where they're rolling it out at stage probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder sometimes if we're not on the do not update list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe.  They said they're adding it today.  So I mean, you know.  All right.  What else?  Is there anything else?  Multi-room audio to echo speakers.  That'll be the nail in the coffin for Sonos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Man, yes, because I've been waiting for my...  I mean, I complain about this this morning on my podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I feel like I've wasted a lot of money on Sonos now because  Amazon is reportedly going to add the exact capability that Sonos has.  It makes Sonos unique.  The multi-room audio.  And if you have dots, you can have better speakers.  You can have them in every room.  This is awesome.  You'll be able to put your Alexa speakers into groups.  So you don't have to just do party mode.  You can send it to individual groups.  I have so many dots lying around the house.  Amazon.  Did you see all the secret brands?  This is actually we're going to do a public service announcement here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's it.  Yeah, that was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Amazon has been busy trademarking brands.  Quartz.  Some very, very good, I think, reporting Mike Murphy at Quartz.  Quartz is great.  Quartz is wonderful.  He went through.  He trawled through the US Patent and Trademark Database to find 19 brands owned by Amazon.  So he must have cross-referenced it.  So if you buy Arabella lingerie.  Happy Belly.  Happy Belly.  That's food.  You're buying it direct from Amazon.  It's not a separate seller.  It's a house brand.  It's a house brand.  Beauty.  Because I've bought pins on sheets.  They've had those for some time.  And they even say pins on by Amazon.  So you know you're getting Amazon sheets.  I don't buy them anymore because they weren't very good.  Beauty Bar.  Denali.  Franklin and Freeman.  Happy Belly.  James and Erin.  Women's clothing.  Lark and Row women's clothing.  May underwear.  Mama Bear baby products.  My Habit consumer goods.  North 11.  NuPro.  Pike Street.  Pins on.  Scout and Row kids clothing.  That's funny.  Lark and Row women's clothing and Scout and Row kids clothing.  Single cow burger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a weird brand.  It's not really an appetizing brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Small Parts.  Smart is Beautiful.  And Strathwood.  I've seen Strathwood.  There are other trademarks that Amazon owns but don't currently have products.  But I presume the plan is to do so.  Bloom Street.  Concrete New York which is for leather goods.  Familyhood.  I know what you're thinking, Jeff.  Knock it off.  Find.  GT Prime.  Instant Pretty.  RV Me.  You can buy motor homes on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Single frozen food for sad lonely single people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like the idea that the UPS guy has to deliver your RV to your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  State Creek and Sweaterman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll be the Amazon guy.  Don't worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  Good Threads.  The Fix.  Coastal Blue.  Ella Moon.  Ocean Blues.  Paris Sunday.  Preston.  Who do you think there's like a whole department coming up with names?  And that there's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, these are consultants.  I've gone through this with companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I feel like there's a lot of thinking that goes into why you would,  for instance, name a cleaning product, presto!  With an exclamation mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Landor Associates is in San Francisco.  Yeah, I know Landor.  Yeah.  Yeah, Walter Landor.  Yeah.  And you pay them a fortune to come up with names.  It's very expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they are house brands and there's quite a few of them.  Why do you think they do that?  What's the goal there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you could have a much higher margin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, higher margin consumers will buy it.  Amazon brand stuff is quote basic at the moment.  So you can make a brand look better.  Yeah.  You can also...  If someone hates Amazon, I don't know why they'd be shopping on there, but you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Quartz asked a quote direct economy expert, Mark DeMassimo.  He's at a New York based advertising agency.  He said, there's a logic to this.  The Amazon brand name can only stretch so far.  Quote, can you imagine anyone ever saying, oh Lord, this Amazon personal lubricant is just so sexy.  There are limits to the Amazon brand that Amazon would be wise not to cross.  That makes sense.  That actually makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remind my dear departed father-in-law, he got a suit one day.  He was very proud of the suit and it was pricey.  It was great price and he got it from Macy's.  He said, look, it's an Alfani.  I never had the heart to tell him that was the Macy's house brand.  But it worked, right?  I know.  It sounds Italian.  Yeah, nice Italian suit.  It's an Alfani.  So I ran a recent, we brought in the top people in commerce in media like Gizmodo and  Perch and other places for community practice that I organized at CUNY.  We organized for our center.  And what was fascinating about it was that the consumer behavior now.  So these are media companies that put up commerce.  They want to sell almost anything to you.  And yeah, they start with Amazon links, but then they want to go off and make their own  deals, better deals, right?  Because Amazon affiliate money gets worse and it's not that great.  Consumer behavior is they want to buy at Amazon.  You are, if you do in commerce, are stuck with Amazon the way that the rest of us in  advertising are stuck with Google the way the rest of the world in social is stuck with Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the future.  We're going to be owned by just a few big giant multinationals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's fine with me.  I'm perfectly okay with it.  I don't, I love the change.  I have no  Embrace it, Jeff.  Past.  Embrace it.  I am embracing it.  I for one admire our new masters.  I am fine with the disruption.  Disruption is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Keep saying that.  Is that your, this is our mantra.  Disruption is good.  Disruption is good.  I'll have some green tea now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not ashamed to be too old men try to go on Instagram.  It's okay.  I, I, I embrace the change.  I want, I want to get ahead of the chain.  You sounded like Stuart Smalley now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could, I'm like, embrace the disruption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  Let's embrace the end of this show.  We have, we've gassed on long, quite long enough.  Stacey, you got a pick of any kind for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do.  Today's pick is.  The B Mighty Player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know this.  This is.  This is weird.  Yes.  It's not weird.  It's awesome.  This is something I've been wanting,  which is basically an iPod shuffle for Spotify.  I didn't understand what this was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I thought it was a speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nope.  Nope.  Not a speaker.  So this, it works with wired or wireless headset.  And basically I was looking for a way to have Spotify on my,  when I walk the dog in the morning or when I run without having to carry my phone with me.  Cause I hate carrying my phone.  Yeah.  And I don't have an Apple watch.  And that was discontinued to Nano.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there's a real opportunity here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, and yeah, plus the Nano, you know, you had to like load it into iTunes and iTunes is awful.  So does it download the music?  It downloads, you select playlists on Spotify.  And you have to have a Spotify account to use this.  It's $95.  And you, it loads it over wifi.  In your house.  And then basically you click this button here at the top and you go skip through your playlists.  So if you want to listen to like a specific album,  you're going to have to make a playlist for that album to put it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's no display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  There's no display.  So it's not, you know, it's, it may be a little clunky, but it's not random.  You can actually get to songs you want.  If you've, you just click this.  This is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple discontinued the shuffle because they figured people wanted Spotify.  And I think Apple's play is we'll just do it on your watch.  You'll be able to stream Spotify on your watch.  This is a, this is maybe what Apple should have done with the Nano.  This is very smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I, I thought this, I mean, cause like, I, I'm already in Spotify and I don't want to carry my phone.  So the fact that Spotify one, I didn't, I had been looking at this for a long time.  Do you have to have premium Spotify premium?  You do have to have the paid version.  You don't have to have the fancy plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah.  And then every 30 days, you're going to have to click it to your account.  You'll have to open, you know, have them connect to your phone and be like,  I'm still legit on Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love it.  Be mighty.com.  And of course nowadays we don't really ask about the sound quality or anything like that.  It's good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's good enough for running.  I mean, it's five, it's five hours of playback.  The one gripe I have is the clip on the back.  Hello clip.  I want a smaller clip.  It feels a little clunky, but that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tonya Apple should have done this for Apple music.  That's what this, that, that I wonder if they'd even considered that interesting.  Jeff Jarvis, a number from you, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this will probably peeve you.  That's why I'm doing it.  Okay.  There is a now here.  This is a three day podcast festival at the Javits center in New York.
