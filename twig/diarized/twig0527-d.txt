Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He has so many people that love looking at his photos on Instagram that I'd started a Google Photos album for norm. It's public and  People seem to like it. They're subscribing they're putting it on their own Google Nest hubs  I guess I don't know. What else really cool. It's kind of like are you going to get norm a an Amazon dog collar?  No, he actually doesn't wear a collar at all  He did when he was younger, but he doesn't care for those

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I feel for Stacey's dog Stacey's dog is sure to be the first dog with an Amazon IOT dog collar

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah GPS tracker and oh, yeah  That dog and the IOT world

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's lost all its privacy. So Kevin when people say oh you're doing norm. How do I get norm?  How do I how do I do norm? Oh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a link you got it there maybe we can put in the show notes or something, but you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a long ass link. You want me to give that out?  Well, I'd make it  There's gotta be maybe I don't know. There's I don't know there seems like there's there's a share link there maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We don't have Google Plus. I know wouldn't it be easier nice create link

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it's kind of a long link photos dot app. I go dot goal. I will ask norm to shorten his link

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  link norm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sean your link actually  Can people add photos to this or is it a norm only I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Believe I set it up. They can only view and leave comments. I don't think they can add this is new to me this activity bar

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is something photos added recently where you can see people's comments  This really does become good in a way your very own Google Plus doesn't it? Yeah, right, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I respond to people and you know  We have a good time bantering about Norman is silly photos really like you can see in that you can see in the top  Row of photos there. We are working on a mattress  sponsorship  Casper norm oh he's not picky. He'll he'll sleep on anything  But if he's gonna get paid, you know, that's fine norm is a go Casper sure such a ham  He is he's sleeping most of the time. So there's his buddy Gus and I had a babysit Gus people thought I was another norm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gus and norm. Yep, that's so cute. So I don't know if you got the idea from but we've mentioned Mike  Elgin's nice book and this is Mike's response to the loss of Google Plus and the kind of the  the pit pit of despair that has become Facebook so he  Does exactly the same thing where he shares pictures from his life?  So it's his kind of Facebook feed. I guess we should probably do a twit  Thing huh? We have lots of pictures. We got a bunch of photographers now between that and Instagram. We'll have it  See, I don't I don't want to support Instagram. I really don't I haven't I created Instagram  Hey cuz I every ninth picture I buy something which I really don't like  See  No, it's mine  It's no effect in a way. They've done too good a job  But I do have to say that if so I have an Instagram account, but it's private  Nobody can follow me. I only follow one person my wife because she posts pictures on Instagram that  Apparently I should see  So but I do notice if you only follow one person on Instagram you don't get ads  What like I don't know why but there's not maybe there's not enough pictures or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They figure you are a a anti-social paranoid schizophrenic insane  Loaner and you're not worth advertising to you. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely, right? That's why so why don't you guys just do a shared Google photo album? There's no ads ever there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you know, that's what I'm saying. That's the whole idea right is do this instead of Instagram  Yeah, I'm gonna do that  And we maybe make a twit one and if we do we'll let you know and that could go with our other  We're trying another thing and I'll talk more about that in the weeks to come  Which is a forum site that we're gonna start working on and set up. That's gonna be fun people could participate  Well, you know what happened? I got a great email  from a guy who said  The problem with the chat, which of course is our primary community interface because it's live so it's interactive while we're live  You have to watch live, right?  And if you don't watch live the chat is meaningless because it's scrolled off. There's no history quickly  So and it's so it kind of tends to a small group of people who are there every day  But it is in a way that everybody could participate. So I think we I think he made a very good point  I think we need a way that everybody can participate in our shows

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we've had forms before but they're a lot of work and I just there a lot of work. I got lazy again  The chat room no disrespect. It is really really niche down that you go out in the wild and say IRC to people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're like what yeah, you know, but I but I think anybody who watches our show should be able to get to it, right  We're setting a bar, right? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wonder if you guys could use that new feature that lets you just get snippets of YouTube videos. Yes  Certain sections and that's like in the forum and that way people can respond to that great idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, this is why I think a forum is an opportunity to do some really interesting stuff great. I like forums

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like forums. I that's we set them up. That was one of the first things I did when I set up  The local news sites that worked on was to have forums. It seems so 90s

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's something to be said for it and that's actually it make I think they may come back again as people tire of  Facebook and Twitter and Instagram these big tick-tock these global  Phenomenon, maybe they want something that is more about the community. They're a part of you know  Why shouldn't a city have its own forum or not a podcast network or software?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  hyperlocal something like in I think  What is it?  South orange maple wood like maple wood

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The the hyper local site is still a forum. Yes. Yeah, I think that's interesting patch still is around  Petaluma  well, but  We have a Petaluma patch and it's active and people write articles for and post to it  I don't what who was patch what happened to them patch was the former president of AOL

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Help help me help me help me help me  Former former head of revenue at Google who then went to  Oh hell  Well, this is embarrassing  former head of  AOL it's in he sold he sold the company to Verizon owned by hail global now  Well, no, okay, so he  Chat room help me Warren St. John memory Warren. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  No, it's a bigger guy. You know who I'm talking about. He sold AOL to Verizon Warren Webster. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm gonna keep throwing Warren's at you. Oh  Killing me Tim Armstrong. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Strong, yes, so Tim Armstrong before he  When it was taking over AOL  He started Pat. No, I'm sorry before you did well he started patch just as a passion he'd left Google  Head of revenue there Wikipedia

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There wasn't enough information about his hometown of Riverside, Connecticut

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. So he did it. He tried to bring me into advise but I was  Not appreciative of their plan to not cooperate with local bloggers that existed instead to kill them  So I said that wasn't very nice and I feared that they were gonna they had a whole formula for what towns to go into  And I figured it was gonna redline, you know local journalism around rich towns that had downtowns  Well, what's interesting is our local paper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The pedal of Argus courier is in some way affiliated with patch so they've made made nice. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So so so when he went so  They started the model. They thought they knew everything  They didn't really get the model down they like advertisers were being charged a very high rate for very low return  It wasn't working as well as they thought but then they went ahead and multiplied times 900  They were 900 towns across the country and now it was too hard to fix the problems they had  They didn't get the bottle down and so really didn't work all that. Well, so then AOL he  When he took over AOL, he incorporated it into AOL, but it was controversial there  It didn't work very well feeling was it was a conflict and so then  He sold it off. That's how it ended with the current owner and the current owner  Yeah, it still exists and I still find out things from it, but it's a much cheaper operation shall we say look at ours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is Petaluma's patch. I've never heard of this and I'm fast 70,000 visits in the last 30 days

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's probably more than the Argus couriers circulation  There are lots of stories here by people who don't honestly probably get paid  But  People are doing it. There's calendars of events. I don't know who's putting the energy into this, but it's really great

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have some staff. They have some staff  They have they've limited staff that do we writes and stuff like that if you want to find a local model  It's really working. There's a company called village media and a headquartered in Sault Ste. Marie  In Canada and they have they've really succeeded in going into towns like that  70,000 people thereabouts and have local news. I got him Jeff LG runs it Google loves them and  So that's gonna be the basis software for Google funded night ridder to start three local experiments. They're also this idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like reading grit a little bit, you know, you know, and in fact if you go to patch.com, which is the over  Global site and you can enter in your zip code or your town  But you can also read today's top local news from Swampscott, Massachusetts  Comes this one Amazon driver fired after trashing dozens of undelivered packages from Des Moines, Iowa  Iowans beer fundraiser for six kids goes flat over old tweets from Miami, Florida  Hey echo, I need a job in a Big Mac  From Tribeca Phi Dai, New York see the big city get involved Mets stolen coffin is going back to Egypt. I just feel like  Across America's good. This is great. This is much more interesting than what we're reading about in our national papers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is well and here's mine in bed and in Bridgewater, New Jersey dog, my cat stuck on roof rescued by Brownbrook police  And you know what it looks like it looks like norm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what's he doing with a cat on the roof are they stepping out what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right now I have one problem with patch as I just checked on the zip code back in my hometown  There's no green. That's the problem. And then I clicked on sports. There's no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Blank page really home of the Clemson Tigers. Really? There's no Clemson Tigers number one team in all the land  Okay patch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay patch  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They need a correspondent Facebook or Amazon today and so we can just talk about oh shut up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, the producer ways in it turns out Amazon announced like 8,000 events and 8,000 products  Including I'm not kidding you a twerking bear  Did you see this? I miss the twerking bear

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Technically the twerking bear was not announced but it was there Jimmy the twerking bear

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Send $10.30  It says on the back of Jimmy the twerking bear. That's my jam  Here's a video of Jimmy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Working Christmas bear or twerking everyday bear. It's time to choose your power source

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I can't work I haven't chosen a power source

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're gonna stick the USB up its rear end. That's why I want to see the twerk. Here comes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I get it so you could set it to twerk when you're tight for 3 p.m. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like the big mouth Billy Bass. It's Amazon echoes voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And when the alarm goes off the putt moves remind me tomorrow at noon to call mom I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can't help but laugh at this the lipsticks pretty good. It's better than it was for Dev Null. Yeah  They also announced that you'll be able to get voices for your Amazon echo including  Samuel L. Jackson, please  Please version or no, they said it may be explicit  MFs  Bear can't wait  99 cents they didn't say whether it was one time only and that's temporary fee, but  Did they Kevin were you able to because this is really up your alley?  I know Stacy's at the event. Were you able to somehow find out what was going on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Honestly, I was in class all afternoon and got back here just in time. However, you were buried in Python  No, no, I've moved on we'll talk about that later if there's time  But no Stacey actually had me right before the show edit her post that covers everything. So that's how I'm figuring out  What's what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so  Like the rumor was 25 new echo products  A high-end there were only 15. Oh a high-end echo studio. Is the Amazon the new echo show 8?  Which I presume is not the eighth edition but eight inches eight inches eight inches dot with a clock  the three and three and one Amazon smart oven  Let's make sure we cover that I wish Stacy were here for that one. Yeah echo buds earphones echo frames  Eyewear with Amazon's echo built in by invitation only. Yeah. Yeah, it's beginning  It's a day one thing for experimental products too bad the twerking bears  A ring not a ring doorbell, which Amazon does own but an actual jewelry ring for your finger. Oh  What does that do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess it has echo in your ring. Hopefully it does and hopefully it does it works well because it's a hundred twenty nine dollars  Another invite only deal. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is really really kind of amazing if I go to Stacey on IOT is her post up. Did you finish it?  It is indeed. Yep. All right. Well, let's go. I'd rather see that than than somebody else's coverage  Everything we care about from the echo event. She's allowed to write the a word, but I can't say the a word  No, can't say it can't say a word. Why did you do that?  Looks like a nice event in Seattle. I'm sure Stacey was happy to be there. Oh, hi Stacey  Amazon's David limp kicked who's David limp

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what a name on primitive earth I don't know kicked off the event focusing on privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They spent ten minutes talking about how they have handled privacy in the past  They do have a physical circuit that turns the microphone on and off. I use that all the time  The privacy zones on the ring doorbell. Okay, that's something the hello does not have and  Echo shows will now have a physical camera shutter, which I think is a really good idea  They also in response to criticism I might add said they're gonna make it easier for people to delete recordings  You could say echo delete everything I said today or everything  I just said there will be a new home mode for camera based devices and security devices  That means they won't record until you leave the house. That's something nest has had for some time. All right  Mm-hmm. The problem is I know you left the house your phone  The Amazon app on your phone you can designate a device whatever you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Designated device whatever you want, but you did then the Amazon always knows where you are, but that's nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and actually I want the cameras on it late at night when I'm home. So  Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm not sure I want to have it, you know, but that makes sense  It's a privacy mode and truthfully the one reason we don't have cameras in the house is because Lisa said no that's not gonna happen  All right, and she's right because she walks around naked all the time  So which doesn't bother me?  I wonder why I'm just joking but it is it is the case  I think people may be sensitive to cameras in the house  We did get that new and I take it you have it because you were just mentioning it Kevin that new nest home max

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Next test hub max. I really like that device. So I did not get one yet. I think Stacy has one on order  So we're kind of living vicariously through other people. She's really interested in the  Personalization as you walk past it's weird. Well, you walk up to turn this on it's on by off by default

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still turn it on and it makes a little boop and it says hi Leo  Because it's because it knows me it shows my calendar shows stuff. I'd be interested in it does a whole slideshow things for me  I  And it's still just like the little baby the best  Picture frame ever because if you use Google Photos, it's totally awesome for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like that idea, but where they store in this data that shows your biometrics. Where is that being kept?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know is because the with Apple's on device only right? So I don't know what

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's not that different than the voice match feature. All right  I mean it recognizes your voices so you can say what's on my calendar and it will show your calendar  That's a good thing. We want that right? Yeah. Well, some people do some people don't I do I like that convenience

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But again, yeah  I have to ask because that's the world we live in today as well as privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also  The case that we have seen more and more devices asking for face recognition  Mm-hmm, for instance my hello doorbell and again, you have to turn it on. This is the Google Nest doorbell  Does face recognition for everybody who comes to the door now?  That's really great because it will notify Michael just got home  All right, because it knows what he looks like or  Somebody I don't know just left a package on your porch. I think that's useful but they also point out  comply with local laws because yeah, there's still caveats with that  Yeah, we're recording people's faces and clearly sending it to the cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, keep in mind that I owe the Google said it's going to take its machine learning models and push them down to the devices  At the edge itself. So at some point if not already it's that data is not gonna go anywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're gonna need to demand that aren't we we're gonna need to say we want that  And if it can do it clearly it has to be able to do it  The echo glow which is gonna really annoy Casper the mattress manufacturer because they have a also a glowing lamp called the glow  Difference about the echo glow is it has Amazon echo built in and it's for kids which is kind of a surprise given Amazon's  Lawsuit about listening to  Children and targeting them with ads  Stk for the echo glow will tie into programs used by schools to manage homework  Are you going to bed Billy? Don't you think you should finish your history homework?  Parents will be able to whitelist users who can call their kids on echo devices. Well, I should hope so  Holy cow and this  Apparently there's an Amazon free time service which will be available on the new echo show  Which and then if you tie in the kids school, you'll actually be able to say hey echo  How did how did they ant do on his math test last yesterday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What?  It's gonna require the schools want to do that. I don't know how many are gonna jump on that bandwagon right away  But yeah, well enough on their parents want it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My kids schools are all tied into power school. Yeah, they like I know  Every pretty much every paper my children every grade on every test they take

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't amazing weird now when they get to an age, I think you know, Zach and Alex are a little young  but when I think when they get to 13 or  At some point then this then the weird thing happens this happened with my kids then they say no  You can't know what they did how they did right? It is 13. Yes  That's so weird is 13. Yeah, it is  You can't know how they did where your their grades are not urine that you have to get their permission  You have to get them so that's happening with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can still know their grades I don't yeah that happened to me in North Carolina before we came here  When our now 16 year old turn 13 turn 13 and I remember having to go in and  And have him sign off on stuff, it's not weird  This is pissed me off. I'm paying my college. I want to know how my kids are doing  Are they taking those classes? I'm paying for and then with my oldest boy the 21 year old  this is before he went into the US Army he went to college and I  Had no access to anything information, but I was fine with that because I was like I'm not paying he's a grownup  Yeah, I was and still I didn't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the echo dot  clock  By the way now that Amazon owns ring and euro there apparently some new ring and euro stuff as well  But that's the clock. I think that's a good idea. That's a nice little digital clock on the side on the fabric side of the echo  There's an echo flex which plugs into the wall  Stacey says it's a device the size of an air freshener has a USB socket on the bottom

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  $25 you could put the echo in this this is yeah, that's the thing if you whoever  Whoever's voice dominates your house  Right, and you've got to have a device in every single room. It's like the old intercom  Yeah, and will Amazon do it or will you know I'm old enough  So to remember what houses had intercoms

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me too. I had to so our 16 year old goes into my office to turn off the light. I said no no no no  Don't touch the switch  Say echo turn off lights  And he it was like non plus the whole thing was what he what what are you talking about?  He's like there's a light so I couldn't figure out. I finally caught him somebody's been going to turn off  I couldn't figure out because then the nothing works like as I have a sensor a motion sensor in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting you get to the point where there'll be no light switches

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing we're in this intermediate state where they're both light switches and voice all right. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, don't touch it  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can't bring myself to do that. So that's the echo flex. I think that's really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kudos Amazon for continuing to make the barrier of entry so easy with that 25.00 price point  And this is just going on for the last couple of years

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  now  Kevin I don't know if you're editing  Did the job or if this I don't sure I understand this sentence  It also opens up an accessory market for the echo and with limp  Showing off a motion detector and a nightlight available for $15 each is with limp a company  So I was actually in a rush. What was the guy? Oh and with limp. That's the guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So with lip showing off that yeah, these are common before the what is the what is the 1499 product in

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it the echo limb motion sensor? Oh, no, that's the guy's name  Yeah, I know I'm kidding

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Motion detection sensor and nightlight. Okay, but no echo built into that I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. It just probably ties in so that way you could say if somebody walks into the room the motions detected

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe turn away. Yeah, I do you I do have a motion detection detector for my hue lights that do that  Which is yeah the echo studio  So this is she says the answer to Sonos and the Google Mac speaker, I love the Google Macs  That thing is so great  It has Google Assistant, but it's a big enough speaker that the sound is very good  I remember it being pretty robust. It's when you went to pick it up. It's heavy  Well, any good speaker is gonna be a little heavy because of the transformer  She says the studio is the size of an ice bucket good old Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's roughly the size of a cocktail shaker

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it has three mid-range speakers positioned on the top two sides one pointing up to the top of the room a tweeter and a  Base at the bottom. This sounds a lot like that new portable Sonos move  It provides a surround loud sound experience in a really tiny package  And is optimized to handle contact formatted for Dolby Atmos. So that's why the up firing speaker  It sounds terrific cost 200 bucks 100 bucks less than the Sonos move  It will also take Amazon Fire TV audio and sound and act like a sound bar  Except she says or maybe you said this it feels like a Kevin Toffle line, except it's a snowed ice bucket  So Eero is being updated there's an Eero Wi-Fi beacon product it's still the same mesh tech  In fact, this is interesting TP link ASUS and Eris are also gonna use Eero's true mesh technology  Now we have a de facto standard even though she points out the Wi-Fi Alliance has its own mesh network standard  Eero seems to be kind of dominating here

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I wish she was here because she and I kind of agree on this the easy mesh standard came out  Maybe a year ago and that was gonna allow interoperability between say you bought an Eero router and you wanted to add some Google  Wi-Fi beacons or access points you could do that if easy mesh was implemented, but that's not what's going on  obviously  Nobody's using it  And if people are glomming on that Eero's proprietary mesh then easy mesh isn't gonna be around I don't think I agree with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There should be an open standard, but Wi-Fi Alliance is not notoriously open  I might add which is why they keep having trouble with their encryption specs web and now  WPA2 because they don't publish those and so crypto experts can't vet them before they implement them  So I don't I it made me good reason why nobody's adopting the Wi-Fi Alliance is a mesh standard  There's a new ring indoor camera ring of course made its name a longtime sponsor on our network for their doorbells  They're gonna build a $60 indoor camera, which still is not as cheap as the wise  But maybe if it ties into echo or maybe I who knows and there will be a  ring alarm retrofit kit  Which will connect to an existing security system hub already in their home  Ring has this alarm system. How what is I don't understand Kevin? What is so so if you have say an older wired

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Security system in your house, and you want to yeah  You want to expand it to have wireless connectivity add new cameras and so on instead of running wires  You would get this retrofit kit to tie it together nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you could take an exit if you spend all the money wiring your home  With an alarm system you can reuse it is there a standard there. How does it tie into the old system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The old systems are actually pretty basic to be honest Jeff  There's not the reason people keep them around is because they have a direct phone line tied to maybe emergency services or a monitoring system  And most of the newer things don't so if you want to keep that service because maybe it gives you peace of mind  You would then do this retrofit so you could add the newer modern sensors and things and still have your tie

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was thinking about the other way you were tying your old system into the new in a way  This is tying your new system into the old right in a sense. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, and again

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is more of that barrier to entry. You know. Yeah, just you got a system in place already. We got you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've got the ring stick-up cam is being updated  9999 100 bucks and it works indoors outdoors or with a solar powered battery so I mean that's  You know ring as soon as the Amazon bottom stopped advertising on our network  But I was all in on the ring. I really like their ring stuff. Here's the smart oven. This is gonna compete with  What Stacy says what you're doing June Oh  250 bucks that's less even than the newest June

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's and it's a it's it's it's a convection oven. It's a microwave. I think it's not a micro

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it is a no. No, no, no, they have a micro. No, this is a regular  Air fryer, right, right any convection oven is an air fryer by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, same. Yeah, this is similar to the June that Stacy and I both have and we bought the first version  that's we paid out the yin-yang for the  $1,500 and now it's down to $600 and I'd be curious to see if she gets a review unit of this because I'm very

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Toaster ovens does a girl need  What does the June do that this doesn't do June is Android based so doesn't have echo it is into it  But you get downloaded recipes all the time you get updates all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It has a camera in it Jeff  so when you put food in it detects what it is and then just  Basically presets all the temperature and time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody explain to me why these are good ideas these smart ovens. I've never  Come on  What was it the smart microwave that that had the ability to pop popcorn for that was dopey but the June you can I can't from

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here. Okay, see who's making toast at my house

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'll preheat mine before I get home so that way when I get home it's already ready  Okay, and to be honest because it's all algorithm based recipes  The food is always consistent, yeah, I mean and it makes very good food

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can say the same every June do your Brussels sprouts thing and it knows what to do  It turns on the convection when it needs to up Royals when it needs to it makes it very simple  Okay, so do you make I mean that's it's ridiculously priced

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Routines for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think you can can you know, you really can't that's weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think you think it would be an open source community?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of it so what if yeah have one of those like subscription services for food and  You go to put that in there what what happens it scans that and assumes it's supposed to be cooked a certain temperature  Yeah, so forth just you can do it manually. You can always do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a regular toaster oven. Okay, so you could do everything you would do with a regular toaster  Okay, but the idea is if you put a chicken breast in there, right?  The camera would say chicken breast, would you like me to cook it?  Okay, and they has a probe which is nice so you can have the internal temperature. So it's  It's it was way overpriced. What is the new price though? It's not 1500 bucks. I see 599 not so  But now this is 250 the Amazon sound and better at 250 250 is what a breville normal Breville breville toaster oven would cost  So if it's a decent toaster oven, that's actually a fair price  Echo Amazon's gonna go into the earbud business  Wireless noise cancelling headphones with Amazon's echo built-in the echo buds. I  Love it though. It'll work with Google or Siri if you've got an  Android or iPhone  That's surprising actually yeah five hours battery life in your ears 20 hours in the case  It's one of those same things the price is aggressive Amazon's being very aggressive in pricing here  130 bucks is about 30 bucks less than the air pods

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They knew exactly what they were doing everything you you've you've tip tap touched on in here. It was just a little bit  Less expensive than a competitor. No, you don't wear glasses aunt. I do wear glasses just not often

Transcript:  Geez Louise. I apologize. I thought for some reason I thought they were still little kids  They are in my heart. I know it goes so fast. I know  Let's take a little break. Perhaps you notice I know you did how sharp I look at my new shirt  Hey shirt. Yes, nice shirt. This is the first shirt I've had that actually fits me in  Years and I got it you won't believe how I got it  it's a tailored shirt made to order for me and  The only thing I had to do to get it measured was take a picture of myself with my smartphone  It works. It's Taylor store  It is amazing  I have now ordered I have a effect shall I show you I got us more  They have all the so first of all when you go to Taylor store comm slash twig, you're really gonna enjoy  the  Process because you get you first you get yourself measured and they and then you do it very quickly. It's very easy  It's so weird. You put the phone on the ground. I should do it  I should show you put the phone on the ground  You should do it because it'd be hard for you to get shirts. I bet it is  This is why I'm so into yeah, I just put the phone on the ground  You stand that gives a frame to stand in and then you it takes a couple of pictures  Oh, okay automatically and that's all you turn sideways. It's like your mug shot  For it's only two pictures, but they're using  machine learning and statistics  To get your measurements and I you know, I can only speak for myself. It was it's perfect. This fits

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Perfectly we have to have this tested on me as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay deal and then and then you go in and the store and you can customize it any way you want  So I got very normal preppy. This is the shirt. We're gonna give you by the way  This is that we got a special on this shirt. Is that nice classic, but you get different buttons  You get a different thread you can get different collar styles. They have spread all kinds of collars  You can get cufflinks styles. You can get button stuff. It goes on and on it's actually  Almost you can you know, if you want to make it easy they have a selection of just like this is it it's done  But if you like to customize look at this, this is I also got this so this is got flamingos on it  I haven't opened it yet. I'm gonna put this on and I'll wear it tomorrow  Spread collar. I think this is really cool. So they have I got a lot of white shirts, but I also maybe you noticed the other day  I was wearing a black shirt. That was also from a tailor store  So this is boutique essentially. Yep, the size colon me app is  Absolutely unique no tape measure no hassle if by the way, this is another thing now Jason Howell did it now remember  He's 18 feet tall  So when the first shirt that they sent him didn't quote wasn't quite right  He said no needs to be longer tail, right?  They said fine. We'll send you another one. Keep that shirt  You don't even send it back if it doesn't fit perfectly  Nice you keep the shirt they sent you donated charity if he really doesn't fit or whatever give it to your buddy and then  They'll send you a new one. So there's no risk at all. Here's the other thing. I think is really important  I want to emphasize this this is a Swedish company. Okay, they make the shirts in Sri Lanka in in a certified  I don't know what the equivalent of  Fair trade is actually I do it's called gotts global organic textile standard they they are certified  With the workers they go there all the time at the workers are well paid well taken care of it's not sweatshot labor  They use organic  fabrics nice  It is absolutely conscious  They told me they got so big that they had they basically took over an entire town in Sri Lanka  Everybody works for Taylor's door and now they've moved into the next town  But these people are getting great jobs  They love Taylor store so you can also buy these shirts knowing they're not being made in this sweatshop somewhere in China  These are made it by a socially conscious company. They I love this. They're also 100% carbon neutral. They actually inspired me  We're gonna make twit 100% carbon neutral. They buy offsets and plant thousands of trees a year  they buy offsets not just for the cost of shipping the  Clothing or making the clothing they buy offsets for the cost of driving to work for every employee they basically  Neutralize their co2 emissions by planting trees. In fact, if you ever want this is another offer  They said if you ever in Sri Lanka, this is for any of you. You want to visit the factory?  You can see how it's made  But I also love this because they email you a picture of your shirt being made as it's being made your shirts are being made  Here's your shirt. It'll be there in a couple of days  I  Used to be getting a made-to-measure shirt was a luxury. I've always wanted one. I never thought I could do it  Taylor store does it and you've it's so nice when your shirt pits fits perfectly look I never could button my collar  I don't know how I knew exactly what my collar size is. I can wear a necktie  Completely comfortably right? This is a first for me. It looks good  With their exclusive trial price  I have kind of buried the lead every new customer gets their first dress shirt starting at  $39 plus free shipping that's half the regular price and  Boy, go check how much a tailored shirt cost is a lot less go to tailor store comm slash twig offer code twig  Free shipping $39 your first shirt you owe it to yourself just to try it  There are lots of beautiful fabrics and patterns all kinds tailor store comm slash twig  You can get the flamingo if you want I can't wait to wear that  Taylor store comm slash twig offer code twig the brand new sponsor terms and conditions apply really great Swedish company long-time  Listeners of twit.

I mean stuff  No, there's more no very important. We're going fetch Amazon fetch  Is it a little dog that gets no it's a collar

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, I wasn't joking the beginning of the show  I was I was asking whether norm was gonna be wearing Amazon fetch is a echo enabled collar

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, it's a pet tracker this uses that new us low low frequency  Wide area network sidewalk. Oh  It's like a little tile it would it would hang off your collar. That looks maybe a little big for norm  I don't know. What do you think? Yeah, that's too big for him. Yeah, he's a little but little guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's a private little beach on anyway  But and he stays inside he stays with you, right? Oh, yeah, and he's on a leash when we take him out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anytime you let a dog go out no Kevin stays with norm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. That's a very true. Yes the other way I live in norms world, but you have a couple of dogs  You let them out. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so I think you know, it's good to have this kind of tank

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So without the mesh does it really work?  so it says here that Amazon handed out 700 devices to employees friends and  Family and had the LA base and completely covered by the network in three weeks. Oh, that's meshing, right? Oh  So oh it's a mesh network

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if there's people nearby that have it that's why they do it with ring as well. I get it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It makes sense. I get it. Yeah, I think it's almost like the tile Bluetooth trackers, which uses crowdsource  Yeah, call it. What's not what if you're the first one with it? Is it worthless? I guess so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, unless it has some Wi-Fi thing or something else built

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't say worthless Jeff because you should if the if your pet is within about half a mile  Well 500 meters so a little more than quarter mile you should still I'm assuming see where they are on the house  They'd still be in range. I see. Yeah, this is intrepid and norm has short legs. He'd never even go 500 meters

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me ask though an ontological question. Do we trust Amazon? I  Think most people do dogs with anything. Look at this  Basically, this is a play to put Amazon within five feet of you no matter where you are  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I trust them  Just as much as I trust Google because of the services that they provide for me in my day to day  Get a lot of value. That is it and I know that I am well  Actually, I'm not the customer  My data is the customer and the product for them and I get it but at the same time they provide a great service in my  Day-to-day life. So yes, actually unlike Google and Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The customer at Google and Facebook is an advertiser  Yes, Amazon makes a lot of money in ads, but really you are the customer at Amazon  Yeah, cuz I'm they're making more and more and more money on ads. Yeah  So do you think okay, so that's the question. I mean if  They if Amazon does all this on your behalf as the customer that's good  If they do it on behalf of an advertiser, is that bad? Oh  I trust them. I trust you see those convincing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just because because you know what because all of the moral panicky  Dystopian people out there are gonna come smashing down on them the first time they do something wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good point. They did didn't they when they people found out that Amazon was listening to recordings and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which was a ridiculous story in and of itself because of course they were and it wasn't a big deal and they didn't know all  Your secrets they were just doing quality assurance, but but fine everybody came  pressing down on them. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, there's a moral panic I  trust them enough because again with the way cookies and everything else where Amazon seems to get  What aunt Pruitt needs to have for day-to-day?  Services whatever, you know, and I don't have to think very hard about it  If I'm if I'm looking for a piece of hardware, what have you for for a camera photo gig?  It already knows what I'm looking for before I start looking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I bought based on habits when I bought this new camera  From B&H right and I bought the lens from B&H I ordered it in July I got it last week  So when it came time to buy another lens for this camera this time I went to Amazon. I got it into one day  So it's hard not to use it exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so so here's a complaint about about all the energy that they use but  Six days ago, so I guess it's within the period of the show  Bezos announced a sustainability plan  and  Just beating his employees to threaten him to walk out because of this  But he says he's gonna drastically reduce carbon emissions with an ultimate goal of being carbon neutral by 2040 and consider how they're mainly  a transportation company

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a big ask. Let me ask you about this because we were just talking about carbon neutral  I have a big vacation coming up that it turns out jet airplanes are  horrible on the environment  But you know, it's worse cruise ships  Lisa oh my god Lisa and I are taking a two-week cruise  I did the carbon calculations on it that two-week cruise for two people uses more  Puts more carbon in the atmosphere than one Englishman for a whole year. I did not know that Wow  So let me ask you so that made me feel terrible  So I went I bought I bought carbon credits now you have to research because there's carbon credits  No, I had one that was recommended like some carbon credits  I had one that was for air travel that was recommended by the Yale School of Environment and Forestry  They really I think knew what they were talking about  So I used that one and then I used I also looked around shopped around and I think I found one that was recommended by the  Washington Post for the cruise and you know, the truth is carbon credits are not expensive  It might be it's less than 1% of the overall cost  But am I a sucker?  Or is this a good thing? Should people do this? Were you guilty?  But but after all I should the better thing to do would be not take the trip take the trip  The sailboat would be for three weeks  God bless her after I saw her speech at the UN. That's when I really started to feel bad  I'm one of those people she said, you know, basically it's how dare you okay. Okay credit

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  do the staterooms have  options for oars like could you paddle no, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  really is I like to travel and  and  Travel is no is notoriously bad unless you're walking or bicycling or sailing or taking a train  and  you know, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably the world's worst when it comes to our environment size shouldn't be asked this question

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We all you know what we all are so good for good for good for Amazon for doing something about it  They're not just buying credits by the way as as this story tells you they ordered a hundred thousand Rivian electric trucks for delivery  What an order, huh? That's amazing. But but that but that tells you they have a real coming

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thanks to the fly this service, you know USPS should have been doing this years ago. Mm-hmm  Those they this perfect for electric use

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's one of the reasons that we drive I drive an electric car right we have solar 60 solar panels on the roof  But honestly the carbon footprint every American has is is devastating the environment  So, I you know somebody says this is actually a great line carbon credits are the papal indulgence of this  Yeah, you're right  But I mean actual trees are being planted actual money is being put

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I imagine you got a recommendation by Yale what they're actually planning is ivy. I've here everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  God bless it. Mr. Jarvis. You said the USPS should have taken this this this  Trucks driving around what about the funding who's gonna pay for that you think the Fed they replace they have to replace them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're they're doing they're coming up to a big contract. Okay to replace all the USPS vehicles  now you're right and it's gonna cost more to get an electric vehicle than it will a  Internal combustion  Vehicles I wonder whether they pay for themselves pretty quickly. It's probably a push

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amazon has that money right here, you know, they can just do it when you start talking about government. I I  Just don't see it happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Swiftly like that. Well not with this president. He's done

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  City the Postal Service has 30  electric two ton vehicles

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  30 and you're also seeing mass of mass transit in some cities being converted New York City just converted  I think what did I see it was a  Public safety NYPD is doing a lot of electric vehicles. So I  Feel like this is a torque on them, too. Oh, yeah. Yeah  You know, there's no reason not to buy an electric car. They are more fun to drive. They're more reliable. They're more economical  I'm amazed gas vehicles have survived as long as they have I have no question in my mind the problem the problem for a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  police department is  The vehicles are probably used 24-hour many of them are used 24 hours. Yeah, you have no charging time  USPS they're they're only used eight hours ten hours a day. They could have plenty of charging time, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So again, am I just buying papal indulgences should I just stay home? Oh  It's a personal choice I feel a little better at least buying carbon credits and knowing that  Trees will be planted. There's a bunch of things projects  People in Kenya are being bought  more efficient  Stoves and generators. I mean there's there's things you can do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Again, I'm the worst person to ask. Yeah, I know I am cuz you barbecue every day. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With history, you know, so just so people know  One of these was good traveler org  For the carbon offset, yeah, that's the that's the one for the the cruise I think that I got  And then the other one I should I should give you both of these in case you want to do this  And then the for the airplane, I can't remember what it was off to find it for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If for a second, I thought you were gonna say that the carbon offset cost more than the cruise tickets

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's cheap. That's the interesting thing. Yeah, papal indulgences were expensive  Or you seen as roughly 1% is that what you said

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, something like that. I mean it was I think was a hundred the total for everything that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're by the way, we're basically flying around the world. Mm-hmm, cuz we're flying from San Francisco  To Munich to Athens. Okay getting on a boat going from Athens to Dubai  That's really not very distant and from Dubai to Hong Kong San Francisco. So we're  Literally flying around the world  Geez literally flying around the world  Carbon credits for that whole flight where it was only a few hundred bucks  I think was 100 200 bucks something like that. The whole thing was 700 bucks something like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so I just put up on the rundown a story from  earlier this year of the USPS testing  vehicles of various types hybrid and electric they're gonna buy a  180,000 new mail truck to answer your question. Okay a total cost of 6.3 billion over five years  Their target is 25,000 to 35,000 dollars per truck  That's fair, but there is a chance now to make you know, make an impact. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the good traveler I'm wrong. The good traveler  So next one is for airlines  And this one is fairly inexpensive you you could put in the and by the way you tell them  You tell them so for every thousand miles of flying. It's two bucks  Okay, or 400 miles of driving so it's not bad and you tell them what your local airport is and they and they try to do  Projects near your local airport, which is good. Yeah  So, you know, I think that there's it's kind of interesting the good this is the one that the forestry school  Recommended and then I'll find the other one because this this is just for air travel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, it's pretty neat having a local connection to makes me feel better that I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope it makes the world a better place

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if things were right with the world, you should get a tax deduction for carbon credits to give more incentive  There should be more rewards and incentives besides. Yeah. Yes, it should be sufficient just to make up for what you're doing  But there could be policy decisions here that would affect how everyone operates. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis, I will say I did not  Consider 25 to 35 K. I thought it would have been a little bit higher than that  I would have to durability that those vehicles have to have to go is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $30,000 that's a great vehicle. That's a great vehicle  Now that's expensive for what would normally be maybe an $18,000 car because the batteries are expensive, you know  But it's gonna save us a lot of money in gas. It's gonna save us a lot of money in maintenance

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's 30 grand for a passenger vehicle a four-door passenger  Think about a truck a mail route and what it has to deal with just those are really simple

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those mail trucks look a lot like a Chevy both  Yeah, the only thing is the steering wheels on the right but other than that there's nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Come to the left. I know those I know those country roads back home can beat up a car. Yeah, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no rosewood dashboard and these things

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'm just thinking from a maintenance standpoint  I would have assumed they would be a little more expensive just to well the suspension and stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy those engines electric engines are basically maintenance free. That's amazing  If you look at the difference to a gas vehicle, which is so complex  Mm-hmm, and you have a transmission you have a lot of other things. There's no transmission in electric vehicle  Right. So yeah, I think maybe it's a yeah, it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What I was gonna say I've had two Chevy volts not the pre pre bolt obviously the  Vultures and I would take it in  You know every six to twelve months and they maybe do an oil change rotate the tires that's it there's nothing to do  That's any reason they had to do the oil changes because the generator is what powers the battery when you're you know when you're  Added battery juice. So right there's nothing there's nothing to them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's my question since I live in an area that gets snow and I live on a very very steep driveway  For that alone I have to have four-wheel drive does the torque of the electric car solve that or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, well many of them are four-wheel drive. Mm-hmm. My Tesla was you have an engine in the front engine and back all four wheels are active

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice, I don't think I'm a difference the big issue  Of course in the cold is that lithium ion batteries batters really like to be in a very narrow range  But almost all these vehicles now will have heaters for the battery and and coolant for the batteries  They heat up when you're charging them. So yeah, that's part of keeping the battery  Reliable and long-lasting, you know, I don't know. I don't know, you know, it's a heart. This is hard  But it feel like if everybody's got to do a little something we all got to do a little something

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you could buy simpler computers like Chromebooks  Absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's talk about the new  What's it called?  Rumored should this be I guess it's not changed long till it's here, right?  Yeah, right. No, this is not change. Well, there's a bigger story than that Leo Leo Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Change log is just little tiny  Hicks we have the expert of all experts go here to talk about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we should go to big story. We should go to about Chromebooks calm and read all about it, right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, at least this where I tell us about it. Mr. T

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So do we know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we don't I wouldn't say we know anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just wrote an article of your thoughts about the leaks which I think is yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We have leaks from nine to five Google and kudos to them  They they claim to have good sourcing and I have a lot of data that backs up what they've said and I have no data  To dispute what they've said, so I'm gonna go with assuming. This is what Google will announce on October 15th  The  Image that they presented is the same image that I presented back in May. I mean I saw this device and I  Jeff I don't think you're gonna be happy. I almost want to not talk about I almost want to start by saying what Jeff  Do you want in the next pixel book? I'm kind of curious. I want the same one. I have just newer

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  NLT, right? I'd like an LTE, right? And I didn't think I'd be using the  What do you call it? You know roll around design?  All-around design to and we call it on tablet mode. Yeah, I didn't think I use it on when I travel using up carbon on planes  I watch movies you need to buy some credits my friend. I'm a traveler calm

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well based on what we what we know Jeff  You won't be doing that on a plane because this is gonna be a clamshell the pixel book go is the name of this  So no no flipping over into tablet mode. No pen support either apparently and that's a  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bought the pen. I've never ever used my pen either. Yeah, that's fine. That's Samsung still sells a Chromebook with pen

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can still go with Sam. Yeah. Yeah my my Acer Chromebook spin 13 has a pen not as good, but it works

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so that's the question pixel books have in the past been the highest priced of all Chromebooks  And highest end and highest end. Oh, yeah, and then this sounds like  Well m3 i5 or i7 this is according to 9 to 5 Google 8 or 16 gigs of RAM that's very high-end  storage options of 64 128 and 256 gigs and  They say emmc based which is is that's the good one right? That's the good sauce  You want SSD not emmc okay, right?  Actually type-c ports, but they're USB of course because Chromebook doesn't support Thunderbolt

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well it shouldn't why not he sees a real standard Thunderbolts Apple crap oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thunderbolt is not Apple crap. It's a it's a standard, and it's actually a great standard. It's on your PC  Mm-hmm on most PCs these days in fact the only people who don't seem to like it very much besides Google  It's oddly enough Microsoft which has refused to put it on its surface devices, but it is really great. It's super fast  It's a supported by Windows Macintosh supports it Linux supports it now, but Chrome OS does not  Not that you need it. I mean storage has never been the sine  qua  Nulltra of of the I don't know what that even means  I'm trying to break it down. I was like it sounds  Known it's a little Latin without which nothing for the the Chrome OS  but  Because you're not doing storage you're supposed to do everything at the cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't store large files often and move them around I guess is probably the more accurate thing to say so  let's let's if we can go back to the processors because  Google has learned from the Celeron debacle of the pixel slate that  People don't want that especially if it's gonna have a 1080p or 4k display  That it's gonna be driving, and that's the options that you're gonna see here according to what we what we know  The processors are the same m3 i5 i7 as  The pixel slate meaning they are the 8th gen Y series chips  Which are low-powered  Not a big upgrade from what you have today Jeff. I hate to say it  It's just a one generation upgrade and to be honest  It's almost a generation behind at this point because we now have ninth and tenth gen  Exactly and the reason and I said this a couple months ago  The reason I did not wait for a pixel slate and drop big money on this a sir Chromebook spin with 16 gig of RAM  Nice is because it uses the u-series Intel processors which can run you  They're more yes, it's less of a mobile device  You need a fan for that which obviously the pixel slate didn't and I don't think the pixel will go will need a fan  But it can run longer hotter it can run longer under load so I can do Android studio on this device I can do all my  IntelliJ my Python my Java everything else  Because it has the next level up processor these processors were available in the pixel slate a year ago if the pixel book ghosts  Leak specs are correct Google could have released this device a year ago. That's what's got me or a crane

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there any evidence that these processors are?  Better battery wise than the 19 is that is that the only reason they would stick around with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know aunt that's a great question. I don't think it has anything to do with battery  I think it has to do with purchasing power gel HP Lenovo  They can get huge bulk discounts on the 9th and 10th gen Intel chips, right?  Google doesn't make a lot of process or computers with processors in them. They don't have that kind of bulk  Pull so it's easier for them to just use the last year's chips save some money  Hopefully not charge us a lot. But the rumor is these will be priced like the pixel slate. I  Just I don't know who these are gonna be for who this pixel will go is for I just don't get it because Leo as  You said it's always been the high-end high-priced model  Now you've got you've got higher priced and high well lower priced higher spec models from Acer Lenovo Dell HP  So where does this fit in? Hmm. I don't I don't see it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why why does Google do Chromebooks? They need to do one to show what can be done. Is it a reference?  Is it the high-end that no one else will make is it for their own staff why I mean clearly there's what's nice this  Year compared to earlier years, perhaps is there's a very nice range of Chromebooks available from 200 bucks  Yes to a wide range  So there so cool doesn't need to prove anything anymore  Right. So why do they make a Chromebook? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think it's all the above. I think it's a little bit of each item  You just mentioned it's to show what can be done. It's to show  Something unique like the Google made by Google Chromebooks have a dedicated assistant button  Whereas none of the others have that that for example, actually that's changing incidentally  But it is it is in fact it changed effectively today because Chrome OS 77 hasn't been announced  But it's showing up on Chromebooks and if you enable it and hit your search a button  The assistant will actually pop up for you, which is fantastic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's still not a dedicated search button. Although it can only be a matter of time before companies start putting those out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean voice button that search there is I I you know  There was a reason for Google to make its own Chromebooks before now  I see less of a reason because of what you just said there are a range of Chromebooks from 200 to thousand dollars  I paid  For this Chromebook, which is far more powerful than what's expected in the pixel book go and probably less less  Less than the cost of the pixel book go so I just don't know I almost feel like  The pixel slate didn't take off the way they hoped and they scaled the next pixel book back and just said let's just get this  Out there. I don't know that for sure. It's just speculation

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But why bother because you say there are good machines. It's just doesn't it doesn't make a lot of sense  So if I don't want a fan  And I'm not doing quite the heavy stuff you're doing but I but I've loved my pixel book that I have  What would you recommend me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Acer well this  Well, I mean I like my Acer. It's not quite as high quality of a display and it does have a fan  So that's that's out for you Jeff. What's the best display out there?  Cuz Lenovo has Lenovo's got the yoga Chromebook c6 30 with a 4k option nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That by the way, and the rumor is this go will also have a 4k option. Yes, it will have an option

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But but that kills battery life I should point out but well those ships push it. Oh, yeah. Yes, because yeah  It's the Intel UHD 620  It's fine the Lenovo with the 4k I've seen it on sale with the U series processor the better processor I think for  619 six six hundred twenty hours. I mean that's that's a sale price the regular price is like  899 but it seems to go on sale like every two weeks Jeff  That is not that it's a 15.4 inch display  So yeah, so that's not like the the go see that's the thing. What's with this go name?  That's the other thing  Maybe this is made maybe more of plastic instead of metal like the pixel book and the go is it's lighter  It's you know, you so maybe that's your thing. I don't I don't know until they announce it but  You know if you want a 4k display and a 13 inch screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't even for him and I love the machine I have now  It's just that it's it's coming to the end of its useful life and I'm gonna have to buy something long in the tea  Is it though? I mean, it's it's acting the screen will sometimes flash black. It's I'm afraid it's gonna die on me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's okay. Okay guys gonna say software update wise. It should be okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The thing Leo's complained about the bezel so the rumors about how big the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Honestly from what we've seen so far it looks very much like a pixel slate screen attached to a keyboard, right?  So and those bezels are okay. They're average. Yeah, they're average. Yeah. Yeah  Well, that's actually a good point and  It I think it's 550 for the mod for the base model with the keyboard, which is ridiculous  I still like that device. I got a bad rap. Yes for good reason when it launched back in November  But software updates have come along and made that thing much much better  that's what I was using for my comps I classes until I got the the  ace well  so  You know if for 550 bucks I'd take the chance that's just me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we were talking about you actually on Windows Weekly because  You are able to use a Chromebook get programming done. Do you use Android studio or what do you use? I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Use Android studio for my own things. I use

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  IntelliJ idea for classwork a range of tools and you do that by turning on Linux on your Chromebook  Oh, yeah. Yep. That's another issue now. I don't know Jeff does not want to turn on Linux, but the Android store probably, right?  Do all modern Chromebooks now support Linux and Android stores is that or because it used to be some hardware didn't some harder didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  correct correct  It Google I oh  Google had said that all new Chromebooks going forward would have Christine II or Linux support  Yes, and Android the Google Play Store has been standard on all new Chromebooks for about two years  Okay, let's say at least since 2015. Do you think the lakes are credible? I?  Do okay I do and and you know what some people are saying maybe go  In fact some some my readers said this and it's very astute of them  The go name could be because it's a lower-end model just like the Android go phones  But what refutes that to me is a 4k display and high-end?  Amounts of storage so I don't know about that  Some people are saying maybe there's a second better one coming out, but I've seen no evidence of that  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I tuned into Windows weekly late was I hearing Paul throughout actually praise Chromebooks

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, he said he uses it for like the second half of his day. He has a whole series at throughout com

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's unfortunately have to be a premium subscriber. I am but he has a whole series on using a Chromebook  It's a great series. It is this really good. Yeah  I a lot of props to Paul because even though he's a window journalist and covers windows  He has always been open  To other stuff and he's he's like us. He's a geek  He doesn't have he doesn't let his biases getting or his is not even biases  He doesn't let his professional all right interest get in the way of his wide-ranging  You know coverage, and I think it's great. I think it's really good. Yeah  Hey  big big deal  Which we'll talk about in just a second Google  Mate no not you Google  understanding  Not that Google the other Google may have made a massive computing breakthrough  We'll talk about it in just a minute  But first a word from our sponsor this episode of this week in Google is brought to you by PayPal credit  Use PayPal credit for any purchases you want to make big or small  You might have a trip you want to take flights car rentals hotels tickets, etc  Or a new computer sound system monitor phone  You've been wanting to buy or for the sneaker heads out there that seems  There's always a new shoe that comes out  You just have to have you can buy what you want today and pay over time with PayPal credit and PayPal credit offers six months special  Financing on purchases of $99 or more some great things about PayPal credit  It's a digital reusable credit line built into your account with PayPal no card needed  It's accepted at millions of online stores where PayPal is accepted  You can use PayPal credit with your existing account with PayPal and checkout is seamless if you don't have an account with PayPal  You can open one for free PayPal credit is great for large expenses or when something unexpected comes up  Applying is easy just to answer a few quick questions and get a credit decision in seconds  Enjoy six months special financing on purchases of $99 or more go to PayPal comm slash  Twit to learn more and apply for PayPal credit minimum monthly payments required subject to credit approval  That's PayPal comm slash twit  quantum

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Supremacy I just love the phrase I for one welcome my new quantum supremacy master for years

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've been talking about quantum computing. I have I admit for years poo-pooed the notion of  a working quantum computer people were up in arms about quantum computing saying we've got to find a new form of  cryptography because a quantum computer will be so much faster than a  Existing von Neumann machine that none of our crypto will work  So Google's been doing some work in secret  NASA which was a partner in this work inadvertently published a paper which they almost immediately unpublished but but before  Too long people were able to get a copy of it. Of course the Google research paper was titled quantum supremacy  Using a programmable superconducting processor quantum supremacy is a term used by  Quantum computing folks. In fact, I'll point you to a really good and completely impenetrable  Blog post by the guy who coined the term Scott Aronson  His it's actually really great  Scott's supreme quantum supremacy FAQ  He talks about what quantum supremacy is but I will attempt in my own way to define it it is essentially a proof  That quantum computing works if a quantum computer can do something  Significantly faster than a Turing machine can do then that's quantum supremacy. And in fact in this paper  It was asserted that the Google quantum computer was able to to solve a problem  50,000 times faster than the world's fastest traditional supercomputer  So it's amazing. It's a con. It's it's not a task you would want right?  It's not solving a problem that anyone cares about but it is it's merely a demonstration that you could do it  that the  Concept it's it's kind of a random number thing  But it was able to do it according to the paper in three minutes and 20 seconds  What would take the world's fastest supercomputer summit 10,000 years  But if you read the blog by Scott Aronson you'll realize that it's kind of it's more complicated than that  It's more complicated than that. So if you really care about quantum supremacy, it's probably worth reading this  He basically confirms the post  Saying yeah, you know I was involved in this I've been trying not to tell anybody for a long time  It's been a big secret Google pulled the article because they want to make a big splash when they announce it  It probably would behoove everybody to to understand a little bit more about what this means  It does not mean that a quantum computer is around the corner  By the way, he says I did not  Create the quantum supremacy phrase. It was coined by John Preskill in 2012. Oh  But he's widely considered to be the guy who first anyway that's established as his bona fides for this article  And he talks about what the problem solved was likely to be and what it means and it doesn't mean a lot of things  So this is this is important. It might in fact be the kind of thing that you'll look back and say up. I remember  Back in 2019 when we first he he likens it Aronson likens it to Kitty Hawk  Yeah, so the first flight of the Wright brothers, but by the way didn't become public for months, right?  Certainly didn't imply that we'd be able to fly across the country or across around the world  It was just a jet airplane. It's just hobbyist. But it was the first time  Humans flew mm-hmm for any length any appreciable distance and that's kind of what this is. So  What does it mean to Bitcoin oh well that's an interesting  Question some people brought this up. I don't know if it means anything for Bitcoin. It would mean  Maybe if you could create a Bitcoin miner out of a quantum computer, which  By the way, that's years and years off. You could perhaps make a some money  But that's not likely remember quantum. These quantum computers have to be supercooled  Remember quantum these quantum computers have to be supercooled if they're very expensive to run  They're very difficult to create and they're incredibly unstable  right so  It's not a practical computer. Yeah, just what you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nothing it doesn't it doesn't mean anything not worth the trouble even for even evil rich monsters

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not unless you've got the research  Means of NASA and Google no, but it's fascinating and if anybody watches our shows and is interested in this kind of stuff  Probably really should read Scott Aronson's blog. His blog is  Scott aronson.com  scottaronson.com  But you could also search for  Quantum supremacy FAQ you'd probably find. I doubt there's more than one  Big victory for Google in a right to be forgotten case. I'm sure Jeff you thought well  There's some good news out there. This was this was good news this week. Yeah, it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  100% good news, but it's good news all around there were two big right to be forgotten cases, but the most visible one  was  countries trying to say that we can demand that you take down stuff worldwide  Which is to say that we would end up with the lowest common denominator internet in the world  Internet  If it's Turkey or Iran or Hungary or pick your country  You don't like for what they're doing these days in an authoritarian government  Could demand that things be taken down around the world and the Europe's Court said no  it can be taken around down throughout the EU and  they're trying to say that the platforms have to  Work very hard to make sure that you discourage people from going to make an American search to get around it  But it recognized  Freedom of expression and recognized that one nation should not control the speech of the world and  I think it was a critically important moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good  Yeah, it only makes sense I mean Christ if Google had to delete  You know post because the French said oh that's wrong all over the world that would be not I would no longer be a useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And meanwhile the other thing that happened. I think just before we came on was that  Europe's  Copyright directive, which I hate  Which is old industries going for protectionism  requiring  Two things one. It's a link tax that that  If you want to put a step it up, you're supposed to pay the publisher the creator and number two  Copyright protection supposedly so France is the first country of course to  Implement this and Google is refusing to pay publishers  For their content Google will only put up a snippet a preview which you're gonna want online  They're only gonna put it up if the publishers says okay  You can do that for free if not they're gonna put up not you know  Nothing about the link itself and guess who's gonna get hurt there idiot publishers guess  Guess who's gonna get hurt there idiot publishers guess  And the public and the public because if you want to see more sources for news  And you want to see more things and more sampling so it's just stupid stupid stupid all around  but these protectionist industries  That think that the way to I was at full disclosure is that Google newsgeist in in Cartagena over the weekend  Where we pay our own expenses, but they buy the food and the booze of which there's plenty  And and I sat in a room again with with editors and and one or two publishers  and I said, you know, I sat in a similar room in the European event a few months ago and  The publishers are going off they can this is gonna save them. We could just if we could just hurt Google that'll save us  We'll be okay again, which is just absolutely  mine  exploding insane  Protectionism doesn't work. It's not it's that did it creates no value  But they're all using their  Their political clout as I said last week on the show in my in my medium very long medium dystopia of dystopians  I think this all goes to a bad place, but  We saw some protection from the platforms in both cases Google  Fought against the copyright directive making them pay for content  Which would hurt the entire web and Google fought against erasing history. So good on Google  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Meanwhile Hollywood is not the biggest Google fan right now  Who is?  Well, this is an unusual  story on Monday evening a bunch of  Mac Pro workstations  In Hollywood studios stopped working  These were rendering movie frames. They were editing video  Google issued a mea culpa saying oh  We did that apparently a chrome update  Damages the file system on Mac OS machines  So scary. Oh  my god  Simple little browser

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Geez and goodness for redundancy that is super scary. How could a browser do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well  Macintosh has something called system integrity protection, which is an awesome thing sip  It keeps unauthorized software for modifying protected data  And incidentally, it's even stronger in the new version of Mac OS El Capitan  No, not El Capitan  Corsica no, not Elba. No Catalina. I knew it was an island. Okay, Lena  So California Staten Island  Catalina is really aggressive. I find myself constantly going no, no, no, it's okay  Let's all this and I've in the past had problems with some software not installing right?  It's just it is an issue, but it's it's a good thing. I think on balance it protects Macintosh users  But it turns out video editors  Often disable it to run their third-party graphics cards  So the entire for instance the entire video editing team working on Modern Family  So if Modern Family comes out late this week, you'll know why again  You have to boot into recovery mode  There's a terminator long series of terminal commands that will remove the Google software update  Restore the damage portion of the file system. In other words, it's not permanent. Thank God  But it just shows you  The risk in hearing in this it was first identified I want to give credit to mr. Macintosh  Mr. Macintosh calm he was the first  To discover this and it's just a little thing. It's an easy thing to have happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How hard was it to tie it to the Chrome when the machine started going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't think the editors really were able to but I think once people figured out that what was happening was a sim link  So normally the slash VAR system is unavailable  You can't modify it with an update because that's protected by sip if you turn off sip  Then any software you can stall will can modify system files. So there was a sim link in the slash VAR  directory  Not sure why that was deleted by chromium. It would take a sharp eye to figure that out. But you know, I mean  That's that's why  People figure this out after rebooting you'd install the Chrome update after rebooting you get a kernel panic and  You'd be in a boot loop kernel panic kernel panic kernel panic kernel panic  Avid users some of the first to report the issue  Because they use third-party graphics cards they turn off sip  And that is that is nasty. It goes it only affects ten point nine through ten point fourteen Mojave  Not sure if Catalina  Would be affected probably if you're running you're running not running beta operating system software if you're doing  Show on a short deadline  At first some people thought it was avid causing the problem. That's when I when I first saw the story

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was just all of it. Google said it was us. It was the cuz all the Adobe

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they've and you know, thank you Google for admitting it and for publishing a fix even more important  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what was it all in one day. It was a crisis, but it was a one-day crisis

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know it took more than a few days to figure it out a few days. Okay, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So some people were sitting there with dead max. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's when you go out and you buy a whole new computer  You spend $50,000. Oh, yeah, I mean whoof

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So anything you want to say about Chrome OS 77

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The funny thing is  Apparently it's going out to just about every Chromebook out there and I have not yet seen you didn't get it  Google mention it. Oh, I have it  I run a couple Chromebook. Yeah. Yeah, I have it. I run a couple devices. So I run one unstable  This is Chrome OS 77 stable  And then I have Devon beta and whatnot on other versions  But on the Chrome releases blog before the show and even now I do not see they have announced this  Anyway, Jeff, you probably have an update waiting. I wouldn't do it right now, but  It's a worthy update  You can download it now. That's the beauty of it. You can download it now when you restart the show  Yeah, it'll be there but  So they haven't there's no announcement of what's in it  I mean, I've seen some things that are in it one is as we mentioned earlier in the show  That many other Chromebooks other than the made by Google devices will have the Google Assistant built-in which is fantastic  Let's see, there's HD copy protected content support for Android apps. So if you have  An app that uses HDMI 1.4  For example, you couldn't previously pipe that out from a Chromebook to a TV now you can do that if that's important to you  the volume control for  orientation  They have fixed that on convertibles because that was backwards when you flip the device upside down  File formats you can now format  External drives flash drives and you can pick and choose between your file format between fat 32 and TFS etc. So that's kind of nice  but  Well, no, that's just if you're in a Chromebook world, right? Yeah, I think that might have been the default prior to but  So not a huge amount of updates that I know of right now  But I literally just updated in class before I came here and haven't really dug around to too much. I'm downloading it right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go. Okay, but don't hit don't hit

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Worry, it's not that you're not using it for this for you. It's okay  It's weird though Kevin I  you know  Back of the day new OS is would come out new OS versions would come out with all the new features and all those be all  Excited of course, this is this is absolutely unnoticeable, which is the whole point of Chrome, but they don't  When new features come out, you don't really get a place to easily clearly except by reading you but for the consumer  I think I think the entire new features and new commands come out and people don't even know it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I agree with you and I'll be honest Jeff when I was at Google working with the Chrome Enterprise team  I raised this issue to anybody who would listen  And actually the enterprise side does do a good job of explaining what's in there for enterprises on the other side the consumer side  It has not been good  However, you will probably notice this when you update because I'm looking right now when you go in your settings in Chrome with 77  Underneath the check for updates button. There's a new link called see what's new. It's not like a super detailed log  I'm gonna try to announce that we're gonna do that. That's better than nothing though, correct, correct  So so I'm looking at it now on mine and yeah, it's showing me the the Google Assistant integration the new  media  Controls at the bottom right of your display, which is nice to have a new family link feature  The Chromebook camera app has been updated  Automatic clicks which is something if you for accessibility if you just hover over a link for X amount of seconds  It will just click it for you  So there that's really all they're showing in there in the what's new, but it's a step

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you keep a machine on canary Kevin I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Generally don't do canary I and for those who don't know canary changes almost  Every day if not multiple times a day, so it's constantly it's it's where all of the Google chromium team  Software changes go into and they push it out and it gets tested and so on and then it could be in the data

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Channel, which is less than canary. How often yes, they did get updated

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Beta is updated every two weeks  I use also the dev channel on a third device and that's updated every couple days or so  And Chrome OS is updated roughly every six weeks so you can see a couple iterations in beta  You see far more in dev, but things are kind of maybe broken. You know, I wouldn't do that on a production machine  My production machine for class and I'll run stable  But yeah, it's it's nice to see and and the nice thing is if you needed to restore a Chromebook  I mean, it's all of a five-minute process

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good old

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really easy to back out which I haven't done in probably a year and probably it's hygiene just to do it  Yeah, I don't need to do it  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just make sure that any local data that you have stored on there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Facebook also had an event today  That's neck up on me. Yeah, and they announced this are you gonna play horizon a  Massively multiplayer virtual reality world  Get ready ready player one. This will launch in closed beta early next year  You'll design your own avatar hop between virtual look locales through  portals called tele pods  You'll watch movies and consume  No, you won't you'll watch movies and consume other media with friends and play multiplayer games together like wing strikers  It'll include human guides known as horizon locals who can give users assistance and protect their safety so trolls can't run rampant  Wow now remember Facebook's spaces  Which we played a little bit with when the oculus rift came out and was really weird and not very much fun  I can't say I remember spaces  Yeah, you'd have to have a rift to play it and and when we tried it I think on the new screensavers  Oh shucks. I can't sign up you have to have a Facebook account to play  Don't what you lose. Oh actually I take it back  You can create an oculus account actually I have one because we do have an oculus risk  so  But I don't know I I can't stay too long in a VR world

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't even know this event was was happening today and I saw that  It's their big oculus event couple headlines pop up about it. Yeah, I  Like that they're updating I don't think this piece mentions it  But they're updating the interface to allow you to use your hands more instead of using actual  Control that's good, you know sort of tracking fingers and in digits and today  Did you do second life when second life was big? I did not I did I wasn't that nerdy just yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you want to know what my second life handle is was it prune face spatula?  and that was randomly picked by  By an engine  But yeah second life got weird.

It was weird. Here's a video  I don't think they'll be nude suits in Facebook or Verizon horizon. Here's a video of  Talking beyond our world. Oh wait, but first of all  Do you want to be the nerdy person while your husband's making dinner in the kitchen?  Standing in the living room dancing with strangers  That's terrible. It's better. You finally put them to work

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Remember the new Tendo we

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a mistake to make this video because it promises something that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very ready player one look at the demographics though of the people in that video  What are the age groups you saw for those? They're all 30 somethings. I guess now. Do you really think no, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other thing they don't show you they show you these people walking around  But obviously you can't walk around she'll run into her husband making breakfast  All right. So you have to have other ways of motivating that aren't you know  You see you throw a thing and you pull it or something. It's just not it's not like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, I appreciate the effort because again when I read it I was thinking ready player one  But when you look at ready player one, he had all of these extra devices the little treadmill and so for yeah  How you have to move around everybody's not gonna do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this is so what's interesting about this though?  One of the most popular parts of Second Life was the ability to build stuff create your own  Stuff and they are doing that so you have tools that will let you create your own  They have a world builder you create your own gaming arenas vacation chill spots

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like the idea of community tropical island. That's not necessarily they did play that right, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So she had a friend who was drinking her coffee through the swirly straw another one in a new Zealand

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See nowadays when you talk about communities you hear it more for the people playing fortnight or whatever the most popular game at the time  Is but this is just regular people connected  In another version of Facebook if you will

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we wondered, you know Facebook spent a lot of money on oculus and we all wondered what was the plan  And so this is clearly the plan this is is it I guess it is next-generation Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I dig that but again you just look at the demographics and look at the hardware that's going to be required  You have a hard time just getting people to watch the VR videos on their phone because they don't want to do  Do you think it's gonna be you start talking about headsets and things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's only gonna be the people who use Facebook today the olds they're using this right?  So maybe they'll all look like 30-somethings, but there really be  Jeff I'll meet you in horizon is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't have to worry about anything don't have don't have to have a walker because we have no legs

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can sit on the virtual porch eat a cracker from the virtual cracker barrel  We can play checkers you and me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We should see ourselves out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is why I take classes with the younglings

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they play roblox or are they too old for roblox in your class?  They're not the other not doing roblox. So that's the youngs are doing roblox, right?  And that's kind of got its own world too. So maybe they're gonna grow into this  also at oculus connect Facebook  announced their  acquiring  Control labs CTRL labs that lets you control computers with your mind  Actually, they announced us a couple of here's it, you know, it's so funny because the the ohm  The giga ohm that diaspora is everywhere. We just read Yanko Rutgers story in variety  This is Kurt Wagner writing for Bloomberg all the people used to work with Kevin  Facebook  Acquired a four-year-old startup  Closely held dozens of employees. They've raised tens of millions in venture capital  They use a bracelet to measure neuron activity in your arm to determine the movement that you're thinking about even if you're not moving  Which is then true. We see this would be good for a virtual world and translated into movement on a digital screen  so who needs the  The the  360 degree conveyor belt or whatever that thing was treadmill you just put a little strap on your thigh  This is sir on a little strap on your arms and you think walk and you think move  We don't know how much they spent but Kurt says between 500 million and a billion dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cow now when they get those data points, I wonder  I  Again security standpoint of it, you know, who's gonna take care of that that data who's gonna own it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can have the data about what my thigh is thinking. I don't care  I'll tell you what my thighs thinking right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sensors on is doing electrical impulses and you think they can you read your mind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You never know  Another Facebook news Jeff Jarvis you tell me Facebook has decided that if a politician says it it's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so  They actually they call people sometimes and  They actually called me not because I've worked for the mineral consult for the mineral full disclosures. I raised money for the school  Are you gonna be on that committee? Are you gonna end up being?  I have too many cooties  So  but they called me as they were grappling with this issue about about newsmakers about newsworthiness and  Twitter was grappling with the same thing and Twitter beat them to the punch  So Twitter said if a politician says something that otherwise would violate their rules  They'll leave it up and put a notice on saying right so no no  Facebook to my surprise decided to leave it up and not put a notice on it because they think that's kind of  Meddling in politics on its own that that notice itself  has  Political impact the problem with that and I and I kind of get that but the problem with that in my mind is  Number one it creates a two-tier system that politicians can do what citizens can't do and that's just wrong  I had argued to them that they should not take down  Politicians think that the politician should be up there for all to see and we should see the politicians sins. I  Do think they should mark it and say this would violate our standards  The reason we're leaving it up is because this person is a newsmaker of this sort  but they decided not to do that and  We'll see how it goes  you know what's gonna happen is that certain major politicians are gonna put up stuff and  people are gonna scream that it should be taken down and  They're not going to because that's their policy now, but neither are they going to label it and  There's gonna be no repercussions  for bad behavior I  Think I don't I don't well  Yeah, I'm not crazy about the decision. It's passing the buck again. I don't think they should have taken it down  I think politicians should have to live with their infamy. Yeah  But I think Facebook doesn't doesn't make a stand. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's so much news today. I'm not gonna get to it all  I'll do a couple of quickies here and you can anybody wants to you know, say anything can jump in  Great interview with Maureen Dowd in the New York Times with Bob Iger the chairman of Disney  He says we decided not to buy Twitter at the last minute because the nastiness on the platform is extraordinary

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And thank goodness. Could you imagine a Disney Twitter? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah  Facebook and Google have ad trackers on  Your TV the weirdest part of this story was the research that said  Even if you haven't don't have a Netflix account the Netflix app on your Roku or other device is still watching what you're watching  Wait, what wait what you don't even have to have an account  Two Americans have been charged  With tech support scamming the elderly for ten million dollars  US Attorney's Office for SDNY announced the arrests  Romana Levia of Las Vegas and Arafal hack of Bellrose, New York are being charged with one count of wire fraud one count of  conspiracy to commit wire fraud each charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison  I hope to throw the book at him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Inhaled responsible for this. They made some money

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  7500 victims ten million dollars. Yeah, they made some money but not anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff and I don't see those not on Chromebooks. Oh, yeah, you know, I know you might

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because if the way they're doing it is a website pop-up you probably will see it but you can ignore it because exactly windows  Let's see I  Want to do the change lock so I just gonna go through a few things Google put up a whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Corpus of  Deep fakes so the researchers can figure out. Yes what they're doing  Which I think is great Twitter by the way, this is not on the run now, but Twitter  Which before had released a bunch of Russian fake tweets  Now added in other stuff from other countries. So again, the more these places  Reveal data for researchers the more that's a good thing keep doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Image net which is a massive database of faces which  Unfortunately were  Categorized let me see if I can find a picture of myself were categorized. I could just do it in the webcam  Let's do this  Categorized by humans and you know how bad humans are

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the problem here is not the technology it is the human but this database is widely used

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, I'm gonna upload a snapshot of me and  See what image net roulette which by the way, oh it stopped. Oh shoot. I wanted to show you this  Because it hit it I did this before and it said that I was oh no here it is here it is  It says I'm a newsreader. Oh, well a  Person or individual who reads out a broadcast news bulletin. Let me do it without  The microphone that might have given it a hit

Transcript:  Mike has been moved

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you're gonna allow us to use our camera which is so good by itself  This is an art project by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't I wasn't immediately clear if the image net roulette which was clown buffoon goof goofball  Mary Andrew  What it does know I'm an entertainer a person who amuses others by ridiculous behavior  Guess what it said about me what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Septuagenarian  Now really you want to do this with somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  African-american because that was part of the issue was that they would say, you know  Thief hood, you know exactly. That's exactly what I was curious get a picture and we'll see if it what it'll do with ant  But the good news is after this and an article about it in the New York Times  Image net said yeah, we're gonna go through some of these images and see  If we can fix that, okay, it's humans  It's a system set up so that the worst of humans can come out and they're gonna come out

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So ant has sent it a pretty simple

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So ant has sent it a pretty scary picture  It's thinking it's processing  New York Times article I think brought it this to light and  And it was pretty funny with now. What does it say about you? Does it say anything? It's still thinking still thinking  It can't can't classify you. I don't think I was quick in me. What is yours say Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Regius professor you're kidding. I didn't get British professorship created by a royal patron  I don't know that royal page. Oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just spinning  Yeah, I think it doesn't want to offend me I give them credit for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it was worse before because they did modify it after this art projects showing the  CEO of we work has after receiving a lot of pressure and having to put off their IPO  Resigned as chief executive Adam Newman though takes a lot of money with him  We still chair, yeah, yeah  Very good article I thought in the hustle about  The graphing calculator the ti-83 which I have bought several for my high school age  Children because it was required. This is a graphing calculator that ti basically has a monopoly in  They don't say it's a hundred fifty dollars. They don't say how much money they've made  But they've sold tens of millions of them partly because  They lobbied hard over the last 20 years to make their calculators required in  classrooms and by the College Boards board and testing they paid lobbyists to  Hound the Department of Education every year right around the time when you know  Mobile technology and apps are becoming more of a threat. You can get a free graphing calculator for your smartphone  But they you know, they're not going to be able to do that  They're not going to be able to get a free graphing calculator for your smartphone  But they even got the Texas legislature to make it mandatory for all students to take Algebra 2  Why well because it requires the use of a ti graphing calculator  20 million graphing calculators sold at $100 a pop 40% of all American high school students and  You have to have one because they won't let you take a smartphone into the test room  It basically sucks as Marcus Grant and 11th grader current currently taking pre calculus  It was really expensive for my family. There are cheaper alternatives available  But my teacher makes the ti calculator mandatory and there's no other option was true  Also at my kid's school. In fact, Abby lost one so I bought three  Gosh  Casio has $50 calculators that do the same thing, but they always say ti they say get a ti calculator  They tell you that and there's a lot of students can't afford 150 dollars for a graphing calculator. They don't need one. I remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  11th or 12th grade and needing to have to get one of these you remember it. Yeah, and  My mother wasn't buying it good for her. I had a  Excuse me. I had a ti 1795  Calculator, I think that's what it was. It was no different from your 10 key and as a result look what happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I can't use it because you couldn't pass math

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My mom said here is this Leo note the note the competition for as an app  Reversed the model of the calculator. This is what's really fascinating. I thought that was great  Go ahead. No, you say it. Well, no, somebody get wrong you have right in front of you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the idea is that you know, instead of charging the user  They charge the schools whatever. Okay. So wait a minute. We've got the results back from ants image roulette  What did it say about you wrong? Doer offender?  So the good news is at least it's been exposed thanks to this art project image roulette and  And the New York Times did a big article on it and that's by the way exactly the words that they quoted. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where the tags come from? How does the how do the tags in this? Remember the Amazon Mechanical Turk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a really cheap crowd sourcing thing. They may still do it for all I know where they pay pennies  For the work, but people all over the world would do the work and I'm guessing from some of the phrases  We've even heard here that these are people probably in India and other places not in the US, right?  Although the New York Times article said they were in the US  But the Amazon Mechanical Turk did not make restrictions about what your geographic location was  They give you a couple of cents to do some job for instance label this photograph  So all of these photographs were labeled using the Amazon Mechanical Turk and boy the results are obvious  But the point of this is it shows why we've got to be really careful with face recognition and other AI  Based on machine learning these databases are often corrupt polluted  For a variety of reasons. I mean, it's no surprise that Amazon's recognition  Is as does a terrible it does fine with white people does a terrible job with people of color  No surprise now we just boy we saw that and not just saw it in action  Wrong do sorry my friend. Mm-hmm. It's terrible. It actually feels like it hurt you your hurt it like hurt your feelings  That's yeah, that's sad  Even in this domain that was it's just sad wrongdoer was exactly in the title by the way of the the article  III  The only thing that I want to add is this is they call it a digital art project and it main  They say it comes from image net  Data  But you know again this interesting that came up with the same  Wrongdoer and offender that it did in the New York Times article for a 24 year old African-american

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is why this stuff has to be trained over and over and over  Yeah, you know, it's not ready and you've got to test it again

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can also have to test it against known problems that are gonna exist  You've got to design in the fact that people will do crap for the sake of doing crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so the  Website we're using was designed by an American artist Trevor Paglen and a Microsoft researcher named Kate Crawford  Paglen said to the New York Times  We want to show how layers of bias and racism and misogyny move from one system to the next  The point is to let people see the work that is being done behind the scenes to see our being processed  I'm not clear though when they say it's an art project if these are actual results  or if

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I couldn't that's the I couldn't get to the source

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm the problem in the times did not do a good job of describing  It is in the art and design section if it's an art project  It may well be that they just automatically label every African-american that way to kind of show the problem who knows

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't we're not really Kate Crawford is a legit smart  AI Institute  NYU  so if this was done to  Make all technology look bad. I'd have a problem with that if it was done to  Enable many people was that was that thing where where the the bot became horrible and racist

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft bot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is my so up to get so let me let me get this I  Kind of misstated this image net is the art project and in fact image net used Amazon Mechanical Turk  So it sounds like those labels really were  Assigned but image net is not used by law enforcement  They the labels originally came from another collection of data called world net  Which was built in the 80s by Princeton University researchers  But with those inflammatory labels included the Stanford researchers may not have realized what they were doing it's unclear to me  It's really hard to get really really of whom

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did what for why here yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Mm-hmm  What do you mean? That's a lie? That's not that that was that was faked  The pushed it over one was faked  Now Boston Dynamics doesn't fake their their  Look at this is doing somersaults.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you think about the wasn't it just last summer when some kids or some workers were trapped in some cave and oh the Chilean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  cave miners  Miners or the or the kids in Thailand or the soccer team in Thailand. Yeah, right  Fortunately, Ian Elon has a submarine for that. Yes  Real quick won't be my pick of the week, but I will mention it cloud flare which has for a long time done  1.1.1 which was a way of hiding your DNS  Lookups from your internet service provider. Yep has now added warp to it. They had promised this  It's sort of it's a quasi VPN  It's missing the features of a VPN that let you choose what country you emerge in  Your IP address will still be visible to the sites that you go to visit  But it will encrypt your data from your phone  It has a app for both Android and iOS and I've turned it on and it seems to work  encrypt your phone now they have a  Free version of warp and then there's warp plus which is five bucks a month  in the US although  Cloudfire says we it varies by region. We're trying to approximate the price of a McDonald's bid Big Mac in your area  So per month, so I paid the five bucks. It does seem as fast as not using warp, which is good for a VPN  Yeah, that's really good. It's using their own private backbone to do warp plus which gives it higher speeds  But you might try one dot one dot one and if you've if you've got that you can everybody now can turn on  Warp which will give you some additional security on open Wi-Fi access points now  The other issue that comes up is that you are no longer directing your DNS and other traffic to your  Internet service provider, but you are directing at the cloud flare. I trust cloud flare, but they are you know a company  They say we're not going to use your information in any malicious way  And I trust them when they say that trust them overcome cast right yeah  pretty much  Yeah, but but but it is something to be aware of that you're that you know as with any VPN mm-hmm  You have to trust cloud for its privacy  They say we don't write user identifiable log data to discs will never sell your data or use in any way to target you  You don't give them any personal information in order to use it  And we will regularly work with outside auditors, which is all you could ask for  So it's a VPN, but it's a kind of a different kind of VPN  You should read the read the post at cloud flare blog cloud flare calm. I like cloud place work  I am using warp  I've used one quad one for a while one dot one dot one dot one and I'm now turned on warp other people use

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google's right eight quad eights

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's quad nine which is another company and Google's quad four I think okay  Yeah, so in each case the difference the other thing is I use  Firefox and Firefox you could turn DNS over HTTPS on but it also uses cloud flare so
