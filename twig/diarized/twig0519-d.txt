Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff Jarvis is in studio with us.  Stacy Higginbotham on the Skype.  We will talk about YouTubers unionizing the big quarterly results from the big tech companies.  And an interesting new strategy for marketing the Pixel phone.  It's all coming up next on Twig.  Netcasts you love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From people you trust.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This is Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google.  The show where we cover any damn thing we want.  So I don't want to hear from you.  We will talk about Google.  But we will also talk about Facebook, Twitter and media.  And guess who is in studio with us to talk about everything and nothing.  It's Jeff Jarvis of BuzzMachine.com.  What brings you out here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Dean and I visited here five years ago.  She had too much work to do.  She has a real job unlike me.  So five years ago we came out and invented a new degree while we were out here.  And she came up and rethought television as a result.  And this time we are doing a reprise.  We are visiting Google, Facebook, Twitter.  You built a beautiful studio at CUNY.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We did.  The journalism school there.  What's her name?  Sarah Bartlett.  But then I always think that's West Wing.  But it's not.  Oh it's not.  Jeff's sister, Sarah.  Also with us is Stacey Higginbotham.  Applause for Stacey too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm okay without applause.  Up in Seattle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's great to see you.  Wonderful to have you as always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is good to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Before we start.  I have some footage to show.  Karsten Bondi, our producer.  Jeff's drive up here.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now should we explain that Jeff does not like British?  He does not like bridges.  I don't like bridges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we have some rather dramatic footage.  By the way that's PTSD from 9-11.  We have some rather dramatic footage of him running away from a bridge.  Uh oh.  That's you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis.  Jeff used to be the critic for TV.  Oh my god.  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now I'm very confused.  Was that Howard Stern talking?  Yes.  And then.  So somebody is listening to Howard Stern.  Talking about this is very meta.  Talking about Jeff.  And they get in the wreck.  You edited that right?  They get rear ended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No that was, we just found that.  No you're kidding me.  We found that.  Our Jeff.  Our Jeff.  Alright rerun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's do it again.  My ego demands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's in car camera.  And he's listening to Howard Stern.  That's the audio.  And a car comes up from behind and rear ends him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis.  Jeff used to be the critic for TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh boom.  I think they added the car wheel squeak.  No.  Wow flipped him on his side.  Wow.  I hope nobody was hurt in that horrific accident.  I hope so too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I bet someone was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah it doesn't look good.  The video is from June 16th.  Of this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was it a model 3?  Because I've been seeing all these model 3 videos getting run all the time.  Oh you know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the model 3's have cameras now that are always recording.  The 360 cameras.  So it might have been a model 3.  Although it didn't look like a model 3.  It did not.  That looks like a pickup truck is what it looks like.  It looks like a bed.  Sometimes people have cameras recording.  Like for backup.  Yeah it's almost certainly a pickup.  That's the problem with pickups.  They don't have any weight in the back.  So if you get tapped even, you get tipped.  Yeah it must be on the Golden Gate.  No hazards on the bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tesla, what did it take me over the...  I mean not Tesla, what am I saying?  Waze, what did it take me over the Bay Bridge?  And I yelled at the Waze lady.  I said no.  Never.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they built it back since then.  It's all new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they use bad bolts.  I read those stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then there's that other bridge we have.  The Richmond Bridge.  Which pieces of chunks of it were falling off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah just earlier this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So maybe you're right.  Maybe we should stay away from bridges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jesus, can I get a helicopter back to the city please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So are YouTubers unionizing?  This is a wild story from Vice.  The YouTubers union is not messing around.  It's joined forces with Europe's largest trade union  to fight for a fairer platform.  Fighting for the rights of content creators  but also of users.  They've joined with IG Metall,  Germany's largest union.  Europe's largest union.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which would be like YouTubers being teamsters.  That's kind of strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is a funny image but sure.  I'm like yeah okay.  When they join,  they would totally tell where Jimmy Hoffa was buried though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'd tell but they'd do a 15 minutes of video before telling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Saying they were going to tell.  We're going to do the Jimmy Hoffa unboxing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In recent years,  this is from the Vice article,  in recent years,  Jimmy Hoffa unboxing.  That was a great setup.  That was awesome.  I think it's not usual that we'll have the title of the show  in the first three minutes.  But I think we actually do.  In recent years,  YouTube creators have consistently spoken out about changes  to the massive platform.  They say they're rarely consulted on  that affect their ability to make money.  YouTube's changed how it handles copyright takedowns.  That's actually costing us money.  We're not strictly speaking YouTube creators  but we put our shows on YouTube.  And we do make money on that  because we count the downloads on YouTube.  So we've had to make goods  in the past for advertisers  because it was a month, right,  that one of our shows was taken down for a month.  We got it back up  because it was an unfair takedown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was more than a month.  It was 45 days.  Over 45 days actually.  45 days to respond to the thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That cost us money.  YouTube has also demonetized some users.  That's its chief punishment  for users it says are problematic.  It's also issued content warnings  to some innocuous channels.  One of the creators leading the unionization charge,  Jorg Sprav,  has had his popular slingshot videos  removed by YouTube.  Why would that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you imagine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  It depends what's at the other end of the slingshot, I guess.  Sprav traced the origins of the problems  leading to this recent move back to changes  in YouTube's relationship to advertisers  following the 2017 ad-pocalypse.  Major advertisers  organized a boycott of YouTube  because they didn't want their ads  running next to quote,  extremist content, end quote,  and claimed, demanded that Google  implement brand safety controls.  Which they did.  But that cost a lot of  content creators significant ad revenue.  So two years ago,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hank Green created  the Internet Creators Guild.  Which was an effort to do something like that.  You know, I'm all for unions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a member of SAG-AFTRA  and I've always been a union member.  We're not a union shop,  but I have nothing against unions.  But it seems kind of  a slap in the face.  YouTube provides free bandwidth,  free publicity.  I mean, it's a great free platform for content creators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was ready to mock it,  but you do think that more and more  and more and more, we had a conversation about this  this week in San Francisco, it's not about jobs,  it's about work.  And in a freelance gig economy,  in a world of Lyft and Uber  and last night I used Caviar to get,  while I was watching the debate, to get food brought to me,  there is no representation  for independent people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the gig economy hurts a lot of people.  I mean, it's a very hard thing to do.  I worry for our kids.  Stacey, have you been in a union?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, no.  A, I'm from Texas and B...  We don't have no unions in Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was like, oh, we're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But even when I was, I'm trying to think,  no, even at my publications,  I've never been in a union pub.  Actually, that is one thing that's happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in web publications.  Yes, they are unionistic.  Yeah, because Fortune had, half of us were,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  half of them were union  and people like me were not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Print people were union  and the digital people were not, yeah.  I mean, there's very much in the sentiment

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in this country, anti-union sentiment.  I bet you know, in the European Union,  unions aren't a bad, aren't a dirty word.  So named because of it.  I think what Jeff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the point Jeff's making about these platforms,  and maybe we don't go to the platforms,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but we've historically relied on employers  in our country for a social safety net, right?  And that has shifted  and now we have a social safety net  that's been used by the people  who are in the country.  And that has shifted  and now we don't have  a social safety net and we don't have  employers and so we're like,  okay, so a lot of the big debates  around things like Medicare for All  or Universal Payer or  things like that  are because  we need something.  We don't have anything and if you look at the gig economy,  we're gradually dismantling  even the ability of an employer  to be your safety net.  So Stacey, this is one thing that's always puzzled me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in the debate, the debate was going on  last night in the election,  in the Democratic candidates,  is that if I were,  and I'm not, if I were  a Republican company owner,  you would think that  I would want to get rid of the burden  of having to provide health insurance to my employees.  Let somebody else do it. Why should that come out of my pocket?  Why should I have to deal with all that?  You know, I would think that  apart from not liking big government,  fine, but you think that they want to  offload that. I don't understand it  just logically.  Um, I, well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know because I'm, I'm  pro health insurance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As am I. I think even  business owners, even business owners  understand that our health system  is broken. So stockholders,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so the problem is businesses,  big companies who provide health  insurance are beholden to stockholders.  And stockholders  typically want  providing health insurance  is, it hurts the bottom line.  So I think that's where  that's coming from. The loyalty  isn't to your employers as a business owner,  it's to your shareholders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good point. That's a, but even  then, Stacey, you're spending money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should want the government to do it, right?  You don't want to spend it. Yes. Well, and there's a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of talk about, so if you look  at something like, they talk  about with, um,  companies like Walmart, especially  low paying companies or the pay low wages.  What's happening is  taxpayers are ultimately  subsidizing the high insurance  rates of the uninsured that these people  have. So what's happening is  they're getting kind of a two for one  in the sense that they're not  insuring people, right? And  they're not paying taxes.  So basically the costs are coming  down on municipalities and  people who pay taxes into those.  Which companies do a little bit, but not as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe that's why  business owners aren't lobbying for  national health care. They just say, well, we're  not going to pay. And so it's  up to you. We pay. We have fairly  good health insurance for our employees. It's a fairly  significant cost. But I think  Lisa, who I can  say was a Republican, I don't know if she still is,  not anymore, but she's independent now,  but still supports  single payer health,  government supported health. Because it's  I think for even for business  owners, it's pretty clear that the health system isn't working.  It's inefficient. Billions  of dollars are going into the pockets of insurance companies,  not into medical care. And here we  are in what should be the country  that has the best medical care in the world.  And it is, we are not even  in the top 20. And even

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  as a business owner, even I was  in a fairly large company that  had one or two employees  who had very sick children. And the  rates went kaboom. So that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you're not protected. That's part of it also.  Yeah. Yeah. In fact, that's one of the  burdens that we see all the time is  the very  steep increases year after year after year  in the health plans we provide our  employees. It can get, it can get, it's, we've had a  couple of years where it went up, you know,  double digits. And it was significant  increases. And  that's without anybody getting sick.  I mean, if somebody gets seriously sick  in the group, then that's even more of a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So back to the YouTube Union. I love  the idea of a YouTube picket line.  Where everybody's shooting everybody else on the picket line.  Right?  But that's why Union, that's one reason people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  want to unionize because that is one of the  Union benefits that's most cherished by  people is Union health care. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the problem is a Union works when you've  organized the entire shop. You have to.  On YouTube, it's going to, the majority will be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with spoilers. You couldn't even, you could even  demand a Union because you'd,  even if you had a vote. First of all, who has  standing? Right. Everybody who ever made  a YouTube video, who has standing? Right.  This just doesn't make sense.  Could it, I mean, but  I don't see any reason why creators  couldn't join together like the Greens have tried to  do and make some sort of guild  where they subordinate each other. Well, but there's always going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  be people who don't join and  they'll be, I mean, they'll be, what is it?  Scabs? Is that what they are when you,  when your Union's. Well, it's a little harsh, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yes. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a giant inflatable rat  that's just waiting to be set up outside  of Twitch headquarters. I imagine  what I now fantasize about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is the TikTok Union.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's that? Oh, good Lord.  A bunch of pre-teens.  Yeah. Yeah.  That's why the idea of unionizing YouTube  doesn't completely make sense to me.  And yet I do think YouTube  creators have a decent case to present  to YouTube. And the only way,  the whole point of a Union is collective bargaining,  right? That if every employee  gets together and says,  we want some concessions from an employer,  it's very difficult for the employer to  ignore that. You know, you have the threat  of a strike and even if you  hire the Pinkertons to  beat up the strikers and bring in scabs,  it's not a good look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. It's not a good look. Well, I love that too.  Right, so the YouTubers are out on strikes  and there come scab YouTubers  who make inferior YouTube

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  videos. But that's the legitimate threat that these guys  have to YouTube because  and we've always said this, when you're a YouTuber,  you are working for free  to benefit this giant  company.  And we don't know. One thing that I would  if I were a YouTuber, I would want to know  is what percentage of the ad revenue am I getting?  Google does not even say that.  Are they taking 50% of the ad  revenue? 70?  Apple at least says we take 30%.  But Google doesn't even say  what the ad revenue is for YouTube and how much  do YouTubers get? Because they negotiate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that doesn't mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they couldn't put up a sheet for every YouTube channel  and say this is what we charge  and this is what you're getting.  They don't want to do that. No,  I understand why they don't. And that's why people  form unions to get  that kind of information, to band together.  And I think the most power  what it's going to take is the top 50 or 100  YouTubers to get together and say  PewDiePie and Michelle Phan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would imagine that PewDiePie in the organizing meeting.  He's an anarchist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Could they do something from an agency?  So could there...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that is one thing that's happening, isn't it?  You could come through your  content creation agencies.  So that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  gives them the data they need  to argue for better rates and that sort  of thing. And then, but  I mean, it does create a middleman instead of a union  who's going to negotiate on your behalf.  So it's collective bargaining only in the sense  that if you're with a powerful enough group who can  be like, oh yeah, well, if you don't take  this person, I'm not going to give you this person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to come down on the side of the free  market here and say if you want to be on YouTube,  you know what the rules are going in.  You're getting some real benefit  from being on YouTube. We're happy to be on YouTube.  We get free distribution.  It's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the Creators Guild is a good idea where there  becomes a body. What happened with the newspaper industry  and that's why I've been down  talking to all the companies this week.  Google did an excellent job  of involving  newspaper publishers and product people in  its new product for subscriptions, for example.  Changed the relationship that they had  and  it gave them a body  to talk with. And it wasn't just  to fight with or even to negotiate with.  It was to create a mechanism to  be able to do things together. That would  make sense. To have a  Creators Guild to go and talk about  ethical  standards for creators, ethical standards  for Google.  That would be interesting. And then I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we should have a Guild  of Tweeters.  The Guild of Facebook users.  I mean, all of these  modern platforms, YouTube, Facebook  and Twitter. I don't think there's a professional  Twitter. All the content, all the...  Well, I'm just pointing out. All the content, all  the way they make money. They make money  by selling ads against content created  for free by the users.  That is inherently...  But as you said, they get free service back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so maybe you create a Guild of  Influencers or a Guild of  people.  Because there's something to the idea  that to  create rules around ethics and what  the type of content you're going to produce,  the type of messaging  that you're going to... However you're going to behave  online and how you're going to treat other people  and whatnot.  And maybe that...  Influencers is bad because  influencers encompass everything  from Instagram people all the way to people  who are creating really cool  and popular videos. But something like that  does kind of make sense.  And  professionalizing this  category is probably smart.  It's already happened in the sense that people have money.  And I believe  you could actually do a lot  of good for everyone  who's involved in this. So think about all  those stories about influencers who  were bombarding hotels with requests  to stay there for free.  Because I'm an influencer with X number...  It's such a disgusting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  business.  And by the other... There was a great  article in PetaPixel  by a photographer who was talking  about the lavender fields of France  where the  farmers have put up a sign saying,  please respect our work. Don't trample  the lavender. And in front of this  sign he posted... The author  of the article posted a picture of  dozens of Instagram influencers  posing in the lavender.  He said some people come with  12 wardrobe changes so that  they can do a fashion shoot in  the lavender. Picking bunches of  lavender for their Instagram shot.  He said...  It's a business. Charge them for it.  Wow. They're climbing  over the fence.  This is I think more and more of a blight  all over the world. I know  our photography guy on the radio  show Chris Markward has said something about it.  Trey Ratcliffe, great photographer,  has actually written a book under  the influence about the...  And here's a guy who really  created a career on Facebook,  Instagram, and Google Plus saying  this is horrific  what's going on now on Instagram. Buying  followers. All of these would  be influencers who are  swamping the world.  There are places where  they have signs. No Instagram hashtag.  Please.  It's gotten out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nah. Nah.  Okay. Relax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do sound like an old guy.  Get off of my lavender you  kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if this will...  I'm very curious how short lived this is  or if this is like a new profession  in the sense... I mean, marketing  has always been around but  in this kind of fashion.  Because I look at like my daughter and her  friends. Some of them are very  into it but most of them are very  skeptical of putting their  themselves online. And their friends  who work hard at this,  they're not shy about saying how much  how hard they work at it.  So it's obviously a very  small group of people so I'd be  curious to hear how other  10 year olds and 15 year olds are  viewing this  as a career.  I mean, because it is. It's hard work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember, I mean, for a while everybody said  well I'm going to become an NBA star. I don't need to  study.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh man, when I was in the 90s  or late 80s, I wanted to be a supermodel for  a hot second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As well you should have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Paul Rafer, the photographer  wrote this in Pedapixel.  Photographers, Instagrammers, stop being so  damn selfish and disrespectful.  And here's the  picture of the fields in the south of  France, the lavender fields in Provence.  Respect our work please.  And all the photographers trampling  into the  lavender fields. And of course  if you do, if you look for  the hashtag,  what did he say the hashtag was?  Lavender I guess.  You will see  all of these pictures  and all of these  people. They damaged the land,  they'd stolen the owner's products, they'd ruined the  fields.  Here it is, yeah, hashtag  lavender.  4.9 million hashtag lavender posts.  And look at these. I mean you know, fashion  shoots in the lavender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's be clear here, the problem here is bozos,  not technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely, but these bozos were not as prevalent  until technology empowered  them.  This is what I come up with though,  every single time. You're right.  That, you know,  I mean for instance, public records are  stored at the county courthouse. They always have  been. And if somebody wants to, they can  go to the county courthouse and find out where you live.  But as soon as you added  technology databases and the internet  to this, anybody can go  to a website like Spokeo and find out  where anybody in the world lives.  And that's the problem. Technology is such a  powerful tool that can amplify  bozos. As well as  good things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will say that  this kind of platform has  like the launch of Instagram and Snapchat  has created  an audience  and an incentive  to, that  incentivizes this behavior.  An audience for it and an incentive that wasn't  there prior.  So, and I don't think there are  people who wake up and are born with  this desire to trample people's fields and  disrespect their property. But I do think there  are people who are maybe a little more selfish  and not thinking about others.  Or don't realize the impact of their actions.  And  what happens is  these platforms draw attention  to a single place and then you get a bunch  of people who behave that same way and have that same  sense of entitlement and then voila.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're negotiating norms  around that. Enough people have to scold  the people on the photos and say, what did you do?  Stop it. Knock it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to say this comes across a little bit  as a curmudgeonly photographer  who wishes he had it to himself again.  Here's a picture from Wanaka,  like Wanaka in New Zealand that he took six years  ago, of a little tree that's out  there in the lake.  And he says nowadays, this is  what it looks like with thousands of  photographers, wedding photographers  coming out and swamping the  lake.  And here's even one guy who decided he  wanted to climb up into the tree and sit there  so nobody could get that shot.  So, you know,  yeah, he kind of wishes it were back to this  lone tree and him.  But that's also a point of view  of privilege. It's a privilege, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let me try this out on you since you both  like to criticize the valley and I've been  there this week. You've been in the valley.  I've been in the valley.  I heard from a lot of people  who,  well, let me start here.  When I lived in San Francisco, when I lived here  in my day, I left, I hate  to admit this, in 1981,  so long before Silicon Valley  was Silicon Valley,  it was a place  people, San Francisco was a place people  adored. They were passionate about.  They loved it. They cared about  it. It was a special place. What I've heard  all this week from people in technology and  elsewhere is  nobody likes San Francisco.  Everybody's fed up with San Francisco. That's very sad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because it was one of the great cities. It was. And it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just San Francisco, of course, it's the whole thing. Now, when I  lived there, you looked down on the peninsula,  what is now Silicon Valley, and thought no one  would die being there.  That's the new vorish down there.  No, no, it wasn't the new vorish. It was the American  Taki.  Taki has is.  I did a column for The Examiner once where I  surveyed, I did a census of  every single fast food and junk food  brand on the entirety of  El Camino Real.  All the way up and down.  All of them.  My favorite one was Eat My Quiche.  But that was what I thought some people had visioned  the peninsula was that it was  the strip mall that was taking over America  and now that strip mall  is in charge of the world.  And so it's really fascinating to me  and I also talked to a lot of people about philanthropy  because we're a school and we're out here and we're going to beg for money  and people say, no, no,  nobody here gives any money. No, not going to happen.  Yeah, you got Benny Hoffman. Yeah, you got Zuckerberg.  But no, nobody gives any money. And somebody  said to me that they thought  that the technology  rich folk think that  angel investing in a company  is like charity. That's our charity.  And that's their thing they're starting.  We're funding innovation. Bingo.  And so you have this  it's worse than all we.  It's a bit of self-hatred  springing up from the entire  Bay Area, which is just so strange  to me. When I lived here  you had these society  mockers.  Pat Montandon, Cyril Magnon.  Oh, yeah. Right. And they would say,  darling, don't we need a symphony  in San Francisco? Yeah.  Let's raise money for the symphony. And then you have a huge  symphony hall gets built. Right. People used to  get money here. The old patronage system.  They really did. And now that doesn't exist in San  Francisco. And now people are worried about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Patrons of the arts.  Is Silicon Valley not patrons of the arts? There's  a San Jose symphony, isn't there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hardly. Nothing.  So it is interesting to say, what is the culture  of not just the valley  itself, but the valley in San Francisco and all that now. I have to think this isn't permanent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That this is just  a blip.  The go-go,  you know, boom  nature of the boom.  Did you ever watch Deadwood  about the gold rush in South Dakota?  Those people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  were really dicks. That's your kind of Gutenberg moment here.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There were no laws.  They were, you know, it was crazy.  But that was the nature of  the boom. I'm sure Deadwood South Dakota  is not lawless anymore.  It's boring. It's probably fairly boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure is. They don't have a symphony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they don't have a symphony. They didn't have a symphony then either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Stacey, what about, since you went  from Austin, did Austin have a touch  of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Austin was a little different because  it doesn't have a lot of super  rich people. So I grew up in Houston where we  had huge patronage of the arts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The oil folks, right? The oil folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They just give money all the time.  Because they're guilty.  They're guilty. I think it's an older  tradition. I think it's the George

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bush kind of patrician  tradition of patronage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and I was going to say new money trying  to impress old money.  Houston was very much a  we are just as good as New York  or God help us Dallas. We're better  than Dallas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We need our own TV show.  That's my motto.  Houston.  Ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in Austin,  it was for the longest  time it was real estate money and there  was donations, but they weren't as big  because they just didn't have quite as much money.  And then when  the tech guys came,  Michael Dell didn't donate any  money for a really long time.  Not only now has Dell started donating money.  He was very stingy.  And then other than that,  there weren't a lot of startup.  There were a lot of startup companies, but very few  ever made it big, made it public,  that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John Thornton is an

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Austin Ventures. Oh my God, that man is such  a friggin jerk.  But he is philanthropic.  He is a  small minded  smooch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my. So now that you're in  Seattle, is it different there?  Seattle has a lot  of public works.  Paul Allen built that beautiful museum.  I think  he bought  the Seahawks.  Gates is having an Andrew Carnegie  moment. Gates was the  rapacious  billionaire.  What did they call them?  The Rockefellers and the  Carnegie's. They called them the Robber Barons.  Gates was a Robber Baron until  basically  after he retired. Well, actually it was when he married  his wife, Melinda Gates,  he started giving to charity.  And then he had kind of a moment,  like Andrew Carnegie, the steel baron,  who was Terry. He talked about bringing  in the Pinkertons  to bust the union. He was famous for this.  But later in life,  I think he thought, I want to go to heaven. So he built  beautiful free public libraries  all over the country. We have one in  Petaluma. And I feel like Bill Gates  is our Andrew Carnegie. He's  making up for his sins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think for  any executive,  maybe it's just in the tech world,  I don't know. But you get to a certain  level. At first you're scrapping by, and you  still feel scrappy. You don't know that you're  successful yet, right?  And then at that point in time,  suddenly you become  evil, right? I think  what happens is you're still fighting and scrapping  and you don't know if you're going to  make it still even though everyone else is like,  OK, buddy, you've made it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at Steve Jobs, who  was famously stingy  with charity. Apple  never did any of that.  He passed away before he had a chance to have his  Andrew Carnegie moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  His wife, his widow, is doing amazing  things with Emerson. Laureen is giving away tons  of money. Bought Atlantic magazine.  It's not just giving away money. It's also supporting  for-profit efforts  for society, like in Atlantic.  That's for Emerson

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  collective that's doing all that  investing. Yeah, good for  Laureen Jobs. She's really a remarkable  person. But she doesn't  see, that's the difference. Maybe wives  are important for  this equation because men are jerks.  Greedy, selfish  jerks. That's us.  But neither Laureen Jobs nor  Melinda Gates had to  scrap their way up to the top and create  the company that made all that money.  And so maybe they  don't have that same Travis  Kalanick kind of mentality of  I'm the underdog. I got to fight  every step of the way. I don't  have time for charity. Bill Gates famously  said, I'm not going to give away any  money until I can do it right. Until  I have the time to  use my money wisely. And look, and actually  that was a pretty good maximum. Mark Zuckerberg,  how much did he give Newark  that was just thrown away basically  because it was inappropriate giving.  It was a waste of money. I think you also have Mackenzie

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bezos is already starting to be  philanthropic. Yeah. Considering she has a  large amount of money. Does Jeff Bezos have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a big philanthropy arm? Is there a Bezos  family foundation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think he's starting to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  invest in things. But Jeff's  charity, this is very similar actually,  is going to Mars.  Blue Origin. It's going to Mars. We screwed  up this planet. So I'll tell you what I'm  going to do as my charity. I'm going  to colonize  Mars so we have somewhere Plan B.  He also saved the Washington Post.  He did save the Washington Post.  There's some credit there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He launched a two billion dollar fund  for homeless families. Alright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Bezos is doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  good with his stuff. But that's pretty  recent. And I think part of that  is part of this like, oh,  now I need to give.  At a certain point in time,  you have to give. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is a timely moment to mention  how much money these guys are making.  Because it is  the quarterly report  time of year.  Facebook, it's a second.  billion daily active users  in June 2019. That's an 8%  increase. So all you people  quit in Facebook.  You didn't make a dent.  Monthly active users, 2.41  billion. Also an  8% increase. But here's the  number that I think is important.  Mobile advertising  revenue. 94% of Facebook's  advertising revenue came from  mobile. That's up from 91%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And when did they make the, uh, uh, oh, we gotta go  mobile pitch?  It didn't take them long. A couple of years, three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember when  Facebook went public,  the real question on everybody's mind  was, can Facebook survive?  Boy, were we  dumb. Can Facebook survive  in a mobile world? All their revenue is  desktop.  28% increase year  over year in advertising.  36% in other fees and payments.  So they had a 28%  bump in revenue.  Costs went up though.  That's a pretty big jump in cost.  They must be doing a lot of R&D and a lot of  investment. Income from  operations was down as a  result, 21%.  Their operating margin was down  from 44%. That's a nice margin.  To 27%, which is  actually lower than Apple.  And their effective tax rate, they don't  mention what it was last year.  Probably because it was zero.  Their effective tax rate for this quarter  was 46%.  So that probably  includes the $5 billion  fine from the FTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you count that as a tax?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  Let's see. I see an asterisk.  That's an extraordinary event.  It includes an additional  $2 billion in legal expenses  related to the FTC's  settlement. And a  $1.1 billion income tax expense  due to developments in  Altera Corp versus Commissioner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it cost $2 billion in lawyers  to pay $5 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They spent $2 billion in legal fees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's a great return then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you include Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp  and Messenger, their family  of services,  $2.1 billion daily  active users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I was down in  both Menlo Park and Mountain View  this last week.  And the  last time I was at Facebook,  building 20 was done. There's the  old campus, and across the street  is building 20, which is the one  that has the famous walk on top and all that.  Now building 21 is done  and it doubles it. And now  they're quadrupling that  down the road. I think from end  to end, it looks like it's going to be at least a mile.  Of kind of one continuous  but where they're all walking to the  cafeteria all the time. Back and forth.  And then down  in Menlo Park, I mean in Mountain View,  have you  seen the construction of the new Google  buildings down there? The tents?  Do we have any pictures of that? Yeah, we do.  Oh, it's unbelievable.  It's just these gigantic  tent-like structures  under which will appear  buildings. Like Facebook,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they want to make these  almost indoor-outdoor  spaces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're just amazing, the symbol of that.  But yet, there's no branding on them  anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google now has more cash  than Apple.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple had half the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  cash in the world.  Go, Porat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, partly that's because Apple repatriated  and re-bought stock with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Google's going to do a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nest Egg is down to 102 billion dollars.  It was all the way up to 163.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that before the stock buyback?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. Alphabet's financial reserves  are now 117...  financial reserves, in other words, money in  their pocket. 117 billion  dollars. That's a 20 billion  dollar increase over the last couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that short-term? Is that  cash? It's the corporate

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  liquidity.  They are the top of the corporate liquidity  rankings.  That's even after the  8.2 billion dollar... 8.2 billion  euro fine.  That's how much they've paid in the last couple of years to the EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alphabet bought back 3.6 billion  of stock in the second quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it was even after that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  The company's new 25 billion dollar  buyback authorization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, look at this sort of thing  in the context of...  Okay. Let's look at  their contractors versus their employees.  Look at a company like  Verizon or actually  AT&T, which  is more unionized than Verizon.  And think about  how that kind of... how that math  ends up working. So,  if you look at margins and profits on AT&T,  and not that they're a  wonderful company that's just not  screwing anyone over anywhere, but  they do have financial obligations  they can't worm their way out of.  And that's...  This is shareholders that are getting  this money, the stock buybacks, etc.  Good for shareholders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, it's interesting. Alphabet...  Well, Apple spent  122 billion over the last  18 months buying back stock.  Including dividends.  Google, 1.7 billion  a quarter. Much less.  According to the Financial Times,  in that time, Google has handed out  more new shares in the form of employee  stock benefits than it's bought  back. Now, shareholders don't like  that because that actually does not  help shareholders. It delutes them.  But... But they're not using this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  cash to invest in  technology and growth. They must see this as a necessary  thing to keep their...  They don't know what to do with the cash. It shows a lack of a...  This is unfair, but I'll be unfair.  Because, hey, it's only a podcast.  It shows a lack of imagination.  Yeah. Right? If you've got this cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they just have  so much... I mean, that is a  lot of cash. Yeah. And it's kind of  this... I mean, think about it like the Bill Gates problem.  They actually have a fiduciary responsibility  to do something good or useful  for their bottom line with it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So... That's exactly what they think they're  doing. Ruth Porat, the CFO, said  the increase  in stock repurchase, which is  now 25 more  billion to a stock buyback program,  did not reflect any change in Alphabet's  financial priorities. Alphabet's  two top goals, to your point, Stacy,  were unchanged. To invest in the long-term  growth of its existing businesses  and to support acquisitions.  That's one thing Google does more than  Apple. Apple doesn't like  acquisitions. Acquisitions... And I don't blame  them, because acquisitions are challenging  for a company. But didn't someone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  do a story about how Apple has been making  way more acquisitions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe lately. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they did just buy Intel's chip business  for a billion dollars. That's a big one, a billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And 2,000 Intel employees are  coming over. But that's historically difficult  for a company. I mean, if you look  at the history of acquisitions  in the tech sector, it's almost  an unbroken chain of failures  and misery.  Because it's hard to... When HP  bought...  Who was it HP bought? I've forgotten now.  Was it Gateway?  It was K-Pro back in the day.  HP bought Compaq. Integrating  those two teams was a nightmare.  It never really went  very well. When Time Warner...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, okay. Well, those are  those are the... Those are big

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  mergers, big acquisitions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tied two bricks together and they're still going to  sync kind of deals. But if you look at

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple... Apple's doing it smart, I agree with you.  They're acquires  as much as anything else. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  their Wikipedia page shows  that they have started acquiring  many more companies in the last five years.  Most of those companies  are small.  The acquisitions...  Well, not actually so. They're really hiring...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're hiring great engineering teams.  They're buying, perhaps buying  intellectual property, but they're not trying to buy  companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they actually... In this last  year, so there's Intel Smart Home...  Smartphone mode of business.  They bought Shazam.  That was a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Beats  was their last big acquisition.  It was a $400

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  million deal. That's  not insignificant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many employees did they acquire?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know how many employees they acquired.  I think they probably got the technology more than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they've done a lot of semiconductor deals, believe it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That makes sense, because they're trying  to build a semiconductor business. That's why  the Intel acquisition makes sense.  They want to build their own silicon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That makes no sense.  That's just like a... I don't...  That's a weird thing. But I was going to say, most of their  chip deals have actually been relatively  small tuck-ins with really...  With cool technology.  And what they've done is they've hired people.  The engineering leads  for...  They hired the former paper master.  I can't think of his first name.  It was their head of silicon when they wanted  to design their own chip.  So what they've actually done is find  really small chip  companies that offer some...  Maybe it's a weird networking fabric.  Maybe it's an optimization scheme.  And then they've actually hired someone  well known in the chip industry to pull that together  with Arm Silicon or whatever.  That's why this Intel deal is  so weird  and dumb.  It's because Intel has  not done a great job with their  modem business, one. So,  Apple doesn't buy  technology that's bad.  It buys technology that's just not  known yet. So, yeah.  That's on that topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an interesting subject. That'll be interesting to watch  that because  there were some stories that Intel felt like  that was a fire sale.  That a billion was not nearly enough for the thousands  of patents and the 2,000 employees.  But that's the problem. There was no one else  out there who had anywhere  near that kind of money.  This is all about  Apple getting out from under Qualcomm.  And remember, Apple has paid  a billion dollars to Qualcomm for licenses  over the last couple of years. So a billion dollars  to get out from under Qualcomm  maybe is a bargain.  If they can get out from under them.  That's the question.  Is that why you're saying it's not a great  acquisition?  How good was Intel's 5G modem  anyway? It seemed like Intel  was struggling to make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was not a good product.  What I would expect to see  then is now that once  Apple assesses all of this  and takes a look, what I imagine  will happen is it will either find  something to fill in the gaps in Intel's technology  and I don't know enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  about it. Which includes, by the way, licenses  from Qualcomm, of all things.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or it will hire  some sort of Qualcomm  people there.  But hire someone in charge of building  5G chips that's really well known in the industry

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and bring them in.  Maybe it is a bad acquisition, but  it fits in with Apple's general  desire to  vertically integrate the entire process  hardware and software. They'd like to make  everything.  Because if they make everything, they've been  one of the problems Apple's had over the last few years  is that Intel has not been able to deliver  with CPUs or  modem chips or anything else.  And it's held Apple's product line back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Stacey, where's most of the fabbing  done for the Intel stuff  that Apple bought? US or  foreign?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to guess  it's either TSMC or  let's see. It's in Taiwan.  I can give you a list

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of Intel's fab locations.  Chandler, Arizona.  Tariff, all that. Rancho, Rio.  Those aren't the modem

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  chips. Those aren't the modem chips.  Those are the  CPUs.  So, I think the modem chips are  fabless. But I don't know that for sure.  If you give me time, I will look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would make sense. That's where you'd have  TSMC and others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And I can't think of the other one that I'm thinking of.  TSMC and...  Micron?  No.  That's memory.  Global Foundries?  Global Foundries is the old AMD one.  They do memory mostly, I think.  It's SM...  UMC?  Oh, UMC is the other one. And then there's an SM one.  Anyway, okay. Just ignore me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  STM?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is Infidion's old...  This is Infidion stuff.  So, I'm trying to remember where Infidion came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm giving you these names from a spreadsheet of 73  rows of Intel chip foundries.  And by the way,  they are all over the world.  So...  I know Hillsboro, Oregon is a big place for the  CPUs.  They make some in Israel.  The microprocessors.  Make a lot of RAM in Singapore,  the US, Japan.  They have a Foundry in...  Global Foundries.  Germany.  So they're all over the world. It's really interesting.  Those Global Foundry ones are memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I would look at the  TSMCs in that place, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's Taiwan.  And then there's a  UMC, which is  in China.  Wow.  France.  SMIC is Beijing.  Shanghai. Tianjin.  and Shenzhen.  How did we get into this?  We fell into a Foundry hole.  Oh yeah,  did we do Google's financials yet?  I can't even remember. No.  Alphabet. Oh, we started with their cash pile.  What we didn't talk about  is their revenues.  And where is...  Where have I put that? Where have I stuck that?  I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that made it onto the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe  they announced  their Q2 earnings.  Google's...  Here's a story from Quartz.  Google's future, beyond advertising,  is starting to become  clear.  Alphabet's cash cow has always been Google.  And Google's largest revenue driver has always been  by far advertising.  July 25th, Alphabet  reported its second quarter earnings.  32.6 billion in revenue from  Google's ad business. That's a 16%  increase.  But traffic acquisition costs went up  also 12%.  In fact, traffic acquisition  costs are 22% of Google's  ad revenue.  So that's a cause perhaps  for concern. I'm not a Wall Street  analyst, so I don't really  know what this means.  Revenue from ads dwarfs  everything else. If you look at  this graph...  What else are they going to do?  Other revenues is blue.  Purple is ad revenue.  Other revenues is tainty.  And you can't even see other bets,  which is a tiny little sliver  below that.  But ad revenue is doing very, very well.  It's still a good business for Google,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right? It's still a good business,  but it's not growing.  So you look at that and you say, oh,  is it kind of plateauing?  So the other thing to look at,  their margins. How are the margins doing?  Are they shrinking? Are they... Wall Street liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their stock went up. Was pumped quite a bit,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  as I remember. I think that just as  advertising is challenged in media,  it's also challenged in the platforms.  And the form of advertising  is not forever.  So I think...  Well, that's where other bets is really important, right?  Google and Facebook are vulnerable.  The ad industry itself  is suffering. Being an agency right now is no fun.  Other bets,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which includes Waymo,  the health sciences, Verily, their  internet. These are all money  losers. Other bets lost almost a billion  dollars. That's an increase of 35%.  Generating a mere  162 million in  revenue. Over the last eight  quarters, over the last two years, other  bets has lost 6.6  billion dollars. So  I don't know what this court's headline  really means. Doesn't sound like anything but  ads are making money for  Google.  Yeah. Yeah.  Maybe... Okay, so  Nest cameras, Pixel phones,  Play Store revenues,  Google Cloud services.  Company posted 4.25 billion  for that business line compared to 6.2  billion...  Oh, I'm sorry. Last year was 4.25 billion.  This year it was 40% higher.  So yes, it is coming up. 6.2  billion in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  its hardware division. And when they come up  with a new Chromebook Pixel, I'm sure  it'll go up another billion dollars. When  are you going to do that, guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was it last week?  Neither of you were here last week and we had a  whole thing on Chromebooks.  Of course, because you had Dr. Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The king of Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin Toffels and Jason Howell  loves his Chromebook too. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't remember. I ignore it when it comes to  Chromebooks. I'm sorry.  I was like, oh, I do enough to be like,  oh, Jeff would be so excited. They were talking about LTE  on Chromebooks, which I know is your

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  thing. Here's an interesting change in  strategy from Google. They're kind of following  the OnePlus  marketing model. They're starting to just talk about  their phones, even though the Pixel 4 won't  be out until later this fall.  They're already releasing  information about the Pixel 4.  This is a Google blog  post. As we shared last month, Pixel 4  is in the works. Today, we're giving you an early  look at the technology  behind two new features.  I like this. I do too. Instead of doing the  Apple, oh, you can't know. It's all going to  be a surprise. Google's saying,  let's talk about it. Maybe you'll be more interested in what we've got.  And get some excitement built up.  Motion Sense. For the past five years,  the advanced technology and projects teams,  ATAP has been working on Soli,  S-O-L-I. That's a  motion sensor radar.  We've got a miniature version  at the top of the Pixel 4. It's not  in a notch, by the way. The Pixel 4  will not have a notch. It's just going to have a big  bezel up at the top. Hallelujah.  It senses small  motions around the phone,  combining unique software  algorithms with advanced hardware sensor  to recognize gestures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's figure out where this is  going to go next. Because I figured that basically  what's going to happen is people are going to look stupid in a whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  new way. They're going to be waving at their phone  to skip songs,  news alarms,  silence phone calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is not for  that. This is for  everything else. What does this thing stand for on your phone?  This is for, imagine  yourself in front of your  Google Nest Hub,  whatever the heck it is, the smart display.  You're moving  through your recipe that you're working on. You're moving  through your songs. Oh, that's a good idea. You don't have to say,  hey Google, do this. Oh, sorry, everyone.  I'm so sorry.  And then, so  that's one. Two, think about it in  your car. And so  where we're going to see this, they're putting  this on phones as a test. They're also doing  it, I had said it was for economies of scale,  but no one actually buys Pixel. So they're just  doing it to give developers access to it  in a format. It will be available in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Android. So it is,  as the Pixel really should be, a reference  design for what other phone  manufacturers might be doing. And like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  when Soli first came out,  I was excited about it, and I still am.  This is interesting for robotic vision.  So for robots, being able  to like, understand,  so the ultrasonic sensor, the radar  sensor that's in there, gives  it fine grained understanding  of movement, which means it can  understand where a person  is in space much  better than using cameras. And it's  not. I love it. Look, we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  looking for new user interfaces,  voice is one, gestures  makes a lot of sense.  Should I introduce the  conspiracy theory at this point?  The other thing that will be very useful  for Google is it's another  kind of camera.  It's not a camera. No, it's another  kind of camera. It's radar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's pulling in data  about where a person is in space,  but it's actually much less granular  and fine grained than a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think about it. It can be used for identification  as well. Gate, one of the things  Google has already pioneered is  gate recognition.  I think that Google has interests.  Cameras doesn't just have to be  a visual picture of what's around you.  I think a radar of what's around  you might be of equal interest to  Google. And the more sensors they have  on that phone, the better they can gather  information. They also say they're going to add  Face Unlock, which of course  Apple pioneered here.  They say the Pixel 4  will proactively  unlock faces even  if you don't lift your phone.  If the Face Unlock  sensors and algorithms recognize you,  the phone will open the minute you pick it up.  It's already  recognized you. It just hasn't unlocked until  you tell the phone, I want  to use you. Face Unlock  works in almost any orientation, even if  it's upside down. And you  can use it for secure payments and app authentication  too. This is a little bit of, let's  do what Apple's doing. So Benedict Evans,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  who's a brilliant analyst at  Andreessen Horowitz,  wrote a piece, I just put it in the rundown  this month,  arguing that,  talking about computers that can see  how a huge number of cameras  that are being produced are not produced to  make anything for us human beings to work at.  I agree. Right? Yes.  And that's where the notion  of vision goes.  It's a lot of Stacey's world, right Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. And I've,  in the last two or three years,  I think I've written his article several times.  Yeah. But, yes.  And  this type of technology, I know just a couple,  probably a few months ago, I  wrote about radar and Project Soli  and other sensor efforts  that use radar. This  is going to be super popular for  aging in place. People  are already using it to measure falls.  There's a good use, yeah.  There's the conspiracy theory, yes,  but this is for most  people way less intrusive  because, and this has always  been the case, people worry about  images of themselves that are viewable  by other people online and searchable.  Right? We worry about cameras for that reason.  People don't think about  metadata that can equally  understand that when a computer  knows that, you know, I am doing  something embarrassing, it doesn't bother  me because it's a computer. As long as  the computer, and people don't think about the fact  that the computer can say, oh,  these engage,  this particular, this set of metadata means  Stacey's picking her nose right now.  You know, as long as that's not visually out there on the internet,  I don't care. What happens in Intel  stays in Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, but I would submit that that's a  typical human-centric point of view,  but not a very informed point of view.  Which is what Stacey's saying. It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying. I'm saying that people  think that's great, but what's  really happening is that metadata  about my falls or me picking  my nose or whatever, that is  going to be turned into  Stacey picks her nose. Let's  market her some, I don't know what products  nose pickers have. But  so, the information  is still going to be out there. Well, it's also face recognition. Radar

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  makes, in fact, Apple has  basically that kind of 3D sensing  built into its iPhone face ID.  Face recognition with the 2D  still images isn't as good as 3D  images. No, they don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  use radar. They don't they use  a, is it a time of flight  depth sensor?  Time of light? Time of flight?  Time of flight. It is not. Time of flight.  What type of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not, it's not LiDAR.  It's the same thing. It's not LiDAR because they're thinking  of adding LiDAR into iPhone. Apple bought

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  an Israeli company called PrimeSense that  developed this initially for Microsoft's  Kinect. It,  the Kinect, and  it's the same technology in the Apple iPhone, I should  point out, can tell your heart rate.  Right. So, with the Kinect,  for instance, when you're exercising,  they've taken, Microsoft  stopped selling it for a reason  I don't fully understand. But there are three different  technologies that give you depth. They can tell if you're exercising hard enough because  your heart rate at distance  is not fast enough. This  kind of technology is very useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, but my quibble  with you is there are three different types of  technologies that allow for depth perception. It's not radar.  Radar is one of them, but  I don't think that's the one that Apple's using.  Sorry. No. Mine is, I'm arguing with you  on a purely tech basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, Apple, and in fact, Apple even  demonstrated this when they introduced Face ID.  It sends out an infrared  light, which they bounce off your face,  which detects the contours of your face.  So, it's not technically time  of flight, but it's very similar to that kind of  So, suppose Google  Time of flight uses math.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's face recognition is supposed to be different.  The story is about it. Right, because they didn't have the patent.  But it's supposed to be better.  Apple owns prime sense. How does that look?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they just have to do something different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't even have to pick it up to your face.  They can do it from different angles and upside down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple had to struggle  a little bit when it first came out with Face ID  at doing it at different, you know, and if  the camera's rotated.  They've mastered that. It does it  now. I'm dreading it.  Well, I want to point out that  there's some value to it  for unlocking or sensing or gestures.  But I wouldn't be  You've got to remember how Google  thinks about this. They don't go, they're not rubbing  their hands gleefully saying, and while we're doing  that, we can also sense your heart rate  and all these other things. They think of the cell  as a general benefit. We will know more  about you and we can deliver more services  as a result. But I should point out  as you have, Stacey, that it is  much more information than a 2D picture  can give you.  And can be used in a variety of ways.  And we don't yet know what kinds of ways.  Google did point out  that just like Apple, they're going to store  all that face recognition in  a secure enclave chip  within the Pixel 4. So it won't be  Right. It will be local. Which is exciting.  Yeah. So that's good news.  What is  important also to point out, and we  always point this out with Apple, is they may  store the  raw data of your fingerprint  or your Face ID on the phone and  never send it to Apple.  But they absolutely  send out the processed  information later  that they know.  And they even admit to this,  yeah, we don't have your fingerprint, but we know  the information  that that generates. And I think that Google  would do the same thing for a variety  of reasons. Oh, here. I found

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a paper for the super  nerds. I'm going to put it in the chat. Here is  the SIGGRAPH paper from 2017  on how Soli works.  There you go.  Thank you. And I am reading  it right now to figure this out.  It's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't have to do it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's okay. I'm like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this is how I know this stuff.  I read lots of papers. Yeah, I bet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you do. Yeah.  Oh, yeah. Let me ask you about that  for a second. How many

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  do you have to subscribe to a lot of  academic journal

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  databases? I subscribe to no academic  journals. What I do is I pay attention  for like Hot Chips or SIGGRAPH,  which just happened.  And a lot of companies, if  I talk to them, they'll just send  me the papers, their white papers.  Because, I mean, it's  really rare that they're interviewing a  journalist and the journalist gets so excited  about what they're doing that they're like,  can I see your white paper? Can I see your research?  And then I go on Archive, which is  like my favorite place ever.  But that's for AI research more than  research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's  see. Google is stopping  people on the street and giving  them five dollars. Just relax.  Just relax.  They are, this is, they say  to perfect their Pixel  4 Face ID feature, because of course  you need the data before you  can make Face ID work reliably.  Google has said that.  It was initially  reported by  Chris Matizic in  ZDNet.  He said,  I think he was in Washington Square Park in the city,  Hi, I work for Google, somebody said,  and we're collecting data to improve the next generation  of facial recognition  phone unlocking.  You need to hold the phone  in selfie mode in front of your face, moving  it around to analyze every feature of your appearance,  and then we'll give you a five dollar Amazon or  Starbucks gift card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're disclosing, it's fine.  They're saying, what's what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And companies need to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They could do it surreptitiously. They could just put a camera out  and do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that wouldn't get them the measurements they need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, five or six cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, here's what they could do.  They could put out an app saying,  hey, if you scan your face  for us, we'll send you, we'll tell you what you look like  when you'll be 20.  Google says, although  Google did this with their  art thing. Yeah, remember that? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microsoft's done it too. Microsoft did  the aging thing.  When it comes to the data the company's already gathered from  the compensated volunteers, Google is  allowing them to decide what ultimately happens  to it. Although face samples  inherently can't be anonymous, says  Google, each participant is assigned  an abstract identity number.  We separately keep each participant's  email address in order to remove  data upon request. That's probably a GDPR  requirement.  Participants previously agreed to allow  Google to keep  they should call themselves Doodle.  Google to keep their face data for five  years. Now they're cutting it down after  the publicity to  18 months. Once they've analyzed, they don't need  it. Yeah, they don't need it.  The Pixel 4 will not  send your data to Google for its face recognition  to work.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I should reiterate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that. You're calm today. This is good.  I'm always calm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it weird? Maybe Jeff has  a calming influence on you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not  any different than I always am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or do you have a calming influence on  Jeff? Exactly the same.  Even Jeff seems calm.  You just wait!  Let's talk about section 203.  Let's not rev him up.  230. 230.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't get me going.  Let's talk about the quality.  Medium is down.  I'll have to talk to the  author about what's wrong  with tech journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it down?  There was a very good paper that I saw  presented at an academic conference  in Medium.  It came back up.  By Axel Bruns, who's an academic at the University  of Queensland.  He pokes  holes, rather considerable,  gigantic wormhole holes,  in the notions and metaphors  of the...  It's on Buzz Machine.  Your blog is never down.  Don't jinx me.  In the idea of the filter bubble and the echo chamber.  And does a very good  literature read going through all the literature  that says, folks, it doesn't  really exist, but these metaphors are being  used. And the metaphors are not at all  defined, so we don't have any  mechanism to argue about it, or measure  it, or understand what this impact is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So define, before we go too much  farther, what is commonly believed  to be the echo chamber in the filter  bubble. They become

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  almost synonymous. Eli Pariser used  the term filter bubble. Eli Pariser argued that filter bubble  is that if you went into search,  and you and I would get... Because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  search is, and the way Google  does it anyway, is  modified based on your previous  searches, you're going to tend  to get, eventually over time,  the same results. That was the argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Though Axel Bruns points to research  that says that wasn't the case, except for  within a nation, you had similar  search results, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you and I... Maybe even within a zip code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. It has to be as big  as a nation. Yeah, you have different languages  and so on, so you have different search. But  in Google search and Google news,  this research showed, because it's actual  research. So this sent me on to  an argument, and I'm a  fake academic, I'm no academic, I'm just a  journalism teacher, but  among the real academics  who are doing the kind of papers that  Stacey reads, that really matter,  there's a standard and  discipline of evidence.  And we don't have that in journalism.  So I end up ranting  about the quality of technology journalism.  It went from full utopian to full  dystopian, and things like  echo chamber and filter bubble  bubble up to become just presumed.  This exists. Without any effort  to even do a literature search, and  see what exists in the evidence, and then  regulation and legislation is going to pop  out of that, and we're just  irresponsible in my field, so I complain  about that. I thought I'd get a lot of crap from people like you,  but so far I haven't.  And I think  we have a problem in the tech journalism world  that we haven't really dealt  with. But it's not just tech journalism.  It's all of journalism. It's humans.  We should  be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, better journalism, of course.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  We have to...  More data is always good, but the challenge with  journalism, and you can call it a filter bubble,  you can call it whatever you want, is we are writing  stories for people.  And people are story and narrative  oriented. And Jeff, you have some book,  some academic book that talks about this.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How history gets things wrong, the neuroscience  of our addiction to stories. Yes.  That... But, Stacey, that doesn't mean the story  has to be factless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But people... Journalists do  look for facts. We just look for  facts in the context in which we  have today, which  may be... Which is driven by a narrative.  I mean, how do you find your  stories? I tell you how... I mean, I find my  stories because people talk to me about things  they've noticed. But I know, Stacey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know that you, because you're a good  journalist and responsible journalist,  attempt to escape the confines  of your preconceived notions when  you're doing research for your stories. And you have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  context. I do. And that's... You do it in the show, Stacey.  You bring in context, as you just did  to Leo three minutes ago. Yeah.  No, no, no, no, you're getting all that wrong, because you have the experience  in the context. But, okay,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but here, and I... You're right.  I've done this. This is why I talk to engineers  more than I talk to people. Or,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  okay, that was wrong. They're going to love hearing  that construct. Sorry, PR

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  people is really... I'm afraid...  Normal people, people who don't  look at data. And that's why I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Keep digging, Stacey. Keep digging.  I am more like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that than an actual person, I guess.  Anyway, the point is, engineers are my people  because we think alike. We  think in data. But I will tell  you as a journalist,  fewer people read my stories  because I don't have  the narrative and I'm not  very good at it. And  that is the challenge.  And I always call it the dead baby lead  because you lead with a dead baby to get  your story, you know,  out there. And Sarah Kiff is  actually really good at this. She does  healthcare data, for example. But  she will always... All of her stories  are super immersed in data,  but they always have... They don't always  have an actual dead baby, but they have some sort  of... Usually it's a dying  patient of some sort.  But that type  of journalism is really rare. It's really hard.  It's really expensive.  And people don't...  I mean...  And honestly, I don't  think it actually drives page views,  which is the advertising metric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Leo's point is right. You're not giving  yourself sufficient credit for the good job that you  do in journalism.  What I'm talking about here is that you come...  Look at the  red wine will kill you, red wine will save you  stories. Right? That's an example  about how we just simply  understand and report on science the way  we should be reported on. That there are strings  of bits of research  that test out various  hypotheses  and that add up to something, but the story  doesn't add up to it. Or when we say  when there's this presumption that there's a filter bubble  and it's never tested. That you  do stories about, oh my god, we're all in a filter bubble.  This is the roots of all of our problems  in society right now. And then you have academic  research at easy reach  to just do a simple search to say  uh oh, actually no.  The filter bubble's been debunked.  But it's been debunked in a different role of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  academic. And that's the problem.  So I would say, one,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  when people start talking about the filter bubble,  we've been talking about the filter bubble before there was  academic research about it. So people  start estimating  that this is out there. If you're actually at the cutting  edge, people are estimating that these things happen, especially  in the social sciences. And then  the research comes out and either backs it up  or doesn't back it up. So  I think there's,  social science research is hard.  And it's usually after the fact, after  we've started writing articles about it.  Empirical science that  you can measure, even that  is called into question. So those red wine studies  are difficult because you'll have an  article or you'll have a  study come out one year  that says this and then another one  that says that. And I think another  thing that's hard for  journalists reporting on science is they  don't understand science.  They don't understand  how studies  should be written.  And I think, and  like, they don't understand the difference between a control  group or maybe an overview study.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is my fault in journalism school that we don't  teach them. Yeah, we gotta do that.  Let me give you a few facts from  Bruns. Our study,  I'll give you a few studies, let's say, right?  So two studies  looking at already divisive topics like  abortion, vaccination, Obamacare, gun control, and found  of course their divisive online. Then they  looked at other topics that people argue  about like Game of Thrones and food porn  and found that they didn't lead to  polarization online. So is the problem that  online creates the divisiveness  or we just bring the divisiveness online?  Another one, social media users  quoting here, generally encounter  a greater diversity of news sources  than non-users do. So that's the  echo chamber argument. Oh no, we're just  in our filter bubble, we don't know crap. Another one,  those users frequenting the most  extremely partisan conservative  sites in the United States  have been found also to be  more likely than ordinary  users to visit the New York Times.  Another one,  exposure to highly partisan  political information, I'm again quoting,  does not come at the expense of contact with other  viewpoints. These  are things that are not hard to find.  And I will confess here  that I'm very ashamed of myself that I never  learned, no one ever taught me in journalism  school, no one ever taught me in a newsroom ever  to go and do a search  of academic research to find out what facts  were. And yeah, we didn't have  Google Scholar before and we didn't have J  Storr, we didn't have other things. But I'm saying  now that  the next time I see a journalist do the  lazy filter bubble story, I'm on their

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  rear end. I have to say that  there's two things that work here. First of all,  the reason  people believe in the filter bubble  is because it makes sense to them.  So it's one of,  and I think we do this all the time, we don't  look for studies or facts,  it just, oh, that makes sense.  Same with the vaccination story. It makes sense.  To some people it makes sense. Yeah, it kind of makes sense.  And then,  and it's hard for a journalist because  if you  constantly saying,  well wait a minute, but let's look at the facts, what  makes sense to you is wrong,  you end up sounding like  you're harping. You sound,  I don't think you'll be a popular journalist  for very long. And so  this has to be done. As Bernie Sanders would say.  Well, nobody  likes Bernie either.  I mean, that's a  problem and it's a problem. Journalists  are, yes, of course,  it's a higher calling and  all that, but ultimately it's a business.  It's a profession. But that doesn't mean you then say  you must go. You need to build an audience. And if  the audience gets angry, because  every time you come on, you say something  that bursts their bubble.  So we should go with the falsity? Screw it?  No, but you have to do it carefully.  Here's an easier reputation  for you. And you can't do it every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As a journalist, as  both a newsroom journalist who had  only one story due every day, god,  you remember being a daily journalist and people were like,  that's so hard because you have to write a story every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you could read the newspaper in the morning. It was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, crazy.  But now, in being a blogger who's  had a story and even occasionally only  have to do one story a week, which is crazy.  Academic  papers suck.  They're hard to read.  They're hard to understand. They're expensive  to find and access, even with things  like Google Scholar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can even find studies that completely  contradict one another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, of course.  Yes. And in  the world of academia, it's hard to  know who's legit  and who isn't. So I have to quote  academic sources every now and then for  some of my articles. And  if you get the wrong academic,  everyone else in the academic  circles are laughing at you and they're like,  and they'll come out of the woodworks. They're not just  laughing at you. They're usually telling you what an idiot  you are.  And you also have to deal with  people who think that their  minor disagreements  really matter  when to the  bigger picture and world at large.  You're like, eh, it doesn't.  True that.  And that's asking  a lot of someone who's not paid very  much and who is also trying to juggle  a lot of other things.  That's my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But as a journalism teacher, I think  that... Well, you should always hold

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the highest standard. Yeah, you should totally  tell them to go do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, the head of research at our school teaches this, but I haven't  been teaching this and I need to. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you're right. Yeah.  But I think you also have to address  the real politic  of it all, which is you can't be the guy  who's always bursting people's bubbles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you don't back up the bubble  when the bubble is BS. Don't back up the bubble.  Don't back up the bubble. That would be a show  title, but we've far  beat it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see. Let's take a break and come back with  our change log. We've got  Picks of the Week still to come as well.  And we do want to wrap this up in the next 15  minutes so that you can get to the debate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're fine. We've got a half an hour.  We're okay. Okay. I know you're trying to get rid  of me, but you're stuck with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by  Captera. If you're in business,  it's so common. It's almost  universal. In fact, I just read a study  we were talking about on Windows Weekly this morning.  One third of all businesses are still  running at least one  Windows XP machine.  Of course they are. And I can almost  promise you the reason they run that Windows XP  machine is because that critical,  super important line of business  program that they got written back in 1992  will only run  on Windows XP and  they're stuck with it. That's why people  still use Internet Explorer 8.  Still use Flash,  Active Desktop. But really,  honestly,  there is great software,  modern software, better  software out there if you could only  find it. And that's why our sponsor  really is helpful, Captera.  Captera is the leading free  online resource  to help you find the best modern  software for your business.  And by the way, I think if you've  done this, you know that, well, the first  thought maybe is Google it.  Because that's just a bunch of results  that are going to be all over the place. Ask a  friend, but he is not going to know every...  Captera is amazing. Captera  is a search engine, in effect,  with 700 categories  of business software and everything.  I mean, from project management to email marketing,  customer relation management,  mailing list management,  but also line  of business software,  jail management software. You've found  a good one. You got to manage a jail?  Jail tracker. Actually,  it doesn't have to be jail tracker. Could be  eLogger. Could be... Turns out,  there are half a dozen,  maybe more, offender management  system, jail  management programs out there.  Well, that's amazing.  First, in custody. First  of all, now we know there's some. But what  here, what's great is you can then narrow it  down by  the number of stars it's got,  by how it delivers  itself. Is it local? Do you put it on your hard drive  or is it a web-based  solution? How many seats it supports?  Whether, you know, it can make  appointments, all the different features you might want.  Narrow it down. You can compare side  by side up to four.  But then the best part,  I'm kind of amazed that there's  this many jail management programs  out there. Then the best part is  you can read the reviews.  There are almost a million verified  real reviews by  real users on captera.com.  This is incredible.  There's a thousand new reviews every single  day. That means in the  next, I don't know, three weeks they're going to get  over a million. And that's fantastic.  That means  you're not only going to find the right software,  you're going to see what people who are using it right now  say about it. Unbiased,  real reviews from real people.

Are you excited?  Are you interested in this T-Mobile  Sprint merger? Looks like it might  be going forward. There's still a few hurdles.  Why not?  I think what's really interesting, and I mentioned  this on Twitter, is Charlie Ergen.  He is  quite a character.  He's the founder of Dish.  Dish is the big beneficiary  on this.  So Charlie is a very interesting  fellow. Great profile about  him in the Wall Street Journal. I've met Charlie. I've  done his show Charlie Chat  on Dish.  He was a professional poker  player for many years.  Then an analyst at Frito-Lay. He decided  to quit his job at Frito-Lay, joined with another  poker player friend. They  ponied up $60,000 to  start a business selling big  satellite dishes, the 10-meter dishes  in Denver.  Eventually, he founded  the Dish Network, selling those hubcap  sized dishes,  going right up against the cable  TV business and winning.  That $60,000 investment  is now worth $9 billion.  That's his stake in the Dish Network.  One thing Charlie's been doing,  so he's a really interesting fellow.  He's kind of a character.  One thing he's been doing is buying up  Spectrum and not using it.  Much to the dismay of T-Mobile,  Sprint, AT&T, Verizon,  and the FCC, he's been  collecting Spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He has been the biggest Spectrum  speculator out there for the longest time.  And one of the more litigious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he's buying it,  holding onto it, and it sits there  as a dead asset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, although he would argue  that he is using it, or  he has always had plans to use it,  and various things keep getting in the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody knew that Dish was  going to do this at some point, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. And, you know,  he's in  a really interesting space because  right now with 5G,  so having access to both  dishes on people's homes and  millimeter wave Spectrum,  which he has, he  can actually build a viable  network, which is, I mean, this is exactly  how AT&T and Verizon,  or how Verizon specifically is doing their  5G to the home network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But even better, and he even says this in this Wall Street Journal piece,  he said, wow, when I  build LTE, just have to rip it out,  when 5G comes along,  he's been thinking all along, I'll start  with 5G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think he's actually been,  he's had the Spectrum, and he's made some interesting  Spectrum trades over the years, too.  I think he's positioning to be in  a space where he can actually offer a  compelling service to compete with these guys  where  he doesn't have to compete against their Spectrum  holdings, which have been superior historically.  He's also doing an NBIOT  network. What's that?  NBIOT, it's a  standard,  it's a cellular standard that  sends very tiny bits of data out,  and you can,  yeah, it's just tiny bits of data.  Microchip Bluetooth

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Internet of Things.  So, a couple  of things I think are interesting. Yes, he may  have just been, he may  come out as one of, as, like,  he was accidentally smart,  right? It may be he didn't have this strategy.  No, no, I think he was very, very smart. I think he knew what he was  doing, but you can't be sure. Yeah, I think he was very smart.  I think he reminds me a little of Elon Musk,  maybe Jeff Bezos, as one of those  guys who's willing to take  the long shot. I think this, I think he's a  poker player. He's pushed  his chips. All these table guys are poker players.  They're poker players, and I think  he knew he was taking a big risk. He's taking a huge risk.  They say, he says it's going to  cost him $10 billion to build  this network. This is not... Did you explain

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  how this comes out of the  Verizon deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When he gets out? Of the Sprint T-Mobile, yes.  So in order to... So this is what's fascinating,  and this is from the Wall Street Journal piece.  He's sitting there,  sitting on all these assets,  just sitting, and all of a sudden,  John Lenger at T-Mobile is told by the Department of  Justice, we're not going to let this go through  unless you can somehow  figure out a way to create a credible fourth  carrier. John Lenger goes,  how am I going to do that?  Thinks of Charlie. He says,  he calls up Charlie with,  they made this deal in three weeks,  and Charlie's going to get  the  Sprint PCS  MVNO business, which is  Metro PCS. He's going to get T-Mobile's  boost, another  MVNO style, although it's owned  by those companies. So part of the  reason he needs that is because he has  a deal that he has to be up and running  as a wireless carrier by next year.  So he is. They just give him these  businesses. It may not be  a very good business. It may not be  a very big business, but he's satisfied the  requirement.  So that gives him a little breathing  room so that he can then start building  this $10 billion  5G network. You know what? He could  fail miserably. He knows he could fail  miserably. This could be a huge  gamble, and he  pushes in all his chips and he has to walk  with the table. So what else did he get from T-Mobile?  He got a lot of spectrum, but  I don't know if it's valuable spectrum. Maybe  Stacey knows that better than I  do. I'm looking at

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  their current spectrum holdings  before the acquisition. I can go look.  I haven't seen their... Essentially

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this was mandated by the Department of  Justice. They said, look, in order to  approve this merger, you've got to create a  credible  fourth carrier. And  this was actually a very clever  way to do it. Under the merger, Dish  will rent capacity from T-Mobile  for the new T-Mobile, which is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  combined... Which by the way, is who'd be run by whom?  T-Mobile. No, by which CEO?  Ledger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, Sprint's out of the... Now, I don't  know what happens to SoftBank's investment in Sprint.  I guess they probably still have a piece of  the combined companies. Deutsche Telekom  owns a big piece of, if not all  of T-Mobile. So these are actually...  Don't think, even though these companies were  struggling, especially Sprint, that  they are not well funded. They've got SoftBank  behind them. They've got Deutsche Telekom.  After seven years  of using T-Mobile's  capacity, Dish will now run its own  network using all that  spectrum he's been acquiring  and its own equipment installed on fewer  towers. So  it's a very  interesting play. I think  Charlie... I love watching people like  Elon Musk as crazy as they are  because they're willing  to play at a level, a wild west  level, that most  corporate CEOs in America  just aren't willing to do.  And you know what? Elon  wants to put 12,000 low-earth  orbit satellites up to create  global internet,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  gigabit internet. I also love it  when the third point, when Ledger  goes after his competitors and  pokes them. Well, and that's why we needed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  somebody because Charlie's the new John Ledger.  So if it weren't for T-Mobile,  I don't think we'd have the deals we have  from Verizon and AT&T by  any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, okay, Dish  is actually going to get part of Sprint's 800  megahertz spectrum, which is  awesome. And  Dish already has 600  and 700 megahertz spectrum.  So they have  really... So who cares  about 5G and their stupid millimeter wave?  It's got stuff that is going to  actually go through walls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Relatively low frequencies go through walls. And that's really  what's key. These are the old TV  spectrum that, remember, when the  digital moved to digital, they had to give up those  700 megahertz spectrum. That's what he has.  So that is...  Yeah, that's going to be a better cell phone  service than these other guys can offer.  Is it cell phone or is it data?  I doubt they very much... That'll be data.  It'll all be data. They're not going to do...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so he can't do massive amounts of data  because I think he's only got a 20  megahertz total in  that band, which...  So the width of  your channels is what allows you  is the limiting factor on how many  bits per hertz you can...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the other thing I think Charlie's betting on  is that... Remember we were talking about how  hard these giant corporate mergers are  when you have two different cultures,  you have two different technologies?  I think he's betting that T-Mobile  is going to be struggling integrating Sprint's  customers, Sprint's network into their  network. It's the store. It's going to  be a mess. And I think he's saying to himself  that gives me a decade to  build out something better. He also  says he wants to  disintermediate the phone companies.  He says...  He says...  Yeah, everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  wants to disintermediate the phone companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, of course. But he's  in that business now.  He says...  He's starting from behind in  the cell phone game, but he argues it gives him an advantage.  Their legacy is a mishmash.  Their networks are plaid.  We will be a solid color.  You got to like this guy.  He also says he sees some opportunity  with car companies offering 5G  to self-driving cars.  He's going to target those businesses.  Does this affect his core

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  dish business? Pardon me? Does it affect  his core dish business? Does he

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  deliver... I think it integrates with his core business, right?  Those dishes can be used...  Can they be used? Are they the  right frequencies? I think they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So your satellite dishes,  given the spectrum he owns,  he doesn't need to worry about that.  So he'll be fine having...  He does have to have space on towers.  That's going to be tricky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where the $10 billion comes in,  I would imagine. He also says he wants  to offer something called on-demand pricing,  charging less in the middle of the night.  I think what Charlie's looking at  is a B2B  business. Not so much  the consumer business with B2B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's a whole... Yeah, so dish  and Twilio and, oh gosh,  even Arm is getting into this.  There is a whole business right now to be had  in saying,  I'm going to give you  internet access for your  things. Again, it's IoT.  And it's because a company like BMW,  for example, doesn't want  to have to do deals with AT&T and Verizon  and Deutsche Telekom and everybody.  They want one throat  to choke, basically. And they want to  have SLAs  that work for them when they're  talking to their customer.  And that's... It's going to be a huge  business. The carriers know it.  Everybody knows it. Everybody's trying really hard.  And we'll see who wins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just a fascinating story. Great piece in  the Wall Street Journal about Charlie Ergen.  And I think we're going to  have a lot of fun over the next decade watching this  play out. Now, is this bad for  consumers? Losing  two... You know, combining  two into one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes, because T-Mobile has gotten better.  Sprint has kind of failed.  I feel like we would have lost

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sprint anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We kind of have. I mean,  who's on Sprint today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like them together will be better at  fighting AT&T and Verizon. That's kind of my  thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I've been rooting for  this merger. And even if  their service is very good, as  Ledger did before, they'll poke  them so hard that we'll get better deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a T-Mobile fan. I'm a  John Ledger fan. And I also  think that Charlie wants  to take over the role of the industry  iconoclast and the poker.  And I think Charlie's a  really good person to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He'll be the Craig McCaw this decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Craig McCaw's a great analogy.  He was the guy who created the cell phone business  basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wireless... I think  one of my first stories for GigaOm was actually  like, to be in wireless, you need to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ballsy.  It's crazy.  It's crazy business.  We'll watch.  It's not over. There are  I think a dozen state attorneys general  who are still suing, saying  it's anti-competitive. I wonder  if those lawsuits will disappear  now that the DOJ has said,  well, we think it's competitive if they do this,  this, and this.  Interesting.  Let's do that  thing with the trumpets and the drums. It's time for the  Google Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Google Change Log.  So Carsten has to hit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like four buttons to make that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very complicated.  There's a steam engine involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there not a macro we can have for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. That macro is named Carsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We probably could automate it,  but I don't. I like watching  him scramble.  I enjoy that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like an octopus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like, ah, ah, ah.  I didn't think he did the jello. No, he's actually using gesture

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what we need. We need  gesture control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We need a way to punch Leo, and we need  a way to make Carsten's life less miserable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got me here today.  Uh-oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that means you've got to be  nice to me. Have you had any reason  to want to punch me to this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Give me a minute, sweetie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He punches good.  Google Chrome  76 is here  and it does a number of interesting things  including block, flash.  It also has an  interesting feature that paywalls  won't like.  It turns out in Chrome, you know, they have this  incognito mode, but a lot of sites  have figured out a way to bypass  incognito mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Recognize you're in incognito  and then come after you and say, ah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there are a number of sites that will say  no incognito visits  because we don't get any information about you.  So Google has reestablished  the power of the incognito

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mode. We go back to flash for a second.  So when I try to watch  MSNBC,  I've got to go through this  whole magilla every time where I have  to say it's okay  to do flash like three times. MSNBC

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  uses flash?  Okay, well, they need to fix  that. That's really what this will do.  Nobody will be able to see it.  I mean flash...  Ironically though, when I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  want to do Google Hangouts, if I want  to take a picture of me, I have to  enable flash. Really?  Which is, yeah, so like, you know how  and maybe this won't happen for much  longer, but there's an option  for you to take a picture of what you're doing right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at this on MSNBC.  No flash detected. Adobe Flash is required  to watch our live video. Please visit  Adobe.com to activate  Adobe Flash in five easy  steps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Five easy steps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, I'm on a Chromebook  so it won't work. It won't work. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so then it tries to go in here and  tell me to do it there. Then I've got to do it up here.  So that's just ridiculous. There's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  absolutely no reason in this day and age  why any website should be streaming via  flash. Did you hear that, Ms. Missy? I know you're watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you hear that? But why does Google  use it for hangouts? Go to Google Hangouts  and click the little attach a photo  thing and if you use your web camera,  boom. Really? Get the same  message. Yeah. I'm looking  at it right now. That's weird. Just to  make sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't know.  Google better fix

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that, Google. Different teams, but  still, I'm like, it's so baffling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hmm. Hmm. Okay.  Sorry. We're actually doing a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  changelog. I don't know anything about that.  The reason you might want to use incognito mode  is to bypass that counter that  says you've already had your five free.  And so if you, if they're not  saving a cookie, they wouldn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which by the way, the counters lie  regularly. There are sites that I have never gone  to in life. You go to it and it says

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  oh, you've already seen your three articles.  It works though, because I've ended up paying for  Bloomberg, which I really didn't want to do, because that's  $35 a month. I've ended up paying for Wired.  I was willing to do that.  $35 a month? Bloomberg really  rakes you over the coals. But I mean,  it's a business expense. It's a necessity.  And so, you know, I do  it, but jeez, I hate. If every  website charged $35 a month,  I'd be broke. I mean, we use so many  different websites. Anyway,  Google has fixed  that  incognito mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Define fix, Mr. President.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now you can go to the Boston Globe  or the New York Times and read as many articles as you want.  Okay, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically, it doesn't  tell  people you're using incognito.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the problem, and it's been doing that for  years. And so, stop it,  Google. You know, I will show  you another useful tip, if  you want to know a useful tip.  Remember I was talking last week  or two weeks ago about using StartPage  .com.  If you, if you, on the StartPage  site, I'm  going to go search for New York Times. Remember, these  are Google search results. So it's  going to give me the same results I would get  on every link. And I should have mentioned this.  There is a, every search result,  there's an anonymous view. If I click  that,  it goes through a  kind of a Tor style  anonymizer that  means it's all reset.  So I don't use this because I pay for the  New York Times. I don't use this to bypass, you know,  any paywalls. But it does,  that is a very nice way, if you want to  go to a site and not have them know anything about  you. Actually, I can demonstrate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, that's the creepiest  technology story. Oh, the Epstein story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He wanted to freeze his  head and his organs.  He wanted to spread his DNA through man-to-man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He wanted to impregnate 20 women with his  sperm and  host them at a ranch. Insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going back to the changelog.  So,  so,  anyway, I'll show you, if I  go right now to a site like  whoernutnet, which tells  you what your IP address is, what  your browser is, who your ISP is.  If I do that from the start page search,  it knows a lot of stuff about  me. But if I click the  anonymous view  from here, it's like Tor.  It thinks I'm from some  other spot. It thinks I'm in West Hills, United  States using Hurricane Electric.  I'm on Linux. I'm not.  So this is really a useful  tool for completely anonymizing  yourself. Better than incognito mode. If you  want to go to a site and you want to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  incognito. You've just bankrupted the news business. Thank you very much.  You're very welcome. Hurricane Electric

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is a hot potato  routing site. So it's not an  actual ISP. But if you wanted to, you  could look at that and say, oh, they're using  Hurricane Electric. That's not legit. Don't let

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  them in. Yeah, I guess they can.  Well, when they do that, we'll do something else.  If you are interested  in Google's Titan security keys,  I honestly think there are other solutions  just as good. I'm a YubiKey  fan. But if you want to get your security  keys from Google, you can now, not only in the  US, but in Canada, Japan, France, and  the UK. And I guess because  it's from Google and all of that.  But you can use Google's  super security system without  having their particular keys.  So, yeah, I actually, they had problems with the Titan  security keys, so I'm not a huge...  Now what are you saying? I saw the next  story. Android Autos  first big refresh since  debuting is starting to roll out with Jeff  Jarvis's very  favorite feature  dark mode. Now, dark mode  by default, but it's good in  your car. No, it's not.  It's so much better in your car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not. I'm going over the  bridge and I'm in a panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going over the bridge and I'm in a panic  because it's all dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going over the bridge at night  and you can't see anything  because it's so bright in your car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want the truth?  I turn off Waze when I'm going over the bridge because I don't  want to see all the blue. The blue, the water around it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is a redesigned  Android Auto. I do not have a car with  Android Auto. I wish I...actually I do, but  I don't get to drive it. That's the Chevy  Bolt. As I was saying  earlier, I still drive a car  from, oh my God, 2016.  It feels so  antiquated. It's funny how technologies  move so fast that  a car's informatics  from 2015 or 2016  seems out of date.  But that's...I wish I had

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Android Auto. And think about it this way,  the car that is being sold today, their  informatics were developed and built  and implemented in like 2015.  Yeah, that's ridiculous.  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tesla's pretty good. You have a Tesla, Stacy.  They've done a good job of keeping it up to date.  That's...I gave up  my Tesla, the lease ran out, so that's why

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm kind of suffering. I came in the parking lot here  and I thought, oh no, Leo's not here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, don't look for my car.  So, I love the story from  the information.  Google has many  OEM partners for its smart  speakers. One of them was  Huawei.  They were going to do a speaker that would come out  this fall at the IFA trade show in Berlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A smart speaker that's listening  to you all the time. Yeah, actually in a way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's kind of probably a good idea not to do a  Huawei Google smart speaker.  When can we get the new Nest  Hub Max? I want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  get that. September 9th. Well, that's when  you can order it. I don't know if it's going to ship

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the same day. I want to get that. I like the looks of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aren't you going to wait for the one  with Project Soli in it? Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Will there be? I guess there would.  If you believe me.  Then it could see everything  in 3D.  It could read your gestures.  I had that  remember the advertiser that had the  what was it? Lighthouse.  Lighthouse had the 3D  time of flight sensor and all that stuff.  So, I'm not shy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't mind. Well, that was an  actual camera. Yeah, and  the time of flight sensor.  So, you couldn't fool the camera  with weird cutouts of people moving around.  Yeah. That actually was pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't you fool it with a balloon though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that was the one that didn't get  fooled by the balloon. The Nest IQ  which is now here  got fooled by the balloon.  It kept saying there's somebody in your house.  It was Mylar Balloons.  Google is phasing out the  old voice search.  The old voice search.  Getting phased out in favor  of the new young assistant.  Okay, fine.  What's the difference to a consumer?  Not much. It looks different.  No, it doesn't. It's the same  response, you know. I have John  Legend now on all my Google  assistant stuff.  I love it. I love it. I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  cyan, I believe is the color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you use cyan? I like cyan a lot.  Yeah, they do it by color, the voices now.  That's a good tip, by the way.  I think we've mentioned it before, but  go into your settings and choose a color.  There are some very dramatic differences.  And that...  Watch this now, watch, watch Garston.  And that's the Google  changelog.  Oh, he was on it.  He was ready. Let's do the Google  changelog again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis. Oh, Jeff.  Jeff used to be the  critic for TV Guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, he's  lying on the highway.  Lower third, that's what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He used to be the critic for TV Guide.  So, did  Howard Stern pick up on that, former TV Guide  critic? No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how he knows me, because  I wrote about him. That's how he knows you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's how that all started?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I gave him a good review, and he  offered to do unspeakable things to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff has been  a former TV Guide critic for a long  time. A very long time.  Long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Spotify is doing well.  108 million paying  customers.  Total monthly active user count,  232 million.  Yeah.  For a while it looked like  Apple Music was coming on strong, might beat  Spotify. In fact, the Wall Street Journal said,  it's just a matter of time. Nope.  No, Apple Music is not even close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am weird, because I live  on Google. I still use Google Play Music.  It's fine. What am I missing? Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, I'm mad at myself, because I  went through a pruning,  and I thought, well, I've got Apple Music,  I've got Amazon Music, and I've got  Google Music. I only need one of those. I'm going to  keep Apple Music. I killed  Google Music, and I forgot that that  also was giving me YouTube Red,  or YouTube Premium, as they call it.  Now, all of a sudden, I got all these ads in my YouTube.  Oh, right.  That is worth the price of admission alone.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, that's what you're missing. So, you can watch great elephant videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what that's about.  Cute elephants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can still watch cute elephants  with ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have ads now.  I think, it's funny, because  our teenager noticed. He said,  why am I seeing all these ads on my YouTube all of a sudden?  I went, oh, shoot.  Oh, yeah. My daughter  is like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we have Hulu, because we got a special,  I don't know, a while back,  for 99 cents a month.  It's the ad version, but  I'm like, 99 cents a month. I'm  okay with it. She's like,  what are these  ads? They're stupid.  And I'm like, oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She has not seen commercial television,  has she?  Why do they keep playing  the same ad, Mommy?  Yeah, she's like, the Liberty  Mutual ones. Oh, God, I hate that emu.  That freaking emu.  That's the worms. Oh, I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do too. And you know what?  I actually looked up. I was worried that there was  animal abuse. No, it's a  CGI. They say it's animatronic. Yeah. It's a CGI

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  emu. You can't get a real  emu to peck the glass over and  over again. Come on,  man. I was worried.  It's so sad. Insurance companies are evil. It feels like  Liberty Mutual wants to be  Geico, but can't.  They just don't have the...  They need a better agency. That's all I'm saying.  Anyway...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There can only be one Geico. There can only be one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's his name? Chuck? Chuck?  Not the emu, but the guy. The guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Lemu and Chuck.  Terrible. It's awful.  70s cop show parody.  It just doesn't ring true at all.  And then there's Captain Obvious.  Is Hulu  stopped with that? Because they were running  a Captain Obvious ad every break.  Every break for Hotels.com.  It was getting so tiring.  They needed some more ads.  That's all.  We may be in a different...  YouTube premiums, $11.99  a month. I am such an idiot.  I canceled...  I was grandfathered in at the $8  a month for YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, this is what you get for all this giving things up.  I'm going to quit. I'm finished.  What was I thinking?  Well, you see what you do to yourself.  I wonder if I can go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if I say, hey, I'm sorry.  Google, will you forgive me? Please forgive me, Google.  That would be nice  if they have said, well, yeah, okay.  You can get back in at your  grandfathered price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've been just waiting for me, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like, I'm sorry, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've been waiting for me to do that.  Subscribe.  Let me just see how much it costs.  Because don't you still get YouTube premium when you subscribe  to Google Music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so, yeah. Or vice versa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Depends on how you look at it.  I should probably just resubscribe.  It's $15 a month now for the family plan.  Well, I like Google Music.  Ladies and gentlemen,  I think we should wrap this up.  I think we've gone through...  Do you have a story I've missed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just going to ask about the PHY limits,  which some people have brought up because they're upset.  Are there limits on your PHY?  You can only have four SIMs now.  Not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Data SIMs.  Oh, that's too bad because I was about to order another data SIM.  I love the... I have dozens of them.  Because you only pay for what you use.  So this news affects you.  It does affect me.  It only pays for what you use, so I was putting SIMs in everything.  My car, everything.  I wish I could put it in a Chromebook, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One day, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alright.  So this is for Stacey and her pick of the week.  And I bet you I know what it's going to be.  Is it going to be the Wyze smart plugs?  You know, someone asked me about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can make those when I pick of the week.  I had something different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've announced the pricing and pre-orders.  Yeah, I have here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me pull up the Wyze.  $15 a pair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is amazing.  I'm going to make that my pick.  Alright, you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just... I can't bring myself to buy more smart plugs.  I have so many.  You only need as many smart plugs as you have sockets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is not true.  But you can still buy them.  What would you do with more than you have sockets?  Sorry, I mean, I don't need that many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because not all of my sockets are full.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need fewer than sockets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are homes being built with smart plugs in every...  No, but homes are being built with USB ports.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  USB ports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've seen that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because that's cheap and easy.  I saw somebody on Twitter today, a friend of mine,  said that he could tell from the fresh paint smell  he was in a new room, and then he saw  that the USB port in the wall was USB-C.  That's modern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is like this year.  Living in the future.  That's so 2019.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God, I want...  Alright, so we won't mention the Wyze smart plugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is your pick?  My pick of the week, and I've mentioned this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I just shut down that window though,  so let me go get to it.  Slate does a deal with future tense.  And they have people write fiction stories.  And they're awesome fiction stories.  And they're all about...  It's like Black Mirror, but they're not all depressing.  Right?  And so they're putting them all in an anthology.  And yes, you can read all of them  online for free.  And they're all about  the future.  So, you can read them online for free.  On Slate.  But if you're just the type of person who just wants to have it  in a book or kindle format,  it won't be available until October 2nd,  but you can pre-order it now.  I love this.  My favorite story probably of all of them is  Charlie  Jane Anders  had this awesome one.  I even wrote a response to one of them.  So, that's my pick of the week.  You should totally read these. They're fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice. I love sci-fi.  I did not know that you were a sci-fi fan, however.  I'm a

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  reading fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I read everything.  I read cereal boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what? I'm on a James McWhorter  pick because of you.  Turns out...  So, you talked about his  book about the English language.  Our Bastard Tongue.  But it turns out... Remember I was telling you about  the great courses I was listening to?  That's him. It's his great course.  And then he has another book, which I found  in my searches,  about Black English, which is  really good.  It's only a few hours. It's a shorter book.  But he talks about how  it is a full-fledged language.  A lot of people think it's a form of illiteracy  or it's slangy.  It's not. It's a full-fledged language with its own  grammar and its syntax.  And it's really quite interesting. It's quite fascinating.  I highly recommend that as well. James McWhorter.  He is a linguist.  Yes, he's phenomenal.  But what is your number, Mr. Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, the  LA Times today had a  memo  leaked, perhaps, about  how their efforts to get subscriptions are not going  so well. Their goal was to get 300,000  new subscriptions this year. They have 17,000.  They got more than that,  but a lot of people were canceling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the Times... I almost  knew this because they were one of the only  daily papers to show up in Apple's  News Plus product.  The Wall Street Journal didn't do it.  The New York Times didn't do it.  The Washington Post didn't do it.  And I think because all three of them have fairly robust  digital subscription numbers,  and I kind of read that as the Times is  a little bit desperate. So, Josh Benton

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  from Neiman Lab did a great post. If you go to  the second chart here, Leo, the next one,  he looked at 2002  print circulation versus  2019 digital subs.  There are two publications where  the digital subs are higher than  the print was. The New York Times  in 2002  had 1.1 million print.  Now it has 2.7 million digital.  So, digital's been good for the Times.  Washington Post, 746,000  print  in 2002, now 1.7 million.  All the other papers  have far fewer  digital than print.  But I'll tell you why. I think the Times,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the New York Times and the Washington Post  are seen as national newspapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The LA Times, again, wants to fool  itself. It feels like a local paper.  But it's a great, it's a great metro paper.  So it now, it had  965,000, almost a million,  print circulation in 2002. Now it has 170,000  digital subs.  And they want to try to get up to a million  who knows.  The Chronicle,  San Francisco Chronicle,  had 512,000  print. Now it has 57,000  digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it just bodes poorly for  metro papers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Paywalls, at that level,  are hard to justify.  A lot of churn. So, yeah, the internet's  ruined, something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lavender Fields and  Metro Dailies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alright, here's a question for the journalists in the  house. Do we need Metro Dailies  or is it sufficient to have nationals?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we need local.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You not only need Metro, you need  like super city council

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  people. Yeah, we have the Argus Courier  in Petaluma. So they cover the city  council, you're right. My Dean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sarah Bartlett,  was core in helping  to start the city in New York,  which is the Texas Tribune of New York.  Texas  Tribune, which was founded by, I dare  say the name again, John Thornton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He didn't found it, he  just funded it, but yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway,  so, but it set a model for  non-profit journalism in the country.  But that's not going to solve every problem.  There's not enough charity, there's not enough  patronage. But,  things like the city and the Texas  Tribune give their content for free  to media around them so it helps bolster  the journalism in the ecosystem. So that's  another model that's starting up.  You know, you look at something like  Medium. I finally  think I figured out what I visited with  Medium, but I think I figured out what he's doing. He's trying to create  kind of the YouTube of text.  The YouTube of text?  I think about that in a way.  Well, there's a difference because he's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  charging subscriptions and he's pushing  I have to say I'm a little irritated  with Medium because every time I go there it says  oh, you could read more if you would just pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's only $5 a month as opposed to Bloomberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I cancel my $5 a month.  I don't like the dark patterns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It pushes content that is old.  That's what drives me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's part of his argument, Stacey, and I don't know that I agree with it  because I find it a little irritating sometimes too, but  his argument, not agreement, his argument  is that the  rabid  currency of the  web is what led to a lot of our  problems. So that he wants to  when Medium started, he didn't put  a date on the page. There was no date there, which  irritated people. But now he will surface  stuff from the past. And I will find  things I wrote a year ago will suddenly get  a comment or something. It's  kind of interesting to see how that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, that reminds me of a story we didn't do  which is the guy who invented  retweeting.  He says, we handed a loaded weapon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to four-year-olds. I thought I was going to make it safely  out of here before. Moral panic!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I have to admit, retweeting is  one of the things that makes Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so neager. No, it also brings magnificent  things. It's great. This is  pandering to  this is  I do like the heroic  pictures of him. Yeah, jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chris Weatherall  who no longer works at Twitter. He's staring at a burning  bush. Yeah, piss me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, well, I'm glad I brought it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  up then. I kind of live to piss you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  off, Jeff. I just hope I don't crash on the bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you won't. Don't think  of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I finally figured it out.  I hope. My palms are sweating, literally,  at the mention of it. But I  just try to not know where I am.  I concentrate on the car ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I discovered that years ago. And then I sing  a song. I have no idea where I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, are you driving yourself  or do you get a car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't afford a chauffeur.  We would pay for a car for you. No, no, I'd  drive it myself. I have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay. No, I was the way you  were. I'll give you a chit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I have the car in the lot. So if you'll drive that.  Karsten, can you drive the car to the city?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, he could do that. Sure.  It would be fun.  Next time, would you please let us send a car for you?  Would that be a better way for you to come?  No, it's embarrassing. It's not embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can pick you up.  I don't know if I trust

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that. Yeah, I wouldn't take a ride  from Karsten if I were you. He's driving with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the hand gestures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where's my horn?  Where's my horn? I need the horn.  Where's my horn? Jeff Jarvis  is a professor of journalism. Well, he's  not just a professor of journalism.

On the retweet machine.  Do you hit the retweet button

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey? I'm pro retweeting.  I hadn't even occurred. It  hadn't occurred to me that people are using it  for abuse, but once it did, I was  like, I tried to become more judicious about how  I used it. The president used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People use ice cream for abuse. They use everything  for abuse. Just today the president retweeted a QAnon  site, brought it to  Twitter's attention. They banned the site.  So be  careful out there.  You never know what a  retweet will do.  We do twig  every Wednesday about 1.30 Pacific  4.30 Eastern, 20.30 UTC.  You could watch live if you wanted.  Or listen live.

What is that sound?  Is there somebody grinding  stumps in your backyard, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, that is someone  I guess taking a shower right next door to me.  So now we know  what it sounds like in my little  area when someone takes a shower

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  next door. Okay, it's good to know.  Sounds a little bit like  a stump grinder.  I should, I have it turned up too  loud obviously. What was I saying?  Oh, subscribe.
