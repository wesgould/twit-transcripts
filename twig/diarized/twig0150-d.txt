It's time for Twig, this week in Google.  The show that talks about Google, the cloud.  We'll talk a little bit about Facebook as well today.  Gina Trapani is here from SmarterWhere.org.  Great to have you.  Gina.  Great to be here.  Yay.  And we only have a little bit of Jeff.  We're going to have an hour of Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't you be here as long as we can?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've got an hour plus, yeah.  An hour of Jeff.  Jeff Jarvis is here.  Where are you?  Are you at the University of New York where you normally haunt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm in Toronto and I stayed longer after meeting them, taking the last flight out so I can  be on Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you were on Air Canada.  Oh, it's a quick flight to New York though.  It's not a bad flight.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is.  It's the last flight out.  No, Air Canada, last time I was here the pilots had a wildcat strike.  Drove me absolutely batty.  So no, I flew United this time.  Next time I'll fly Porter, not Air Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I flew, I did a lot of flying on Air Canada.  Every month for four years or something I would fly up to Toronto.  I like Toronto though.  It's a great town.  I love Toronto.  It's a magnificent town.  I almost moved here twice.  Really?  Oh, you like it that much?  I don't like it that much.  Too cold.  Well, yeah.  I don't think I could.  Now we have an unusual guest.  We're going to start off with James Spann who is a wonderful fella.  He's a meteorologist.  He along with Kevin Sell, is it Sell's?  Is that how Kevin pronounces his last name?  Selly.  Kevin Sell.  He does a podcast called Weatherbrains because he's a meteorologist.  And James has done an amazing work in the past with hurricanes using Twitter and social  media.  Was this last year that you were warning people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, our big day Leo was April 27th of last year.  We had a generational tornado outbreak in which just in my state alone, the death toll  was 252 and around the region it was way over 300.  So that was April 27th of last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are the Alabama tornadoes and you're in Birmingham, right?  Yes, that's correct.  WBMA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, the ABC affiliate here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And WCFT and WJSU.  Hoover, Alabama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm actually more excited about being on Twitter than ABC.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm a Twitter fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I'm a fan of Weatherbrains because it's something about weather.  People get fascinated, addicted and hooked.  So James is doing good stuff.  I mean, yeah, he's on TV.  But by using Twitter, you were using your Twitter feed to follow the tornado's path  to warn people that the tornado was on the way.  Was it really a remarkable thing you were doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well social media is very powerful, Leo, and I think I have learned a lot.  There's still a lot to learn, but I think we used it very effectively last year to not  only warn people about the danger on that day, which was historic, but also for us to  gather information back.  It used to be I could not buy a report from some rural parts of this state, but now with  social media we can get them by crowdsourcing at almost any time.  So it's a two-way kind of thing.  And social media is absolutely crucial to what we do.  It's an interesting use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You use Google Plus for this as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  I was in there like all of you at the beginning.  I find it a very robust platform.  It almost was my exclusive platform this past weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's kind of why we're having you on, because I guess Facebook deleted your page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What happened?  I don't know.  This past weekend I was getting set to post some information on the Facebook like page.  Again, a lot of people live in that world.  I don't, but many people do.  And as you know, you've got to go where people are, which is what we try and do.  That page has about 99,000 likes.  We were getting set to have an active day the next day and I couldn't pull it up.  I noticed at the same time an email came in from Facebook that said your account has been  disabled with no explanation.  The regular account has been maxed out at the 5,000 limit like everybody else for a  long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now you can subscribe of course, and that means that you can have many more people following.  The account is back, we should say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It came up 12 hours later, but for those 12 hours I didn't know what to do.  So I finally found a form for those people that have had their accounts disabled.  I went through that form and filled it out and got an email back, which I guess was automated,  and they asked for my driver's license, which I thought was a little bizarre.  This is when it started getting creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They thought you were impersonating James Spann.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess they did.  I had to scan my state driver's license, the photo ID, and send that to this Facebook email  account.  I did not know a specific person I was dealing with.  There was no name.  I blacked out all of my personal information, the driver's license number, the address.  I just had my photo showing in my name.  I woke up the next morning just assuming it was a mistake and it was still down.  I started the Twitter stink bomb thing, which I didn't know what else to do because later  that day with active weather I needed that account back because a lot of people get weather  information during severe weather only by social media.  Many young people don't watch these newscasts we do.  This is Ron Burgundy stuff from the 70s.  It's just for older people.  We reach a lot of younger people with social media.  I had great concern.  I do okay on Twitter.  I don't have your numbers, Leo, but I think I've got about 62,000 there.  You're pretty vocal.  That started to roll.  It's like a snowball going downhill.  It just came back magically mid-morning Sunday.  It was out for about 12 hours.  There was no email to tell me it was back.  There was no communication explaining why they yanked it.  It's horrifying because we are using that platform as a very critical way of disseminating  severe weather information.  When you've got an F4, F5 tornado on the ground, this is serious business.  This is life-threatening.  It's scary stuff.  I'd love to know, number one, why they disabled it.  Did they think I was imposter?  Did they think I was posting something ugly?  There's nothing on that page but just weather information.  There's nothing controversial.  I don't know, politics.  It makes no sense at all.  I tried to send people over to Google Plus and hopefully I got a lot of people signed  up for that.  It's very scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It shows both the strength of social media but also its weakness, which is these are  private companies.  We don't really control.  It's not broadcasting, which is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission.  It's just a private company and they can do what they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of people say, well, just get a lawyer and sue these people.  You can't sue them because they can yank that account anytime they want.  It's their privilege.  Yeah, they have the right to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have emailed the heads of PR at Facebook in Washington and in California to ask them  and so we can get some facts here and actually discuss the facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's bizarre and I think it probably is a case of wanting to make sure that you were  who you say you were.  What is it?  So you're at SPANN on Twitter.  What is the Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's facebook.com slash James Spann.  I have two N's on my name and that's the like page.  My personal account is just Spann, but the page that we use for content is that one.  And again, if you look at it, it's on a day like today.  We have calm weather here today.  It's about weather.  I promoted it.  By the way, you've got the weather weenies of the world over here now.  The weather brains crowd have invaded the twig audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see you were watching the Venus Transit as we were.  We were fascinated by that.  That was great stuff.  Yeah, that NASA video.  We can't stop watching that.  The sun is so beautiful.  Well, James, I'm sorry that happened.  We'll try to find out.  Thank you, Jeff, for doing some actual reporting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was very last minute, but as soon as I hear something, I'll...  We'll give their point of view on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo and Jeff and Gina here.  These are three big shots that can try and find out some answers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I certainly don't want to slam Facebook because we don't know what happened, but I  think the takeaway is that we more and more are relying on social media and private companies  for this kind of dissemination of information.  There is no protection.  I mean, it's just up to them what they want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What makes you wonder if our relationship has to change?  Sorry, Gina.  Gina, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, sorry, Jeff.  What I was going to say, when these networks become these very important vital distribution  platforms, you wonder if the relationship between the user and the company has to change.  I mean, right now it's a free service that's advertising based.  But in a situation like this, do you want to be able to purchase the service, purchase  access to a live help person, for example, in this case?  I mean, who knows what this was?  It's possible that maybe the page was hacked.  Maybe there was unusual activity.  Maybe there were just algorithms that detected unusual activity and it was a security issue.  I mean, who knows what it was?  But, James, I'm wondering, does what happened make you rethink the way that you use Facebook  at all?  Do you feel like you could move off to a separate site?  Or, I mean, you're really kind of in a tough position, right?  Because you're trading control for distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And again, it's like Leo.  You know, Leo, you tried to get off Facebook once.  You can't.  You're right.  You can't.  You're pulling me back.  That's where people are living.  It's this wall garden AOL 2.0 thing.  And I have to reach them out there.  And of course, we try and bring them to our site.  The blog we do and all of that.  But a lot of people will not go there.  They just get the information by Facebook.  And so I would pay.  You know, I need some kind of consistency with this.  So I know that the products are distributed.  And the other thing that frustrates us, I guess, is the fact that I can't monetize this.  You know, now, if I start putting ad messages on here, yeah, that they will.  Oh, yeah, sure.  They will.  You know, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, newspapers are starting to use the Facebook reader.  You have The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and The Guardian.  And so there is a beginning of a model where your company could monetize.  The other thing is that when my credit card company suddenly says  there's suspicious activity and the one hand, it's inconvenient, it's a pain.  But I'd far rather them do that if they if in the end it's happened  and they protect me and protect my identity.  And that's part of what's going on here is is protecting identity.  And I don't know why. I just got this email back from  the head of PR in the Washington office of Facebook.  And this was obviously very last minute, but he contacted his ops team  and he said that I can say that Facebook has confirmed this was an error  and they apologize for any inconvenience.  There you go. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It really is about the larger issue, which we've talked about  so many times in this show about having your own website that you control.  And of course, we all agree, Gina and I have talked about this a lot,  that you have to do that.  But you make the excellent point, James, and you're talking to normal people  as opposed to our audience, which are geekier people.  You talk to normal people who that's how they are on the net.  They see Facebook as the as the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And I can't reach them with the traditional television method.  And having said that, you know, obviously during tornado outbreaks,  television is still a primary distribution method.  The numbers are huge.  But on the day of April 27th last year, on Ustream,  we had 70,000 concurrent live streams.  The the Facebook and the Twitter usage, I think, was critical.  I will tell you right now, there are people that are walking around  in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and that was one of the many towns hit so hard that day  because these these people got the tornado warning via Facebook or Twitter.  Now, we didn't have a Google Plus back then.  It is a critical platform for us.  And I'm hoping that our friends within these companies understand  the critical nature of that.  And would it I guess the only thing I was looking for was a warning.  But if it was a mistake, it's I feel better that Jeff found out.  That's the nice thing about being on this show.  You got important people that find out things. I had no clue.  I mean, I had no clue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff has the context. So thank you for pursuing that, Jeff.  And thank you, James, for joining us.  James is on Twitter, SPANN.  And of course, it's James SPANN on Facebook.  And it is up now.  100000 people make it 100000 and one because I just liked it, like it.  And it is if you're in the Birmingham or the Alabama area,  certainly something you'll want to use.  I you know, I just wish there were some sort of way to do this  that were that were guaranteed to be up.  But there isn't, you know, that's that's kind of the nature of the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, James. Hey, thanks, guys.  I got to go do some local television across the hall.  You'll have a great day.  Thanks, James. The old fashioned way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The old I do TV the old fashioned way.  It was cameras expensively.  Really? Yeah. Thank you, James.  Thank you, Jeff, for pursuing that.  And I mean, that's I think that's what we thought had happened,  that something went wrong and there was some issue about verification.  And they and they said, oh, well, we can, you know, send us your driver's license.  But this is a problem with Google, with all these companies now.  They're so big. When you have 800 million users, how do you  how do you do support? You can't.  Yeah. James, the podcast is at WeatherBrainz.com, by the way.  And I forgot to mention the official netcast for people who love weather.  There it is. WeatherBrainz.com.  And they've done more of those than we have done of Twig.  Three hundred and thirty two weather episodes.  It's actually there is always weather.  It's a really good podcast.  I really enjoy it.  All right. Let's move on to more news from the world of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From the cloud to the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Can I show you my new phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, please. Yeah, please do.  What if we said no, Leo?  What if we said we don't care?  We don't want to see it.  You know, we're going to go home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just another Android. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please show it to us.  Well, we didn't. You know, it's funny, when they did the announcement,  we debated whether we should cover the announcement live as we would do,  certainly with an iPhone announcement.  And that's the problem with Android.  Yes, this is going to be a big deal.  But is is there are there's a new Android handset every week.  And the HTC one, which is fantastic.  The Galaxy Note, which I have been using for a long time.  My favorite before the note was the Galaxy S2.  A lot of attention when Samsung announced that they were going to do a Galaxy S3.  I ordered and I did this. I've done this before.  If you want it is now, we know going to be available on all four major carriers  in the U.S. Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile  that it will be available June 21st on some of them.  Verizon won't have it till July.  But, you know, as always, you can order an unlocked European version  if you're willing to spend the unlocked price, which in this case was six hundred

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  fifty dollars. And it won't it won't go to full speed here, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It will on AT&T. It's not LTE, but it will go.  Let me let me go back here.  It will go. I don't want to show all my personal information.  By the way, I love it when you get a new Google phone.  It just downloaded all my apps and everything just here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's nice. You know, I mean, it's really smooth.  Like you swipe through those screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks wide core, baby.  It really makes a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This thing is huge, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So four point eight inches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, to compare them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do. John, would you get my note?  It's in the it's in the drawer of the office there.  It's smaller than the note.  This is four point eight inches.  So it's it's and it's by the way, it is really thin.  The Galaxy has to had a little bump at the bottom for a radio transmitter.  I'll compare it to the thickness of a pencil.  And you can see that it I love that gag.  I just keep using that guy.  Here's the guy.  Here I know everybody on Twitter.  I apologize. They've seen this for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the here's the back from the place where phones go to die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, back. Yeah, because you notice I reset it.  It's already saying Willkommen Bienvenue.  Welcome. So there's the Galaxy Note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So noticeably bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is. Oh, yeah, it's not note size.  But I mean, a lot of people didn't like the note because it wasn't one  handable. This is much more one hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a fablet. It's not a fablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But at four point eight inches.  And by the way, twelve eighty by seven twenty.  So this is actually close to the resolution of a 13 inch power book.  It's three hundred more than three hundred dots per inch.  So it is it is a retina display.  And it is while it is a super amulet, it is pentile.  But I have to say, I don't have any of the pentile color  noise issues that I saw.  And it wasn't too crazy about with the the Nexus.  This Galaxy Nexus, this is the whites are really white.  The text is incredibly crisp, very, very legible.  This is a very fast phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Chrome. That's Chrome.  Yeah. And is that the default browser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it does not come with Chrome.  It comes with a traditional default browser.  Comes with a lot of Samsung craps, although they're not.  You know, I have to say touch some good stuff from Samsung.  TouchWiz 4 is not bad.  This is TouchWiz.  Not it is on ICS 4.04, but TouchWiz 4 is not horrible.  And it does have some, you know, the Samsung apps does not have it.  I thought it was going to have a stylus doesn't have a stylus,  but it does come with SMMO, S voice, which is the Siri clone  and actually is quite good.  Is it play Bob Dylan?  And and it's really quick.  It's actually faster than Siri.  It does it does a pretty good job of understanding text messages  or opening applications, things Siri cannot do.  I'm actually kind of fond of of this.  Does she speak? Does it have a she that speaks to you?  It yes, I believe that she speaks.  I haven't I don't remember off the top of my head.  Samsung then comes with a planner and, you know, a few other things.  Video hub, music hub.  Actually, the music player is quite good.  Good enough that I made it my default music player.  One thing I really like about the Samsung music player, it supports DLNA.  So at home, I have two DLNA devices, my my AV receiver from Accio  and an Internet radio, the Grace Mondo.  They both show up here.  They're not showing up here because I'm not at home on this.  And if I'm listening to a song, I can send it right to my stereo.  And in seconds, it's playing on the stereo.  Same thing with video.  I can I can be watching video here and send it right to the right to this.  Right to the TV set.  So that DLNA is actually kind of like Airplay works quite nicely.  That's nice.  Quad core, one point four gigahertz Exynos processor.  That will not be the case.  I'm not sure, but I understand that will not be the case on all the US carriers.  I think there's a there may not be a quad core.  One of the things I really like in the teardown,  I fix it published a teardown.  It has the same exact camera app  or not app sensor as the iPhone 4S.  It has its own app, but I think quite a good app,  including the ability to shoot bursts, HDR,  a panorama built in panorama that was quite good.  Like I posted on my Google Plus account.  And that was fun. Yeah.  And if you zoom in, it looks good.  And I'll tell you what, I'll shoot a quick panorama here  just to give you an idea of how quick it is.  If you give me the full shot here, you just do this.  I'm in the camera.  Let me put it in panorama mode here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's the Samsung camera app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not the Samsung app, not the ICS app,  although I think the ICS app has similar capabilities.  I'll start here. It keeps you level.  You just slowly rotate it and it takes pictures  when it gets to where it needs to.  That you were with this app, you really see the speed of the  quad core processors.  Once I'm done, I think it takes eight or nine images.  And I'm actually going a little slower than I did when I took the.  I'm just rotating it around like that.  And when it's done.  I'll make sure I can tell you when it's about to do this.  Yeah, it's done. It's stitched.  It didn't take any time to do the stitch,  which is which is kind of amazing.  And here, let's turn it sideways.  Here it is. Oh, cool.  And it's it's really good. Sorry, Gina.  She was she was she was blinking.  But really, I mean, that did that instantly.  And as far as I could tell, there are no.  At least you're in the picture, Gina.  Yeah. No, Jeff's kind of sort of right.  There he is. I went I went.  I went Gina to Jeff.  So, yeah, that's this is the Samsung app.  I think the Samsung actually pretty good.  I think they do a pretty compelling job.  So I'm impressed.  You know, a flip board exclusive.  Oh, I didn't. Yes, I forgot to mention.  Here's the flip board and flip board is just like on iOS.  It's excellent.  Same as the iOS where you you flip up.  It immediately recognized I logged into my flip board account  and downloaded all my flip board sources.  It doesn't have audio or does it?  Let me check.  Has video, but no audio.  So they haven't updated that yet.  I think that's only on the iPad.  I don't remember if that's on the iPhone yet.  I don't think it is.  It's just this is.  Yeah, I love flip board.  I'm very happy to have flip board on here.  It looks really nice.  You get 50 gigabytes of Dropbox storage for free for two years, by the way.  Really? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As as when you buy the phone, you just come with with extra Dropbox. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't know why, but it does.  So all in all, I must say, I love it.  Two thumbs up to steal from Cisco and Ebert.  Good size.  It's a nice intermediate between the Galaxy S2 and the Note.  Watch how small it is.  I mean, just it's just I'll tell you the negative.  It's slippery, thin and light.  And this I'm going to drop this for sure.  And of course, because there's no cases yet.  Right. But I just I think they've done everything right.  It's got a one point nine megapixel, a one point nine megapixel front camera.  So it's better than the front camera on any of the iPhones.  I mean, this is this is Samsung saying, OK, let's see what you got, Apple.  And it'll be very interesting to see what Apple response with this fall.  I'm sure that they'll they'll be in a tug of war.  But a lot to be said for this very, as you can see, you can feel how fast it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a really that's a nice phone.  What's the deal with the colors is you can only get white now,  but in red later as they have white and blue and Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's Verizon is going to have red, the pebble blue.  They were having some trouble with the back not matching the front.  I think I'll take the seconds.  But I got white. I thought, what the heck?  This is all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So someone were buying a phone today. Would you recommend AT&T gets red?  Or would you recommend this or the note or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this is definitely the best Android phone by far.  Yes. Not even question.  Compete's, I think, very nicely with the Galaxy.  I mean, the iPhone 4S, we'll see what happens with the iPhone 5.  And by the way, Apple is I'll tell you how good it is.  Apple is calling for an early ban on it.  Apple says, you stole this.  Well, well, well, no, it's look how thin that is.  And it's very light for all the power in that thing.  It's really kind of remarkable. Nice screen.  I was watching video on it last night. Great HD screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so how are you feeling about ICS now that you're?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it because this has buttons.  So I've got a menu button at the bottom.  I've got the capacitance buttons that Samsung put on the note.  The menu is here.  The back button is here.  And the home button is here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I couldn't really see. I just saw the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They actually glow kind of.  You can't see it, but they glow very nicely, actually.  So as long as I always have a menu here, I don't ICS does not bother me.  And there and yeah, there are other things I love about ICS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there they are. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can see them kind of. Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very nice. The capacitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lots of nice. Yeah, I mean, this is, you know, an ICS.  This is touch was on top of ICS, so ICS doesn't impinge.  Every once in a while, seeing a menu button there.  But as long as I got my menu button at the bottom of the physical menu button,  I'm all right. I'm right. I'm loving it.  And there's some nice things.  Samsung put in some gestures so you could shake it.  Supposedly, and I don't know if this works when the screen is off.  Let's see if it works.  I'm supposed to be able to put my finger on this, turn it sideways,  and it launches the camera.  I haven't been able to figure out why that's not doing that.  There's some shake things.  If you are on a contact  and you put the phone in your ear, it will dial that contact.  You can, of course, turn these things off.  But this is kind of wild. Let me let me let me go to somebody.  I don't mind if I call them. I'll call me.  And I put it to my ear. It should call me.  Maybe it's not doing that.  So some interesting things. This is the Galaxy S3.  It is going to be on all four carriers.  AT&T will have the red,  pebble blue and marble white on the other carriers.  This is comparable to the one X.  I like it a little better than the one X.  It certainly feels a lot thinner and lighter.  So quick review of the Galaxy S3.  I ordered it unlocked early so that I could talk about it.  Very impressive. It lives up to all of the good things we've heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So although if you're buying a phone right now,  I might wait until the end of the month, right?  Because we've got Google and WDC happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There'll be some announcements.  I don't think Apple's going to have an iPhone until September.  So that's when iOS 6 will come out.  So right. Yeah, makes sense.  And you're right. Google I.O.  They may announce the S4. So yeah, I don't think they will.  Oh, and removable battery.  And I always order a couple extra batteries.  So that's one thing over the HTC, even though this is really thin.  You can pop the battery.  It is a 21 milliamp hour battery, which is almost as big.  This note is 2500.  This is pretty it's the biggest battery is much bigger than the Galaxy S2.  So I don't know yet. I haven't charged.  I'm running on a single charge and I'm about half done.  But I've been using it like crazy.  So I think I think battery life is going to be strong on this thing.  Anything else you'd like to know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you switching? This is this is now your your full time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I took the SIM out of the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because, oh, that was something else I found out.  It takes a micro SIM, not a full SIM.  And if you're going to cut down your regular SIM, you got to do it really carefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, you scissors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't recommend it.  I have a live or did you record that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did on Liz's desk. Liz, Liz saw me do it.  So I'm seven hours, nine minutes, 57 seconds on battery.  It's 37 percent down.  Twenty nine percent of that was screen, as usual on these big,  beautiful screens, they're the big ones.  But I wouldn't say unusually.  This is good. So I've got a third left.  So we're going to probably get eight or nine hours of heavy use.  Yeah. So now I have to get a new SIM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if if I'd done it right or I got a SIM cutter, it would have.  Yes, you could totally do that.  But you but I was just like,  I'm just going to cut this.  And I think I clipped it a little bit and, you know, I mean.  And it fits very nicely.  But I know this is because it's so slippery, it's going to slide right out.  It's going to hit the toilet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you have to go to the store and admit that that's the latest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huh? Hello, I need a new SIM.  Yeah. But you can AT&T, you can do that.  You say, I got a new phone. Can I give a SIM?  And they'll do that. No problem.  They don't care as long as they don't care.  As long as you're a customer.  If I want to go out and buy an unlocked phone, they don't mind.  I'm not asking for money back.  I'm just I'm saying I want to be a customer some more.  So, yeah, you can always get new SIMs.  You can say my SIM fell out.  I'll tell them, you know what?  They know me at the AT&T store.  The last time I was in there, they said, oh, you that you drop your phone in the water, right?  And I said, yeah, I need a new SIM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I appreciate the DIY spirit, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, I liked it.  I just, you know, careful when you're cutting.  Get a cutter. It's better.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Google had its event this morning.  Did you all watch it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Didn't watch it. No, but I saw the maps.  They look cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't watch either.  But what's wrong with you guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't watch it either.  So this is Google clearly trying to steal a lead on Apple,  which on Monday will have its announcement that it's not going to use Google Maps anymore, I think.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what that's what sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what Google's trying to do is saying, are you sure we're going to be really good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Blow our heads off here.  Check this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So three key features, 3D models in Google Earth.  So offline maps, that's big.  So you can download the maps ahead of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's really nice.  That's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then something called Street View Backpack.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's so that you can the apparatus can be taken into places where cars don't go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's this backpack with this like giant robot head with a bunch of cameras on top.  And this isn't obviously this isn't for users.  This is like Google is paying people to have indoor street views now.  Right. Well, like hiking through national parks and that kind of thing and getting street view for for those places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, Leo, you've got to get used to one of those.  I want one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, don't you want to try for the street view?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks a little top heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, Leo, I want that for the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I want to wear one.  Google looks enormous.  Google, come please.  Oh, look, there's Rafe Needleman trying to strap it in.  Wow. Rafe, you got to do Rafe.  Come come over here, Rafe.  He was on Twitter Sunday.  He said he was going to this event.  I got that scene.  It's Rafe Needleman looking very sharp in a Google backpack with a street view thing on.  It looks like a soccer ball with with cameras or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Google basically has an army of pilots flying contracted planes around big cities, getting 3D imagery.  And now they've got an army of foot soldiers walking around with these backpacks on through national parks and places to get street view images.  It's pretty crazy.  It really is.  It's really crazy when you think about it.  Wow. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I did get it.  There was an update to Maps, but it's not this is not the one.  I got an update this morning, but that's not the one that's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, it's coming in the next few weeks.  It'll be Android only at first.  They're working on getting it to iOS.  They said, yeah, good luck.  Yeah, good luck. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is going to happen there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Apple just cut them off.  No, no, you get in fact, that's probably what Google's thinking is, well,  Apple plans to cut us off in September because they'll update everybody to iOS six.  And suddenly Apple Maps will replace Google Maps.  So we've got a few months to show them what we can do so that people switch.  Right. What would be that?  What would be the they're not going to convince Apple to leave Google Maps.  And what they want to do is convince people to go to Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, let me let me cause trouble for a second.  If Google gets in trouble for promoting its own products, then why shouldn't Apple get in trouble for promoting its own product if it's now a platform?  You mean by putting as a restraint of trade against Google?  Well, so is Apple?  I'll tell you why it doesn't bother.  I know the answer. But but but you know, there's just some kind of if we all if everybody goes after Google promoting your own stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because Google is not a normal company, Jeff.  Google has a higher responsibility as a search engine.  Apple is a normal company.  They sell a hardware product.  They make their own software.  They're not an agnostic search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, wait a second. So what's the difference?  So whether it's a hardware product or whether it's, shall we say, an operating system with a browser in it?  You know, the difference between Apple and Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just trying to you know, I think that's a legitimate case where you could say, look, Apple has a huge.  Do they have a monopoly?  Because that was the only reason it made a difference for Microsoft.  Right. They had a monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft neither does Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, Microsoft.  They did have a monopoly.  That's why the browser thing was an issue because they had a monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Say for Apple. But but Apple has a huge market share.  It was Apple's market share difference between big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's less than 50 percent.  There's a difference between big market share and monopoly.  Huge difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And same for Google.  Same goes for Google.  Google has 65 or 63 percent.  It's not a monopoly.  Not a monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not a monopoly of search.  So I don't think they have a legal responsibility.  I know I'm not I'm not asserting that.  I'm not arguing in this favor.  I'm saying they have a moral responsibility not to promote their products on search, which is supposed to be agnostic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the same with, you know, so I'm captive to this phone.  I'm captive for two years.  And now suddenly they're just going to change on me and say, no, no, no, no, Jeff.  We're going to give you these maps instead.  And they're using that that that that stranglehold to do that.  All I'm trying to say is I'm not I'm not believing what I'm saying right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just to be clear, I'm I'm trying to get that makes it easier to argue against you.  You know, you don't really believe that, do you?  No, I know. I get what you're saying.  And but but but look, it really apples.  This should come as no surprise.  In fact, the surprise was that Apple was even allowing Google's maps on its phone.  Apple wants to control the entire user experience.  And the only reason they don't 100 percent control look at you, you know,  is because they they don't have the resources to now they have the maps.  They're going to push Google out, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So so what's the harm of Google promoting its own stuff, then using its own service?  Because results.  So so if you know what, if what if Google decides I don't care if Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  buys a billboard promoting its own services, I don't want them to taint  search results.  And the only risk to Google, there's no legal risk to Google.  It's merely that people will leave Google saying, I can't trust the results.  The problem is, Bing is even worse. Yeah.  And Google said, do no evil, which was a response to paid search results.  Google implied.  That they were right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I made that argument myself a few weeks ago.  Yeah, I know. But I'm just saying, I think we get that everybody gets  so paranoid about Google and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, everybody's paranoid about Apple, but it's just kind of no, it's a known thing.  It's like, of course, Apple's, you know, oh, you're surprised that Apple's predacious.  You're surprised Apple wants to win at all costs. Really?  And I think it's been a long time since people have.  And people did used to think of Apple this way.  But it's been a long time since people thought of Apple as the nice company,  the do no evil company, the company that cares more about you than profits.  Nobody's thought that about Apple in a long time, have they?  No, no, no.  We still like their stuff.  Yeah. But we know that they're out to get us. Yeah.  By the way, Google is not the only company bypassing Apple's privacy.  In an IADS, this is apparently, I don't know if I have that story here.  I'll tell you what, I'll save it because I do want to talk about this.  There's other I think it's in there. Is it in here?  Thank you.  I do want to talk a little bit about this because this was what Google got in a lot of trouble.  It turns out there's everybody's doing it, apparently.  But first.  I'm looking I don't see it first.  Let's talk about stamps.com. How about that?  And then we'll come back. Jeff and Gina are here.  We're talking about Google.  Jeff, I know you got about a half an hour left.  No, we're fine. We're fine. Half an hour, 45 minutes.  Don't make it soft because I'll take every minute you give me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm very neurotic about making planes. I'm extremely neurotic.  I'm up at two hours early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, don't do that.  Be like Bill Gates. You know what Bill Gates would do?  He would... He owns the frigging plane.  No, no, before he... He used to fly economy.  This is when he used to fly economy.  He would wait to the very last minute, knew exactly how long it would take to get from  Microsoft's Redmond headquarters to the SeaTac.  He would time it to the minute he would arrive.  His goal was to arrive as the door was closing.  And he would do it every time.  I know that's way too stressful.  And then he'd get in the plane and he'd cover his head with a jacket and go to sleep.  And that was it. That's the last...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's famous.  Now those will all be the signs for being a terrorist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. I'm sorry, Mr. Gates.  Take your shoes off now.  We're brought to you today by the finds.  Anyway, we'll get you out of here in a bit of reason.  When's your flight?  So you have a 530 flight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no. I have a car. A car picking me up here. 545.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. So it's five your time now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm at Don Mills Road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I know where you are.  No, Toronto.  Oh, you know, it's easy to get to Toronto Airport. It won't take you any time.  Especially on a... What night is this? Wednesday night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many flights have you ever missed, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've only missed one. I'm actually famous for doing exactly what you do.  OK, all right.  I am late for everything. I mean, everybody knows this.  It's Leo time, right? I'm always late. I was late for this show.  But I'm never... I'm always early for flights because there's a big difference.  I'm not late for Twig. Not a big deal.  If I'm late for a flight, your whole life gets... it's a mess.  Rush hour in Toronto. It's not bad.  I shouldn't say that. We'll get you out of there at 530.  In fact, I don't know if you're going to make it.  I used to do the same thing.  I think because at the end of every week, I would go up to Toronto, shoot 15 shows in four days.  The last show would be the last thing on Friday.  And I would make 730 flights. I would leave at 530 from downtown.  Wow. Yeah. And I would always... I would rush in.  All right. This show brought to you by Stamps.com.  You can't use it in Canada. Sorry. It's only for us Americans.  Stamps.com.  You know what's funny? I thought we would get complaints from our...  because a third of our audience is international saying,  why can't we use Stamps.com in our country?  Well, because it's United States postage.  I guess you could, but it wouldn't be much use to you.  Here's the idea. You can print... and other countries I think are doing this.  The technical term is indicia.  You can print legal postage, legal US postage from your computer and your printer.  You don't need a postage meter anymore.  You don't need special links. You just need Stamps.com.  And it means you will never go to the post office again.  You get the USB scale, so you always have exactly the right postage for any letter or package.  It prints right on the envelope if you want, which is so cool.  Or you could print stickies, just like a regular stamp.  In fact, it even fills out forms for international mailing.  If you're an Amazon or eBay seller, it gets the data from the site and populates the mailing label.  It's just fantastic.  But wait, we have a special offer.  Now see right there, special $80 value.  That is a good deal.  No, I got a better deal.  We're going to add 30 bucks to it right now.  Just click that microphone in the upper right hand corner.  And use the offer code TWIG.  And now that $80 offer is suddenly $110.  $55 in postage coupons.  The free digital scale you just pay shipping and handling.  $5 supply, get in four week trial offer of Stamps.com.  You can get discounts you can't get at the post office.  Post office wants you to use Stamps.com.  That's why they offer up to 21% off express mail.  Up to 15% off priority mail when you use Stamps.com.  In fact, if you use it a lot, you can even, it could basically be free.  It's more professional.  It's easier to use.  You'll never make another trip to the post office.  You just use Stamps.com and then the mail carrier comes and gets it.  You can even get a schedule free pickup.  The post office loves Stamps.com.  So will you.  I want you to try it right now.  Stamps.com, offer code TWIG.  It says $55 offer on our page right there on the front.  That's wrong too.  It's $110.  $110 bonus offer.  Use the offer code TWIG, Stamps.com.  So did you find the story?  Yes, it's under privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the last one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Ad networks, bypass.  Now, we should qualify this.  The one reason I'm bringing it up on TWIG is because you and I have both been very critical of the journal for their privacy stories saying they often are crying wolf.  In this case, Jessica Vascarello and Joel Sheckman writing that mobile ad networks are doing something similar to what Google did to target iPhone users by circumventing Apple's privacy protections.  Apple said after the Google brouhaha that it wouldn't allow app makers to use the unique ID in phones and pads to track users.  So ad networks that serve advertisements within mobile apps have started using new unique identifiers, cookies in effect, that collect information like location and preferences as the user moves across apps.  Now, this isn't with iAds.  This is with other ad networks.  iAds hasn't really gotten much traction, so there are a lot of other ad networks on the iPhone.  The networks, now this is the argument that we were having about tracking.  The networks claim it will cost them millions of dollars a week in lost revenue if they can't target you.  Personal data is needed.  Mazda, Nikon, and eHarmony, according to the Wall Street Journal, are all employing tracking systems in their ads.  Now, the brands aren't doing it directly, but maybe they don't even know about it because they're using ad agencies and these ad platforms.  But the ad platforms aren't doing it.  In fact, the journal talked to Mazda and the director of digital marketing said she wasn't aware that ad networks were doing this.  But she said, hey, if this becomes more widely adopted, we would like to use the anonymous identifiers to target customers for campaigns based on geography and lifestyle.  The advertisers would love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the issue is that mobile Safari by default only accepts cookies from the site that you visited, right?  So if I go to twit.tv, I only get twit.tv cookies.  Right. And so, right, Google and these ad networks are working around that because they want their pages, they want users to be able to accept cookies from, say, DoubleClick or some ad network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which would then allow them to track. So what DoubleClick would do is every time you went to a site with a DoubleClick ad, it would say, who are you? Where are you? What are you doing?  Right. And so aggregating that data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And by default, mobile Safari disallows that. So now these ad networks want access to the UDI ID of the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're not allowed to. Apple says no. So they're creating their own in effect.  Or they're using other IDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And let's be clear here. Basically, there is no first site ad serving.  Everyone uses third party or ads right.  Either because it is a lot more efficient and inexpensive to use a DoubleClick or such, or because the ad agencies and other clients insist upon it.  As I've said before, the GM was the first GM and Procter & Gamble, the first two gigantic advertisers to insist on serving their own ads so they could verify what they had.  So this idea that, oh my God, they're sending to third party.  Well, that's always been the case and will be the case when it comes to advertising.  And if that were to turn around, then you're putting a huge burden on to sites.  Ad serving is expensive and it's difficult. I know because we used to run on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is ad sales. You don't want to do any of that. You want a third party to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So it's not, you know, that's become it's like the word tracking is demonized. So it's third parties.  We have three people here. One of us is a third party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, to you, both of us are third parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. Well, you see. And I see you. You're watching me. I can see it. You're tracking me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But OK, so for the sake of argument, though, you can you see the three of us, right?  And but but for people do understand don't understand how the Web works.  And I agree that this is a standard way that Web works.  If you visit a site with TV, you know, as a user, you see Twitter TV in the in the URL bar.  You expect that this is an interaction that you're having with with only Twitter. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then again, when you load a page, when you load a page and you look at the load,  don't you see everything popping up there from sites all over, including, by the way,  you know, Facebook and Google Analytics and and whatever and whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or ad stands or whatever. Yeah. I mean, this is this is the thing.  I mean, I trust that Leo is going to do ads from companies that he's vetted and chosen to do business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't do targeted advertising.  All our advertising is targeted by de facto because they assume that there's a tech audience.  But we don't know anything about our audience. Right.  You know, what's funny is that and maybe this would make people feel better if it were widely known.  The ad tracking people say we don't want to know people's names. It's actually noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was in that story. It was in one of the stories we have on the run on this week.  It was fascinating because it said that that it's information we don't need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't matter. Doesn't help us. We don't care what your name is.  We just want to know where you are, how much you make, what things you like.  Are you about to buy a car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we want to know whether you've seen this same ad 10 times already.  So we don't waste our money on you and be disturb you.  You know, listen, I think that it would probably be a good thing for you.  Let's use this as an example in Twig.  If you had the capability to know whether I was an iPhone user or an Android user,  that would allow you to serve up, let's say, app ads,  app ads appropriate to the user.  And those ads would be less noisy to the user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's what I think users need to understand is this actually improves their experience.  So these are the two things that if you really want to defend,  first of all, you guys stop using the word tracking cookies.  But if you really want to defend this process, you would say,  A, we don't care what your name is. We don't care about your personal identity.  That's irrelevant. It's noise. We don't want it in the database.  And B, all we're trying to do is make, nobody's going to believe this,  but is make your experience better. We want to give you ads for products you're interested in.  Don't want to overdo it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Gina, you're right.  I'm down with that. I agree.  I think that, however, I do think that users should have the ability to turn that off if they want.  I don't think that should be the default.  I think I've come to the place where I think that Apple's being too restrictive, making that the default setting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get ready because Microsoft has announced that Do Not Track is going to be the default in IE 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's going to be on by default?  On by default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, most of our users don't use IE, but it's still by far the majority browser, I think, out there.  That's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not sure if it still is, but it's still obviously huge.  And it doesn't affect Microsoft's business, but it does affect media's business badly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google doesn't even have Do Not Track in Chrome because it understands how important this is.  Google's an ad network, basically.  Microsoft is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're an advertiser company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think Microsoft says, hey, we could stick it to Google and Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's what you see is you see companies that are not dependent upon advertising or are de-emphasizing advertising.  And that's I throw News Corp into that because it is a paid content company now.  And Microsoft sells other things, other products.  And by the way, consumers are going to love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is going to sell Windows 8.  It's going to sell IE 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The fact that Do Not Track is on?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why people were so upset at Google because Do Not Track was on in mobile Safari.  And Google said, well, we can't do likes.  We can't do pluses.  So we have to get around this.  That was the thing that upset people is that Google was bypassing Do Not Track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you're saying that Microsoft is going to sell IE 10.  I think this is a security feature, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Why else would they make a big announcement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think it's FUD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so too.  Gina, I want to come back and agree with you on one thing.  Absolutely true that...  Users should have a choice.  I agree.  Well, that we screwed it up in my industries.  In media, advertising and technology, we were not clear.  It enabled the demonization.  It's there because people don't know.  And that's stupid.  It's just downright stupid.  And it's probably damaged that these industries will never recover from.  But I go to media companies now and I see what goes on with advertising pictures.  And they need...  They have to be going more toward knowing signals about you if they're going to survive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it also distracts from other more important privacy concerns.  That's the problem.  If you get all head up about these issues, then you don't pay attention to say...  For instance, there is a very rapid mass movement towards electronic health care, electronic patient records.  And I just read a very good article that said one of the issues with a lot of the laws the states are passing right now is it's all or nothing.  You can say, I don't want to have my health record shared.  But what you can't say is I want relevant information shared but not irrelevant information.  The example he used was let's say you had a venereal disease.  Actually, he didn't use this, but I'll use this.  You had a venereal disease 10 years ago.  And you're going to a podiatrist because you want a bunion removed.  The podiatrist says, well, can I see your health records?  In many states, you will only have the option of yes or no.  You won't say, yeah, but you can't see the venereal disease that I had.  You cannot control it.  And this is a big issue, a big privacy issue that is completely ignored because we're all worried about tracking cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Leo, hold on, hold on.  I go to a big medical group.  Everybody has my full record there.  They don't give me the right to go in and say, I'll show this to that doctor and that doctor because it would be insanely difficult for them.  And as Doc Searles has pointed out, when he had a bad choice that he and his doctor made with a health problem he had a couple of years ago,  not having electronic access to your full file is probably far more dangerous than somebody knowing you have herpes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in fact, that's what the director of Health and Human Services just said.  You're 600% more likely to have mistreatment if you don't share this information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then there's an issue to society.  I spoke by a conference call lunch session with a bunch of people at the CDC about two weeks ago because of public parts.  And, you know, what they're doing is seeing the benefit of shared data at scale and how that can lead to speedy monitoring of spreading diseases, correlations, maybe causation.  And so they're asking, you know, how do we get around this?  Now, one problem they have is they have a department that's all about surveillance.  And I said, can you please get rid of that word?  You know, health surveillance is freaking people out.  You know, you think tracking is bad.  You guys talking about, you know, surveilling my health.  Ah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but you're so cool.  You're Mr. Open Privacy Advocate.  So you're saying that health records should just, if they're shared, they should be shared 100%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm saying a few things.  I'm saying that we have to have a conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's my point is that we're ignoring something that's very important for privacy issues.  I'm just using pick that out of the air as an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, it's right.  And part of that discussion has to be the balance of fear and benefit and that there are benefits to you individually to have all of your health data together.  There are benefits to you as a member of society and your neighbors to know that there is a outbreak of whatever disease or breast cancer or prostate cancer in your neighborhood and it's in the water.  Those are benefits that we need to discuss too.  You know, and I would argue that no one should be forced out of any health closet ever.  But there are reasons, there are good and sane and rational reasons to share.  And that's where I want to be part of the conversation.  But the discussion always starts with, oh my God, health.  You know, and my other point is why in this day and age should anyone be ashamed of being sick?  It's not like the Black Plague.  Well, that's true.  What if, good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The example the author used was rape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, but I also have seen cases of, you know, there's a very famous editor who did this, who, and again, forced no one out of their closet of confidentiality, but who said it's time to take the shame off that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I agree, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you know, and there's HIV, which means, you know, a lot of people assume that you're a drug user or that you're gay.  You know, I mean, there's, but yeah, I agree that this shouldn't be an issue and it's getting better, right?  I'm not so sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure.  No, I, you know, me, Mr. Optimist all the time.  No, I think we're shutting down more because of this kind of fear, because of this change that it brings.  And so that's that's why I wrote an old damn book.  But but but I don't know, Gina.  I mean, we were opening up in some ways, but we're, you know, and we had this great conversation a few months ago about about what you would tell your grandmother 40 years ago versus today.  Which I think was a very personal way to look at this, that the society has obviously changed around and with us and because of us.  But still, I'm a little worried these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did, however, delete my LinkedIn account today.  Well, I don't need it.  And B, I don't want my calendar information shared with LinkedIn, which apparently they've been doing similar to what path was doing with the address book information, except that I think the calendar information could even be more.  I mean, if you're a CEO and you've got private, I mean, there's all sorts of stuff in there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is if you had the LinkedIn app installed on your on your on your phone, it would upload your calendar data from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And LinkedIn said, well, we did that because we want to see if you're meeting with somebody else we know we could give you that kind of information.  But they didn't tell anybody they were doing this.  They didn't warn anybody that they were saving it, that was being saved on the servers.  And, you know, it's just like path.  It's another one of them.  OK, so then sixty five thousand sixty five six point four million LinkedIn passwords were leaked, including mine.  I went and checked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I was ahead of us.  That's Gina's tip.  But, OK, yeah, that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I won't say anything then.  Anyway, all I'm saying is I decided I don't think I'll be looking for work again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so this is interesting.  So when the past issue happened, Leo, you didn't think it was that big a deal, right?  Because you get an email occasionally saying, hey, your friend joined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't think it was because I understood that that's what they would have to do to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You understood that's what they were doing.  Right. But you didn't realize that LinkedIn was doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no indication that they're sharing your calendar.  I don't use the LinkedIn iOS app, but if I were, I think it's kind of inappropriate to upload your calendar.  They're taking the calendar for the iOS calendar and uploading it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  Listen, I think that's crazy.  But I didn't like what path is doing in the beginning either.  But this is the same conversation that we've been having.  Like, at what point can you justify sharing data in the interest of a better experience?  And I have a hard time with I have a hard time with like, you know, let's be nice to the media companies and help them keep their business model.  I look at it more as like a user experience issue.  Right. Like if you can argue that it's a better user experience, then great.  You know, then people can make business models around that.  And that's that's fine.  That's a good point. That's a good point.  But this is kind of a similar situation, right?  Like if you're going to have a better experience on path and then why shouldn't it share your address book?  Or if you're going to have a better experience on LinkedIn, setting up meetings or whatever people do on LinkedIn, you know, why shouldn't they grab your calendar?  Which I think it just seems absurd.  But, you know, where's the line?  You know, what's what's the line?  I guess is really the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, and after the passwords get hacked, I thought, you know, this is fine.  I don't need LinkedIn anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, you know, LinkedIn's been around for so long.  My password for LinkedIn is one of my old passwords that I had.  I set up like before I started using LastPass and like more secure tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you use if you've been using the same password on other sites, you probably do want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you got to go change them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Change them all.  So the Electronic Funtier Foundation has published a new Who's Got Your Back?  I love this.  They I guess they do this on a regular basis.  They they they do a table of the grade Internet companies on their privacy policies and their practices, particularly when the government comes a knockin.  And let me see if I can find because I think Twitter's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Twitter's three and a half gold stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Twitter's doing a lot of good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're like they're I think, you know, very consciously.  I've got it here.  The leader.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the four categories are when the government comes a callin, will the company tell users about the data demands, be transparent about government requests, fight for user privacy in the courts, fight for user privacy in Congress.  There aren't very many people that will tell you that the government's asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think in some cases, some things they're not allowed to know, like Patriot ads.  So I think they may say that they're going to tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google gets and say gets two half stars and two full stars.  LinkedIn, one one blank star on fight for user privacy in the courts.  Sonic Net, which is our our local Internet service provider here, four stars.  They do it all, baby.  I like.  Yeah, they're not.  That's Dane Jasper.  We've had him on before.  Great guy.  And he really cares about this stuff.  He's you know, he's got a political axe to grind.  Twitter's pretty good.  Three and a half stars.  Verizon zero stars.  Skype zero stars.  MySpace zero stars.  Four Square.  Oh, Den's zero stars.  Oh, that means Four Square neither tells you that the government asked is transparent about it, fights for you or goes to Congress or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They just know I'm going to bet I'm going to bet that's a case of small company.  Yeah.  Start up. Yeah, because I know Den's cares about that stuff.  He's great.  I'll ask him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ask him.  EFF.org slash pages slash who dash has dash your dash back dash dash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google did pretty well here.  They're kind of right in the middle.  Yeah, they did all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think a big company, very few companies can go to Congress, can fight for user privacy in Congress.  In fact, I'm surprised at the number of companies that do have stars in that cat that column.  The easy thing would be to tell users about data demands.  And as you say, Jeff, in some cases, they're not allowed.  Patriot Act, for instance, disallows you if a grocery store gets a Patriot Act request for who buys hummus.  They can't tell anybody.  It's a secret.  Let's see.  Google told by the EC to pay play ball or face a trial.  I just do these EC stories to see him just to get me going.  See him steam.  Google's been given an ultimatum by the European Commission.  Straighten up or we'll take you to court.  Screw it.  I'm not going to do this.  Yeah, OK.  Who cares?  Something we might see at Google I.O., a Google set top box that will play movie streams from Android phones and tablets.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that seems like an obvious next kind of airplay.  Yeah, yeah.  So you install an app on your Android device and you're watching a video or listening to music and you send it to your Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy, this Google TV, I guess, was being shown at Computex, which is a big Taiwanese computer show that's going on or just ended, I guess.  They showed a new Google TV box with Android 4, a Marvell dual core ARM A9 processor,  4 gigs of flash memory, 1 gig of RAM, ports for micro SD, Ethernet and HDMI video.  Wow.  This is from a company called Honeywild.  Honeywell.  Honeywell.  The Honeywell?  No, Honeywild.  H-O-N-E-Y-W-L-D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds like a porn company.  Honeywild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Honeywild.  Yeah, Honeywild.  Honeywold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Between 95 and 120 bucks.  That would be a cool product.  Yeah, that's cheap.  Cheap, cheap.  It's for the Taiwanese market, unfortunately.  You know, I could do that.  That's one of the things I like about DLNA, which is basically what AirPlay is.  AirPlay is Apple's branded DLNA.  That's the same standard.  Many TVs and other devices can see DLNA.  That's how I can play music from my Galaxy S3 or video.  A lot of phones now have DLNA, Android especially.  Well, iPhones don't.  Google bought QuickOffice.  What do you think about that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do they really need it or is that a Trojan horse into iOS devices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  QuickOffice, for those who don't know, is an iOS app that lets you open office apps from iOS.  They've been around for a long...  I remember having QuickOffice, I think, on BlackBerry.  They've been around for a long time.  Google says it has to do with Google Apps.  Today, consumers, businesses, and schools use Google Apps to get stuff done from anywhere with anyone and any device.  QuickOffice...  Well, I guess they want...  I mean, the Google Apps experience on iOS is not very good.  Right now, QuickOffice is for Microsoft, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.  And it does let those files run on Android and iOS devices.  So this could be good.  It also acquired Mebo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, what was... I haven't heard Mebo in like seven years.  I was like, wait, is that that chat thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Who uses Mebo?  Didn't it change, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't it pivot?  Social platform.  It began as browser-based instant messaging client.  Then they had the Mebo bar, which allows you to chat on TV Guide, TMZ, Entertainment Weekly.  Now the website will team up with the search engine giant for future unidentified adventures.  That's PC Magazine.  Stephanie Miat running in PC Magazine.  Future unidentified adventures.  Together, Mebo said, together with Google, we're super jazzed to roll up our sleeves and get cracking on even bigger and better ways to help users and website owners alike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Super jazzed.  I'm super jazzed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. They said the alleged asking price was $100 million.  I am in the wrong business.  What am I doing?  I should have started a web-based IM platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Multi-user chat rooms.  It'll be interesting to see how this will manifest itself in Google+, or if it ever does, if it was just about acquiring the team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think? What are the bets that we will get Google Glasses under our chairs at I.O.?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I keep seeing reports and videos.  There's a trampoline video.  Somebody wearing the glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think what will happen is that you might be the first people to actually be able to put them on in a booth somewhere.  Oh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're probably right.  That's worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's worth it.  That'll be good.  Yeah.  Twitter says we're going to have a billion dollars in ad revenue next year after next.  That surprised the heck out of me.  Not this year. Not next year. The year after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they even have what? 525 now surprised me, which I guess is a good thing.  What ads they have are unobtrusive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how they got half a billion in revenue from what they're doing.  I don't either.  It was 139.5 million last year.  This year they said 540 million.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is just from promoted tweets and promoted users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, how else are they advertising?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and maybe advertising in search results.  I go to Twitter a lot to search.  We had a power outage in my area.  First place I went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. It's what I do now.  It's what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you just expect that.  The local news, you know, is going to be reporting the tweets later.  Right. Go to the source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The original tweets.  And I use it like on Sunday.  The tweet video feed didn't get it was messed up.  And somebody told me that.  So I went to Twitter to see if it was true.  I'm not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter's.  I'm going to jump ahead.  So I'll probably be gone anyway.  We're going to wrap.  There were some Pew numbers out about a week ago right after our show.  And what's interesting is that the acceptance adoption of Twitter has not gone up that much.  But the engagement with it has, which they few is guessing comes from mobile.  So in November 2010, 8 percent of online adults use Twitter.  Two percent used it daily.  All right.  In May 2011, 13 percent used Twitter, 4 percent daily.  Now jumping ahead to now, 15 percent use it Twitter at all.  8 percent daily.  So it's still a pretty small adoption to be able to be something valuable for that kind of news of having enough people around you that when the power is out, there's going to be somebody else who's on Twitter who knows about it is saying something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of interesting because it sounds like you don't need a critical mass to make this value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the it's the one nine and 100 percent rule.  Right.  One percent of people in social situations are extremely active.  Ten percent somewhat active and 90 percent lurk.  And you only need one percent.  It's Clay Shirky's rule about about about Wikipedia, that less than two percent of the users Wikipedia make Wikipedia.  And if you doubled that, it'd be chaos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, I can tweet from my galaxy as three by voice, which I cannot do with Siri.  Oh, I could say that's neat.  I could say Twitter.  Oops, I just did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, the voice is not nearly as nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you have a choice.  They have a Samsung voice and this is a Google voice.  Twitter.  Is it time for me to talk?  Twitter update.  I'm tweeting from my galaxy as three phone period.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You must log into Twitter to update your status.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought I did.  I already did.  Anyway, that's by the way, that's the thing that Apple is suing over.  They say that that's too much like Siri.  It's actually much better than I'm sorry.  Didn't mean to offend you.  I think it's actually much better than Siri.  You could set alarms, weather, turn Wi-Fi on, tweet.  You could say how high is Mount Everest.  You can play music as you saw.  Set tasks.  You can do memos.  You can navigate.  Look up contacts.  I could say look up.  Let's try it.  Look up Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I found Gina Trapani in your address book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it.  Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She doesn't know how to say your name.  She says it like I do.  Trapani.  I found Gina Trapani in your address book.  Yeah, Apple invented this.  I don't know how come Samsung could possibly do this.  Apple, get off it.  Just make a better phone, please.  Sean, did you see Sean Parker and Sean Fanning's airtime launch yesterday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you get it?  I didn't see the launch, but it sounded like I shouldn't have missed it.  Nightmare.  Yeah, it was like horrible, wonderful, wonderfully horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they had Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jim Carrey, Snoop Dogg, Jimmy Fallon.  So, you know, I mean, this is Sean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How's that for showing off your Rolodex?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is Sean Parker going, I know the big guys.  And unfortunately, nothing worked.  So these guys were like, apparently Julia Louis-Dreyfus was not happy.  At one point, they had, what's her name, saying, no, really, it worked much better.  Olivia Munn.  Olivia Munn.  It really worked much better.  Whose video froze.  This is not how it's supposed to be.  Anyway, I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's Chatelot Roulette Without Penises, right?  But how do they assure that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is an interesting thing.  I mean, apparently they're taking screenshots.  They're doing all sorts of stuff.  I'm not too moved to use it.  What it does is it's a side-by-side video, and it uses your social graph to say,  hey, what, do you like to talk to Jeff Jarvis?  I don't want to talk to random people out of my social graph just for no reason.  I don't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, I don't want to do it randomly.  I do go on to Google Plus once in a rare while, and I just decide to go on a hangout and see who shows up.  But then they're knowing, we know who we're talking to.  Right.  To have them assigned.  It's the same as when I wrote a couple years ago about the notion of a social airline.  What's a social airline?  Well, the idea is that you can sit next to who you want to, and you can do other things.  And so KLM and another company here with Air Baltic just, they sent me a press release,  just set this up so that the airline, Air Baltic, will find you at a compatible person to sit next to.  That's interesting.  I want the opposite.  I want somebody who doesn't want to talk to me, and I don't want to talk to them.  What I really want is if I'm going to South by Southwest together,  then let's find out who else I know is on the flight, and then give us the option to sit next together.  That would be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For South by it would be, but most flights are so random there's not going to be anybody.  So random you don't want it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this idea of giving me somebody random, ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because then I'd have to talk to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to talk to anybody.  That's why airtime is an exciting thing.  I thought I would want to be a ham, so I passed all the tests, got all the equipment,  then I realized, no, I talk all day.  I want to go home and shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Ms. Hardaway just came in and said, you can choose who to talk to.  It's like a pretty Skype.  A pretty Skype.  I thought it served you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, it doesn't.  No, it's not random, but you have a list of people you might want to call, I guess.  Oh, I see.  I don't know.  Sarah used it.  And did you choose that person, Sarah, or did you just pop up?  She's not there.  I got the impression it just popped up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a mix.  So you can see your friends that you have friended, and you could give them a call,  or you can just say, using my social graph, find someone who's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you get to say, give me somebody random, or hey, let's talk to Jeff.  I mean, Skype does the let's talk to Jeff thing.  I guess you could go like this with Skype.  Meeny, meeny, miny, moe, boom, and call that person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I did something two days ago.  I saw these two people I know from Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism,  and they just did obviously a public hangout.  I could tell because it was labeled Medill Hangout.  But I said, what the hell?  They just did it publicly, so they were just starting up.  So I click in.  That's cool.  Jarvis, what are you doing here?  And I so much thought I'd say hello and all that.  And they said, well, it's a faculty meeting.  I said, I'm going to run away as fast from that as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, that was Chad Johnson, the old redhead, our new producer on the show,  who is just dynamite.  Dynamite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems like airtime is tackling kind of the same problem  we're trying to create the same experience that Google Plus Hangouts is.  Right. Exactly.  And I just figured out that I'm just too old for Hangouts.  I think Hangouts are really useful for young people who are a lot more outgoing than I am.  And I think probably airtime is a similar thing,  but it seems like just maybe a little bit of a different approach.  Certainly, we've had so many video chat products come out in the past couple of years,  like Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, Facebook,  FaceTime and Hangouts and now airtime.  I wasn't that like, I have to have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it just seems like it's this problem that different companies are trying to solve in a different way.  How can I chat with someone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it weren't Sean Parker and Sean Fanning, I don't think they would have gotten any attention at all.  Oh, well, that's clear. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, DeepPockets, big names, you're going to have a launch like that.  We're going to take a break. Come back with our...  Leo, can I do a favor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a plane to catch.  So we'll do Gina's tip in my tool, but Jeff's number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you. So different ones.  So there's this... I go in now, I heard I'm going to have to go into Kickstarter and find new stuff.  And I found this great little thing that happens to be called the Twig.  And the Twig is a really nice bendable USB charging cable for your iPhone, I presume iPad too.  And it's really nice.  And so I contributed to it and they're now double their goal of $50,000, 50 days to go.  And so I thought I'd just give them a... since the name is serendipitous, if we don't want to sue them.  No, I love it. That's not a problem.  It's a neat little device. So if you scroll down, you see all the uses for it.  What I like is not having a wire in my briefcase.  I can use a connector that's not a wire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now you understand that they better hurry because apparently Apple is eliminating the 30 pin port on the iPhone.  They're going to a micro USB port from what the rumor mill seems to indicate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is not a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So there's still time, 50 days to go. They've already got 100,000 of their 50,000 goal.  It's a shorter bendy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can bend it and use it as a... if you scroll down.  It's a Gumby.  Well, that's the inspiration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a Gumby for the iPhone.  Oh, look, and it can be a tripod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It can be a tripod. It can be a...  That's very cool.  Oh, that's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't this cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now they have to license the 30 pin port, you understand?  Yeah.  I guess that's probably where most of the money's going to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll bet. I'll bet.  So I thought it was cool.  That's neat.  I thought it was a coincidence. I thought I'd give them a little point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and it's a cord wrap too.  It's a cord wrap, yeah.  That is clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's a pocket protector.  This does everything.  It does.  It solves the world's problems. It's Twig.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's amazing how Kickstarter's become this market for iPhone accessories.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's great.  This is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The amazing ultra portable cable for your iPhone.  If you search for Kickstarter and Twig, you'll find it pretty quickly.  Good.  I like it.  Thank you, Jeff.  Safe travels.  We'll see you back in the US of A.  Safe flight, Jeff.  I'll see you in Washington next week.  From D.C.  He's a traveling fool.  You fool, is that?  All right.  Take care, Jeff.  We're going to have more.  We get Gina's tip and my tool of the week, but first a word from Squarespace.  This should be my tool.  I love Squarespace.  The secret behind exceptional websites, everything you need to make a wonderful website, including,  of course, the best hosting in the business.  There is none better than Squarespace and the best content management system.  So you get great software on top of a great hosting platform.  Always secure, always up to date because they take care of that.  You don't have to.  It's fully managed.  You focus on what you want to do, which really is the content, I presume.  This is not a good site if you want to hack around with Apache, mess around with .htaccess,  upload fixes and patches to your software.  This is for people who want to post content and whether it's photo galleries for the photographer,  importing from your existing blog, movable type, WordPress, type pad or blogger, using the iOS  or Android apps for editing and creating content and moderating comments.  It's just it's got everything you need.  You're going to love it.  Take a look at the example sites.  Take a tour.  They even have great free workshops for Squarespace customers at workshops.squarespace.com.  I don't think there is a better platform for creating your new website than Squarespace.  I want you to visit it right now and try it for you.  You don't even need to use the offer code.  Just click the try it for you button.  You got two weeks of Squarespace.  If you decide you want to buy, that's when you want to use the offer code twig6.  And do note somebody said your offer code is no good because they were listening to an old show.  It updates every month.  This is June, so it's the sixth month.  Right.  So twig, T W I G 6.  So I use the current month and twig in the number.  Now, what is the offer this time?  Well, I'll tell you.  Ten percent off your first purchase on new accounts.  So get the yearly plan because that's going to be the most savings.  And in fact, by the way, the new pricing is very affordable.  Websites are as low as eight dollars a month.  And if you want the unlimited plan, which really is an amazing deal, unlimited pages, bandwidth storage and with either it's 16 dollars a month.  And with either plan, when you buy the annual plan, you get a free custom domain so you can have your own domain.  They'll hook it up so it's automatic and use the offer code twig6.  You're going to take 10 percent off.  Now, that's a great deal.

Gina Trapani, your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, LinkedIn had a password leak this week.  So you should be auditing your passwords.  You should change your LinkedIn password.  You should make sure you're not using the same password everywhere.  You should use LastPass or keypass or some sort of secure password tool.  But if you're worried, if you haven't looked at LinkedIn in a while and maybe you're using an old password, if you want to know whether or not your password was one of in one of the leaks, the leaked file, you can go to leaked in dot org, which is actually kind of slow today because a lot of people are busy.  Exactly.  But leaked in dot org.  If you enter your password on the page, I normally would never tell you to enter your password in a random page, but you're not entering your username, just your password.  And that page actually hashes the password on its side.  So you're not submitting your plain text password to the service.  All it does is check to see whether or not your password was in the was leaked or not.  And mine wasn't.  So I got that great little message.  Looks like your password wasn't leaked.  Hooray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Either way, mine was, by the way, your what yours was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know a lot of people whose password was leaked.  I know a lot of people who said, you know, I signed up for LinkedIn forever ago.  The same thing with me.  And I used an old password.  And back then I used to use the same password for everything.  If your password was leaked and you're using a simple password and use that same password other places, go change your password everywhere and and start using different secure passwords everywhere.  But leaked in dot org useful service.  I think a programmer kind of threw that up real fast after after the password leak.  Yeah, that's really cool.  I'll tell you whether or not you info got out.  We talked about Steve Gibson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I asked Steve Gibson about it and he said, no, no, the JavaScript is all local.  So they are what they're doing is they're using the same hash technology, S.H.A. one on whatever you submit.  They're doing it locally.  So it never sends that password back to their servers.  And then you submit the resulting hash to their servers and they compare it with the database of leaked hashes.  And so unfortunately, I had a good random long random password that I generated.  And so even though they had it, it's very unlikely they would have been able to hack my account.  They're only able to reverse the hashes on kind of crappy, obvious passwords.  Weak passwords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you using now, Leo?  Do you use LastPass?  LastPass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so what I did just in case is I used LastPass to generate a new password and use that for LinkedIn.  And then I canceled my account.  That's the same.  And then I thought about it and I said, I don't need this anymore.  Bye bye.  So I guess I've already done my tool.  I guess there's really no reason to go into any more detail.  I have I really think this is a fantastic phone.  The speed battery life is good.  Camera is superb.  This is a nice implementation of ice cream sandwich.  Couldn't be happier.  I think that they've really done a nice job.  This is the Galaxy S3.  The good news is it's on every major carrier in the next month or so.  So if you want it, you can get it.  And I think this is as long as Apple doesn't manage to get an injunction and keep it from coming into the U.S., I think this is going to be a very, very popular foreign phone.  Pre-orders apparently were nine million for this phone.  Its predecessor sold 50 million units, which I think is, you know, we're talking iPhone territory here.  So this is a this is a really spectacular phone.  Very thin, very light.  I don't have the same problems I had with this with the Nexus screen, which was a pentile display as well.  But for some reason, the Galaxy Nexus, I just saw a lot of noise.  T-Mobile, AT&T, Sprint, Verizon all have it apparently one hundred ninety nine dollars, which is surprising because usually these premium phones go for one hundred bucks more.  June 21st for T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon is taking pre-orders now, but won't be until July.  AT&T has not announced a date, but has said yes, we'll carry it.  In fact, I think they have a red one on AT&T.  That's for the 16 gig model.  By the way, I do not.  I think 16 gigs fine.  It takes an SD card.  I see no reason to get the 32 gig model.  I think 16 is plenty, plenty.  So buy it before it gets banned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Someone in the chat room, I think was M.M.X. reminded, mentioned.  And this is a story we should probably mention real quick on X.M.S.  Did you get a chance to look at this, Leo?  No, what's that?  It's a new Microsoft product for Android phones only, oddly enough.  But it's kind of a scripting automation tool for Android phones.  So it's similar to like Tasker for Android.  But it's a web app and an Android app.  And you get to create recipes for action.  I love it.  Given a set of variables.  So it's kind of like if this then that, but for your phone.  So you say, you know, if you're leaving work, text your spouse and say, I'm on my way.  And it's brand new.  Microsoft just launched it.  I think this week it's in beta.  And all the recipes are it's on X.M.S.  Is the website.  And interestingly, just Android for now.  And I haven't had a chance actually to try this out myself.  But it looks like a nice UI on top of something like Tasker, which we've talked about before on the show.  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For some reason, it wants a certificate.  Wow.  This is using the JavaScript API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the recipes are our JavaScript code.  So you can fork them and you can edit them.  Bizarre.  Yeah, yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are you up to, Microsoft?  What are you up to?  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  I'm going to play with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe we can make some maybe we can make some little scripts.  I always like I always like this kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I do too.  If I'm you know, because it's location and they detect the speed at which you're moving.  I assume it's speed and location, whether or not you're driving, running or walking.  So you can say from running, play my music.  Play my music.  If I'm driving, you know, send my text messages to you know, increasingly, increasingly, these

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android phones really are kind of amazing.  I have to say they're really innovative.  The pace of innovation is fast.  And that's what's missing.  Is the framework to do this kind of thing on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So many folks into the system that allow for this kind of thing to happen.  It's wide open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
