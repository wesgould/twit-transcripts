Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google.  Ant Pruitt is here.  Well, he's actually not here.  I sent him home.  But he'll be on the show.  Glenn Fleischman is filling in for Jeff Jarvis.  Jeff has the week off, but we have a big announcement from Jeff.  We'll also talk about Victory in Britain for Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp and Apple  Messages.  We'll also talk about the end of the line for the Board Apes Yacht Club.  It's all coming up next on Twig.  It's time for Twig this week in Google, the show we cover the latest news from Google  and everywhere else in the world.  It's really, you know, I'll be fair.  It's the internet show, the show we cover the world out there.  Jeff Jarvis has the week off.  I will tell you why in a moment.  But joining us in Jeff's place, the wonderful Glenn Fleischman from Glenn.Fun.  Hi, Glenn.  Hello.  Hello.  How's everybody?  I'm wonderful.  And I appreciate your patience.  We're starting a little late because I threw in out of the studio.  And Prude's also here, our community manager at Discord.  And he said, I have a scratchy throat.  And I said, goodbye, goodbye, because I am going to be leaving on Sunday to go move my  mom into a assisted living facility.  I didn't want to bring any germs back with me.  But it has officially approved the we are good to go.

Transcript:  So that's actually probably accurate.  It is big tech.  And there is a lot of big tech news.  We'll start.  We'll go to England for the first story.  Britain.  Well, I don't know if this is an optimistic headline or not.  Wired magazine says Britain admits defeat in controversial fight to break encryption.  Remember, we've been talking about this for weeks.  The online safety bill, which, among other things, required plain text of all transmissions  from all apps, including WhatsApp, Signal, Apple's messages, Signal and WhatsApp.  Both said he passed this bill.  We're out of here.  Because it would essentially undermine end to end encryption.  Government has admitted.  The spy clause in the online safety bill has been eliminated.  The government has admitted that's because there is no technology that can do this without  compromising users privacy.  What's happened?

Transcript:  It's not eliminated, though, not eliminated, not enforced.  This is the key point is it's still in the law, but they're claiming they're not going  to enforce it because they gave up and they don't.  I mean, this is an ongoing thing, right?  Is people in government who are not well informed believe there's a magic golden key that technologists  are hiding from them that would let them have their cake and eat it too.  Either that they pretend that they think that exists and they said, you know, uncle, but  it's it's still in the law.  There's a lot of people on the privacy and security side saying great that they're not  enforcing this, but until it's actually the legislation would be revised and it was removed.  It's an ongoing threat that could be reinvoked at any point, and the UK could try to pull  something out of its back pocket and push it when it comes to encryption in our government

Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  Although it turns out that a lot of the people engaged in CSAM turn out to be as one might  not be surprised by turn out to be incredibly bad at security.  And you keep reading these stories every few months is a story that comes out.  There was one just several months ago, I remember, where nobody involved was taking  thank God. Thank goodness.  I mean, this is a positive.  Nobody involved was doing even the basics of any kind of information hygiene or security.  So international law enforcement tracked them down and arrested dozens of people.  It was easy to convict them.  I mean, that's what the idea is that being able to snoop on encrypted communications  that people think is private would somehow replace good police work when in the end it's  almost always good police work that actually produces a result in these kinds of cases.  And that's an interesting.

Transcript:  Thing to keep in mind when you hear about these stories, because we were talking about  this yesterday because Apple is in the news with this subject as well.  And Alex Lindsay asserted, and he might be right, that whenever you hear anybody, England,  Australia, anybody in the five eyes, asking for this, it isn't really about child sexual  abuse material.  It isn't even really about terrorism.  Those are the two paper tigers, the straw men that they raise.  It's the American NSA pushing them because law enforcement in America, especially the  National Security Administration, does not like it that they can't see everything.  You know, the NSA has this big facility where they've been collecting all the electronic  transmissions all along for the last decade and storing it.  And for two reasons, one, someday they hope maybe with quantum encryption technology,  they'd be able to break it.  And two, frankly, the metadata is extremely valuable as well.  And so they don't this is that whole thing of going dark.  And I remember talking to Phil Zimmerman of PGP fame about this.  And he said, it's not an issue of going dark.  He said law enforcement, thanks to digital technology, has a beautiful 4K view of all  the things that are going on.  There are a couple of dark pixels and it offends them.  They have a couple of dark pixels.  And that's really more that's a much better analogy.  It's not going dark.  They have more information than ever before.

Transcript:  Yeah, because most of what they're doing is connecting people.  They have to connect the dots and the encrypted information, the stuff that they can't get  at, it may be helpful to them to build a case or to find more participants.  But here's the thing.  I remember years, years ago, my friend Steve Mannes was laughing about digital rights  management on books because he said, in order to read a book, you have to be able to look  at the works, the word.  So no matter what kind of DRM they put in a book, in any device, if you can read it,  you can scan it. If you can scan it, you can see are in the analog hole.  We call that right.  The analog hole. And it's like if I can look at something.  So the whole to all encrypted communications is that people view it.  And now, while I would also prefer that governments release information about exploits  that could affect people on a massive scale, which is a whole other debate.  So instead of exploiting them, they actually patch them to improve all citizen security.  I also see that governments make use of exploits.  They put in key loggers.  They do all kinds of surveillance and other things that are that are legal or legal within  certain countries, things that we might agree have a valid purpose.  And when they do that, they can look at the unencrypted stuff when it comes in or they  can grab the keys off that person's machine.  They have so many tools at their disposal.  It's the notion that there are secrets that will essentially prevent the worst people  in the world from ever being found.  The whole terrorist with a bomb example, it has never been a case in which you could  actually extract that encryption of a kind that would be covered by one of these laws  and that could be retrieved would have prevented an incident.  That's not how it works. Human intelligence is the key.  People have to move around and do things.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, if we think back over these several decades and how we used to trust the  FBI, remember, I was going to say, I'm going to speak for myself here.  I'm not speaking for any of you, but I'll speak for myself.  There's times I think back over several decades of things that I have learned and sort  of just said, you know what?  They're trying to take care of little old Aunt Pruitt and his family, and they're doing  what's in the best interest of Aunt Pruitt and his family.  And then I look back and it's like, no, not really.  This was more about them and taking care of them.  And they could give a crap about me.  So why should I trust them?  Is there anything they can do for people like me and everybody else to to to get that  trust back?

Transcript:  Isn't it transparency?  Isn't it being more open about the kinds of things they're doing and admitting when  they're wrong?  Because, I mean, I have that same reaction as there's, you know, the 9-11 was a terrible,  terrible thing, but it was also a huge failure of the FBI and other federal and international  law enforcement groups to ignore signals.  But it also showed we've been so lucky in the United States and many countries have been  generally fairly lucky because we have had authorities like the FBI that have prevented  a broken up terrorist networks, tracked them down.  We've seen a lot of stuff since.  So, you know, it's there's this thing about like when you look at local police, the clearance  rate on crimes like the actual number of crimes solved is relatively small, kind of disheartening  when you look at it.  When you look at sort of the international picture, it's like, what is the FBI doing?  It's finding white supremacists who are making bombs, is finding plots against governors,  it's finding, you know, eco-terrorists who planned to release a poison or something to,  you know, cut down or burn a tree.  Here in Seattle, we had vital botanical resources almost fully destroyed because of eco-terrorism's  concern about fast growing trees.  So, you know, when they when they can track down and prevent things like that, you're  like, all right, that feels aligned with my interests, like that feels reducing terror,  reducing the impact on especially vulnerable people or things like that.

Transcript:  I think the eye-opener that you've experienced, I think everybody now is kind of having that  experience.  And and I think it's honestly I think it's always been that way because government is  made of people and people are kind of unreliable in this regard.  I mean, it's true.  I think as individuals, there are great law enforcement people who respect us and our  rights and want to protect us.  That's why they got into law enforcement.  But I think there are also bad apples.  We know that. But I think also as institutions, there becomes an institutional pressure in  the in the direction of let's complete our mission at the cost of everything else.  That and this is I've been really thinking about, as I've mentioned this a bunch of times,  I've been reading a book about Robert Moses, LBJ, the same biographers done a great series  on LBJ, which I read.  When I get time, I want to read.  It's really good because the fundamental question is, do the ends ever justify the means?  And this is my point is that these institutions are looking at the ends.  We want to keep people safe.  We want to end child pornography, child abuse, trafficking, terrorism.  These are all great ends.  Our constitution directly addresses this saying in pursuit of those ends, you may not do  some of the things that you might want to do, like unreasonable search and seizure or  cruel and unusual punishment, both of which would work very well to achieving those ends.  Nevertheless, despite the fact that the constitution prohibits it, there's such institutional  pressure from every institution, including Congress, to achieve these ends.  And the problem is that they're willing to compromise the means.  And this is where we really get in trouble.  And I think this has happened from time immemorial, that people get focused on the goal.  So I'm giving them credit.  I'm honoring them saying, yeah, I know you're trying to protect us.  And this is where I a little bit disagree with you, Glenn, because I don't think that  they're dumb about the fact that there's no encryption technology that will do both  things, protect our privacy and reveal the terrorists and the child pornographers.  I don't think they're dumb about that.  I think that they know that those things don't exist.  They're just willing to give up privacy to achieve these ends.  And I don't think they're doing it out of a I'm giving them a lot of credit, but I  don't think they're doing out of a bad spirit.  I think they really want to do a good thing.  But but they just kind of lose sight of the fact that there's such a huge compromise  there. We can't go down that road.

Transcript:  I definitely I agree with you.  I think it's both sides. I think there are you hear stories about, you know,  technologists going behind closed doors and talking to politicians.  They know we tell them over and over and over again.  Yeah, but they don't believe it.  They're like, come on, there's got to be a way.  There's a way to do everything. And they simply won't believe it.  Then and I think that some percentage really just think, I mean, look at the distrust  of experts. Oh, but I'm sorry, but I also agree with you.  I think there are definitely there's both aspects of this.  But think about the distrust of experts.  If you're somebody who's not trained in computer science, haven't been a programmer,  haven't worked in, you know, math, cryptography, and someone says, no, there's no way  to do this. And you're like, look, I know that you can tap phone calls.  Why can't you tap an IM chat?  You're just telling me it can't be done because you don't want to do it.  And I'm going to keep asking until I find someone who does.  You definitely know that's going on, too.  But the UK situation to me seems like weirdly the first time that the only success  there is it seemed like they were going to go through this no matter what.  They were going to impose this and it was going to be a problem.  And then what happened?  It seems like somebody blinked.  I mean, even if it's I don't know, it's still in law.  It could still be enforced later. Whatever.  They said, we're not going to enforce it.  And that is a big concession after all the effort put into it.

Transcript:  There's also an and I think this is appropriate for your situation as a black man.  It's reasonable for you to say they're really not working in our interest.  You know, it's easier for a white member of Congress, a white male  member of Congress to say, well, I don't worry.  I'm not worried about my privacy.  But if you're an underclass or if you're, you know, discriminated against,  you're the first people who are going to get hurt by this.  And so, you know, that's the other side of it is Congress.  And this is Parliament, too, in the UK.  They say, well, it's going to be fine.  Don't worry. Our privacy will be fine.  And there's probably will.  And and this was brought to my attention because I've always said,  oh, come on, privacy.  Don't there's no such thing.  Why worry about it?  People point out that's a privileged point of view.  Exactly. Exactly.  You don't have to worry about it.  So there's a great piece I recommend from Benedict Evans.  He published this last week when tech says no.  Benedict is a smart guy.  I think he used to work at Apple.  He or maybe Microsoft.  He's been in the tech industry for a long time.  He's an analyst now.  The tech industry always has a reason why any new laws or regulations are bad.  Indeed, so does any industry.  They always say that.  It's bad. You don't want this.  The trouble is, sometimes it's true and some laws are or would be disasters.  So which is it? So he talks about the when an engineer says no,  there's three reasons they say no.  And he's talking specifically about this UK Investigatory Powers Act.  He says first, and this is the default, they're saying no because they just don't like it.  Apple, Signal, WhatsApp.  Yeah, it's too much trouble.  We don't want to do it. No.  They have their own. Right there. Right.  No. They have their.  And I think a lot of times we're aware of that.  And so we might think, well, they're just saying and the Congress critters  might say that, too. They're just saying no, because that's their default.  They have their own opinion of how this should be done.  They don't want outsiders making them change it.  Apple, remember, said about being forced to use type C charging on their next iPhone.  We just don't want government to tell us what technologies to use.  That's a bad policy. Right.  So that's an example.  The second reason Ed Evans goes on, the tech industry or the doctors  or the farmers might be saying no, is because this really will have some very serious  negative consequences that you, Mr.  Parliamentarian, haven't understood.  And he uses as an example, this horrific law we passed in California, AB5,  which put freelancers at it, basically ended the whole the the intent was good.  They wanted to protect Uber and Lyft drivers so they get health insurance.  But it ended up basically making freelance work.  And you know this because you lost your job because of it.  You lost a lot of money.

Transcript:  Do you remember the California state legislator who was behind it, who is  incredibly strong, pro-union voice and in the union aspect of things was terrific.  And I'm not a Californian. I know only knows by hearsay.  She on Twitter was such a rabid, nasty person.  She was terrible. People would people brought up valid concerns.  I mean, she's the example. She didn't listen.  He says, you're just making this up.  You're trying to protect something and trying to block unions.  Whatever. The good news is the failure of AB5.  There was a similar law trying to be passed in New Jersey around the same time.  And the testimony there, partly looking at California, destroyed it.  I wrote my Washington state, one of my my senator for my district,  because a law was being considered to be talked about.  It went nowhere. So fortunately, AB5's implosion  saved the rest of us in other states. Thank you and sorry.  And sorry. Good God.

Transcript:  And this and this may be the process, right?  Is that we I mean, nothing. It's not a straight line.  The what is what is Martin Luther King say?  The arc of the world bends towards justice, but it doesn't get there right away.  Right away. It's an art.  So there's the so there's the first two.  One, we don't want to do it to.  It's a bad idea.  But three, and this is the one I think applies to the UK Investigatory Powers Act.  We can't do it.  We actually cannot do it.  And he says Benedict Evans writes the perennial example here, of course, is encryption.  For the last 25 years, engineers have said we can make it secure  or we can let law enforcement have access.  But that means the Chinese can get into and politicians say, no,  make it secure, but not for people we like.

Transcript:  Cover the story in the last few days.  Forgive me if you have, but the Apple releasing that extensive reply  about CSAM scanning a few days ago, which is almost unheard of them  to release a statement like that.  I mean, was there a reply to an organization that has valid concerns?  The heat initiative with Apple.  But yeah, but which and I, you know, I have I mean, there's  whenever you bring up CSAM, it's like, what can you be?  But sympathetic and appalled.  So, of course.  But Apple's response was exactly the right tone.  And just days before this UK thing.  And you think when the largest company in the world, I think as we speak,  says we cannot do this technological thing that we actually said  we were going to do and we dropped our plans because of it.  It really sucks a lot of air out of the room.

Transcript:  Steve Gibson talked about it yesterday on security.  Now, it wired had the story and they had both the letter from Sarah Gardner  at heat initiative and the response from Apple's director of  Eric Newsh, new and Schwander, director of user privacy  and child safety and the key sentence in that long letter from Apple.  We concluded it was not practically possible,  not practically possible to implement without ultimately imperiling  the security and privacy of our users.  And remember, Apple proposed this two years ago and dropped it.  Well, but get ready, because the heat initiative spends is spending two million  dollars and they they are putting up websites.  Here's their heat initiative website that is going to it's just as bad as the  Sarah McLaughlin Dogs Are Dying ad, right?  Oh, these poor children.  And it's right aimed at Apple's child sexual abuse is stored on iCloud.  Apple allows it. No.

Start time: 1333.56
End time: 1385.50
Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  And Apple pointed out validly in that letter, I believe  the heat initiative did some conflation is that CSAM scanning is typically  it doesn't identify new instances of abuse.  And we've already we've also seen Google is also the cautionary example, too,  by the way, is Google has had these well publicized incidents  in which it's CSAM or CSAM monitoring system,  its identification and reporting system has had some terrible abuses  where people have, you know, the the father or mother posting a picture  of their child accidentally going into their cloud Google Cloud Photos.  Yeah, he lost his Google account.  We reported on this. He lost because they were a doctor said, send me a picture.  Even the law enforcement cleared him. Right.  Google just was not responsive.  We've seen the abuses that can happen.  You need an appeals process even when it's in use.  But the fact is, the the database, I've forgotten the name of the database.

Start time: 1385.98
End time: 1397.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's the Nick Mick database, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  And it is it is hashes of known CSAM material.  But you're right, it's only what they've seen and only covers what's out there already.

Transcript:  And it's just as bad. But and also, I think this is disingenuous.  I don't know what the heat initiative's goal is here.  But Apple does, in fact, remove CSAM from iCloud.  In fact, they have some case studies of people getting arrested for CSAM on iCloud.  Well, how do you think that guy got arrested for CSAM on iCloud?  Apple reported him and Facebook reports him.  What Apple was proposing was not that.  Apple was proposing something that would scan images on your device  before they were uploaded.  And Apple's reasonable conclusion was it's a slippery slope.  Yeah, we could do this using the Nick Mick database for CSAM.  But then governments like Saudi Arabia can come to us and say, if you have any,  you know what else is CSAM pictures of men kissing or right.  Or China can come to Apple.  So, you know, what else is CSAM pictures of Winnie the Pooh?  And and Apple will now be in the position of saying, yeah, we have this technology.  We have to follow the local laws.  And now all of a sudden, a lot of gay men in Saudi Arabia  and dissidents in China are going to jail or worse.

And but but of course, I mean, I'm glad the dialogue's happening  because it's very hard to say we should do less to protect the victimization  of children because we're not saying that at all.  Saying that no, saying that it's a but it's always phrased that it's the  when did you stop beating your wife question?  It's like that is not how you frame it.  It's the it's the what can we do to protect children without violating,  you know, in the point zero zero zero zero zero one percent of the images  that relate to the victimization of children and abuse of children?  Here's the question.  How do we protect the other ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine percent  of images and people out there?

It's I never see in those stories.  And this may be either the way the coverage is or or how the organizations  want to fight it.  They never say, well, if we had more, we could find more people.  It's usually it's, you know, sometimes there's hundreds of  of police and other law enforcement officers sometimes around the world  working on these cases diligently with with what seems to be a fairly  high level support sometimes for years.  And maybe there's a thousands and thousands of cases that are being ignored.  But it's typically the same thing with with sexual assault of adults  is that the issue is often not resources, but it's finding people who care.  And that doesn't get changed if you break through encryption or not.  It doesn't get changed.  If you give more money, you have to be able to have people  who actually actively want to investigate it.

Transcript:  Well, because crooks are dumb.  I remember going to the Secret Service years ago.  Patrick Norton, I talked to some Secret Service agents in D.C.  And they said, you know,  sure, it'd be nice if we could force you to give us your password.  But usually we don't have to crooks will just give it.  We just ask them and they give it to us.  It's true.  So this was this was a great story.  The FBI, this happened a couple of years ago,  created a super secret encrypted phone system.  And then they they used one of their informants,  who is a well-known drug dealer, to recommend it.  And got all these drugs in.  It was called an A-Nom, A-N-O-M.  They get all these criminal groups to promote it.  Oh, you got it. You got to use A-Nom.  It's really good.  And of course, law enforcement, the FBI and world law enforcement,  including Italian organized crime and outlaw motorcycle gangs  and drug trafficking organizations, all were infiltrated all over the world.  Operation Trojan Shield.  Because the crooks go, oh, yeah, this is good stuff.  And the end of the FBI and your poll had complete access to it the whole time.  It's hysterical. That's great.

It's like, when did someone not get caught?  Because we don't know.  We don't know.  We don't know.  We want to tell us, trust us.  A great thing.  I want to hear from anybody is trust us.

And and and and it's it's it's now England doesn't have our Constitution,  but it's it's I think it's in their common law as well.  The principle that, you know, there should be some limits  on what law enforcement can do.  Yes, we want to eliminate crime,  but only to the point where we're safer, not to the point where we're less safe.  You just throw us all in jail and there'd be no crime.

Saudi Arabia had agents working at Twitter  telling the Saudi Arabian government what dissidents were posting on Twitter.  Apparently, there's some evidence Jack Dorsey and the Twitter  management knew about these three Saudi agents.  Eventually, they admitted that and they got rid of them.  They fired him. But who's the  after Elon Musk, who's the number two investor in Twitter,  owns billions of dollars at Twitter?  It's the Saudi Sovereign Wealth Fund, MBS.  There's a reason Saudi Arabia put more than a billion dollars into Twitter.  Right. And incidentally,  Saudi citizens just been convicted of and given the death sentence  because of tweets against MBS and the Saudi king.  Mohammed Al Ghamdi, he's 54.  He was accused of having two accounts, two accounts on Twitter with a total of  10 followers.  Nevertheless, it was enough to  the death sentence.  All right, now I take a break.

You know, here's what it looks like. Any problem?  We said, yeah, this is great.  But all the books have been sewn together.  Yeah. They're gluing the covers on their own signatures.  This is not some cheap production.  This is a lot of glue.  And but yeah, it's kind of, you know, usually you back a Kickstarter campaign.  You're like, you know, even the best ones, there's things that can come up.  It's like this is we're so close we can taste it.  And it's still knock. I'm finding wood to knock.  It's on schedule.

And I've got so much wonderful material and access to some.  I've already interviewed Lynn Johnston, who's the cartoonist,  the Canadian cartoonist behind For Better, For Worse, that ran for 40 years.  Lovely person. She got on the phone with me.  I've been talking to comics historian, but emailing with Gary Trudeau.  I mean, this is I'm trying to emailing with Gary Trudeau.  This look, I say this is the interesting part.  Nobody has ever told this particular weird aspect story.  So when I write a cartoonist and I say, can I talk to you about this  really strange thing and here's some photos, they're like, yeah,  I'd love to talk about how I colored cartoons or what ink I used or or  Lynn Johnston, her first husband was a of a rural dentist.  Like he flew. He like lived.  They moved to northern Canada and he would fly around  to do dental work up in the in the northern territories.  And so she's like, we got in the plane and we flew to Buffalo,  where most of the comics were sections were printed for a number of papers.  And she met with the folks who did the color, including this fellow died young,  who was instrumental. I've got his story to tell.  You know why they're glad to talk to you?

Start time: 2277.34
End time: 2361.94
Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  It's the American conservative.  I'm hoping to get in touch with him because, you know, he had  he put so much effort into the I mean, such a great artist, such a great writer  and so intricately involved in the craft.  I want to talk to him about the craft, like how he saw his work go to fruition.  The book is really about that realization of vision.  But as I take my weird materials like flongs and printing plates and whatever,  those tell a beautiful story.  That's like, you know, we think about that.  The cartoonists are working on a board. You get a newspaper.  There's so many people and processes involved.  And then it's all changed.  You know, the newer cartoonists, there's a woman, for instance, who does  Breaking Cat News, Fun Strip, and she just works in watercolor  and they do color separations.  But 20 years ago, people were still marking numbers in every color.  And somebody in a studio at the engravers was using Photoshop  to fill in the colors like paint by number,  because that's what had been done in the metal days.  And it was only really in between 1990 and like 2000 ish  that they transitioned out of that kind of paint by numbers thing  in the digital era to this normal like just you scan it and you color separate it.  Anyway, it's just I'm I keep finding wonderful material,  wonderful people, and I'm just so excited.  So the book's not going to go to Kickstarter until February.  But I kind of unleashed what I've got now to start getting people  to sign up to announcement list and then to just put the word out.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by.  Oh, I love it. Fast Mail.  Look, I've said this so many times over the last 15 years.  If email is important to you as an individual  or even more important to you as a business,  why are you using free email where you are not the customer?  You are the product.  You need fast mail.  I switched to fast mail more than 10 years ago, and I am not looking back.  I love it.  Make email work for you, not on you.  Fast Mail.  No, because you're paying them.  Admittedly, it's not free as little as three dollars a month.  It's not expensive either.  But because of that, you're the customer.  They have real support people who will really help you.  They have great service, great products and no ads, no tracking.  Just email the way you need it.  And one of the things I love about fast mail,  I make it very easy to use your own domain name at fast mail.  In fact, I use fast mail for the DNS for all almost all of my  domain names, more than a dozen.  That way I can receive email at those domain names.  I'll give you one of them is Laporte.  Email. Well, I can make it be anything at Laporte.  Email. So every time I sign up for something new, it's Verizon at Laporte.  Email or Twitter at Laporte.  Email. That way each of them has a unique address.  And actually, I don't use Laporte.  Email. So don't bad guys.  Don't try to hack me.  And that's another advantage.  If you're using Bitwarden, our sponsor or one password,  you can use fast mail to generate unique email addresses  every single site, every time you create a new password,  you create a new email address.  That is a really nice feature.  I just I can go on and on.  I probably will.  You can use fast mail with any email client, whatever client you're using.  Just install it and run fast mail.  It almost always will auto configure.  If not, fast mail's got all the information you need to make it work with Outlook  or Thunderbird, Apple Mail, whatever you use.  I use a lot of weird email clients.  They all work great with fast mail because fast mail is real IMAP.  In fact, they use the open source Cyrus server and contribute back to it.  They are leaders in email technology.  They've been doing this for a long time.  You can also use their web version.  I know a lot of you like if your Gmail users,  you like having your browser be your email client.  Fast mail has a much better, I think, web based version.  All sorts of nice features, colors, custom swipes, night mode.  iOS and Android, too.  In fact, that's the app I use on iOS for my email is fast mail.  It just it's great.  The quick settings means it's easy to choose a new theme,  the switch between light and dark mode, change my text size,  all without leaving the email screen.  Quick settings is fantastic.  The mass email addresses you can auto save context.  I do that. In fact, the spam filtering on fast mail is the best I've ever used.  And because you can use SIV, the SIV program to customize it,  it is the most powerful I've ever used.  For instance, if I respond to somebody's email,  they're automatically added to my contact list.  And I have a rule that if somebody's sending me an email  and they're in my contact list, they go to a special important folder  because I know I know this person.  It's a great way to not lose any email in the spam filters.  Keep track of everybody.  I use filtering like crazy.  You can pop images of your centers from external services.  They use Gravatar and others. That's fantastic.  Set default reminders for events.  Oh, did I mention I also use fast mail for calendars  as well as contacts, as well as email.  In fact, I replaced Google with all three.  It syncs with every device.  It's a fantastic CalDAV and CardDAV server.  For over 20 years, fast mail has been a leader in email and email privacy  because you're the customer, not the product.  You got to get fast mail.  I can go on and on. In fact, I often do.  It's very easy to move over.  Just reclaim your privacy, boost your productivity with fast mail.  You can try it now free for 30 days at fastmail.com slash twit.  Fast mail, F-A-S-T-M-A-I-L dot com slash twit.  I've been recommending them for more than a decade.  I'm glad I finally got them to sponsor our show.  Thank you, fast mail. I appreciate it.

And I like wasn't they weren't trying to shake me down.  And I looked and went to fast.  I was like, nope, it all checks out.  It's all good. I don't know.

Here's my here's one of the many domains I've registered there.  LeoLaporte.com says your domain is correctly set up  to send and receive email, but more importantly,  it's set up to support all the email security  features like D Kim and as what is it?  SPSPF.

They somehow got blacklisted by.  Oh, that's bad.  If you get in one of those black holes, that's terrible.  No good reason.  And there's nobody you can talk to.  It was an entire corporation of which the group I was running for  was a very small part.  And they were wrestling with it for I think it just finally broke the blockade.  But like the fact that I remember writing in the 90s,  I was writing articles about email is going to become Balkanized  and servers will not accept email from other servers.  And it'll wind up being all these fiefdoms of email.  And Gmail is among the worst of those.

Benito doesn't have it stacked.  I don't know how Craig's going to get his plugs, but we'll find a way.  Technically, he says, I'm retiring, though, if you know me, I know,  you know, I will never retire.  I'm looking at some things to do next, one of which, of course, is host our  AI show with Jason Howell.  Yeah, we're we're doing it right now in the club and we're going to.  It'll emerge at some point.  He has a great medium piece, though, about his 18 years  at CUNY, which is really remarkable.  I mean, that's that's a long time.  And a lot of students who got Jeff as a journalism professor.  And it's it's pretty impressive.  He did a lot of great work there.  And so I know a little bit about what Jeff's going to be doing.  But I guess I'm sworn to secrecy.  Stay tuned.  And I think he will be back next week.  And so will Kathy Gallus, our favorite  Supreme Court admitted lawyer who will, I'm sure, have some stuff to talk about  in the new October court docket is coming up.  In speaking of court in Australia.  They've decided in all not to force adult websites to to do age verification.  This is something many states in the US have started to do.  In fact, a judge just knocked down one of the states.  Was it Texas? Texas?  Yeah. Judge strikes down porn age verification law  in Texas, saying it's a violation of the First Amendment.  It's not even you know, I'm not even particularly worried about that.  It's just a ridiculous idea.  From a privacy point of view.  Yeah. What I have to give you my government idea so I can watch porn.  Oh, what could possibly go wrong?

I don't want to say the state if it's not the right state.  But I, Louisiana, for instance,  I think that's I think that's a good thing.  Just say, well, fine.

Transcript:  Anyway, just a terrible, terrible idea in the first place in a Texas  a federal judge in Texas, David Ezra has said  it violates First Amendment free speech rights and it's too vague.  It's constitutionally problematic because it deters adult access to leave.  By the way, this is important legally, legally explicit material  far beyond the interest of protecting minors.  It's another example where they pass these laws and the intent is maybe good.  But the actual impact of it is not so good.  The the the means do not justify the end or the end does not justify the means.  Oh, hey, are you worried about UFOs?  Who isn't?  Is this an ad? Yeah, this should be an ad.  The United States Department of Defense has launched a UFO site.  Well, they call it the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, AARO.  But if you go to AARO.mil, you'll see  oops, we're having trouble finding that site.  Yeah, maybe I have to type the dub dub dub.  It's an unidentified anomaly.  You probably do.

Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  Yeah, it says it says we'll accept  reports for current or former US government employees, service members,  contractors with direct knowledge of US government programs or activities  related to UAP dating back to 1945.  So they're saying if we weren't told before, you could tell us now.  Although it's an end that the government can receive classified  information from it from people.  So that means like if you had classified information,  we're told not to talk about it.  You're apparently allowed to report it.  If I'm I'm not a lawyer, just what I'm reading in the footnote.

But I mean, you know, I would I would love I believe there is extraterrestrial life.  I don't think we're the only life in the universe.  I don't think anyone's come to visit.  I don't think they're flying weird missions around.  I don't think that I don't think physics allows it.  So there has to be more more likely there's another explanation  that's just irritating, like the Chinese have developed some really great  thin material that is really bizarre, reflective for top.

Or we turned out it was true.  It would be amazing. We'd overturn practically everything that's understood.  Yeah. But I just think it's Occam's razor.  What's the likelihood of that happening?  It's very, very low.

Transcript:  Oh, man, we got so close and then we all man crashed.  No, I don't think so.  And maybe here's another way that we can help people get over this belief.  Caltech, you've heard of them.  Good school.  I think 42 Nobel laureates teach there.  It's a small school.  It's hard to get into.  I think only a few percentage points of 2400 students,  40 percent of them undergraduates, three percent admission rates.  Very hard to get into.  One of the reasons is Caltech requires calculus.  You also have to have a certain level of physics and chemistry  before you can get in as an admission to get into as a freshman.  And unfortunately, in this modern age,  there are many things high schools no longer teaching.  Among them, calculus, physics and chemistry.  And it's a bummer.  Caltech was absolutely firm.  If you don't have these, you can't get in more than one third  of the nation's high schools do not offer calculus.

End time: 3659.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think there's another reason to teach a higher level math,  because it also teaches you how to think.  So you may say, I'm never freaking thinking and I'm never going to use calculus.  But this the process of learning it was what a skill you learned.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  You know, yeah, I said that about algebra.  I mean, now, granted, geometry is, I guess, is a little bit more used  in the real world.  All of that stuff, it teaches you how to how to think.  And the more I talk to a lot of the teenagers that I've come across,  whether it's here or back in Carolina and a lot of kids, they just  don't think things through.  And it's right there in front of them.  And it makes me wonder, well, what's going on in the classroom?  And then I see stuff like this. Oh, yeah, that's why.

And I said, I know this is not for me.  I ended up I end up canceling most of my classes, to be honest.  I mean, perfectly.  Anyway, good news.  Caltech in the name of equity  is changing their requirements and groundbreaking step.  They announced Thursday they're going to drop the admission requirements  for calculus, physics and chemistry for students.  Now, you have to say, first of all, show that your high school didn't offer it.  And you have to take an equivalent, which will include Khan Academy.

And because there are, I mean, the fact, you know, it's one thing  that arts usually get cut first, right?  But now they're cutting to the bone.  So many schools never offered it or cutting these higher level courses  that people kids want to take.  And unless they're an area with, you know, my district in Seattle,  they've got the courses are being offered, thankfully, at all the school,  all the high schools, but also there's access to the rich community  college program here.  So of course, isn't offered.  The kids can do it either for credit or to get advanced,  to accelerate a course requirement, all of this.  And so I got to imagine there's the places they must be so tapped out  where there's just no resource for these kids at all.  This is fantastic.

It's going to be worth millions down the road.  Investors aren't the only ones, according to Bloomberg's suffering.  NFT marketplace recur, which is backed by billionaire Steve Cohen  and is known for its Hello Kitty NFT.  Who could forget that?  Said it's winding down due to, quote, unforeseen challenges  and shifts in the business landscape.  Mark Cuban backed NFT social media platform Nifty's.  Get it, NFT, Nifty's.  They had done Looney Tunes themed NFTs, also closing down,  saying citing investment opportunities that, quote, didn't pan out.  Oh, really? I'm sorry, I'm suffering a little schadenfreude here.  Survive. I told you, I told you.  Surviving platforms and projects aren't faring well, either leading NFT  marketplace blur has seen its sales volume measured in ether drops  96 percent between the late June peak and early August.  OpenSea decided to make royalties paid on secondary sales optional.  Now, that's a big deal.  Oh, yeah, one of the problems, one of the promises here was you buy it  and then or you make it rather and then you sell it.  And then when it gets sold on again and again, you get royalties each time.  Right. Now they're saying, well.

Transcript:  I love the idea of being able to sell like a digital original  that would have something as an artist, as you say, to support artists  and to give artists other digital transition, particularly as shipping  has become super expensive outside to outside the US.  It's meant that artists used to have an international market.  They lost that in the last few years.  I mean, shipping is so insane.  So I thought at one point I was like, well, maybe NFT is like answer.  Maybe NFTs will be another way to support artists, give them a future  revenue stream, let them own their work, even if the underlying technology  seemed to me ridiculous, maybe it was a way to order, you know, to own a digital,  you know, original or digital print.  And just the whole thing, just networks are being shut down.  You can't even access. Yeah.  I mean, if you bought things, OpenSea was pretty much the place

I thought, you know, every time I think crypto and NFTs or blockchain  or anything is is ebbing, I just look at my feed for that site.  I'm like, man, every day there's some millions or millions of people  who are going to get stolen, some kind of cracker hack.  So there's still apparently plenty of money out there to steal.

But, you know, I mean, not that Ethereum has gone anywhere,  but all the projects built on top of these other efforts,  they don't seem to have lasting power.  So what happens if you, I don't know, there's the you needed  technology built on top of it and it didn't prove to be worthwhile enough.  I think it's easier just to to sell to sell stuff that's serialized  and one organization is responsible for each serialization of it.

Transcript:  Speaking of crypto, it turns.  So, you know, this story has been a slow brewing for a long time.  Last pass, longtime sponsor here at Twit.  No longer, but the longtime sponsor.  Some many months after they stopped their sponsorship,  we learned that they had been hacked.  And, you know, it was slowly dribbled out that first.  Oh, yes, somebody's compromised our dev system.  Don't worry, your passwords are safe.  And then a few months later. Oh, hmm.  Turned out when they got into the dev system,  they got into the S3 backups of the vaults.  They downloaded all the vaults.  So now we've been waiting for the other shoe to drop  because those vaults were encrypted, some of them better than others.  We've learned and Steve's talked about this on security.  Now that some of those vaults were, you know,  protected by a single iteration of the key derivative function,  which is not super secure unless you had a really good password.  But as you know, most people don't have super.  Most people don't. Yeah.  So we've been waiting and I've always said,  well, we'll know if this is a problem if we start seeing hacks.  Yeah. They say now this is from Krebs on security.  Brian Krebs reporting. Yeah.  We're seeing hacks.  Taylor Monahan, lean product manager of MetaMask,  which is a cryptocurrency wallet for Ethereum.  He and other researchers have identified what they say is a reliable set  of clues connecting recent cryptocurrency thefts.  More than 150 people robbed of collectively more than 35 million worth of crypto.  What do they all have in common?  They use LastPass.  I'm sorry.  Taylor says, she Monahan said virtually all the victims she'd assisted  were longtime cryptocurrency investors,  which meant they were security minded and sophisticated.  Importantly, none appeared to have suffered the sort of attacks that typically preface  a high dollar crypto heist, such as the compromise of one's email and or mobile phone accounts.  This is Brian Krebs writing.  Monahan wrote the victim.  This is on her Twitter.  The victim profile remains the most striking thing.  There are truly all are reasonably secure.  They're also deeply integrated into this ecosystem.  Employees of reputable crypto orgs, VCs, people who build DeFi protocols,  deploy contracts, run full nodes and have ENS names.  I mean, these are sophisticated people.  The diversity of key type strange is remarkable.  The 12 and 24 word seeds generated via all types of hardware and software wallets,  Ethereum pre-sale wallet, Jsons, wallet.dats.  That's what I've got.  Private keys generated via MU and others.  However, it looks like nearly every victim had used LastPass to store their seed phrase,  which is the private key needed to unlock their cryptocurrency investments.  Now, in fact, I have a wallet and I forgot the password.  And the reason I don't know how to get into my wallet is I did not put it in LastPass.  Oh, no.

Transcript:  Or one for later.  I love buying buying Krebs.  I've known him for, gosh, over 20 years.  And I started reading this.  I was like, maybe this is a reach. Gosh, I don't know.  And then I'm like, that's unlikely.  And boy, the people he's quoting are great.  And I was like, but this doesn't.  And I got to the part which I'd forgotten, which was LastPass never upgraded their sort of security mixing over time.  So if you have a short password and not enough iterations, not enough iterations of that routine, then they didn't make you change it.  This is a problem.  This has been a problem in some password breaches.  Seems to have abated is that sites used to use simple shot one hashing, which is now considered an outdated algorithm.  But it's also you could have a short password, have it just shot one and a half hashed.  And it was easy for crackers to make up what are called rainbow tables.  You know, I'm sure you and and Steve talk about this.  But, you know, it's it was easy to have precomputed tables to crack common passwords.  But then sites got smarter. They started using longer hashes.  They started forcing security updates.  They notify people. They push out password requirement update notices.  They started using salting, which meant that every password even when hashed was different, like all these great things.  But LastPass for some reason never said, hey, you haven't changed this since whatever it is no longer secure.  You need to do something.  It would have been trivial because they don't know your password, but they do know your excuse me.  They do know when you last made a change.  They have some metadata about it and it's disclosed.  One password, as I recall, because I remember a report came out several years ago that looked into the iteration and the algorithms being used.  And one password wasn't perfect, but it was kind of in the top of the heap.  LastPass wasn't bad, but one password since then dramatically increased, as did LastPass security.  And so I think even if my LastPass storage vault from 15 years ago were uncovered, I don't think it's crackable today.  But a LastPass one from several years ago without being updated is ostensibly has the chance to be.

Start time: 4993.30
End time: 5063.66
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, Steve reported on this some months ago that looking at a lot of these vaults, people would look at there were tools you could use to analyze your vault.  Many of in the early days, LastPass used PBKDF2 with one iteration.  Say that five times.  Which is very weak.  That's the key derivative function which hashes.  So you have a password.  You can read it.  Monkey123 and then you run it through the PBKDF2.  It's now hashed.  The more times you run it through, the more difficult it is to brute force.  And because processors have gotten faster and faster, the recommended number of iterations from OS and others is been getting higher and higher.  In the early days, like five, six years ago, it was one iteration.  And many, it turns out, people who had maybe upgraded to more, I eventually with LastPass went to two million iterations, which was the max.  Sure, why not?  Well, why not?  Because it does slow it down.  But on a modern machine, it doesn't slow it down appreciably.  Yeah.

Start time: 5065.48
End time: 5080.35
Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I remember when one password, they increased one of their iterations and I was like, oh, man, it's taking a good two seconds to unlock.  And then I upgraded my machine.  It's like that.  But yeah, it's a serious outdated password security that's not being forced to update.  It's serious.

Start time: 5081.52
End time: 5186.68
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  For many older LastPass users, the initial default setting for iterations was anywhere from one to five hundred.  By 2013, ten years ago, five thousand became the default.  In 2018, one hundred thousand one hundred iterations.  It's currently six hundred thousand.  Again, you could go to two million.  There are other key derivative functions, though.  In fact, our sponsor, Bitwarden, supports something called Argon two, which is memory hard and not as not nearly so brute forcible, probably not brute forcible, in fact, although I never say never.  So we this was the supposition was all right, somebody we don't know who.  We were thinking maybe it's a nation state, but somebody has these fault.  Maybe many, many people have the vault.  Maybe they've sold it off.  Right.  What the next thing they do is start brute forcing it.  And they're going to get the low hanging fruit, which is going to be, you know, some elderly guy in Muncie whose password is monkey one, two, three.  And it was one iteration.  But there's nothing they're getting that right.  They got his New York Times account.  So they keep going.  And it's and it was I was expecting this would be a process that would happen slowly over time.  And in fact, that's what it looks like.  Perhaps they've been working on these crypto password vaults where there really is money for a long time.  But it's just taken them that long to brute force it.  Here we are almost a year later.  It does look like now and thirty five million dollars.  Somebody is it looks like.  Again, there's no conclusive proof, but somebody is getting into these last pass vaults and it and they're going where the money is.  They're going after people whose money you know, that's why we're only now hearing about it, I think.

Transcript:  So I probably wanted to do half a percent of folks that are still using last pass.  And I feel fine about still using last pass.  I think it's fine to use it now.  I thought about it and said, you know what?  There there are noses and faces in the mud right now and they're quite embarrassed.  I've got a hunch they're going to get their crap together.  Go about this the right way and really tighten things up.  Plus, I'm also going to be diligent about managing the passwords that are out there right now.  At the time of knowing this, the news when it broke, I need to go change my passwords regardless of what happened.

Start time: 5228.76
End time: 5263.70
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that's probably there are tools you can go and look at your passwords if you still have your last pass vault and see how many iterations were used.  There will be a variation depending on when you create this password.  Some people's older passwords are one PBKDF2 iteration.  So that's worth looking at. Those are the low hanging fruit.  Those I would change immediately.  I think if you had a password vault at last pass during the time of this breach,  it'd probably be prudent to assume that at some point your passwords might be cracked and you should probably change all of those, especially the ones for your bitcoin.

Transcript:  Krebs has a really good article.  He quotes Vladimir Palat, who is the developer behind Adblock Plus and is a security researcher.  It's funny, Palat explains all of this iteration stuff and he points out that the reason this has gotten easier to crack is these GPUs, which are really, really fast.  They could do four million guesses a second, even if you have a thousand iterations.  Amazing.  Reached by Krebs on security, Palat said he never received a response from LastPass about why the company apparently failed to migrate some number of customers to more secure account settings, higher iterations.  Palat wrote, I know exactly as much as everyone else.  LastPass published some additional information last March just finally answered the question about the timeline of their breach, meaning which users are affected.  It also made it obvious that business customers are very much at risk here.  The company's federated login services being highly compromised in this breach.  Palat said upon logging into his LastPass account a few days ago, he found his master password was still set at 5,000 iterations, which is pretty darn weak.  As I said, I set mine at 2 million.  LastPass was recommending 100,100.  I think it's worth examining your iterations.  You can.  I think the other shoe is out there if you search for it.  Read this article by Brian Krebs.  I think it's very complete.  And I think the other shoe is dropped.  We now are starting to hear it's not conclusive, but there seems to be strong evidence that somebody has started to crack keys that were stolen in the LastPass breach a year ago.

Start time: 5379.72
End time: 5457.70
Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  I should point out, I said something a moment ago that wasn't, I just double checked on one password.  They changed in January of this year.  They dramatically increased iterations from 100,000 to 650,000.  You do have to change your password, although you can keep it the same.  You just have to run an operation to upgrade to the new one.  But one password's trick, which they started years ago, is they don't have.  So, you know, Apple and some other companies and some many Android models now have a secure enclave or another kind of what's Microsoft's from the trusted identity module, something like that, so that there's local device encryption that's mixed with other information so that you have to have the local device plus a password.  So even cracking the password doesn't help.  One password did a version of this where they create a secret key on every device in which you install one password.  So it's all mixed.  So even if you crack the one password vault password, you still can't decrypt the one password vault.  So the password should be strong, but there's this other element that's a device based encryption element.  But if you want to increase, which now that I read this, I'm like, oh, I need to do this.  If you want to get your password up to the maximum protection, you just have to essentially change it even back to itself and they'll regenerate the key and and get you up to the latest iteration.

Start time: 5457.92

Transcript:  Read the so OWASP, which I have to look up because it stands for the Open Worldwide Application Security Project.  But it is a trusted resource.  Steve's referred to many times has a password storage cheat sheet, which I would recommend.  We'll put in a link in the show notes that you should read about hashes.  They say do use Argon 2 and they have a recommendation for settings.  Then if Argon 2 is not available, which it isn't on most password managers, it is on Bitwarden, use sCrypt for legate systems, use bCrypt.  And this is the only reason PBK DF2 survived is because FIPS 140 required it, which is bad.  But if you have to use it because of FIPS 140 compliance, use at least 600,000 iterations or more.  This is the current OWASP recommendation.  That number keeps going up as GPUs get faster and faster.  And also considering using, I've never heard of this, a pepper.  We've talked about salting hashes.  Consider using a pepper for full flavor to provide additional defense in depth.  And so there's a lot of information about hashing versus encryption, how attackers crack it.  The Brian Krebs article is good.  Never came across a pepper before.

Start time: 5547.78

Transcript:  It looks like Michelle Raman is great.  Michelle was a regular on all about Android.  Yeah.  And is really, he gets the scoops.  He had a couple of big scoops.  One, and he's reporting this.  I haven't seen confirmation yet, but he says he's hearing that the source code release of  Android 14 has been delayed until the release of the new Pixel phone, which will be October  4th.  And there's some, he has some concern because OEMs thought that Android 14 would come out  yesterday that maybe there's an issue.  OEMs are now being told that vulnerabilities detailed in the Android 14 security release  notes won't be published until October 4th.  So maybe that's why it's being held off.  So if you were waiting for Android 14, your wait continues for yet another month.  Google keeps, Michelle's got this story too, keeps leaking out information about the Pixel.  There's not going to be anything we don't know about the Pixel 8 by the time this is  done.  It's so stupid.

A full 360 degree view of the phone confirming the colors.  Ready for the colors?  Licorice, black.  Porcelain, gray.  Sky, blue.  There is a weird yellow dot on the back of it.  You see it right there.  Some people thought maybe that's the NFC target.  It says temperature sensor, but I don't know if it's pointing to that dot or not.  Hold it up to your forehead.  Yeah.

I think it's a neurological thing because people will get queasy.  They'll feel ill.  They can look at Swiss cheese or a grater or a bunch of camera lenses.  It's uncontrollable and it's not like, oh, my mother was...  Patterns make people feel that way too, right?  My mother was scared by Swiss cheese as a child.  It's just, no, it's...

Transcript:  Trypophobia, disgust or fear of a pattern of holes.  There's a wonderful British comedian, Bridget Christie, who appears regularly on the QI  sort of fun information show in the UK.  And every time she's on now, she mentions she had it and they torture her, maybe unintentionally,  but they're always like, they're showing something on screen when she's on it.  It's like lots of...  It's a pattern.  She's like, I can't...  You know, I can't look at that.  And it's giant because they have giant screens behind both of the...  So it's holes and patterns.

And so you have this little white dog walking around and he had these weird hives on his back and on his face.  And my son couldn't look at him.  Every time my son saw him, my son would just scratch and just uncontrollably...  Oh, wow.  It really affected him.  And my sister-in-law, she's the same way.

At the time, it didn't seem too expensive because after your first couple of cameras, it was all included.  Oh, get ready.  Stand back.  They're going to raise the price of Nest Aware big time.  It's currently $8 a month or $80 annually.  It was $6 and $60.  It is going...  $15 now.  It's going up.  It's going up.  It's going up.  The new Nest Aware cost will be...  Wait a minute.

So, I'm seeing a lot of people saying, is there anything we can do and get rid of these  cameras?  Right.  But I think everybody's...  Because what's happening with Nest is they're recording it, storing it, and you can go look  at it after the fact.  And it's been useful.  When our newspaper delivery lady ran over our mailbox, I had video.  I had video of it.  We were in Europe.  And I could look and say, oh yeah, I see who did that.  She was nice.  She said, I'll pay for it.  I said, no, no, no, not necessary.  We were getting...  But we got you on camera.  But I do have video in case you...

They've stole a neat sheet, like a blanket you sit on in a park, and Tivas...  There were tons of other stuff on our porch, and our camera didn't catch it because we  can't use infrared mode because we've got it inside.  Or it could have been an animal, it could have been a raccoon.  But it was the weirdest thing.  I've reviewed all the camera footage.  Nobody was caught.  I'm like, so I need to get an infrared out for a camera now, clearly, to find out who  stole my Tivas.

Transcript:  It was stuck in my brain somewhere.  I don't think I can use it on Jeopardy, but it's there.  It's stuck in there.  Google Chrome pushes browser history based ad targeting.  This is Topics.  But here's the deal.  It's not just...  We've talked about this on this show.  We've talked about it with Steve Gibson.  Google, as you know, is really trying to figure out some way that it can appease advertisers,  give them information about you without annoying you so much that you use an ad blocker and  then all bets are off.  So Topics is their latest thing, part of their privacy sandbox project.  The EFF and Mozilla and others are saying, we still don't like Topics.  Steve likes it saying, well, it's the best of all evils.  But get ready because it's not just in your browser.  Topics are now coming to apps on the Android Store.  So you can turn it off easily in Chrome.  Well, not that easily, but you can dig around and if you search the internet, you'll find  ways to do it.  But now it looks like they're going to also support Topics in the Google Play Store for  apps, which means...  So you're using an app.  It's got an ad.  The app can query other apps on your phone, query your phone about what apps you have  to figure out what your interests are to show you a related ad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, most people aren't even going to know.  You're only going to know if you listen to shows like this or Security Now.  Right.  So it's coming to Chrome.  It's in Chromium.  Brave, Vivaldi, and Opera, three browsers based in Chromium have all said, we're not  going to do Topics.  Don't worry.  I'm sure Firefox is not doing Topics.  That's my preferred browser.  But Microsoft has not yet said whether they're going to put Topics in Edge and I wouldn't  be surprised if they did.  So something to be aware of.  This is the least thing Google could do for you workspace customers.  They now can lock files so that nobody can change them.  It's literally the least thing they could do to say, hey, we have a new feature.  When the file is locked, no one with any level of access can make edits, comments, or suggestions.  It's read only until you unlock it.  Woohoo!  Sure.  And that's big news.  Big news.  The Google change.  Big news.  All right.  I think it's time to get your picks of the week in just a moment, if you don't mind.  So prepare those, if you will.  Jeff Jarvis will be back next week, as will Kathy Gallas filling in.  As you know, we've got a gaping hole in our hearts.  Stacey Higginbotham has left the show.  She's left her other podcast, too, to focus full time on her work, her advocacy work for  Consumer Reports, which is fantastic.  We're very proud of her.  But Aunt, there's good news.

This looks like he got married.  And in fact, I think the tweet was all the plastic.  They say rain on your wedding day is good luck.  They also say it has never rained in the Playa like this before.  OK, pretty sure it's my fault for being the luckiest man in the world.  Well, you know what?

And I said, well, who in particular?  And he was like, well, one was Daniel Suarez.  Really? We love Daniel Suarez.  We got to get you two in the room together and sit down and have a chat.

It's funny because President Biden was briefed on the crisis at Burning Man.  All the news.  There was so much schadenfreude, so much gleeful pleasure in the misfortune of others.  The poor burners stuck in the way and the burners are saying, what are you talking about?  Always rains at the flyer.  We were going to stay till Tuesday anyway.  They're coming home now.

I mean, I think the I think the reason it's like 70,000 people  in the middle of nowhere, let's say it had kept raining and they had the kind of rain  that have elsewhere. I think the concern was, do they have to bring in military  transport to get people out?  You know, that's probably was the that's a lot of people  without any real way to get them in and out.

He said I used to be a contractor for Apple working a secret project,  but the computer we were building never saw the light of day.  So in August 93, the project was canceled.  I was unemployed, frustrated.  I decided to un-cancel my small part of the project.  I had been paid to do a job and I wanted to finish it.  My electronic badge still opened Apple's doors.  This is 93. So I kept showing up.  Apple's engineers knew it. Some of them knew what I was up to.  They thought it was cool.  Whenever I gave demos, my colleague said, I wish I'd had that when I was in school.  He's doing the graphing calculator.  Those working on Apple's project to change the microprocessor  and its computer to the power PC were especially supportive.  They thought it'd be a great demo for the new machine.

But then who's paying you? No one.  How do you reverse milk? How do you live?  I live simply.  What are you doing here?  At that point, I'd give a demo, explain the project been canceled.
